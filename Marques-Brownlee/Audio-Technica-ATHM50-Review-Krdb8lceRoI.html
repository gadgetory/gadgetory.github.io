video review of the Audio Technica ETH M
50s my self-proclaimed best headphones
for under 200 bucks period so you know
these have to be good and if this video
gets 800 likes I will give away a pair
on Twitter so you can view that link
below so let's get started so right away
you can see the m50 s are a sleek
high-quality pair of headphones and they
feature a really solid build of mostly
metal and a little bit of plastic but
for the price point like I said if
you're looking for sub $200 headphones
in terms of build quality this is
absolutely the way to go so starting
from the bottom and working our way up
we have a three-and-a-half millimeter
gold-plated headphone jack with a really
really solid build don't see that
breaking anytime soon
connected to this jack is a 1.2 meter or
4 foot cable and that cable is also
coiled so that makes it more like 6 feet
so you can reach it around behind a desk
or something over at the other end of
the cable it's the star of the show
it's the m50 S themselves looking good
so starting off with the build quality
these headphones are top notch which is
an awesome segue because these have
little notches on the sides that allow
you to adjust the size of the headphones
so that's perfect if you have a gigantic
dome you can still rock these or if you
have a tiny skull these work for you too
also you can see these are adjustable in
all kinds of ways so you can literally
have a pterodactyl shaped head and these
will still create a seal wonderful oh
and unlike some other headphones in this
budget this pair is ridiculously durable
so major props to Audio Technica on this
one well done and another thing I like
to talk about in headphones is comfort
and this is one of the again top of the
line for this budget it's really really
soft and all the parts are flexible
enough to fit to your pterodactyl size
door or whatever sized head and yet they
do all this while still being able to
fold up and fit in this handy dandy
carrying pouch thing but what's a
headphone review without word on how
they sound well they'll be pretty stupid
so we're going to check that out right
now first we have to get some music on
ah there we go perfect let's listen to
some Gaga first
all right so I'm just going to tell you
right now these headphones are flat-out
amazing pun intended - that was that was
intended the frequency response is flat
and amazingly accurate I would happily
pay two hundred two hundred fifty
dollars for these headphones but as you
can see by the link in the description I
only paid one hundred and sixty even if
you have the most crazy musical tastes
any of the music item listening to right
now sounds amazing
the lows are very very deep they're not
overpowering at all the mids are very
well balanced and the highs are
extremely nice they sound just as fine
with the mids and lows as any other
highs I've ever heard so this is one
well-balanced pair of headphones and I
couldn't recommend anything else if you
have a two hundred dollar budget this is
the pair of headphones you need to buy
this is also going to earn the I think
the third ever mkbhd ten out of ten
product rating so believe me if you if
you have any problems with these
headphones come to me and by the way if
this video does get you hundred ratings
I do want to see a video review from the
person that wins them either way thanks
for watching this video
mkbhd signing out peace
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
