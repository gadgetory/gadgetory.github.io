three of this battery saving video
series so what we're going to do in this
part is we're going to discuss discuss
actually a number of battery saving tips
that I've discovered so first of all
what we're going to do is turn off
wireless I know you might think well
that sounds kind of stupid but the first
thing people people are usually using
when they find that they need to
maximize their battery life maybe
they're just listening to music maybe
they're just on an airplane maybe
they're just chilling in their room just
messing around with their computer I
don't know what they're doing so what
they got to do is disable um if they
don't have their power supply mix next
to them or near them disable or should I
say turn off wireless so wireless is
basically what's constantly searching
for and also Bluetooth by the way so
wireless if you have a switch on your
computer it's basically constantly
searching for emails constantly
searching for a signal if you have
Thunderbird it's obviously always
checking downloading emails constantly
your virus scans are running on the
emails that are being searched into your
computer so as these things are being
surged at your computer your computer
has to process them and that's using
your processor so turning wireless off
will save you a lot of battery life um
actually a lot more than you might think
even more than disabling Windows Aero
and using a bigger battery
really so disabling wireless is the
number one thing that I recommend and
I'll show you how to do that in the
software coming up don't worry I always
do that
so number two what we're going to do is
cut down the use of external devices
external devices being say a mouse or
maybe an external drive maybe have a
flash drive like this one um maybe you
have one of these for your mouse that
hooks up to your wireless mouse I did a
review on my mouse so things like that
if the more of these that you have
hooked up to your computer the more
glamour you're going to use um so that
that definitely drains your battery so
remove them or shut them down when
you're not using them so if you're just
on your lap and you're not actually
using your mouse yes you can go ahead
and unplug that mouse USB now one of my
later videos is inevitably going to
contradict this because I'm going to end
up recommending a laptop cooler for you
guys which is going to run on USB but um
that's another tip for helping widows
run faster as well as um helping your
computer last longer so it's not
necessarily going to make your battery
life better but I guarantee you that
removing wireless devices and removing
USB devices and external hard drives and
stuff when you're just moving when
you're just chilling and you have one
battery that's going to help you guys a
lot and I'm pretty sure I said three
things so I'm going to say the last
thing is to not use to just remove any
discs from your CD drive so you might
have noticed when you open up my
computer and you go click on my computer
your hard drive starts spin a little bit
or your your processing light on your
laptop comes on and that might seem a
little unusual but really it's searching
for everything that's new that I've been
added may have been added to your
computer since you asked clicked on the
my computer button so really what you
want to do is remove just hit that eject
button on the side of computer or just
you know whatever you go into your
windows and eject it right click on it
and eject that disk all the disks that
are in there trust me spinning the disk
constantly is going to use a lot of
batteries so the less hard drive you use
the less USB devices use and the less
Wireless activity you do is going to
they're all going to add up to increase
the battery life of your computer so I
hope this was tutorial I hope this
tutorial was helpful
do you guys and I think I'm just going
to do a quick a quick little software
edit after this to show you guys exactly
how to do a few other things I just
showed you so thanks for watching this
was number 3 and enjoy the software
peace alright the first thing I told you
guys on my camera was to remove all your
USB or actually the second thing but to
remove all your USB devices now what you
want to do if you are if you haven't
already known there will be a little
icon down here I mean just oh let me
just plug one in for you I'm going to
plug in a USB device in a second and
you're going to see a little pop-up
window saying you know you have a USB
device plugged in takes it out alright
guys once this is plugged in and you
will expand your system tray right here
and you'll see this little green icon
with a chick coming on it but pardon to
run that blinking so I like Bend this
again and you'll see this little icon
with a check I'm going to right click on
that and there's only one option
to safely remove hardware go ahead and
click that option all the window will
come up and hopefully it'll mob soon and
here we go it'll say I have you a
storage device all you have to do is hit
stop okay and boom it's it's safely
removable from your computer so I just
put out right there so the USB device is
gone that will save you guys some
battery so the second thing that I was
going to tell you guys was to to turn
off Ireland's easy on my computer
because there's a wireless switch but if
you have this right here and Windows
Vista there is a a little network icon
in your system tray double click on it
and connect your disconnect and another
window will obviously pop up just hit
that disconnect button right there and
last but not least remove any devices
from your hard from your disk so I'm
going to go into my computer and I'll
just lit open here and there are no
devices in my USB Drive if there was I
would right click on it and hit the
eject button of course it just pops out
an empty tray so that's all I got to
show you guys for today hope you enjoy
the tasty tutorial and subscribe for
more thanks for watching and subscribe
