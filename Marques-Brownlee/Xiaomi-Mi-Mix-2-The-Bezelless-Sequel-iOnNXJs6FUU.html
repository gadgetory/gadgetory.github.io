fact my second most viewed video of all
of the past year was the one that i made
about this guy the xiaomi me mix that
video got a lot of attention in fact a
lot of you guys were asking about it
since it's been about a year if there
would be some kind of a follow-up or a
sequel to that and there is and this is
it this is a xiaomi me mix 2 you see the
thing about the original me mix was as
beautiful and awesome as it showed up on
video i don't know if that really
directly translated to sales i mean at
the end of the day this is still a
pretty huge unwieldly phone for a lot of
people it's still running a rom that's
pretty unfamiliar to a lot of people
that aren't in those asian markets so
even though it did have an awesome super
thin bezel suite form factor that helped
move the needle for the entire
smartphone industry like we see in 2017
people weren't exactly rushing to import
this into the US and buy it and actually
make it their daily driver so that's
where a me mix 2 comes in so pretty much
every single change that xiaomi made
from the me mix 1/2 the me mix 2 is to
make this a more approachable more
viable sequel to the phone that made
such an impact for them last year so
right off the bat the me mix 2 is
smaller so it's rocking a 6 inch OLED
display but of course keeping the
signature tiny front and side bezels so
it's a huge display about the same size
as the new iphone we're about to see you
know 5 point 8 to 6 inches but of course
in a footprint that's way smaller and
easier to grip even with one hand and
the 6 inch display even though it sounds
big for a phone it's in that tall and
narrow two-to-one aspect ratio so it's
gonna be easier to reach the size in the
corners than your typical 6 inch screen
not all 6 inch displays are created
equal a lot of people forget that the
body is now ceramic on the back and
aluminum on the sides so it's still that
super shiny fingerprint ii slippery
finish but is also a bit heavier than
normal phones of this size so ceramic is
a really dense premium material like we
talked about with the essential phone
and it's packing that as well but really
all the placement of everything the
buttons the ports the speaker is all the
same because the body is smaller so that
just means everything is easier to reach
the only difference is just that
got rid of the headphone jack this year
so essentially now that they have
everything from that original phone in a
smaller more compact more reasonable
size what they did was basically a
once-over of the entire phone to take
anything that was a little bit extreme
to make that original design happen and
bring it down to earth so that
piezoelectric speaker at the top of the
old phone that had to vibrate the whole
front of the device to make sound that's
replaced by an actual real front facing
speaker and earpiece up at the top of
the phone much more practical
directional sound much more useful it
still has the ultrasonic proximity
sensor firing through the glass so
that's cool and the selfie camera is
still at the bottom in the small chin
but they coated the glass in a slightly
more polarized shaded way so it kind of
it's darker and it sort of blends into
the front of the phone more and it's
harder to see it's a nice touch that
adds to the seamless feel of the phone
and doesn't seem to have any impact on
the cameras performance and they did
upgrade the camera on the back so it's
now a 12 megapixel Sony AMX 386 sensor
with optical image stabilization an F
2.0 aperture and still inside that 24
karat gold ring in the middle of the
back of the phone so no dual cameras on
the back of this guy again but it's
definitely an upgrade in the camera
department even if it's not quite to the
level of what Samsung and Apple are
doing right now and the fingerprint
reader on the back is also now even
faster like it's super fast at which is
confidence-inspiring
and of course it's now in that ideal
location for one-handed use since the
phone smaller and it's still in the
middle of the back and on the inside
have some pretty op specs right now
snapdragon 835 six gigs of ram up to 256
gigs of storage and a 3400 milliamp hour
battery so with all that refresh in the
hardware which is pretty impressive it
basically comes down to whether or not
you can stand the new e software on top
of Android that ROM and they have added
a bunch of new things in these updates
to make it more accessible but more
importantly more familiar mue now has a
split-screen multitasking mode so this
is something almost every phone now has
except the iPhone where you can do two
apps open at once that's been added and
it's pretty simple to use and works well
so you can really take advantage of the
big screen honestly I'm kind of
surprised it wasn't on the original
there's still that quick ball that moves
the
autumn row of shortcuts anywhere you
want on the display in case the corners
of the six-inch panel are still kind of
hard to reach and it's over all cleaned
up it's pretty snappy it doesn't have
much bloat
not many bloatware apps honest honestly
already gotten one software update since
I've gotten the thing out the box and
hopefully it continues to get more it's
on top of android 7.1.1 right now so
pretty standard for new phones coming
out right now but I think the benchmark
is just how fast they move to Android
8.0 I'm kind of having tabs on all the
big phones to see how fast they do it
but wait there's more there's also a me
mix - special edition here it is
actually next to the standard me mix -
surely you can tell the difference
they're probably not the special edition
basically instead of rocking the matte
black aluminum sides has curved the
ceramic all the way over a round to the
front so it's a ceramic unibody phone
which is actually kind of amazing and
then it also has eight gigs of RAM so
that's what makes a special edition
super limited a little more expensive
hard to get also harder to grip that's
your call so a lot of changes that are
comfortable and make a lot of sense for
the me mix to that I think they're
hoping we'll get people to go from
drooling over the me mix to actually
buying one obviously 2017 has been this
year of of disappearing bezels on the
front of smartphones I made an entire
video about that but I think the changes
they're making are more to just put it
on a global scale
now this supports a massive amount of
bands 37 bands total 22 of those being
LTE bands so the goal here it has a dual
SIM card slot the goal is that you can
put your SIM card in this anywhere and
it'll work including here so to mix or
not to mix that is the question that
I'll pass on to you guys but either way
that's pretty much it the new iPhones
right around the corner new video on
that coming very soon be sure to
subscribe to see that if you haven't
already until then
catch you guys in the next one talk to
you later peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
