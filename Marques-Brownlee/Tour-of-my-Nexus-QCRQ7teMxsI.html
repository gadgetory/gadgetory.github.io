mkbhd channel back with another tour of
videos another video in the tour of
series so if you like the idea of this
series give this video a thumbs up and
if you have any more suggestions for
things you want to see a tour of like
you know a tour of I don't on my
computer or my desk you know things like
that I'm trying to get a tally of what
people want to see a tour of so go ahead
and leave a comment down there if you
have a suggestion but today we're giving
a tour of my phone which as you can see
here is the Samsung Galaxy Nexus I'm
using the stock lunch or have a stock
lockscreen as you can see cuz I like the
functionality where you can swipe up to
Texas on back when they call anyway if
you don't have an Android phone this
might be a little bit weird to you but
um it's definitely something I've got
the her quest to give a tour of so this
is my home screen as you can see here I
am NOT using the stock icons down at the
bottom I'm using a nice little colorful
Google colored set of icons and you can
find those at the link in the
description where I have it on my
Google+ profile so those are some the
phone icon you can see and the people
icon which I probably don't wanna show
and the messaging icon which I
definitely don't want to show and the
browser which I can definitely show I do
use a stock browser I kind of been
switching back and forth but I like the
stock browser it's fast and it syncs
with Chrome right here in the middle is
it says 94 I don't know if you can read
that but make sure you watch this in HD
so you can read everything this is my
battery indicator this little circle
here sort of indicates how much battery
is left so it actually winds down the
circle until I have 0% battery which
totally never happens so down here is
extended controls this is my extended
controls widget I got Wi-Fi Bluetooth
brightness and airplane mode here I have
a ton of apps and I obviously won't go
ahead and open every one well go ahead
and give you tour since this was
requested so much I'm not a big gamer
but the games I have our Angry Birds
fruit ninja and zombie - and I guess
words with friends could be considered a
game - basically I have the Amazon App
Store because I like the free apps of
the day a desktop visualizer and that is
how I was able to use these icons down
here I love the Search Widget the
persistent search widget at the top is
great
almost constantly use it to search my
phone to search the web and stuff like
that so let's swipe over to the right
here and this is kind of my productivity
slash everyday apps screen I use G tasks
to keep tasks or nice Foursquare Dropbox
Google Maps Google navigation that saved
me a couple times already
quicker which is what I use for Twitter
and pretty sweet to a client I've opened
this in a video before it's pretty nice
news Rob which is like news Google
Reader and YouTube and the YouTube app
is awesome on Android if in case you
didn't know if you have a Samsung Galaxy
Nexus you know this already watching
apps and full screen and the YouTube app
here is an awesome experience all the
way over here on the right I have my
weather and that's beautiful widgets and
if you tap it it opens up this glorious
high definition I'll look at the weather
forecast and does this on the tablet too
and down here we have our shopping apps
which are Google Shopper and we also
have Amazon price check and Amazon and a
barcode scanner and here I have some of
my settings that I'm most frequently use
so like my data usage widget and my
battery and apps Hope and data usage
just because the thing is kind of funny
since I've gotten this one I've used 6.6
gigs of 4G and I've used 3.9 2 gigs of
Wi-Fi so I have used a pretty decent
amount of data not enough to get
throttled though thank gosh so back to
the left we have Spotify which I love
the app can use some work but the
service is great
calendar gallery and camera all the way
here on the left I just have my starred
emails I like to start emails I want to
get back to later that's basically it
for my phone the setup as it is I don't
have a lot of widgets as you can see but
some notable apps I do use Evernote
Dropbox and Google Docs which I use for
within sync as you probably already know
so yeah that's basically it so those of
you guys who have been looking to see
what's on my phone now you know SkyDrive
by the way is what I use when I'm
golfing SoundCloud the speed test app I
almost always have 4G on but when I'm
home I have Wi-Fi on yeah and that'll do
it that's a tour of my phone so like I
said again if you like the add the
series idea just go ahead in and leave
this video a thumbs up and let me know
in the comments below what else you want
to see a tour of I love that animation
right there I'm gonna do it again just
for kicks thanks for watching and I will
talk to you guys in the next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
