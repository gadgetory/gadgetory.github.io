remember when I said I was moving this
is one of the last videos that you guys
will see in this apartment I mean I
didn't really literally say like I'm
moving out now but that's kind of what I
thought I was doing so long story short
was during that time I was looking for a
place I found a place I bought a place
or at least I thought I did and then
that fell through because of the way
banks handle a person that's
self-employed didn't really work out so
I was really let down by the fact that I
thought I was about to have a new space
to shoot videos in and then I suddenly
didn't so after that didn't work out I
just started the process over of looking
for a place again and while I was doing
that I also started shooting my videos
outside of my normal spot so in around
town or in spaces in the city started
renting out like studio space stuff like
that just because I was getting so bored
of shooting all my videos in my one
apartment between those four walls I've
read a bit about like your comfort zone
recently and trying to branch out and
stepping outside of your own comfort
zone I like and my hand goes off the
frame want to say that but if anything
is my comfort zone it's shooting videos
in my apartment I've shot videos in
there for like the past five years
you've seen like every possible angle of
that apartment as you possibly can so it
would be really nice like I finally get
another space to shoot in but as you can
see between all those videos searching
for things visiting them poring over the
details finally found something and it's
looking pretty dope so this is the
studio as you can see I'm really glad I
found it I just it was super empty right
now as you can see and here there's a
lot of unfilled space but right off
frame over there there's a bunch of
stuff that you can't even see bringing
in stuff for the first time to set it up
I've talked about this stuff and showed
a little bit of it on my Twitter and
especially snapchat most of the behind
the scenes of setting up the studio has
been going on snapchat because that's
just easy you can definitely hear that
there is a good
in here like a good solid one-and-a-half
to second echo from what I'm talking
that's going to be my number one
challenge with this spot is not making a
video ready because it definitely
already is but making it audio ready and
they can get totally normal sounding to
make videos here now there's already a
little bit of foam in the ceiling going
up the echo used to be like I would snap
and you wouldn't stop hearing it for a
solid six seconds so we're on that right
now is a little bit of an improvement
thanks for the phone but one I get like
you know couch and desks and more
carpeting and things in here a lot of
that stuff is going to dampen the sound
and one by one want to get furniture in
that's going to make a big difference
but as of right now my number one
challenge is making this place more
audio ready and not like an echo chamber
anyway I want to bore you with all the
brutal details of it but essentially I
figured I would show you guys a little
bit more as I start to move into this
place over the next couple of days and
weeks and months a little bit beyond
what I was just showing on Twitter and
snapchat now I can already answer some
of the most common questions I've seen
from the comments on Twitter and
Instagram people talking about it is
number one am i living here no I'm not
this is actually a dedicated video space
and it's actually for the first time in
my life is going to be separate in a
separate room from where I live and
sleep which believe it or not is a bit
of a challenge a number two thing are
probably seeing is why do you need all
this space to make videos and again it
comes down to the comfort zone thing I'm
trying to get out of my comfort zone
trying to branch out more and also
trying to make a little bit more and a
little bit different stuff which I've
talked a lot about it but again have
been in the same apartment not really
doing it so here we are I can actually
host things now I can bring people in if
people want to work alongside me for one
project or for a long term that can
happen wink wink
if you're a youtuber in the New York
City area you're invited come on over
have a party so collapse can happen here
videos can happen here it's sort of a
place to bring people and things in
that's not awkward in my apartment the
way it is now so I'm really excited for
the possibilities there and that's
pretty much it I mean my goal at the end
of the day is to make better videos and
hopefully it's a win-win hopefully this
space is a win for me because I'm
stepping out of my apartment and
comfort zone and making new better stuff
and to win for you you because it's a
better space it's going to look better
it's going to eventually sound better
and it's going to allow a little bit
more of a variety of the type of stuff
that comes out of this channel and
that's pretty much it also my daily
driver right now for those who are
wondering is a galaxy s7 edge
it's the titanium silver one although
that might change in the next couple
days just because of the amount of
phones that are coming out right now so
anyway that's the situation for those
who are asking and yeah that's pretty
much it I'm gonna get to moving and
bring more stuff in thanks for watching
I'll talk to you guys the next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
