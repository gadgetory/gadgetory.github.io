video brought to you by mkbhd and today
as you can see this is going to be an
unboxing video and this is an ice fogs
unboxing video this is what was actually
got two packages in the mail today
but I do dedicate a video one sort of
unboxing the unboxing and first
impressions for every product that I get
so this is the unboxing of the iFrogz
ear pollution d-33 earphones they are
noise isolating earphones
I will obviously have a huge full review
video of everything I get so I thank you
I for assigning about to me and so here
we go with the unboxing I don't want to
cut anything in here I just want to get
this open so here we go simply can just
take open and pop and I guys I can't
wait to get that microphone review to
because that is also a great microphone
that was sent to me so I really want to
get that reviewed video out anyone here
we go and here's a little little note
with the shipping information and
everything here are the headphones and
stuff and you know just bubble wrap
inside nothing special so we can put
that off to the side so here is the the
actual iFrogz earphone so now first
thing you'll see is that it's just it
does say they are noise-isolating
earbuds says that the bottom has little
travel case which is very cool because I
do like cases I come with travel cases
they don't really lose them so that's
basically all that's in the box you will
also have the headphones which do look
pretty nice I like the way they're
shaped the color they're black that's
cool and also you'll get a three
different size of your phone so the ones
that are on are medium sized that keep
going off camera sorry they're medium
size they are larger size and smaller
size so I'm actually going to try to get
in this box there it does look easy yeah
it is actually
so if we just pull up the bottom here is
the iFrogz carrying case a little piece
paper here it is a hard case and zipper
that's cool that's very cool the card on
the inside but it is is crammed full so
that's cool I like this carrying case
there's very good accessory I like
companies that
include the small things that just make
the product easier to use so that's cool
what else can we get and yeah we can get
to the headphones here we go so we have
the earbuds that come with the that come
with the earphone that aren't actually
I'm headphones so that you know you have
the larger one the smaller ones and the
ones that are still on now we have a
little piece of paper in here that looks
like a have the rest it Wow
there we go all right here we go pull
the rest of the package up pull the
earbuds themselves out of the package
and here we go so here's the earbuds it
just say noise isolating and clean deep
tone now I really sorry keep going on I
really like headphones with deep bass so
I like I like headphones that are like
in here then I give the nice clean rich
deep sound this so I'm just going to
take this out of here it just have all
the specs on the back so a nine
millimeter driver size the impedance
frequency of magnetite all that stuff
3.5 millimeter so we just take this part
off and we can obviously read all the
specs of it later but we can always
visit the link in the description to get
the full specs the price it's iFrogz
comm it's a great great site and I do
have a lot of also iPhone accessories
and stuff so here we go with the first
impressions they look nice there wow
this is not focusing at all but yeah
they actually have this kind of slant
little thing going on and I do look like
they're going to provide a deep some
good base so um yeah the color I like
the color if you can see that on the
side it says iFrogz this right here and
I do say that's the left ear 3.5
millimeter headphone jack which means
I'll be able to use it for my laptop
you'll be able to use it for your cell
phones that has a 3.5 so that's cool
yeah guys also came in the box with the
d-33 you'll be able to check it out more
