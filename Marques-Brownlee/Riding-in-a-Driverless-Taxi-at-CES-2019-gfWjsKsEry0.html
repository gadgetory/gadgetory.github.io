Las Vegas and I've seen a lot of
self-driving tech so far here at CES
like if you walk through any of the
halls with cars in them
there's tons of like open room concepts
and things like that
but they feel kind of useless you know
like as long as they're still in a
concept phase they don't really feel
really yet the idea is we're building
the interiors of these cars now for this
autonomous future where you don't have
to be sitting at the wheel so you can
turn around face your friends you kind
of feel like you're in a moving room
lots of glass it's very different and
I've seen a lot of that all over the
show floor really far out stuff crazy
shapes huge chunks of glass and stuff
built for autonomy actually BMW I think
had a sort of a happy medium they showed
me what they called the eye next which
is sort of a really futuristic vision of
a next-gen car but not too far in the
future so it has these wide open spaces
and touch sensitive fabrics and surfaces
for gestures but it still sort of seems
like a normal car but still without the
actual self-driving tech in action it's
just kind of half the story so then I
got an email from a company called
Yandex
you may know them as a Russian tech
company and they said hey come check out
our autonomous car at CES I'm kind of
thinking okay well I've I've seen a lot
of autonomous concepts and things like
that how could this be much different
but then they said listen we have a
fully autonomous driverless car hitting
the streets of Las Vegas with all the
other regular cars right now you can go
for a ride you in so I am super in let's
do it
so the car itself is a retrofitted Prius
on top is radar lidar and camera array
for the car to map out its surroundings
I think that's Owen who's used the auto
pilot from a Tesla it helps me to not be
as nervous in the backseat but it's
still crazy not having anyone in the
driver's seat at all as the car
navigates the streets there's a safety
engineer in the passenger seat which had
a kill switch next to him for if
anything happened to go wrong or it
needed to be interrupted but we did
about a 15-minute loop around real
streets real drivers real people and
everything went smoothly and it was kind
of still trippy the whole time this this
really feels like the future I got to
say it might not be this crazy soft
driving interior that everyone else is
talking about but this tech part is cool
to me the details are that this is a
small area in Las Vegas that was already
mapped by this company so it was a
predetermined route and the car knew
where it was gonna go but everything
else road conditions the other cars
the pedestrians the traffic lights that
turns speed changes all of that was
decisions made by the car but all that
makes sense for a taxi I mean you map
the town or city you want to be in you
have predetermined routes for pick-up
and drop-off and then the taxis are
driverless and they just go from there
and the even cooler nerdier part is
these iPad pros you're seeing that's a
visualization of what the sensors on top
of the car
are seeing in real time so the radar
lidar and cameras are all combining to
identify what is other cars on the road
what's pedestrians what is a stationary
object and seeing things up to 250
meters away in every direction
so things six seven cars away we're on
the iPad that I couldn't even see in
real life out the windows so there are
some red paths and when we start driving
you're gonna see some green paths and
basically what I'm seeing here is it's
evaluating what's currently happening on
the road and what's about to happen
red paths
green paths good and it takes the green
path and has a predetermined destination
we're on a left turning lane so you can
see way up ahead where it wants to go
and it's just gonna follow where I can
based on the cars around us you can't
really merge right now so those paths
are red it has a green path and it has a
bunch of other possible paths to take if
it wants to switch it up but right now
it's all green and the best part is the
reaction from other people on the road
was pretty great there's people pulling
out their phones to record the
driverless car people kind of stare a
little bit at stoplights when they
realize what's going on and apparently
Las Vegas cops think it's pretty funny
too but overall the 15 minutes we've
spent in this car were a lot of fun I
learned a lot just looking at these
iPads and what they were seeing as the
car drove around and this gave me a sort
of an optimism for the future of
self-driving tech so that's pretty much
it figured I would share my experience
would you let yourself get driven in a
driverless taxi like this maybe share
this video with other people you think
would be interested and I'll leave some
links below with some more information
so you can look it up if you want to see
that too either way thanks for watching
see you guys next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
