as much as YouTube analytics tells me
about the people that watch these videos
what devices they watch it on what
browser you're using what operating
system you're using one thing it doesn't
tell me is how many people click to
toggle to watch in 4k how many people
actually click that wrench and watch it
in 2160p I have no idea at the beginning
of 2014 after last year's CES we were
looking at 4k in its infancy basically
and as much as a lot of people would
have liked to have said that was the
year of wearables it was quietly the
best year yet for 4k so about a year ago
YouTube started supporting 4k uploads
officially and things have heated up a
lot since then so 4k has gotten
immensely better in two ways one
recording 4k and two watching 4k so for
watching 4k it's simple you just need a
4k display a 4k TV some panel with a 4k
resolution to watch the content on for
me I picked up these Asus PQ 3 2 1 Q
again about a year ago and when I first
got them these are serious they were
about $3500 a piece
the price has gone down under 3000 under
2500 in fact under $2,000 they're
hovering around 1500 bucks apiece now a
year later after I got them I'm not mad
or anything but it's less than half of
what I paid for them a year ago and
that's been the general trend with these
4k displays and these 4k TVs they're
dropping a lot in price as our
commoditized and start to be a lot more
popular and then there's this this is
the 5k iMac not 4k 5k
it's the highest resolution commercially
available display that also happens to
have the computer built in as IMAX do so
this 5k panel has a resolution of 50-120
by 2880 so it's actually four times the
2560 by 1440 that other 27-inch monitors
are it's a crazy amount of pixels and I
love it these things are super sharp
when you get right up close to it you
still can't see any pixels it's awesome
for video editing photo editing really
any visual graphics work
you gotta love it and the technologies
that make it possible one of my
predictions for CES this year in 2015
was that we would see a lot more 4k TVs
and of course we did basically we see
that everyone who makes a TV now makes
some 4k TVs so they're everywhere
they're lowering in price like every
month actually leave some of my favorite
4k panels in the description below some
of the TVs and monitors I've gotten
hands-on time with that I can actually
recommend including the ACE uses I use
now so clearly it's getting easier to
watch 4k but what can you watch in 4k
what can you actually watch on these 4k
TVs well in addition to all the 4k TVs
coming down in price we also see a whole
bunch of 4k cameras coming down in price
and existing more I talked about this in
my CES highlights video but we have a
bunch of 4k handycams now we have a
bunch of 4k action cams the new 4k GoPro
and even a ton of smart phones coming
out that can shoot in 4k so regular
people can shoot 4k video too so we have
all these cameras that can shoot in 4k
and we have all these TVs that can show
4k videos so now we just need them to
connect we need them to work with each
other and there are two main players
that are making this happen right now
Netflix and YouTube on Netflix you can
already watch a bunch of new shows in 4k
that are being shot in 4k and YouTube is
also supporting 4k really well in fact a
ton of youtubers including the ones that
I was hanging out with that CES are all
rocking 4k cameras and uploading 4k
videos all the time including yours
truly so this video you're watching
right now is also available in 4k if you
want to check it out fun fact I did this
video last year the 4k state of 4k using
a 1080p camera so I up scaled it to make
it look 4k I mentioned at the beginning
I don't know how many of you guys are
actually clicking to watch these videos
in 4k but even if there are a bunch of
you with a 4k display or a 5k iMac out
there I still don't know if your
internet or your computer can handle
watching 4k on YouTube since it requires
extra bandwidth for these bigger files
and extra processing power to push all
these pixels so and half of you guys are
watching on your phone anyway so it's
definitely not 4k there even though it
can be up to 1080p or sometimes 1440p
either
Waypoint stands for K now he's way more
prevalent than it was even a year ago
today I feel like I said 4k a lot in
this video either wait for K is
everywhere you're going to see a lot
more people buying 4k TVs Black Friday
is going to be probably this is going to
be the yield people buy a 4k TV on Black
Friday you're going to see a lot more 4k
laptops start to roll around that has
already begun and as much as it seems
ridiculous and as much as it might seem
completely unnecessary and a waste
you're gonna see 4k phones sooner or
later in probably a year or two we're
going to be having 4k displays in our
pockets as insane as that sounds but the
connection that we talked about earlier
is being made so thank you YouTube for
supporting 4k this early and when people
come back to watch these videos in maybe
one or two years on their new 4k TV or
their 5k iMac they're going to
appreciate all those extra pixels and
that crispy 4k video so if you're
looking to buy a TV for the long term
this year or if you're looking to buy a
camera that you plan on using for a long
time might as well make it 4k because 4k
is here to stay that rhymed
thanks for watching I'll talk to you
guys in the next one days</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
