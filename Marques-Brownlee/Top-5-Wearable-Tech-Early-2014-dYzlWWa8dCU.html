personal computing is being redefined as
the technology around us becomes a part
of who we are this is the wearable
revolution we put technology on our
bodies to make ourselves better to find
a way to kind of move through the world
and extend ourselves looking around for
a name we came up with wearable
computing it's wearable tech revolution
and one of the big talking points this
year is wearable technology wearable
electronics they're wearable technology
offering the fifth year at Consumer
Electronic Show wearables 2014 is set to
be the year of wearable tech electronics
that are physically attached to your
body but what good is that why does
anyone even want that well to put a
super long story super simple and short
in 2007 Apple reinvented the smart phone
with the new iPhone and made a lot of
money off of that now everyone has a
smart phone so now companies are
scrambling to find the next big thing
the next big paradigm shift that will
make the first good one a lot of money
and they all seem to think it's going to
be something wearable and I guess that
seems kind of cool you know having
glanceable information without taking
your phone out your pocket not that it's
all that much effort to do that but a
watch is already perfect for that you
can just glance and look at the time
without having to unlock your phone but
what if it was something more what if it
was something a little smarter than that
something that could actually show
information from your phone or your
phones notifications or what if it gets
to the point where in a couple months or
years you can take out your phone and
say okay Google now set a timer for 10
minutes and in 10 minutes the timer goes
off on your wrist so these first bits of
wearable tech we're seeing here in 2014
it's still January are very beta they're
the very first look at the attempt to be
an iPhone of this wearable realm and
we're seeing a lot of weird stuff but
hopefully this list will be very
different by the end of 2014
hence the title of this video so if had
any further ado here are the top 5 best
wearable options we have right now
number five is a Qualcomm Talk
SmartWatch
now this is a really interesting device
for a lot of reasons but number one is
definitely its display it's called a
Mirasol display it's a pretty new
technology that Qualcomm thrown into
this that gives it incredible outdoor
viewing ability it's it's got great
viewing angles great brightness it looks
like basically paper and you can do it
outside no matter how the reflections
are shining off of this thing so the
display is really interesting about it
but the thing is it's not really a
problem but Qualcomm isn't a hardware
manufacturer they don't they don't do
the entire device they do the insides
and the guts of devices so you can see
that with the talked the design is not
there this is not an easy-to-use
SmartWatch it's not intuitive the UI
isn't good there's all sorts of
confusing and redundant bits about it
and that would be the downside of owning
this thing hoodoos there's a big
learning curve and it's at the end of
the day not really that much faster than
just taking your phone out your pocket
number four is the Samsung Galaxy gear
another take on the Smart Watch and this
one I have to say is easily one of the
classiest and best-looking smartwatches
out there it has a battery life that
lasts about two days or so with regular
use and it's got a whole bunch of
different watch faces and it's it's -
overall just really appealing it's
probably the best-looking accessory
samsung makes to any of its stuff but
that's the thing the huge downside is
that this is an accessory to a Samsung
product it only works with less than a
dozen devices right now and if you don't
have one of those dozen the Samsung
Galaxy Note 3 or the galaxy s4 or one of
their new tablets or something like that
it's really just a watch not a
SmartWatch it's just the watch face you
can't do anything and even if you do
have one of those new Samsung devices a
lot of the notifications aren't really
full-featured it'll only tell you that
you have a new notification you should
probably check your phone now what's the
point of that if you're going to take
your front of your pocket anyway over
all the gear is a very confined device
it feels very throttled by the fact that
Samsung wants to have control over the
entire experience number three is a
Google glass Explorer edition one of the
only ones on this list that's not on
your wrist and honestly it's really
interesting technology it's essentially
a heads-up display to real life you
constantly have a display and a camera
across your face and every time you wear
it you have that sort of instant access
to actual notifications from your iOS or
Android
the fact that you're wearing it on your
face means I have to keep it lightweight
so it doesn't have a very large battery
but the real downside is that when
you're wearing it you look like this and
that makes a lot of people uncomfortable
when you have a camera on your face all
the time and you're looking around at
people and some people just don't like
it at all it makes them uncomfortable
and also it's 1,500 bucks which is
another downside but that will hopefully
be changing very soon when this year
2014 we see the full consumer edition of
Google glass because this Explorer
edition is a limited-edition product and
you can see my video about that right
below the like button but essentially
this is a beta test number two is Fitbit
and we're going back to the wrist here
but the Fitbit force is actually really
cool it's an awesome product it's
essentially a fitness band and it does
everything under the moon it tracks a
whole bunch of things about your daily
activity and about your nightly activity
works on any Android or iOS device with
Bluetooth 4.0 and above and there are
plenty of other fitness bands there is a
Nike FuelBand there's the LG live band
touch the jawbone up a whole bunch of
other things that do the similar things
that this Fitbit does but in different
combinations but the Fitbit really does
everything it does all of the things
during the day your dieting the amount
of steps you take a pedometer and
activity tracker calories burned and
even a sleep timer and the sleep
activity tracker so all these different
things put together in one package that
let you look back upon your day and see
exactly what you did and try to beat the
goals and beat your friends goals you
can sync up and accumulate points
there's a whole bunch of awesome stuff
that goes along with this wearable tech
doesn't necessarily deliver information
to you it doesn't necessarily talk to
your phone or give extra glanceable
value but when you take it off at the
end of the day and plug it into your
computer there's a whole bunch of
awesome stuff that goes on and number
one there's one company that's taking a
very focused approach to it all it's the
only company on this list that only does
wearable tech and that's pebble this
company pebble started with a very
successful Kickstarter project where
they did the first iteration of the
pebble smartwatch and now recently at
CES I showed off the second iteration
called pebble steel but more importantly
they also now have a very specific app
store for pebble because of all the
third-party sites that were doing this
anyway and pebble has the advantage of
being able to focus a hundred percent
dedication on this Smart Watch concept
because that is all they do and then the
pebble doesn't necessarily do everything
under the Sun it won't do every little
function that the Galaxy gear does with
the camera or the taking and receiving
voice calls but the things that it does
do it does very very well and that's
what pebble prized themself in the new
App Store that they're putting together
will allow even more functionality with
the device because of all the things
that people can build into the apps now
to talk to your smartphone so glanceable
information will probably be at its best
on a pebble so there you go those are
your top five wearable tech available
right now I do want to give some
honorable mentions to some stuff that I
saw at CES to smart bands the jaybird
rain and the razor Naboo these are
things that actually had some unique
functionality that other fitness bands
don't have right now so I want to see
those come out this year and there's
also way more really interesting
wearable stuff there's something called
opt invent Ora which is supposedly the
next best go go glass competitor it's
not a private product so it's public so
you can buy it and see what that's like
I might want to try that out and also
there is the Neptune pine which is a
standalone SmartWatch so you don't need
it to be connected to the phone it's
actually just a mini Android tablet and
it gives you all the information you
need and there's also stuff like oculus
rift which I also tried for the first
time at CES technically this isn't near
that's the sort of wearable stuff we're
talking about with Google glass or the
smartwatches but technically it's
wearable and technically speaking this
is an incredible experience like totally
objectively this is one of the most
immersive things you can have even if
you're not a huge gamer like me it's
pretty cool to play with and an
interesting omission from all this is
Apple which again is why the video title
is what it is because I think by the end
of this year we're going to see way more
wearable stuff from big companies like
Apple like Intel maybe even Google will
make a SmartWatch with the same
interface as Google glass I think that
would work out really well so keep an
eye on all the stuff we make videos
about here on the mkbhd channel as well
as if you want to follow me on Twitter
I'll be sharing a whole bunch with more
awesome stuff that comes out it appears
on the market but that's been it thank
you for watching this video and I will
talk to you guys in the next one peace
