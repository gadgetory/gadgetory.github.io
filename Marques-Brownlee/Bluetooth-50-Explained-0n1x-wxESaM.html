and welcome back to the explained series
so the galaxy si is a head-turning phone
and there are plenty of awesome new
things about it
but one thing that kind of went under
the radar I don't even know if it was
officially said during the announcement
is that this is the first phone in the
world to ship with Bluetooth 5.0 so
you've probably heard of Bluetooth and
you may even know if your phone has
bluetooth 4.0 or 4.1 or 4.2 but
generally those different iterations of
Bluetooth are just slight improvements
to things like pairing time and low
energy modes etc it doesn't really
change the way you use it you just know
your phone has bluetooth 5.0 that's a
pretty big new number that seems to
signify sort of a bigger change so
there's a couple things that you should
know that so what is new with Bluetooth
5.0 there are three main things that all
enable one pretty dope new features so
number one is it's 2 times faster so
bluetooth pairing is generally not that
quick of a process you have to do it
very often but it's pretty slow you're
someone like me who's connecting a lot
of Bluetooth speakers as I test a bunch
of them for a video then you know that
it's not super quick but doing it with
this Galaxy s8 with Bluetooth 5.0 shows
a direct advantage of data transferring
twice as fast which is the pairing
process is a bit quicker and there's
also less delay you ever watch a video
like on Bluetooth speakers or bluetooth
headphones and like the audio is a
little bit behind the video like
someone's talking and then you hear it
like a split second behind usually not
too bad but that actually does get
solved a bit with Bluetooth 5.0 that
delay is a lot smaller so that's data
speed number two is four times the range
that's actually been a real-world
weakness of Bluetooth especially in my
past it depends on what pair of
headphones you use but sometimes you can
be listening to music in your headphones
and you leave your phone in another room
you walk a little bit too far away and
it starts cutting out and then
eventually stops that happens like all
the time the theoretical maximum range
of Bluetooth 4 was about 50 meters with
a direct line of sight but about 10
meters in everyday use through walls and
around corners and around different
rooms of the house so 30 feet tops so
that means you can't get very far away
from your phone it's you're trying to
listen to music or if you walk around
the corner it's going to cut out and
that's kind of a nine-to-five like I
said quadruples that max range so a
theoretical
maximum of 200 meters with a direct line
of sight or about 40 meters around a
house or indoors so that's that's 120
feet that's a legitimate serious
improvement so that's not just like
downstairs and around the corner that's
like you can walk out in your backyard
while your phone's upstairs you can walk
to the front yard or around the gym what
have you got to do you can get a lot
further from your audio source with
Bluetooth 5.0 and then the number three
improvement is eight times the data
throughput Allu tooth four and this is
where a lot of the real world
improvements and doh features start to
get enabled so first of all this has
benefits way beyond just like audio like
I'm talking about speakers because
usually that's what we use bluetooth for
but bluetooth can also be used for
things like Bluetooth beacons and
parking meters and small wireless things
those can also be helped by more data
throughput through Bluetooth five but if
you think about a Bluetooth stream like
a highway it used to be a two-lane
highway going 40 miles an hour for 20
miles now it's a 16 lane wide mega
highway going 80 miles an hour for 80
miles it's a completely different story
so having all these lanes of data moving
so fast enables a pretty sweet feature
which Samsung calls and which will call
since they're kind of first to it dual
audio which lets you output to two
different Bluetooth speakers at the same
time so let me demo that real quick I'm
going to connect to bluetooth one at a
time here plays it sound whenever it
turns on
so this is one speaker it's pretty
decently loud but let's say I want that
stereo listening experience I want to
have two different outputs at the same
time just bear with me here I'm gonna
connect this one now so you go into the
dual audio mode you turn it on and then
you make sure both of your sources are
connected that you want to play - whoa
okay I'm gonna play
so the fact that that works so easily is
awesome you might have noticed there's
this this super tiny delay in the the
audio timing one of them plays like a
tiny bit before the other one that can
be negotiated just by moving them
further apart you'll notice that way
left oh yeah this used to be a lot more
difficult to do like you've heard of
Sonos right so knows essentially made
its living of a couple of things but
mainly the stock that you could connect
to a bunch of different speakers all
around the house in different places at
one you have to get certain so no
speakers and you have to have that Sonos
app and then you connect the app to the
mesh network up to so no speakers create
amongst themselves and when you plug
that into those speakers then you'll get
the one audio source among several so
notes but you have to buy those very
inexpensive so no speakers to make that
happen this Bluetooth 5.0 and this
feature enables that Sonos experience on
any Bluetooth speakers so that is
Bluetooth 5 more data more range and
faster speeds and it's good to know
about a phone that you may potentially
get later this year so that's pretty
much it
thank you for watching talk to you guys
the next one hey looking for a freak
someone who likes to please</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
