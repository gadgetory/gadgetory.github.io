the moto Z came out a few days ago we
have the Moto X before and I don't know
what Moto Y is but I think the gap is
actually appropriate because Moto Z is a
totally different phone than anything
we've seen from Motorola or Lenovo in
the past and I like a lot of it so
here's what's up
moto Z is a high-end flagship spec
Android phone and it's actually two
phones
there's the Moto Z and the Moto Z force
so Moto Z is the thinner prettier
version of the flagship 5.2 millimeters
thin 2600 milliamp hour battery gorilla
glass on the front and the back and a 13
megapixel camera and Moto Z force is a
slightly thicker version so it's 2
millimeters thicker and it gets a
shatterproof display a 3,500 milliamp
hour battery and a 21 megapixel camera
so right off the bat the Moto Z force is
a bit more expensive but it's probably
worth it unfortunately these are also
both exclusive to Verizon right now
the unlocked versions are coming later I
hate carrier exclusives I've talked
about that in the past but what can you
do that's just the way it is with these
so my favorite thing about this phone is
actually the build quality all metal and
glass no chassis flex or any creaking of
any kind tight tolerances materially
this could be one of the best moto
phones ever built and obviously they've
built a lot of good phones and also do
you think it looks pretty good in black
and that's just my opinion but obviously
that's pretty subjective but there's no
arguing that this guy is well built and
as a result it feels great to hold and
carry it's really solid there's a
microSD card slot up top for expandable
storage which is awesome and a single
USB type-c port at the bottom which is
an interesting choice but maybe a bit
premature I don't think this is a phone
where you have to get rid of the
headphone jack but they did anyway using
the phone I slowly got used to it thanks
to just attaching a USB C to headphone
jack adapter to my headphones all the
time it comes in the box and I also use
Bluetooth audio a bit more but yeah of
course I still miss that headphone jack
a lot the buttons on the phone are
clicky and everything but they're a bit
of a stretch with
volume buttons all the way at the top
corner I mean I have big hands so even
for me it's a stretch which means if you
have smaller hands it's probably a bit
of a pain to reach them the other side
of the phone is blank so they could have
put the volume buttons over there on the
left or put them below the power buttons
like most other phones but I'd say maybe
the worst thing about this phone is that
it's a pretty constant fingerprint
magnet and it definitely doesn't look
good with fingerprints so if you hate
them as much as I do you can either grab
a D brand skin for it which leaves the
pins at the bottom exposed and wipes out
the fingerprints completely which is
great I'll link it below or you can grab
a color swap piece from Motorola they're
a little more expensive but they're
weightier to put on and take off and
I'll talk about them more in a second in
this video so aside from the frustrating
buttons and I guess maybe the lack of
water resistance moto Z is built great
on the front you have a fingerprint
reader in this square that kind of
doesn't match with the rest of the
aesthetics on the front of the phone but
it's fast and it works well so I'm not
complaining that it's there and you can
long press to read your finger and wake
up and then while it's on you can long
press again to sleep it's not actually a
home button no matter how many times you
accidentally try and the screen we're
looking at on the front is a 5.5 inch
quad HD AMOLED display again very good
really high pixel density obviously and
viewing angles are more than good enough
pretty wide and colors stay accurate it
doesn't get quite as bright as Samsung's
panels but most don't it's not the
easiest to see outdoors but other than
that the display on moto Z looks pretty
good and the software itself is Android
6.0 marshmallow right now with Moto's
very light customizations on top and a
lot of this is at least familiar to what
we've seen in other moto phones even if
the outside the package it comes in is
way different so you have you know your
screen off gestures your chop-chop to
turn the flashlight on and off and the
almost invaluable twisting twice to open
the camera for example those things
aren't going anywhere you almost get
used to them and miss them on other
phones and then the inside the UI itself
is still feeling a lot like stock
Android in the way it looks and feels
which is great I'm a fan of the clean
look and I like what they did to use a
lot of googles apps as their stock apps
this is something HTC did earlier so
even in the past there would be phones
that would look and feel like kind of
close to stock Android but they still
you
their own separate calculator and dialer
and photos apps and all these things
that Google already makes so now with
this phone you take a picture and you
swipe over and you're in Google Photos
right away the one and only calculator
app is the Google calculator the one and
only calendar app is the Google calendar
now obviously not everyone is going to
notice or even care but I think that's a
really nice touch and it kind of gets
nullified by the fact that it's a
Verizon phone so now there's also a
bunch of Verizon bloatware in there but
you know the thought that counts so
aside from the Verizon bloatware I'm a
fan of the software experience which
means I'll probably be really happy with
the unlocked version later this year I'm
disappointed that Motorola isn't fully
committing to the regular Google
security updates like on-time for
Android but I still think it'll get
upgraded to new versions of Android
faster than most phones and performances
you can probably already tell has been
smooth with my time with this device as
you would expect with a high-end device
with top-notch specs animations are
quick opening and closing and switching
between apps is quick it's snappy I got
pretty warm actually to the touch after
using it for a while or especially after
a long session of either web browsing or
gaming not to the point of any
performance issues but still something
to notice now the camera on the back of
this phone is another weird point for
the Moto Z first of all I can say that
cameras and smartphones has never really
been a strong point for Motorola it's
just true they never really had the top
of the game smartphone cameras and sadly
that's still true with this camera so
here's the deal I did most of my testing
with the Moto Z force so 21 megapixel
camera F 1.8 aperture optical image
stabilization dual LED flash and for the
most part the pictures looked pretty
decent especially in good lighting it
tends to overexpose a little bit which
leads to more blown highlights than lost
shadows but that's not a huge problem
there's definitely a lot more noticeable
processing though first of all you get a
lot of sharpening going on and there's
also plenty of noise reduction and when
you combine that you get some pretty
soft or grainy night shots depends on
what you're taking a picture of which in
this kind of an area the camera falls
apart pretty quick it is not good at
night or in low-light but look that's
not like it's not capable of taking
great photos most high-end smartphone
cameras
capable of taking great photos but when
I say it's hit or miss that just means
it's a little bit more miss than you
would like it to be in your daily phone
but it can definitely hit if you get it
in the right conditions also if you're
just selfies the front-facing camera is
pretty decent it's a wide angle it
exposes well and it has a front-facing
LED flash which you don't see every day
the actual camera bump on the back of
this phone was pretty interesting though
because with the thicker phone you would
think they would get rid of the camera
hump but they didn't
the thicker moto Z force has the exact
same camera hump and that's because it's
probably the first phone to ever have a
camera hump with a purpose it has a
function to it it's for keeping moto
mods in place so moto mods our
Motorola's answer to the wave of modular
smartphones we've seen in the past year
so those pins you saw at the bottom of
the phone that's a combination of
magnets and smart connectors that let
the phone connect to a range of
accessories like the color swap back I
told you about earlier and wrapping
around the camera bump helps it hold in
place super well now I don't even know
if I'd call this stuff modular because
you're not really swapping anything or
taking anything off the phone but I'd
more just call moto mods modification
because it's easily the quickest and
easiest way to just add functionality to
a smartphone just by clicking it into
place you don't have to reboot the phone
you don't have to swap things in and out
there's no buttons there's no clicking
there's no rebooting it's just snap it
into place in two seconds and it's
secure and it fits and it works so here
are the mods we have now number one is
the color swap backs they just get rid
of the camera bump and change the color
/ material of the back of the phone the
battery backs these are a little bit
thicker and they snap on and they just
immediately start charging the phone the
JBL speaker which gets super loud way
louder than the phone's single front
facing speaker and also has a large
battery extension and even a little
kickstand and the projector which has a
built-in battery for power and can
project whatever is on your smart phone
screen onto a wall or any projectable
surface so motor mods are actually
pretty awesome as they are now and we
can cross our fingers for more to come
since Motorola promises to try to make
them work with future Motorola phones as
well only problem is they're a little
bit expensive and it's hard to buy into
these with a promise of an ecosystem
especially when your neck
phone might just come from Samsung or
Apple or anyone else really but I stand
by that this is the best execution of a
smartphone mod that I have ever seen
also here's a million dollar idea a moto
mod with a high quality DAC and a
headphone jack at the bottom and like a
little battery in there that would be
awesome you're welcome I'll take 10% my
favorite mod though besides probably the
color swap one is definitely the battery
because the battery life of the existing
moto Z and Z force is really super
average obviously the Moto Z has a 2600
milliamp hour battery that can only take
you so far with a big bright quad HD
display I'm not surprised I was only
getting two and a half hours of screen
on time and having to charge every
single day didn't shock me at all
moto Z force has a thirty-five hundred
million power battery and again I'm
getting like three hours and change of
screen on time which for me is still
charging every night when I'm using the
phone with match brightness all day but
it's definitely like the battery mod is
the easiest way to just click it on it's
better than a battery case because you
don't have to like attach it around the
phone when you attach it to the phone it
starts charging immediately that's
pretty awesome so at the end of the day
moto Z is a great idea with great
execution but it's just not a complete
package like especially if you're
looking for a phone with a great battery
life or a great camera thing you're not
going to find it here and you probably
won't buy this phone for that but a lot
of what they tried is awesome I'm glad
they did it Thank You Lenovo / Moto for
trying this and making moto mods work so
well and I do hope it works really well
and I do hope there are more third-party
moto mods from other companies that just
want to get in on this on the ground
floor because generation one it's pretty
damn good
so let's spin it thank you for watching
I'll talk to you guys the next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
