this is the new Google pixel phone or
two phones the pixel and the pixel XL
they're picking up where Nexus left off
with this whole stock Android experience
thing and showcasing the absolute latest
of what's good with Android
so while Nexus phones were Google
working with manufacturers like HTC and
LG and Huawei to make the phone pixel
here is the first phone made entirely by
Google inside and out top to bottom the
whole thing so we're getting is a mostly
unibody aluminum phone here with some
chamfer action all the way around the
sides and overall pretty round pretty
familiar shape and antenna line goes
across the bottom of the back and you
have the digi logo the Google logo now
at the bottom replacing the Nexus r.i.p
nexus and then you have the top half of
the back with this glass panel around
the fingerprint reader so it's a pretty
interesting dual tone look dual text
your look I might have to let it grow on
me for a little bit but wireless
charging wasn't mentioned at all at the
event so I'm not sure if this has any
utility but just a different look and up
front is the AMOLED display which looks
great and on the white version of the
phone above the display you can see some
cluster of sensors although the black
version of the phone I think definitely
hides this a lot better as you'd expect
and I think I like the overall look of
the black phone a little bit better
anyway it's kind of my thing and I can't
seriously be the first one to mention
that chin wow what gives it really
necessary to keep the phone symmetrical
actually liked the Nexus 6 look of
having a smaller chin because it's not
necessary to have a big chin the
fingerprint reader is on the back the
home and navigation buttons are on the
screen so I would have loved to have
seen a smaller chin up here but oh well
so the only difference between the pixel
and pixel XL is the size the display
size up front and the battery size the
5.5 inch display of the XL and the 5
inch display of the pixel everything
else the specs the camera everything
else is identical so speaking of specs
this is shaping up to be possibly the
fastest phone ever
again it's rocking a Snapdragon 820 one
chip so it's the first phone to do that
four gigabytes of RAM and 32 or 128
gigabytes of storage
it has USB type-c at the bottom where
the speakers are as you can see and
quick charging claims to get seven hours
of charge in 15 minutes oh and don't
worry it still does have a headphone
jack feels crazy every time I have to
say that but it's true it's still up
here at the top and the camera on the
back claims claims to be the best on any
smartphone by their pre-production DxO
mark ranking now I can't even keep track
of how many smartphones have claimed
that anymore but it is promising it's a
12 megapixel camera with a really big
sensor so 1.5 5 micron pixels which are
some of the biggest I've seen in a while
it's basically ultra pixels at this
point f 2.0 aperture 4k video and that
LED flash and with the software
optimization they're saying there's
basically zero shutter lag so you can
take photos super quickly so that's
definitely something I got to test more
when I get it the few photos I did take
in this environment they look decent but
this is like the worst lighting possible
so off to get out and test that for the
full review for sure and yeah this is
all launching with Android 7.1 onboard
so it looks like it'll be the first and
only phone right out the box to get that
and playing with it I found it pretty
nice now the round icons and a couple
new UI tweaks I can get used to that I
mean at least all the icons are the same
size now but the rest of Android 7.1 is
a bunch of new features and a little
additions to 7.0 the main one of those
being the Google assistant now Google
assistant isn't new it was in Google's
allo app you can use that already but
now they've built it into the OS itself
so it's replacing what was essentially
Google now on tap or that used to be so
now anywhere in any app on any screen
you can long press the home button to
get the little pop up for Google
assistant and for there you can ask it a
question you can ask it about people
places things ask it to remind you
something or start playing music
chromecast whatever it's your assistant
it does all that stuff now you can still
get the Google now on tap features by
swiping so if you still want that
awesome screen recognition stuff you can
long press on the screen and swipe up
and you'll have then now on tap features
but yeah the assistant and all its
machine-learning awesomeness is a major
new feature a major point for Android
7.1 and the rest of the things I notice
were pretty little like in the settings
there's a new tab over to the right
called support where you have direct
links to calling or video
chatting with tech support the new home
button animation you saw it one I've
long pressed it but there's this new
fancy animation every time you regular
press home and it's quick but is nice
you can't really miss it and this new
animated lockscreen thing check this out
look at that like the canyon picture
when i unlock it see it moving like
that's crazy that has to be new right or
at least the image is built-in for the
support are super good looking now but
anyway that's what's good the first
impressions for me ralph the bat with
the pixel phone and with the pixel
launcher are a bit of a mixed bag for
sure of the three new colors I would say
the black one is my favorite not a
surprise but not gonna lie that blue is
actually pretty good looking in certain
light but you're going to want to love
it to spend that premium price that this
phone is going to come in at it's
starting at six hundred forty nine
dollars unlocked which makes sense for
the build you're getting and the specs
you're getting but you're gonna have to
really like it so I'm hoping to get my
hands on this and the daydream view
headset later this year and Google home
and chromecast ultra and everything they
announced but in the meantime let me
know what you think of pixel and pixel
XL is this your next phone is this
enough to convince you to spend your
money I think the full review will be a
lot of fun so definitely subscribe for
that and be sure to share this video
your one-stop shop for all information
all things pixel until it comes out
anyway thank you for watching I'll talk
to you guys the next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
