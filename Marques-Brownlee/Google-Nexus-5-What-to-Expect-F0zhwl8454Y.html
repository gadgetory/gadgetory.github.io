earlier this year with the Google Play
edition devices there's a little bit of
worry that we might not see a new Nexus
every year but this is 2013 and we know
by now that just about everything new is
going to leak before it's announced and
this new Nexus is no exception so
without any further ado this is
everything we know about the next Nexus
so first of all the rumor mill really
got going when an Android 4.4 promo
video from Google one up and had a one
or two second clip in it of a Google
employee holding an unannounced device
that said Nexus on it so we all pretty
much assume that that's the next Nexus
right there he's got an early copy and
essentially that's where a lot of our
initial impressions of what it's going
to look like came from since then though
we've gotten way more leaks from FCC
submissions and leaked service manuals
and actual photos of the device itself
that give us a much better idea of what
to expect when the actual device is
released so we basically already know
what it's going to look like at this
point so here is a pretty accurate
render I would say of what to expect
when the announcement finally rolls
around when we see that Nexus 5 for the
first time you can pretty much assume
that that's what it's gonna look like
has a larger display and the LED
notification light on the front larger
camera aperture on the back then that
black finished similar to the current
Nexus 7 it's a very simple clean pretty
much understated device now I have the
Nexus 4 here which is also in its day a
very clean simple understated device
because it's a nexus it has no front
buttons on the front but on the back it
at least had a little bit of shine a
little bit of glitz or something to
significantly distinguish it from other
devices out there but from what we've
seen of this new Nexus it looks actually
be even more of a clean simple
understated device now two things will
this actually be called Nexus 5 and will
this actually be called Android 4.4
KitKat
well about the KitKat thing you can
pretty much be guaranteed that yes it's
going to be called KitKat some people
still don't believe it but if you've
read more into the Android 4.4 story
you'll realize that the partnership with
KitKat came essentially at like the last
second it was a very last second for fun
sort of deal so earlier League's
versions of Android still show some key
lime pie elements and some naming
schemes from
key lime pie and even a debug icon from
key lime pie but they've probably going
to change all these things to match up
with the KitKat mantra as far as the
Nexus 5 name goes it's kind of hard to
say because on one hand they could say
it's the Nexus 5 but then the next Nexus
will be the Nexus 6 and then the Nexus 7
which is a new tablet so naturally based
on that a lot of people said it's just
gonna be called the Nexus 4 2013 or the
new Nexus 4 that makes sense but
honestly the only thing that's actually
confirmed right now is the model number
which is the LG G 820 and that confirms
two things number one it will be made by
LG again and number two it'll be a
natural step up from the model number
from the LG g2 which was the LG D 802
but for the purposes of this video and
for the purpose of the rumors we're just
gonna call it the Nexus 5 so if this new
device is based on the LG g2 should we
expect it to have high-end specs like
the LG g2 that's a question that's
interesting because well first of all
the Nexus line started off as being
known for high-end specs the Nexus 1 was
the first device to have a 1 gigahertz
processor which at the time was nuts but
right now as of more recently the Nexus
4 comes out and goes with a more mid
high end range spec sheet but a much
more competitive price so we've actually
gotten the leaked specs of the new Nexus
and we can confirm just about everything
here so it's gonna have a 5-inch 1080p
display that's gonna have that Qualcomm
Snapdragon 800 quad-core processor
clocked at 2.3 gigahertz
it'll have 2 gigabytes of RAM and an 8
megapixel back facing camera with
optical image stabilization it will also
have a seal of 2300 milliamp hour
battery if you were looking for a
removable battery or removable storage
Nexus is not for you and we're also
looking at connectivity on LTE bands in
the United States and it'll all come in
a package that's just eight point six
millimeters thick these are all pretty
high to mid to high specs I mean they're
not note three future proof sort of
specs on a phone but they're also pretty
decent specs and I would expect to see a
phone based off of the six to $700 LG g2
and the Google Play Store as competitive
as Google can get I wouldn't be
surprised to see a 16 or a 32 gigabyte
version of the Nexus 5 sell for four and
nine off contract in the Playstore as
far as carriers in the United States
since the Playstore tends to be a very
United States centric thing I would
expect all the major ones but don't
cross your fingers for a verizon Nexus 5
just don't it's probably not gonna
happen and even if it does happen again
Verizon's likely going to find a way to
screw it up like it does with all its
other promising devices on its network
so I'm actually already in the process
of fully switching over to AT&amp;amp;T in order
to just use AT&amp;amp;T as my main line right
now either way all the information about
Nexus 5 will be finally unveiled and
released officially this month
it's October along with the whole bunch
of other awesome protect this month but
all of the rumors will finally cease and
the false things will be dispelled when
the google event actually happens I have
a feeling that's not going to be the
biggest surprise at the event the more
exciting things that we don't already
know much about like the Asus Bilt Nexus
10 or maybe some Google glass or some
Google Chrome news might be more
exciting but either way follow me on
Twitter for more of the Nexus 5 coverage
as it unrolls and if we get more stuff
I'll be sure to share it with you if
we've to get more leaked stuff that we
don't already know I'll be tweeting that
out but either way that's been it thank
you for watching and I will talk to you
guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
