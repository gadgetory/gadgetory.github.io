welcome to the definitive video to send
your friends to on facebook twitter or
google+ of the new google chrome beta
for android so this is as of today the
newest release of a browser on Android
from Google itself go ahead and open it
up and take a look at it for the first
time as yes it was released today if
anything is the most compelling reason
to use Chrome on the desktop you know
it's a fast browser it's a secure
browser and it's coming to mobile here
and you'll see there has been a few
interesting changes right off the bat
there are some user interface changes
first of all there's some really weird
tab switching on going on here so first
of all I can swipe to the right to go in
my next tab which is pretty sweet here
you can see how Facebook open I have
Google+ open and I have a google.com tab
here I also have a Settings tab what I
can also do is hit that multiple tabs
button here and you'll see I have this
interesting accelerometer controlled way
of flipping through my tabs and
revealing what tabs I have open so I can
go straight to Facebook straight to
Google+ and just flip around between the
tabs here which is kind of interesting
and I like it in this tab you view you
can also exit a tab here or just swipe
it out and never have to look at it
again you can also open new tabs of
course to view other stuff but if
there's any really compelling reason to
use Chrome and I'm serious about this
because it's finally come to mobile is
the settings now there's some pretty
crazy stuff going on in here so I'll
show you when you're signed in to Chrome
as you probably are on your desktop you
have your Google account hooked up and
that'll be able to sync all your
bookmarks while your history and all
sorts of settings and things like that
to your phone second of all is auto
sign-in which we would expect so if
you're signed in to Facebook on your
desktop site and you don't want to have
to remember that password this will
remember the password as well as soon as
you sign in and if you're not a fan of
that crazy tilt scrolling you can
disable it in developer tools the single
most important version and this is just
on the phone of the settings is the
other devices button and I'll go ahead
and show you right now this is the
transformer prime TF - oh one in the
background and it's letting me know that
two minutes ago I had Google+ open so I
can go ahead and write open Google
Plus that was open on the transformer
prime without any sort of delay because
it knows that's what's open on the
transformer prime but there are some
other things that are different on the
tablet so let's go ahead and switch over
to tablet view and check out what's
different there so now we're here on the
tablet and you can see that first of all
the Nexus was right I do have Google+
open here on the tablet and if you want
any further proof will go to other
devices here and it'll tell us what the
Galaxy Nexus is running and sure enough
it's Google+ and the new tab page and
that's totally correct but what you'll
notice is also interesting is this is
showing the mobile version of the
website and that's because as of right
now there is no request desktop site
option as there was in a stock browser
so that's one of the cons and the other
con which I'll go ahead and get out the
way right now is that Adobe Flash is not
supported so if you were hoping to be
able to use your desktop sites that were
full of Adobe Flash stuff that's not
going to work right off the bat at least
right now in Google Chrome for Android
if you're ok with all the rest of that
and you like the tab switching Google
Chrome actually looks like a bit of a
desktop browser when you're using it on
your tablet you can see it looks it kind
of resembles Chrome for Mac actually I
can say that because I use Chrome for
Mac now and it looks very very similar
to that also if we go back into our
settings here again you'll find the same
sort of settings here you can sign in to
your Google account and sync everything
like your bookmarks history everything
is the same and it does resemble a
desktop experience so I would say if
anyone is looking forward to using such
a very high-end tablet you should go
with a high-end browser and so far
Google Chrome has looked to be like that
either way there's been mkbhd with a
quick video google chrome beta for
Android 4.0 and above devices so I'll
keep you updated if this is updated to a
later version or if it's changes
significantly either way that's been
mkbhd thanks for watching and I'll talk
to you guys in the next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
