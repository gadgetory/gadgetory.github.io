fact people still use BlackBerry's a
recent poll from the boy genius report
showed that the current u.s. usage share
of smartphones for blackberry is 1% it
was measured from mobile web data usage
which means basically in layman's terms
that 1% of all the phones that are going
on the internet nowadays are
blackberries but how much is that really
well there are 300 million people living
in the United States and roughly 115
million of those people in 2012 are
smartphone owners and will call
blackberry smartphones for this so one
percent of these hundred fifteen million
smartphone owners are blackberries that
means there are 1.15 million people
using blackberries today in the United
States that's a lot of people now taking
a look at this chart it shows that as
recently as October 2011 more than 5% of
people using smartphones were
blackberries so now that's more than a
75 percent drop-off in just less than a
year but there's still a float there's
still a million of them why so many well
you have to consider the fact that a lot
of the people who are using blackberries
are people who got them because of
enterprise that's a huge market that
Blackberry and rim used to hold most
people who are getting jobs that give
out phones they give their employees of
blackberry to use and if you want to use
the phone for personal use you can buy
another one but a lot of employees are
getting BlackBerry's for free to use for
their business if I had to guess I'd say
that's about 75% of the blackberries
that are being used in the US which
leaves about 250,000 people who are
using blackberries by choice or because
they can't afford anything else or
they're locked into a contract right now
some of these people are really
difficult to understand like I can
understand if your business forces you
to use a blackberry for business and you
can't really afford anything else or if
you use a second phone for more personal
use but if you're one of the maybe
hundred or 150,000 people that chooses
to use a blackberry over anything else
for the price that's confusing to me did
you know that in the United States on
Verizon the BlackBerry Bold 99 costs the
same as the Samsung Galaxy Nexus here
here's a little graphic I put together
very
short one that summarizes the state of
research in motion the company that's
behind blackberry I kid a kid rim you're
doing alright okay you got a million
people that's solid here look I have a
blackberry with me right now I promise I
don't use any other devices it's just
the one that I happen to prefer it's a
neat little device it's very pocketable
I have this other random phone here
don't know how it got here but it it
fits in the screen of this other device
it's how pocketable it is and it has a
keyboard and it has a camera on the back
I think that's a 1 megapixel camera um
the screen is about an inch or two maybe
that's all you really need is a little
keyboard right here you can hear the
clicks there very tactile and stuff and
that's what it's all about with
blackberries isn't it look at its hefty
it's the bulk you need either way I'm
back to doing regular videos guys in
case you haven't noticed I'm back from
my one-week break thanks for watching
