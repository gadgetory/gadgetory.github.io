these are my quick first impressions of
the new big smartphones that Samsung
announced today the main one you need to
know about is a galaxy note 5 it is big
it's bright crispy it's really dense and
slippery as hell so here's the breakdown
just like every year you know the galaxy
note gets improvements on the inside and
out and right off the bat on the inside
on paper the galaxy note 5 has a pretty
dope looking spec sheet so it's the
octa-core exynos 7420 chip from the
galaxy s6 it's a bump up to four
gigabytes of RAM it's a 5.7 inch quad HD
Super AMOLED display that looks pretty
outstanding it's a 16 megapixel camera
with optical image stabilization and the
F 1.9 aperture and it's a 3000 milliamp
hour battery with fast charging and
wireless charging and NFC and LTE
advanced and AC Wi-Fi etc it's even a
new color with this sweet-looking
titanium gray it's a very complete
looking spec sheet on paper but in
practice it's not all perfect so the
main story with the note 5 is on the
outside obviously the biggest change
here is in the hardware design it's
moved as we kind of expected into this
all metal and glass thin railed look
like the galaxy s6 and Samsung says you
know premium materials high-end precise
build durable etc and they've even
curved the glass on the back of the
phone to fit better in one hand so that
actually works well and to top it all
off it fits inside the footprint of the
galaxy note 4 since the bezels make it
thinner and shorter and narrower than
its predecessor I agree that the shape
is better the shape is actually great
but the phone itself is super slippery
in the hand it's just not really that
comfortable to hold it's like all the
things that were slippery about the
galaxy s6 with that glossy back
magnified in an even bigger body just
the feel on the hand is I guess
definitely my least favorite part of
this phone that and the fact that you
now have all the internals sealed
meaning there's no removable battery and
there's also no expandable storage those
two things will be a pretty big deal for
some people I don't mind them as much
but I actually do care a lot about the
way it feels in the hand there's also
some pretty neat new features though
that really make it a note first of all
the s-pen is improved and
maybe looking at it wondering how do I
get it out of the phone if it's embedded
like that
well the stylus actually has a clicking
button on the back and it just clicks
and pops out of the phone just like that
and it is an improved stylus made with
more metal now you know it has a little
bit more weight to it
still has a button and that multi-level
sensitivity and as a bonus you can keep
clicking it even when it's out of the
phone no functionality there but it is
kind of addicting and the S Pen
functionality itself is actually
improved too you can see the menu looks
a little bit different when you take it
out the phone and going into and
triggering the S Pen actions works the
same with the improved pen it just feels
a little bit more natural to write on
the screen at the end of the day I
usually like see all these features and
I use them a little bit when I first get
the galaxy notes but then I use them
less and less as time goes on but today
they showed me one feature that I really
like and will definitely try to use more
you can bust out the stylus one the
display is off and then immediately
start writing on the screen so if you're
ever in a bind and you hear something
that you just have to write down you
have to just break out your phone and
start to write it the S Pen lets you
write it down real quick and when you
put the pen back it closes and saves
that note that is actually a really good
idea I like that there's also stuff
added to the Galaxy Note improved ways
to take like taller screen shots and
ways to annotate and share what you
create with this pen all of it makes
sense and all of that is what makes it a
note but all the rest is in your
brand-new design also I mentioned the
phone is thinner with this new design
which means the battery as I mentioned
is actually smaller than the last Galaxy
Note at 3000 milliamp hours and non
removable now they do try to make up for
this and you can decide if it's a good
enough replacement or not with wireless
charging and fast charging and get this
fast wireless charging so samsung's new
wireless charging technology lets them
get around 90% of normal fast charging
wired speeds without the wire I
personally would rather still have a
larger battery and a thicker phone
that's just me but you know we'll have
to see how good this battery lasts with
the quad HD display in the full review
and that's the real sentiment here I
didn't get to play with these phones for
too much time but I'm looking forward to
getting my hands on them like
permanently for a full review experience
preferably in this darker titanium color
to test things like the battery life
to test the performance to test things
like the built-in YouTube live streaming
directly from the camera app at up to
1080p I mean this seems like it's
supposed to be a periscope killer but I
won't really know it until I try it
certainly seems really convenient for
people to livestream from their phones
especially since this is one of the best
cameras in any smartphone not sure if
I'm looking forward to testing this
though what year is it again but you
know what I'll give it that shot and
actually try to use it before I dismiss
it entirely overall the note 5 gets my
hesitant but optimistic wait and see
also there was another phone announced
today the galaxy s6 edge+
this one's easy it's the galaxy s6 edge
but plus it's bigger or you could also
call it the Galaxy Note 5 with curved
edges both descriptions would be correct
it has the updated specs and it's the
bigger 5.7 inch display from the galaxy
note that is also curved on each side
I've used the galaxy s6 edge smaller
version as a daily driver for a while so
I'll be interested to see the new
features one of the new features of the
s6 edge+
is the ability to put not just your
fever at contact in the edge on your
homescreen but to put any of your
favorite apps in there as well and also
to have this available on any screen so
it's sort of like a mini launcher of any
apps you want no restrictions this will
certainly be nice to have so there you
have it thanks for watching and feel
free to share this with others curious
about Samsung's big new flagships I'm
definitely interested
like I said in using these full time and
let's just spend my quick impressions
and hands-on again thanks for watching
and I'll talk to you guys the next one
peace
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
