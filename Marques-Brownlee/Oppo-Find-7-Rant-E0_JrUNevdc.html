Oppo that company Oppo remember them
they posted a bit of a teaser a couple
of days ago on Twitter that I retweeted
that reads hashtag fine 5 was the first
smartphone with a 5-inch 1080p display
hashtag fine 7 is taking it one step
further
hashtag always improve and then it shows
this image that shows the Oppo find 5
has a 1080p display obviously and that
the Oppo find 7 its successor is going
to have a 2k display so many things
about this just get to me so first of
all only Oppo like only Oppo would tweet
the next-gen specs of the successor to
their current device that they're
currently working on that no other
company has ever introduced yet they're
the only Oppo would tweet and tease
something like this second of all what
exactly is a 2k display if you watched
my 4k explained video you know that the
K is a shortening moniker for the
horizontal resolution of the image of
roughly 4000 by 2,000 pixels so doesn't
that mean 1920 by 1080 is already 2k
roughly I guess the hashtag always
improve would suggest that Oppo has a
slightly higher resolution in mind I'm
thinking 2560 by 1440 or something like
that but then again is that 2.5 k which
where does that fall either way it
doesn't really matter all we know is
it's higher than 1080p and I'm glad to
see Oppo as a company pushing the limits
yet again here now I know what a lot of
you guys are thinking because I've seen
it in the tweets I've seen it in the
comments and other videos it's why would
I want a 2k display in my smartphone if
I already have a 1080p display I already
can't see the pixels it already looks
super sharp why would I want extra
resolution that's just going to kill
battery life that's just going to hinder
graphics performance just going to make
the phone less enjoyable to use why
would anyone want a 2k display and it's
so easy to just ignore that tweet and
agree with that it's so easy to just not
care basically uh but if you've rewind
to September 2012 I made a video in
September 2012 called the super Retina
display
smartphone about a company called Oppo
who is preparing to release a
revolutionary 1080p smartphone if you
look back at a lot of those older
comments a lot of the comments on that
old video remind me exactly of the
reactions to oppas tweet where people
are saying 1080p on a smartphone are you
kidding me why would I want that
I can already not see the pixels on my
iPhone it already has a Retina display
why would I want a 1080p smartphone
that's just going to wreck my
performance that's just gonna hinder my
battery life and at first it really did
they were right the first 1080p
smartphones like the Oppo find 5 and the
Droid DNA they were really not the best
performance they needed like top-end
specs and massive batteries to keep up
with the phones that didn't have 1080p
displays and their sales showed they
weren't the best selling phones they
weren't the best experience even though
they had those amazing new bright
beautiful looking panels but slowly the
big guns came on the HTC ones the galaxy
s4 is the Sony Xperia Z's the Nexus
fives
suddenly we have all these massive 1080p
phones and it's sort of a standard by
now we kind of expect a new high-end
smartphone to have a 1080p display by
the end of 2013 and actually something
funny happened a Moto X came out that
was supposed to be a flagship for
Motorola and it had a 720p display and
there were comments from people who said
why doesn't this have a 1080p display
how is this supposed to be a flagship
without a 1080p display so it's clear
that 1080p has become a standard it's
become what we expect out of every new
phone and it's obvious that a 1080p
phone nowadays compared to last
generation 720p phones the 1080p phone
looks a lot better and even more obvious
when you put a 1080p phone next to an
iPhone no offense of the iPhone but it
has a 640 P display and you can
definitely tell which one is the 1080p
display when you put them side-by-side
the phone with a 1080p display is going
to look a lot better than a phone with a
640 P display even though you already
can't see the pixels on that 640 P
display because it's about so much more
than just raw pixels now it's almost
like the megapixel count in cameras it's
way more than just
pixels now that's so much more than just
that if I sat you down 10 feet away from
250 inch TVs one of them is a 1080p TV
and the other one is a 4k TV and ask you
which one looks better 10 times out of
10 you're going to say that the 4k TV
looks better even though you can't see
the pixels on either one of them from 10
feet away you can still tell that that
4k TV looks immensely better and I've
done this test for myself I went to CES
2013 I will be at CES 2014 again to see
way more 4k TVs but you can tell that a
4k TV of the same size as a 1080p TV
looks way better even though you can't
see the pixels on any of them so this
same philosophy is being applied here by
Oppo to smart phones you can make a
display that looks better than a 1080p
display even though you already can't
see the pixels on the 1080p display so
I'm ready to see that I'm ready and it
looks like oppo is going to be the one
to do it either their first or their one
of the first now will it impact battery
life at first probably will it
negatively hurt your graphics
performance at first
probably but Oppo is willing to take
that risk again and you know I admire
them for that they're willing to be the
Icebreaker just dive in headfirst be the
number one and push that boundary and
that's that's impressive of setting
standards is not easy but I can kind of
see that same trend as we saw before
happening with this 2k resolution over
the next few months the big guns started
getting into it you know big players the
new Galaxy s5 comes out with a 2k
display galaxy note 4
HTC - Nexus 6 and then maybe we'll see a
Motorola phone that comes out with this
1080p display that makes everyone
scratch their heads why is it only 1080p
you know what I mean crazy it might
happen it might just happen it's all
about framing really and I guess
basically what I'm trying to say with
this whole video is that that no one
should really be complaining when it
comes to the when it comes to the future
of technologies like this like the
really high tech stuff when we're seeing
like for example really high resolutions
and smart phones there's no real reason
to complain unless you know maybe you
buy a smartphone with a 2k display and
you
battery life sucks then complain please
complain because that's that's going to
make the technology better but there's
always going to be the naysayers in the
infancy of any new technology growing
pains as I like to call it but I don't
complain unless it's actually hurting
you
like the this let it happen let Oppo
take the bold steps like let whoever
wants to follow in their foot take the
next bold steps
I guess I'm probably just rambling at
this point I wrote this really quickly
and I wanted to tell you guys it but
anyway that's basically it yeah if you
enjoy this video give it a thumbs up I'm
excited like I said to see the fine 7 by
the way I hope this isn't a gigantic
phone op oh I you could say it's 2560 by
1600 but if it's a 7-inch phone not
working out but yeah I'm excited because
the rest of the fine 7 specs that have
leaked have been along the lines of like
15 megapixel camera four thousand
milliamp power battery Snapdragon 805 or
803 next generation chip like 3 or 4
gigs of ram just crazy stuff so I'm
excited for the future of mobile phones
and it's the end of 2013 the beginning
of 2014 is going to bring more awesome
stuff I'm rambling again thanks for
watching subscribe if you haven't
already I'll talk to you guys in the
next video peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
