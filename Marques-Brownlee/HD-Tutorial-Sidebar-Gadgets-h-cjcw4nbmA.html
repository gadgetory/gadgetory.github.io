to add and remove edges from your
windows vista sidebar here's my sidebar
I've got a few gadgets in it and I also
have the battery indicator over here
what I'm going to show you today is how
obviously an hd2 add and remove packets
so first you'll notice at the top there
is a small little plus button hit that
plus button and there's a number of
gadgets already built in the windows of
the sidebar that come with it such as
stocks and feed headlines that I haven't
actually put in my sidebar yet these you
can drag in easily simply by clicking
holding them and dragging them to any
place in the sidebar letting go and
they're instantly in there I had this
one before so there's already a few
contacts and exit this one out but
you've always wondered will I've seen
people with these cool these things or
maybe a wonder one or a cpu usage ram
usage monitor wondering how to get one
of those so so you simply hit the button
hit get more gadgets online this will
open your default web browser might
happen to be so fly right now and it'll
visit the windows website where you can
search for more gadgets so other top
rated gadgets there are top down gadgets
i'm going to show you an example of how
to insert a gadget so say you want to
get the vista calculator over here in
the bottom of your sidebar or say right
between the google one and the stock
gadget what you do first i will click on
it and it will open up this web page
it'll tell you all about it usually and
you have to make sure it's free unless
you want to actually buy it so you hit
the download button this will take you
straight to the download page and begin
your download give it a second and it'll
say really um only install applications
from developers you trust I hit my
install button here and open and up here
it's done downloading it's a tiny tile I
want to open it up and install so you
can see it's already there now I'm going
to exit out of my web browser and
everything since this is no longer
necessary
you also notice it says page 1 of 2 you
don't see this is a calculator here in
here actually you do it's right there
but once you get a certain amount of
gadgets can actually move to your second
page and the second page of gadgets
which is just my XM radio so I'm going
to side of this so here's the new gadget
that's simple as that you can grab this
little grid thing here and remove it and
we insert it somewhere else where I
where you wanted it before and there we
go so that is how you get the windows
vistas gadgets from microsoft itself
into your sidebar if I want to delete it
or maybe change options the wrench
always means options so if either exit
this out and go in here and hit the
wrench since this is the weather gadget
I can change from Fahrenheit to Celsius
I can enter my location etc that's what
the rent always means and I'll try to
zoom that on the wrench for you so here
is the wrench right there I don't know
if you can see that it's all on the edge
but that's the wrench always means
settings so and removing like I said it
as easy as exiting out and if you go
into the plus again that brings it up
right click one and hit uninstall to
remove it completely from your computer
and that's as easy as this and I think
it'll there it is it's gone PGA Tour one
is gone and i only have one page because
XM radio is back on the first page so
that is how you install and uninstall
gadgets from your sidebar should you be
using one in windows vista so there's a
lot of cool gadgets here so if I was to
search blah and just hit enter it'll
open up a web browser Google search blah
then BAM researching so there's a lot of
useful gadgets that I would recommend if
you have a powerful enough computer and
if you have enough random access memory
to actually do this kind of stuff if you
do then good luck and I hope this
tutorial was helpful if you have any
other tutorials that you'd like me to do
I just hit that subscribe button and
write up a comment now will try my best
to do it so I to watch the speech</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
