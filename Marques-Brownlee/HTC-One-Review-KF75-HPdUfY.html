recently did a top 5 1080p smartphones
video and this device ended at number 1
so it took crown 4 best 1080p smartphone
and I've also been tweeting about and
talking about this phone a lot and this
is it this is time to give it the full
review treatment this is the review of
the HTC One so the one is a really
interesting phone this year for a couple
of reasons number one this is HTC's main
flagship so it seems like it's their
last hope and this is a bit of a
must-win phone for them
number two its competing directly
against Samsung's flagship the galaxy s4
for sales and that's interesting because
HTC actually took some serious risks
with this phone that you don't usually
really see in other phones and some of
them you already know what I'm talking
about already but I'll get to those in a
second but initially picking up this
phone and holding it is a pretty nice
experience which is pretty obvious it's
an all metal unibody aluminum back
design which kind of wraps around to the
front it's definitely not the thinnest
phone in the world and it's also
definitely not the lightest phone in the
world either but it feels rather
steadily built and that's always a good
thing in fact this is probably one of
the best things about this phone how
hefty it feels in the hand it feels
really good and how well everything fits
together with that back piece of metal
now some people have had small gaps
appear between the layers of the phone
and sometimes it's worse than others but
my phone my HTC One feels pretty much
perfect so that's always good the one
thing about the outside Hardware of the
HTC One that I don't like is the button
placement mostly the power button
placement so the power button is up at
the top left hand corner which is a
little bit awkward but if you hold your
phone with your left hand you can get to
it and go to the phone with your right
hand you can get to it but I'm just so
used to tapping our right hand side for
power like I did on you know Samsung and
Motorola devices that it kind of gets me
throws me off a little bit and there are
no buttons on the left hand side of the
phone there's just the SIM card tray and
on the right hand side is your volume
rocker no power button and speaking of
all the placement I guess we'll go over
at the top is also your three-and-a-half
millimeter headphone jack and at the
bottom is your USB port and now at the
front you have some awesome awesome
design features going on here and and
then some other not so awesome ones but
first of all you have a 4.7 inch 1080p
display coming in at
shy of 470 pixels per inch it is an
extremely extremely nice display then
down at the bottom you have your HTC
logo and just two buttons capacitive
buttons your home button and your back
button and you also have your boomsound
front-facing speakers which we'll also
talk about in a second there's also a
wide-angle front facing camera and the
holes for the boomsound speakers are
micro drilled they're really really high
quality they look pretty good and I was
also a notification light up top so
overall the front I like the design of
this phone it's kind of a two-tone
design which is you know a mixed bag
some people don't like it because it
looks like an iPhone but honestly I
think it has a pretty unique appeal of
its own on the back of course you also
have that band the plastic bands are
where the antenna signals were go
through that's where NFC will happen
that's where your radios and Bluetooth
and everything will go through basically
you can't go through the metal then you
also have your four ultra pixel camera
in your flash and you have your AT&amp;amp;T
logo for this model and Beats Audio
which is you know it's they're actually
you know what let's talk about that
let's talk about that Beats Audio in
fact I'll probably do a separate video
covering literally everything about
Beats Audio and phones but you don't
really need to know it now all you need
to know is that this phone's
front-facing speakers are amazing
they're incredible HTC calls it boom
sound I call it awesome sound whatever
you want to call it it's a wonder
nobody's thought to do this in a smart
phone before and executed this well like
HTC and not only are they front-facing
they're also stereo speakers so if
you're watching a movie or playing a
racing game or something you can
actually hear things move across the
screen from one speaker to the other
it's absolutely awesome and on top of
all of that on top of being front-facing
and stereo they're insanely great
quality drivers two more lows more mids
more highs more details just go ahead
and listen to this comparison with the
galaxy s4 and judge for yourself
there you go actions speak louder than
words here and these speakers combined
with probably the best smartphone
display on any phone of every used
period make it probably the best media
consumption experience that I've had in
my pocket and that is a huge reason to
buy this phone by itself now in terms of
media creation though this camera is a
pretty big deal and the camera on the
HTC One is actually not bad it's not bad
at all now I did a video explaining the
whole ultra pixel deal so I'll leave
that link right below the like button on
this video if you want to check that out
but basically the phone takes decent
pictures and regular light and
outstanding pictures and video in
low-light so if you care about low-light
then this is probably the best phone
camera for you next to the Lumia 920
this problem here is that because this
is only a four megapixel camera not 13
there's not as much detail and when
you're zooming in there's not quite as
much sharpness so HTC decided they're
going to go ahead and add some
sharpening in software to make the
pictures appear as sharp as a 13
megapixel shot this works pretty well
for the most part until you can actually
tell like when something's supposed to
be blurry and out of focus and smooth in
the background the software tries to
sharpen it up and gives it this weird
look otherwise though the camera and the
optics are pretty great and the software
behind it has plenty of neat features
those things like HDR shot and burst
shot and things called HTC Zoe which
basically gives you a few seconds of
video on like command basically really
quickly it's pretty great it's also
worth mentioning that the crop on this
phone is way wider there's a way wider
angle lens on the back and the front so
you can get way more in the shot which
is pretty nice and it's also worth
pointing out that there is tap to focus
and tap to meter so if you're metering
for exposure if you tap a dark area it's
going to blow up the photo and will be
really really light but if you tap a
white area it'll get really really dark
so you have to find the right area of
the photo to tap to get the right
exposure unless you trust the auto
exposure now inside the Beast
running everything is a 1.7 gigahertz
Qualcomm Snapdragon 600 CPU excellent
processor never a doubt this thing
crutches crushes benchmarks just like on
the galaxy
for as we expected but I kind of want to
like to see it matched up to the Galaxy
s4 at 1.9 gigahertz I don't know why
it's just something about me was wishing
they didn't clock it down as much but
then again that's probably going towards
saving battery the fact is this is a
2,300 milliamp hour battery so it's not
quite as big but it lasts as long as the
galaxy s4 is 2600 milliamp hour battery
because of the slightly lower CPU clock
speed the slightly slower ddr2 RAM
instead of ddr3 the slightly smaller
display and a few other things in
software but it lasts me basically a
full day of heavy use from 7 a.m. to
about 8 p.m. no problem but would you
really want to use this phone all day
it's a pleasing experience or not to be
honest yes it definitely is it's much
better than previous HTC phone
experiences the HTC One is running the
newest version of Sense UI called sense
5 on top of Android 4.1.2 jelly bean
will probably see some update to 4.2
pretty soon and this phone is fast I
mean actually take that back I think
quick is the better word it's a really
quick and responsive phone it's very
snappy that's another good word I love
everything about using it I've never
feel any sort of sutter or hiccup or
anything this thing flies through
multitasking performance is great I
never run out of RAM there's two
gigabytes of RAM and it's just an
awesome experience using this phone the
only delay I ever feel is when I
sometimes miss press that capacitive
home button or try to double tap and
accidentally get a single tap and it's
kind of wonky I end up doing this a lot
actually because in Sense UI a double
tap of the home button brings you into
multitasking a single tap of the home
button brings you home and then a long
press of the home button brings you to
Google now so there's a few actions you
kind of have to know with the home
button but after a while you get used to
it
I've also accidentally pressed the HTC
logo by default to try to wake up the
phone that's how long I was using the
Galaxy Note 2 even though the keyboard
though the keyboard is another thing
that is extra snappy I'm finding that
the autocorrect is also phenomenal I
actually think this is probably the best
keyboard 90 smart phone I've ever you so
that's another huge win for HTC this
keyboard is really really good very fast
just for regular typing and it's also
big enough for my pretty big fingers and
then there's also swiping so you can use
this keyboard over the stock android
keyboard I've actually found that I use
it a lot more
speaking of stock Android this is a
double-edged sword there are a couple of
things that are weird really weird about
sense five for me number one is
blinkfeed I don't really use blinkfeed
I guess I could understand why people
would want it it's kind of customizable
so you can add your own sources and
everything so that's nice but I would
like to be able to completely remove it
from my homescreen and not accidentally
see it every time I swipe left number
two is the app drawer and the dock are
one they are the same thing they're part
of the same thing it's really weird so
you know how you get something out of
the dock you should just be able to drag
it out and put it somewhere else right
wrong you just dragged a shortcut out of
the app drawer too because the dock is
part of the app drawer so of course it
duplicates it and replaces it with
another one so that means you can't drag
things from the dock to the home screen
or you can but you'll get another one so
basically what you have to do is go into
the app drawer and then drag it from the
dock up into the app drawer to get rid
of it from the dock it's it's just a
weird process it just takes away it
should have just been the same way stock
Android is to be completely honest the
dock and that should be separate and
then there's another little quirk
changing a wallpaper you would think it
would be just as easy as a long press on
the wallpaper just like stock Android
right wrong you'll just find widgets
there instead you have to change the
wallpaper by going in digging through
the settings and finding the personalise
setting and then picking a wallpaper
from in there so there's a whole bunch
of weird quirks like that about HTC
Sense 5 that HTC can either fix or just
leave it there as a weird quirk
otherwise though using this phone has
been a blast the experience has been
really really nice and like I said it's
quick enough that it makes up for pretty
much all its shortcomings I love how
fast this phone is there's nothing I
would ever take away from the
performance and the speed of this phone
whatever it does whether it's weird or
not it does it fast and I love that
that's probably my favorite thing about
the HTC One so that's basically it as
you can probably tell I am definitely a
fan of this phone and a lot of ways and
a lot of people like to ask the question
you know what is your next daily driver
and to be honest I don't really have a
daily driver I do use different phones
for different things but honestly this
is probably a great choice for a phone
for the next two or three years if you
sign a contract with it I would have no
hesitation recommending this phone
literally anyone that's how good this
hdc1 is so there you go thanks for
