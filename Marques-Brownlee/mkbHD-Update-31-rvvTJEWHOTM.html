appreciate that you guys get my messages
and you know I get the word out so thank
you for helping me reach 2,000
subscribers also something interesting
happen today
and I probably should not have made it
through today because I witnessed a f-1
funnel cloud I was tweeting about it
before I posted some pictures on Twitter
I Twitpic them so I'll be doing a
tutorial on how to send pictures from
your phone which might not be an iPhone
or an iPhone 3G or anything like that
and have a Twitter client and you can
send them straight to Twitter and if you
want to go ahead and follow me on
Twitter and you'll see more cool
pictures like that I got some pretty
awesome pictures of the storm and the
thunderstorm they're pretty sweet
in fact I'll try to throw up a video of
the storm that I took with my phone
unfortunately I didn't get the twister
itself on camera but uh as you can see
it was pretty intense the way it was
hailing we got lightning and we just got
another subscriber
no but seriously guys enjoy your summer
I know I will be too and I have about
one more month left of summer I've
officially decided I'm going to try to
upload a video once every two days and
sometimes once every three days but
basically it's not really a finite
schedule but um it's not gonna be like
three a day or anything like that so
just letting you guys know and one more
part of this update video I might be
giving away a Griffin elevator so follow
me on Twitter for more exclusive updates
about you know when or how I might be
giving that away I'm going to stop
plugging my own Twitter no one wants to
follow me anyway but yes seriously leave
a comment below if you would like to see
a griffon elevator giveaway or some
other giveaway up some product I've
reviewed go ahead and look in my past
videos leave a comment saying what that
I've already reviewed that you would
like me to give away because there's a
lot of things up in here I'm not giving
away my microphone but seriously big
something you know check it out oh one
last thing
another fellow YouTube user by the name
of Pablo Silva I believe that's how I
say he's a member of the mkbhd group

should switch out my intro keep the
music change the music I'll give you
guys a little preview of it right there

comment maybe you think that should be a
good intro possible intro and you know
it's pretty good so up thanks for
