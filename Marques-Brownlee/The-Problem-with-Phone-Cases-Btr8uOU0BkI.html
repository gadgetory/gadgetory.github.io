this is a question I get so often so
when using these phones or tablets or
computers or whatever you gotta have a
case for it right you gotta have some
sort of protection that you need to
worry about so this is me answering that
question this is why I don't use cases
so more and more especially recently
these new flagship phones that are
coming out are focused more and more on
their design specs matter less and less
so we seeing these new phones come out
and no matter what the specs are
quad-core this Ram speed that doesn't
really matter basically every phone at
the top of every manufacturers lineup
performs great so the way to pick which
phone you buy is number one the software
features and number two the design and
the hardware and the feel on the hand so
that's why these manufacturers have
spent hundreds and hundreds of hours of
research and development creating these
meticulously precise designs where every
curve every Edge has a reason the button
placement that build material is the
shape the size everything is considered
and everything has a purpose to make the
phone thinner they make the phone
lighter they push the limits of physics
to fit as big a battery or as many
camera lenses or as big as speakers as
possible into this beautifully designed
phone so when you finally decide which
six or $700 phone you wanna buy you'll
really appreciate these little details
these fine things that they've
considered and you'll hopefully really
appreciate the design but then a case
manufacturer comes along and no offense
to any case manufacturers but they spend
maybe a week to study the dimensions of
this new phone and come up with a piece
of rubber or plastic to put over the top
of your phone to protect it and so you
put this piece of rubber on your phone
and then the beauty is gone like the
meticulous edges the sharp details the
design all the curves everything that
they were trying to impress you with and
the way it feels in the hand is gone the
thinness that they brag about on every
new flagship phone when you put that
piece of rubber on top is now gone but
you want to protect the phone what if
you drop it you gotta have some sort of
protection on the phone for that right
well it turns out the drop tests what I
actually have a case on the phone are
actually at least a little bit useful
because they've shown that basically no
case with a few exceptions basically no
case actually prevents your phone from
getting
when you drop it from any significant
height when you drop your phone on the
screen especially is going to get
damaged
unless it's an otterbox defender so
really the protection and case offers is
against direct impact between your phone
and whatever surface you drop your phone
on so if you drop a metal phone on
concrete you prevent that metal from
getting scratched which is great but so
do skins their skins that you can apply
just like a screen protector it's just
on the back of your phone really are
thick enough at this point to actually
protect your phone the same amount as a
thin rubber case would against the drop
for maybe pocket height they also tend
to improve the feel in the hand worst
case scenario you have the HTC One m8
this is a tall large rounded metal phone
and if you want to touch the top of the
phone and grab that power button with
one hand you inevitably have to do a
little shimmy with your hand and with
those smooth rounded edges that's just
asking to drop your phone eventually so
I added a carbon fiber textured skin to
the back of my phone problem solved
and that's kept the phone's thinness it
hasn't changed the shape of the phone
the only thing that's really changed is
the way it feels in the hand because you
now have that texture so I guess the
only thing after worry about is the
actual visual looks of the phone and
that's not really a problem anymore
because a lot of these skin
manufacturers have tons of different
colors and looks and build materials and
all sorts of things for the most popular
phones out there I also have a skin on
my laptop
it's a decal from decal girl.com don't
judge for the 13-inch retina macbook pro
obviously that's a device you don't
really drop that much but it does
protect it when I pull it in and out of
my bag from any scratching with a zipper
or something and at the end of the day
if I want to sell the laptop or get rid
of it I can just take the skin off and
it leaves the metal underneath perfectly
new so bottom line I really don't use
cases on my laptop or tablet or phone
and that's because I actually care about
the design of it and if you do - it
doesn't really make sense to cover that
up with the piece of rubber or plastic
so I'm gonna encourage the the skin
makers out there the D brands the decal
girls the slick wraps all those guys to
keep making more awesome skins for us to
customize our phones the way they look
and the way they feel in the hand and if
I actually need to protect my phone I'll
put it back in my pocket or get an
otterbox defender I guess had any
further ado I'll code and sign off let
me know what you guys are are you a case
person are you
ask in person or do you carry your phone
naked because I know lots of people like
it naked</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
