another high definition video and today
we're going to be taking a look at
youtube com as there is a been there's
been a recent update in YouTube video
watch page it's not a very major update
but i do feel the need to point this out
to you guys well not the need to point
this out but I'd really like to show you
this because there for the first time I
can really say that all the changes that
have been made are positive which is
really impressive for me to even say
that I usually am NOT you know happy
about every single thing to do but all
the things I've done are really good so
I'm taking a look at is a video I put up
about a week ago so it has significant
activity on it and you can see over the
top of the page really hasn't changes
that much but it's what's underneath the
video that's changed and it's changed
for the better so on the right-hand side
you still have all of your related
videos which is where I like to see them
but what they've had underneath the
video typically you have all the things
spread out the entire width of the video
it's separated them into only being on
the left hand side and having related
videos on the right so now you have your
like button now of course ratings have
been disabled on this video but in
between there you'll be able to see I'll
give you a better example I'll use this
video in between there you'll be able to
see how many likes and how many dislikes
the video has similar to any other
YouTube video so if we hover over that
you can see that we can also do is click
on that and view the videos honors and
insight and things like that so I'll
close that you can also just like you
can before have all these add two
options and sharing options you can
share to buzz you can share to facebook
twitter and if you still use myspace i
hope you get a virus we also have the
embed code and the flag button you'll
notice the view count is actually a lot
bigger than typically is and if the
video is not yours you won't get this
blue button but what I really like is
that every single thing that expands
including the description does not
disrupt the related videos so if you
actually planned on looking at a related
video to the right and you expand you
know you like the video it would
actually have moved down before and you
go ahead and take a look at the
description it would have moved even
further down but what I like is that it
doesn't actually move anything to the
right in the related video section or
suggestions so whenever you go ahead and
leave a comment it would push it down
it's just it would got really cluttered
and you might lose your spot so that's
just something I felt like pointing out
to you guys of the new YouTube video
page there are a couple of hardware
reviews coming in the near future for
mkbhd but I felt like a screencast was a
good breath of fresh air so until next
time this Ben mkbhd with a quick little
screencast for you guys until then until
next time I'll talk to you later bass</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
