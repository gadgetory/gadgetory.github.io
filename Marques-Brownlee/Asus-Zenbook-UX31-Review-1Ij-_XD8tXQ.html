a video taking a look at one of the
slimmest most well-built ultra books
that you can buy right now we're taking
a look at the Asus Zenbook ux301 go
ahead and give a thumbs up on this video
if you enjoy it and without any further
ado let's get right into this one
alright I'm gonna go ahead and start
this off by saying the Zenbook ux301 is
a picture perfect definition of an
ultrabook and in case you didn't already
know I'll include a link in the
description as Zenbook in order to be
called an ultrabook needs to fit a
certain number of qualifications and
this does just that you can see it's
razor thin and it has a nice tapering
design to it from back to front but this
one separates itself from other possibly
tapering laptops
check this out on the right hand side
you have a USB 3.0 port okay 3.0 power
mini VGA and mini HDMI ports and a
battery charging light and on the left
hand side you have another USB port a
headphone jack and a memory card reader
and they can get a good look at that
nice solid tapering design so there's
nothing on the bottom of the laptop and
the battery while it's non removable is
actually pretty good so it wasn't a
problem and the whole laptop is this
nice spun metal finish that's just just
screams slick or something I don't know
it's hot reminds me of the transformer
prime actually how but there's no ports
on the back of this laptop either which
is perfect the way it should be so all
you have is this hinge and I can tell
that Asus spent time designed it
properly put the right parts in the
right places just so that it could do
this oh yeah boss does your laptop do
that I didn't think so okay so once you
open it up you get the keyboard the
trackpad and the screen and this is
where you can make or break it here in a
laptop the keyboard it's alright it's
not the best I've ever used but it's
definitely not the worst there's a
little bit of flex but not much because
it's metal and the size of the keyboard
was fine for even my mammoth size hands
and there's function keys and everything
they work great with Windows the
keyboard is pretty good and the display
was right on I might not be a fan of
glossy on the desk
up but they pulled it off here with a
13.3 inch 1600 by 900 IPS panel the
viewing angles were decent but the
screen actually gets really really
bright which is nice for using it
outdoors and a trackpad uh no it's just
bad I mean it's a it's big and smooth
and has nice hidden buttons and
everything but for some reason mine just
wasn't that sensitive at all it was
really weird I don't know if it was just
mine or maybe too much I maybe I'm a
mouse and keyboard kind of guy but I
feel like if you're getting an ultra
portable laptop you don't really want to
carry around a secondary Mouse you know
so the keyboard and the trackpad should
be really top-notch but this trackpad
let me down it worked ok with windows
gestures but I would have preferred a
more sensitive keyboard and trackpad I
feel like it could use a firmware update
or something so inside the beast we have
Windows 7 home premium and an Intel Core
i5
25:57 M at 1.7 gigahertz so you know
what that means you can do work on this
thing
it's an ultra-low voltage processor so
battery lasts well but performance
doesn't lag behind even a split second
graphics were snappy and it's responsive
to everything I threw at it including
editing a video while plugged in in
power mode but still I'm convinced that
the 128 gig SSD in this laptop had a lot
to do with that also the speakers were
really loud it surprised me it kind of
blew me away actually but I'd like to
see more of the technology they used in
these speakers in more mobile devices I
liked it a lot and all this comes in a
17 millimeter thin package I don't have
to tell you which one's the Ultrabook at
least I hope not peace out guys
