YouTube media here but all critical
stand for my idea to make this video I'm
going to attempt to make my own icon in
PowerPoint and I'll probably use it as
my avatar from now on because mine is
just a picture of me playing golf so we
go and maximize this I'm just going from
the top of my head I don't remember
exactly what he said but I know I'm
supposed to delete these I'm going to do
is information shape and here's a
relatively looking Hey alright that was
ok mmm Internet Oh whoo and hold down
shift in order to make it a perfect
circle so go ahead and I was going to be
big cuz I'm cool
psyche hey I'm right click it and go to
fly shape and this is where I will
create my um rock created so I'm going
to hit gradient fill and I'll dress off
to the side so you can see it better
first of all good gradient fill just
looks cool like that you can change
whatever angle it just it just gives it
a certain appearance that's cool um
that's just fulfill and let's go ahead
and choose a color my favorite that's
not pretty the let's see what colors go
that does funny thing no now I'm in line
color I know three to do something with
shadow before all right well we're gonna
I'm going to add a shadow make it pop
out and make the size of it a little
bigger that's huge that's a decent size
shadow blur it a lot because that that
makes it look like a shadow how many
grams am I getting right it's acceptable
um so now we're going to I want to put a
text box on right this will you know
it'll be my initials say m'kay be right
so whoa I'm going it close I'm going to
insert a text box
just there and I'm going to type m'kay
be very very simple right sike I'm going
to format right-click it and format so
now we're in the text box I want it to
be let's just leave it horizontal leave
it in the middle right now and it has to
be bigger as we know so let's change the
font uh I think word art has something
to do with this if I find like a little
design with a new word art where can I
do word art here we go yeah that'll
stand out right there we go so let's
delete this good and dragged it to the
middle of course the font it's not big
enough for us so we're going to make it
humongous no that's not big enough it's
not quite big enough to fit our circle
so we're going to shut that down bit and
save that that's a pretty blue image
right there that's going to be my I
guess my avatar if I can figure out how
to do that so I'm gonna save it well
first actually give me a second I'm
going to come back to you and try to
figure out how I'm going to save this as
a PNG or a bitmap so I'll be right back
alright I'm back and here's how I'm
going to add a backing to this to the
actual circle so I'm going to insert a
new shape and this one's going to be a
rectangle and I'm going to just drag it
down to a good size looks good to me and
I'm going to format
and send it to the back so that this
shape is in the back and the shape is in
the front center everything sure nothing
looked at so here's the entire icon it's
not perfect but it's amateurish my fill
color it would be cool to have it a
little well that's a little dull isn't
it how about this nope that was cool
this one that's decent but it's not dark
enough so shape fill make a little
darker nuts that's kind of monotonous
shape fill will be a shade oh great
because that's just cool also also if
you want to format this shape you can do
so just by right-clicking it again and
cooking format shape
I'll choose gradient fill again and a
lot of preset colors but where's well
Moss all right whatever line color line
colors just basically this outside color
you see here not a big deal it'll be a
solid red line whatever line style make
a little thicker and give it a shadow
this is important to make it stick out
for me so I'm going to put a the same
shadow right here under the circle so
I'm going to make this one under the
civil as well under square as well give
it a little more size a little more blur
and there's my icon I think I'm good
with the 3d format I could change it if
I really wanted make stick you know out
vertically towards whoever's doing it
but that's that looks good right now now
to bring this to bring this into paint
we're going to have this selected and
we're going to hit our Print Screen
button on keyboard which I just
um hopefully it will work I'm going to
open up paint a second there's paint
sorry thought of it off it has a
tendency to do that I'm going to go to
paste my image there it is so what I
want to do now is I believe I want to to
crop this pitch out this image needs to
be high this one by itself to do this so
I'm going to do is go image crop I'm
going to drag hopefully now I'm going to
drag this crop that right there it then
I'm going to select all and I'm going to
crop that see if this works
crop it vertically yeah I can grab it
somehow
sorry I'll come back when I'm done
crapping this
you
all right I finished cropping my image
so I'm going to do is edit now I'm going
to file and save this image I'm good as
my icon in my pictures and exits out
exit this I don't need it anymore I'm
going to go to my YouTube page I can set
this I'm going to click on my name and
I'm going to find my settings
hopefully let's see hold on second to do
this go to more and hit the Change
button and I'm going to choose a file
from my pictures folder here it is open
and it's uploading that image so I'll
hit Save Changes wait wait for it
it will save your changes and that is
how you create that as your image for
you to subscribe thanks for watching
