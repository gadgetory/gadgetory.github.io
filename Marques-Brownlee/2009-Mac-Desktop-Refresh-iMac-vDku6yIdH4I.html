tutorial and in this video this is the
second part of this video series this HD
video series go ahead and watch this in
HD we're going to be going over the new
iMac so this is a 2009 second video
about the new Mac refresh of desktops
here so go ahead and open up an internet
browser and we're going to look I'm
going to maximize this for you go to WWF
will calm slash Mac okay if you just go
to apple.com and hit the max tab you'll
get right to it
and what I'm going over today is the
iMac so first of all you click on the
iMac button like I just showed you the
iMac basically what Apple is putting
this at ass is the ultimate all-in-one
desktop this is for the consumer the
average user the Mac Mini is a little
gear down a little bit but I love I
think the iMac is my favorite Mac you
don't have a Mac Pro I like that I'm add
quite a bit so they're showing in here
of course the 24 inch model with a tiny
little keyboard on it to the keyboard in
a second now they have a lot of new
features first of all it comes in the 20
inch and the 24 inch the 24 inch is
gorgeous by the way
second they're telling us they have
ultra fast Nvidia graphics and I told
you about that in the Mac Mini they're
using the new Nvidia graphics chip and
I'm actually going to click on the new
Nvidia graphics chip just to show you
guys a performance shred if I can find
it here we go we're going to show you
guys this first game here the NVIDIA
GeForce this is the lowest in graphics
card that they offer and you can see
there's quite a bit of performance
increases using this low-end graphics
card in the 20 inch iMac but if I go all
the way up to the 24 inch iMac the
highest-end ATI Radeon HD
look at the six times the performance
increase so that's that's a pretty good
a pretty good graphics increase plus you
get that gorgeous 24 inch screen and I
think you guys are going to like that
also you get up to 8 gigabytes of ddr3
RAM which is what I have on my laptop
which was hard to find but so it's
really slim as you can see on the right
hand side you get that beautiful screen
you get a terabyte of memory
if you so choose and actually I'm going
to go up to the top here and hit by now
because then we get the exact prices and
what you get for the price so this is
the cheapest iMac that you can get the
20-inch 2.66 gigahertz intel core2duo
and for the twelve hundred dollars you
get a you get two gigs of ddr3 ram which
is alright for a desktop again it's an
all-in-one so you're not taking it
anywhere but it's pretty cool you get a
320 GB hard drive which is nice and you
get an nvidia geforce 9400m which is the
lowest end that you can get in the Mac
in the iMac and if I just selected
there's pretty much no options to go any
lower than that for that price range so
then stop and then we have the 24 inch
there's three versions of the 24 inch
you can get ranging from 1500 to 2200
which is decent again for desktop is
pretty good price for an all-in-one like
the iMac
we're running leopard here so what we're
gonna get is anywhere from four gigs to
eight gigs of ram in fact I'll customize
one here for you
with all the highest end specs so this
is the kind of PC a lot of people will
be looking into the the middle and iMac
but here we go I'm gonna add to get four
gigs of ddr3 RAM which is a thousand 66
gigahertz Ram you get it's a thousand
dollars extra so right up here at the
top you can see it it's gonna be three
thousand two hundred dollars now if we
do want that ATI Radeon HD that's 50
bucks the wireless Mighty Mouse is a
twenty dollar add-on to the wired Mighty
Mouse okay you get the keyboard and
again the back will keyboard the desktop
model still doesn't have a number of
head so you're gonna get like the kind
that you get on a laptop you're gonna be
a little bit cramped but a lot of people
again like that they love that Apple
keyboard so I'm not going to go too into
that of course I work on nine you can
get our life oh nine etc and the
processor that you're getting in this
one for three thousand two hundred
seventy dollars is the 3.06 gigahertz
Intel Core 2 Duo so that's pretty darn
fast so I'm going to go back to the Mac
tab and go back under the iMac overview
again
and obviously the 24 inch screen is
going to be really beautiful
there's a lot of new features they say
more display for less so it's just
fifteen hundred bucks for the lowest and
24 inch iMac so a lot of people are
going to go for that that low-end 24
inch iMac and now I'll
they're gonna tell you on every new iMac
you get iLife oh nine and you can get I
work oh nine and OS ten leopard so those
are the three things you'll get it all
integrated so you get all that kind of
editing software integrated when you buy
it in an iMac so if we scroll down a
little bit here also obviously boot camp
if you do you feel like running Windows
Vista or Windows 7 which I can't wait
for Windows 7 here's the office all the
new features and iLife oh nine I'll go
over that too you know I can't I'm not
screencasting from the Mac Pro yet I'm
screencasting I'm broadcasting really
from the PC for now but I'll get I'll
get ScreenFlow and I'll start uploading
that goes 10 videos so stay tuned for
that so you can see all these things get
yet get even more from your Mac so
obviously you can use bootcamp on your
iMac you can get pretty decent speeds
with that 3.06 you hear its processor
and if you really want to go into the
tech specs there's actually built in
wireless and as you can see at the
bottom here's the resolution 1920 by
1200 so pretty good specs if you have
any other questions about the iMac or a
computer in general I do tons of reviews
on them so just give me a shout out give
me a yeah subscribe to my channel and
send me a message and I'll do a request
video again this is number 2 in the
video series and I hope you enjoyed this
one and watch the rest of the post if
you feel like it if I put it up yet and
that's basically it so thanks for
watching this one and stay tuned for
more and hope you liked it enjoy peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
