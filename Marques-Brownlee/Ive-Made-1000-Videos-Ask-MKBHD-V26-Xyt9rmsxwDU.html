and welcome to ask mkbhd number 26 still
doing one every month so this is the one
from March 2018 and for those of you
who've been paying attention is a bit of
a special upload or episode this is the
thousandth video I've ever uploaded to
this channel if you include the live
streams and things has ever done this is
number 1000 we've ever posted and it's
coming also around the time of the ten
year anniversary of the day I signed up
for YouTube so a thousand videos in 10
years it seems like it's been a lot
faster than a decade but that's where
we're at so I asked you guys for
questions on Twitter you had plenty I
kind of asked about like if you had
questions about the last 10 years of
videos but most of you just ignore that
so we'll just get right into what you
did ask so first up is what do you feel
you've improved on most and least over a
thousand videos I can say noise control
not improved noise control so I know
I've improved efficiency than most like
I've gotten better at editing videos at
shooting at the whole organization
process of putting a video together so
if he give me a day with all this
equipment in 2009 versus a day with this
equipment now it the video I'd make
today would be way better just because
I'm faster at editing and better at all
this stuff
improved the least is aa taupe like that
would imply like I have done this well
from the start so I don't really know if
I can think of anything the thing that
comes to mind that's changed at least is
probably my language I keep I've said
dope and crispy and words like that from
the beginning so maybe that's something
that's improved the least at what age
did you upload your first video and what
did your parents say about it so hi mom
dad if you're watching I was 14 in 2009
when I uploaded the first tech videos
just you know got a laptop for high
school started making that stuff I
didn't tell my parents for a while so I
was just kind of uploading these things
like making videos in my room under the
radar putting them on the Internet
probably not the best idea as a little
kid but it's gone a long way since then
and it's a little easier but when I did
find out they were just kind of like
alright
this isn't the worst thing our kid could
be doing in his spare time so I guess
keep it up and they've been very
supportive since then so thanks how many
minutes people watch how many minutes of
people watched your most popular video
and total minutes of all videos so
actually an interesting fact is the most
popular video or most viewed video on
the channel is a different video than it
used to be it's the iPhone 10 unboxing
it used to be a different iPhone video
as a matter of fact probably 7 out of
the top 10 most viewed videos on this
channel are not just Apple videos or
iPhone videos but it just it's past 10
million views and that has turned into
32 million three hundred seventy four
thousand two hundred fifty-five minutes
watched of me taking an iPhone 10 out of
the box mark the saying says if I beat
you at rocket League can you upload a 21
by nine video in 24p okay a lot of
little nuggets in there so number one
okay mark if you're challenging me to
rocket League I'm assuming coming out of
the woodwork you're probably pretty good
so we should probably come out with some
sort of prize if I beat you also and
then of course like uploading a 21 by
nine video we've talked about like
shrinking aspect ratios to two to one
which is a little less drastic but I
think is a change you can reasonably
make in 2018 but 21 by 9 is a bit more
extreme and more interesting and more
drastic of a change for one video
wouldn't be crazy
but I could see uploading two to one
videos in the near future
most of the screens in our lives like
these these monitors and TVs and
desktops and laptops even are mostly
still sixteen by nine so it makes sense
to keep uploading sixteen by nine but
obviously our phones are changing that
and there's a lot of two to one aspect
ratios a lot of super wides people like
super wide desktops now so it's
interesting considering maybe uploading
two to one videos in the future let me
know what you guys think about that but
then also 24fps I've just never been a
24fps kind of guy what is gonna be your
next big step up in the filming game
possibly robots that will mean more when
you see the next video but stay tuned
for that this is the year cp3 is finally
going to get a championship it sure
looks like it and if you look back at an
older Q&amp;amp;A video from a couple months ago
like the preseason before the NBA season
started I was wearing a Houston Rockets
hoodie and I dropped cp3 as my favorite
player on the Houston Rockets and why I
follow that team and since then they've
been the best record in the conference
they have won 31 out of their last 33
games and they look like they're gonna
be a 1 seed and hold home court and
probably beat the Warriors not saying I
caused that but clearly some good vibes
there why is the Nokia 3310 the greatest
phone of all time sent from a Nokia 3310
all right Austin can you tweet from a
Nokia 3310 Perillo this phone is the go
of course I have one this phone is a
goat the same way that Tiger Woods
Michael Jordan they just can't you don't
really even think about it you just kind
of know that this is the best it's ever
been but then it gets kind of weird when
they like come back out of retirement
and they're not the same as they used to
be so you just kind of pay more
attention to the way what this is this
is obviously the greatest phone of all
time coma code wants to know about the
red hydrogen one status I am not
authorized to update you on that status
right now I'm not authorized all right
here's one from the subreddit is do you
regret making any of your videos which
ones and why so generally not really no
there's a couple instances though that
come to mind one of them was a couple
years ago in the college days so you
guys have generally been pretty positive
about you know showcasing you know
working with different brands in the
studio and in videos but before any of
that we actually made a GoPro video this
is just me as a college kid with a GoPro
trying to figure out what to do with it
and we put it on a dog and did a video
of like a day in the life of a dog so
that dog was Mac and he may remember him
from that video I'll link it below if
you haven't seen it he's really into
guarding the door but we had a little
ending of that video which was just the
you know the shot on GoPro animation
that you usually see at the end of GoPro
videos I thought it would be cool to add
that to the end of our video with Mac
now I didn't work with GoPro on that
video or anything it just felt like a
natural way to end that video and the
comments on that video
tore it apart cuz they all thought all
you got sponsored but you didn't say it
was sponsored but then you made this ad
for GoPro obviously now I get it it
looks like an ad when you end the video
the way all the ads end but uh I guess I
regret adding that animation we're
always very transparent about working
with brands though so and I want to be
even more obvious about it in the future
the way we should so you'll always know
like I've always added it to the
description when a device was provided
by the people who make it so that kind
of thing is always gonna be there but
yeah that's something that comes to mind
all right another tweet what was the
most enjoyable video you have ever
created which is it's pretty general but
that actually got me thinking about the
least enjoyable shooting conditions I've
ever had to deal with in making a tech
video now I'm not like a action
photographer like running through the
wilderness
I'm not Devin Supertramp it doesn't
happen very often that we get difficult
shooting conditions but as you can
probably tell I'm also pretty obsessed
with making videos look good and tech
events and other youtubers can probably
attest to this tech events especially
new smartphone launches generally have
the worst lighting the worst shooting
conditions imaginable I'm talking like
purple green lighting like spot lights
everywhere harsh lighting shadows floors
that move when you try to put a tripod
on them like really annoying difficult
to make videos in conditions now I'm not
even naming names there but I think like
if you ask any other tech youtuber
they'll probably have that same
experience at some point but apples
always seem to be ideal like there
haven't been youtubers at Apple events
until pretty recently but it's pretty
obvious when you go to one that they
think about the photographers and the
news channels and the videographers I go
there and now also the youtubers and the
one that comes to mind when I'm talking
about this is the iPhone 8 launch which
we shot that in a room where they
brought all the press back there but it
was literally lit like the entire
ceiling was just soft boxes just huge
white beautifully soft soft boxes and
everything we shot in there was
effortlessly like no reflections
well-lit beautiful eye that's the kind
of thing I hope for when I go to a tech
event but it almost never happens
have you thought about making a second
channel this is a thing that definitely
comes up in the careers of a lot of
youtubers second channels vlog channels
behind the scenes separate channels
podcast channels I've obviously put
everything that I make on this channel
which is where have idios but I haven't
really had a need to yet it might come
up it might be a future thing but I
haven't really needed a second channel
at this point I like this one who is
your biggest inspiration for your videos
or your work I think you probably were
expecting me to say like a couple of
youtubers names this may be gonna sound
dumb but apples videography here we go
sounding like an Apple fanboy in this
video but Apple videos their commercials
their launch event videos are incredible
now it's clearly it's made by teams of
people it's made over a long period of
time and they have like time with the
products it's clearly composition of
both real footage and renders so there's
a lot of impossible shots in those
videos that I could never get but every
time I watch an Apple video or an Apple
commercial or if you just go on our
YouTube channel and just observe the
sound design and the lighting and the
editing in those videos that's the kind
of stuff I hope to be able to live up to
someday also fun fact apparently Apple
shoots all their commercials in 30fps so
there's that also you've probably
noticed we've started getting a little
bit back into interviews generally
lately having Neil deGrasse Tyson on the
channel as a guest which has made me
appreciate interviews more generally and
people who do really good interviews
like oh hey a youtuber Sean Evans on
first we feast on hot ones really good
interviews really really good interviews
and then what does what does the case
stand for hashtag thousand video special
decay and mkbhd I think we'll save for
another milestone how about that we'll
leave it at that so that's been it thank
you guys for watching thanks to those of
you who have stuck around for a decade a
thousand videos a ridiculously long time
and supported the channel and share the
videos up to this point and hopefully we
keep improving all of the things that
are in the video
to the point where you'll want to keep
watching him until the next one thanks
for watching talk to you guys later
