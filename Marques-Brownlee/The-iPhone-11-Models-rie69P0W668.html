that time of year again so for those who
don't know all the smartphone's were
about to see for the second half of this
year
you know Galaxy Note 10.1 m are pretty
much done behind the scenes already and
one of the most consistent cycles and
press is the dimensionally accurate
dummies that come out for the iPhone
case makers to make their cases for the
new iPhone so we have hands on of these
dummies shoutout to Sonny Dixon and for
2019 we will again have three new
iPhones iPhone 11 iPhone 11 Macs and
iPhone 11 are I guess we're technically
not a hundred percent sure that's what
their names will be they could stick
with Roman numerals iPhone X I seems
like they probably won't do that so yeah
I'll just call it iPhone 11 and so the
main major change that we've all been
seeing in these renders for months now
is this new camera bump on the back this
new tile looking Apple watch looking
alien eye bug looking camera bump and I
got to say I have very mixed feelings
about it see on one hand I love that
we're getting a meaningful upgrade to
the camera on the iPhone it looks like
that's gonna be the biggest change to
the new iPhone and so triple cameras is
the wave you have your standard your
telephoto and your ultra wide and that's
fun that's what we've been expecting to
see for a while and I'm crossing my
fingers that that ultra wide is just as
good of quality in photos and videos as
the other two imagine ultra wide 4k from
an iPhone as a video camera like I love
the mini trend of adding an ultra wide
camera to these flagships and the rumor
that the pixel 4 won't have an ultra
wide camera makes me sad so I'm a fan of
the focus on the camera pun intended but
I am NOT a fan of the way this looks
like this rounded square thing it's
gonna look awkward on the pixel for it
already looks kind of awkward on the
huawei mate 20 Pro but at least it's
smaller and centered which actually
seems to make a pretty good difference
and making it less jarring and less
alien-like and
but yeah it's gonna look kind of awkward
on this iPhone and it's bigger also not
sure if they keep the color of the phone
back in the camera bump or if they just
make it all black I've seen renders do
it both ways this one's by Vania Gaskin
I kind of like it a little bit less than
having it all black right now Apple does
all black in the cameras but either way
it just looks kind of chunky and also
still having a camera bump not making it
flush I've said this before you can make
the phone a little thicker and have no
bump and that would be cool with me I
remember the days of the iPhone 5s not
having a camera bump but this still has
a bump I guess I just don't really know
if I buy that this is the best design
for a new iPhone 11 that they could come
up with like we know they usually have
the tick-tock strategy 6 and 6s look the
same then new design for 7 and 7s and 10
and 10's so I was thinking about this
potential new sort of boxy modern design
like the iPad pro for the iPhone 11 and
we even know tons of people are gonna be
waiting for this new iPhone but it kind
of seems like they just mailed it in
it's just the same design with the new
camera I don't know it makes me wonder
when we're gonna start to see iPhones
not designed by Johnny I've anyway just
just to stop ranting about the new
design for a second what else can we
expect from these three new iPhones well
it's looking like we'll have the same
screen sizes for the iPhone 11 and
iPhone 11 max you know still 5.8 inch
and 6.5 inch still OLED the front facing
camera suite is also expected to be
similar likely new sensors for improved
and faster face ID but still one selfie
camera still a notch
still the same kind of huge notch in the
world where almost everyone is rapidly
getting rid of theirs and then the signs
are strong that they will actually be
getting rid of 3d touch so if you
remember the pressure-sensitive
depresses and force touches to me this
is fine this isn't something I used all
the time other than maybe lock screen
flashlights and camera shortcuts but you
can get them with a long press anyway so
I'm not super bummed about that I just
wish it made it cheaper anyway we should
get a new spec bump of course so the new
chips alongside iOS 13 but aside from
that still lightning again still
asymmetrical speakers at the bottom no
USB type-c thanks Apple and overall just
the rest of the design is pretty
much the same as the 10 and 10's same
shapes same rails same chamfer same or
very similar colors you know that's the
whole deal and then with the iPhone 11
our it'll be interesting to see what
they do with the display and the cameras
the display just because that was
basically the biggest complaint a lot of
people like me had with this iPhone
having a low pixel density and not the
greatest display even though it turned
out to be not a huge deal for most
people and they end up buying it anyway
but you know fingers crossed maybe
they'll improve that a bit and then of
course the iPhone 10 are had a single
camera in a world of dual cameras it
looks like this iPhone 11 R is also
going to have one less camera than its
brothers so if you look closely at these
models you'll notice the flash is in a
very different place on the 11 are where
the third camera would be and so sure
enough there's only two cameras on that
budget iPhone where there's three on the
flagships and I am hoping that means
it's going to be a standard and an
ultra-wide I kind of think apples gonna
end up doing that because you can still
do portrait mode without the telephoto
and they got rid of the telephoto for
the 10r so I think the 11 R will be
standard and ultra wide I hope then as
far as extras like reverse wireless
charging can't really tell from the
renders I mean they're still gonna have
the glass backs most likely but we don't
know about that so yeah no USB type-c
the battery may be marginally larger a
little bit not hugely no hundred twenty
Hertz display is expected anyway finger
per meter under the glass also not
expected if they stick with face ID like
they're supposed to just overall a
pretty underwhelming update this really
seems like the first time they're not
doing a major design shift after the S
version of the iPhone we go from 10s to
11 and it's looking very similar usually
for these videos looking at the models
we would go super hard with After
Effects magic so you could get a better
idea of what it would look like on a
working phone if you're holding it in
your hand but the differences are so
minimal you almost can't tell it looks
just like an iPhone 10 or 10s like just
from looking at this piece what this
model is telling me is the camera is
going to be the biggest upgrade on the
new iPhone it'll be interesting to see
how they sell that and they'll probably
go super hard about it onstage to
justify this but if you're one of those
people who is you know pretty opportune
to upgrade every single year with the
new iPhone based on having new features
that is pretty much the only new feature
to look forward to as far as we know but
yeah that's been it I'm kind of curious
would you skip this new iPhone I know a
lot of people you break a phone you kind
of need a new phone and you just gotta
wait till September and then this comes
out and you get it but would you skip
this new iPhone let me know in the
comments section below I'm curious
either way thanks for watching catch you
guys the next one pace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
