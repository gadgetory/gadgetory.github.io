this is Google Babel explained hey
what's up guys I'm QB HD here and let's
say I get a Google Talk message on my
phone my android phone as I'm walking
into my apartment I answer the message
and I start having a conversation with
this person and then I put my phone down
and I'm done with the conversation and
then I open up my tablet and I have a
new notification an unread message but I
already read that message it's already
completed the conversation on my phone
that's fine I swipe to clear that
message but then I go back to my
computer and I have a gmail tab open and
I have another unread notification from
Google Talk of the same completed
conversation that is just one of the
problems Google has with their messaging
platform it's a real problem right now
is that Google has multiple chat
services multiple messaging and instant
messaging services and that's the real
problem is because they don't talk to
each other their notifications don't
sync you can read a conversation on one
and you have to pick every single time
you want to chat with someone how you
want to communicate with them do you
want to use Google Talk do you want to
use a Google Voice do you want to use
Google+ Messenger do you want to use
Gmail what do you want to use you want
to use a Google+ Hangout how do you
communicate with this person it's a bit
of a mess right now
so babble is the expected service that
Google will use to essentially brand
these all into one social messaging
platform that basically replaces all the
ones that currently exist it's a pretty
smart idea it may seem like a minor
thing but I'm expecting this to be a
pretty solid thing pretty big chunk of
what Google talks about at Google i/o
this year in 2013 so what's that well
gonna be like what are the features
going to be like well the number one
expected feature is it's going to have a
unified user interface across every
single platform so it's kind of a mess
already right now for example with
Google Talk you notice the way it looks
on the desktop you use a Google Talk
conversation in Google Plus it'll have a
direct link to a hangout and it'll have
a bunch of different Google+ related
things but if you use it in a Gmail tab
it looks different from that and if you
use it on your Android phone it looks
even different from that and also knows
Google+ Messenger is totally separate
randomly inside of the Google+ app
tucked away in there doesn't talk to any
other services for some reason so they
all look different and they all don't
talk to each other so Google babble
along with unifying all the different
messaging services into one core service
it'll all look the same so you know it's
the same service number two is that
everything is expected to sync and talk
to each other so babble on every single
platform will notify itself and if you
pick up a conversation on your tablet
the notification will disappear from
every other device that you own that has
Babylon number three expect video chat
expect Google+ Hangouts to be very
tightly integrated and expect your whole
Google+ account to be very tightly
integrated into the service after all it
is Google making it and Google already
has a pretty good idea of how to build
and integrate things with each other
that it already controls so expect
Google+ Hangouts expect a button inside
of Babel to directly take you to a video
chat that will end up being a Google+
Hangout in fact it might even be called
Google+ Babel but I wouldn't put money
on that but it again expect the chat
hangout feature to be there and lastly
number four expect a bunch of little
improvements for example in the clients
we use today like Google Talk and
Google+ messenger there are a bunch of
little hiccups and quirks with for
example group messaging so expect some
improvements there there is also said to
be more than 800 emojis and emoticons so
sources close to it are pretty confident
this is going to be a pretty well built
system and also things like sending
pictures and maybe videos and small
files the way you can with Skype now so
it's really taking on the bulk of all
the different services we have today all
at once now Babel will be most
successful and be able to separate
itself from other services similar to
this which I'll get to in a second if
it's available everywhere and Google's
pretty good at that right now it kind of
covers all its bases even though they
don't overlap but if Babel is available
everywhere we can expect to see it right
off the bat in iOS on Android with a
chrome app with a Windows app with an OS
10 app and with a web app and that way
it'll pretty much cover the majority of
people who are going to be using the
service there's no talk really about a
BlackBerry OS or Windows Phone app yet
but hey you never know if that could be
a priority later now Google's not blind
to the competition what is the
difference between this and I message
because I messages basically apples
equivalent of this well the main
difference is its availability right now
I can't use iMessage if I don't have a
Mac or some sort of iOS device so if you
have an iPad or an iPhone or
Mac you can use iMessage and talk to
your other friends who have those same
devices but there's no web client so
your Windows buddies won't be able to
talk to you on iMessage and it kind of
talks to your SMS as well so that's nice
if you have an iPhone but the idea of
babble is to be able to use it
everywhere on every single device even
if you have a Windows Phone you can go
and log into your browser and continue
conversations there the same way you'd
be able to with Gmail so overall Babel
may seem like a minor thing at first but
I've gotten so many questions about it
that it's turned out to be a pretty
major thing in my mind as we approach
when can we expect to see it I would
expect to see it alongside the next or
latest version of Android keelon pie at
Google i/o this year so just a couple of
weeks away from that and expect it it's
pretty much imminent now the almost the
name is basically confirmed we've seen
leaked screenshots of the user interface
and little dialog boxes that have been
popping up on people's screens by
accidents so it's pretty much confirmed
that it's gonna be called Babel bab-ee
el so if you guys are wondering it's
just around the corner and we should be
seeing it sometime very soon so that's
it just a quick video talking about
Google Babel again if you like videos
like this definitely be sure to hit that
like button below and the subscribe
button if you want to see more and
hopefully we'll get some pretty awesome
videos coming this week and next there
are some awesome awesome videos coming
up I can just tell you that guarantee it
either way thanks for watching and I'll
talk to you guys in the next one
pace and view on bonus points Google
through our chat hits in there</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
