colors are pretty important to us right
but when it comes to our devices for the
most part they really don't come in that
many colors maybe one two or three
colors at the most one every Apple
laptop in the world is silver the same
color every Apple keyboard in the world
is silver every trackpad every Magic
Mouse in the world they're all the same
color silver so the company color where
is doing something about this colorizing
your devices but not just with a skin
that you can put on and then peel off
this is kind of taking it to the next
level
this is a color where custom MacBook Pro
I picked all the colors as you can see
here you probably guess that and cover
where has this design studio kind of
like moto maker but for a ton of
different gadgets they have headphones
mice keyboards laptops tablets phones
all kinds of stuff and if you've already
bought one of these devices you can pay
to have a colored and send it in and
I'll get painting or you can pay for a
brand new one to get that paint
treatment but yeah this is legitimately
painted in your color of choice not just
a skin so here's what I punched in on
the design studio on color website
pretty simple everything matte black but
with a cherry red hinge for an accent
and as it's arrived here it looks
exactly like that
everything matte black with that
beautiful cherry red hinge I think
that's a sick accent color you guys
already knew I liked red on black now
there are some parts here that are still
silver like the inside of the MagSafe
charger and the headphone jack and the
SD card reader stuff like that didn't
get painted which is smart because they
wouldn't work if they were covered in
paint and that's because of their super
detailed deconstruction and painting
process
so with this MacBook Pro for example
when you send it into color where they
actually completely take it apart they
look at the colors on your order and
then paint and coat each of the parts
individually before then putting
everything back together again
they actually reconstruct the MacBook in
their studio the only thing you see here
on my custom MacBook that you can't get
in the color or design studio is the
custom mkbhd logo on the back this is an
additional option they have usually for
like companies who want to bring a
branded laptop for presentations or
something like that it's called the
custom logo replacement and actually
disassemble behind the display where
Apple has the Apple logo cut out and
they will machine cut a custom logo or
text of your choice and you can even
work with our engineers to get the
backlight to work if you still want it
to glow when it turns on I did and sure
enough when you turn this laptop on it
glows I think this looks absolutely
ridiculously insanely good and I think
it's safe to say this is a legit mkbhd
Edition MacBook after the surgery so
when you get your laptop back everything
else in the packaging is the same as a
regular MacBook you get the same
accessories and everything plus an added
info sticker from
aware and everything works the exact
same way it's still the MacBook Pro that
you paid for I'm basically in love with
this now so the one thing that remains
to be seen is how durable this kind of
stuff will be it's obviously painted on
so it's permanent not like a temporary
sticker that's part of the reason I
didn't go with like a Ferrari red bright
painted laptop because you know that's
really cool after like a week but it's
permanent so a week later you have to go
to class to take notes and you're like
oh god I have a bright red laptop so I
did go with a more classy
I think understated more tuxedo black
look and design but again the durability
is what's going to matter here because
if you scratch a silver Apple laptop
there's more silver underneath no big
deal but if you scratch this black
painted Apple laptop how many layers of
black are there before you get the
silver again and you can really see the
damage and how bad does that look
obviously the logo reconstruction is
something very unique and from me
looking at the materials that the logos
made of it looks pretty solid and it
doesn't look like it's going to break
anytime soon or fall apart
it's really precisely cut and it matches
exactly the logo that I provided for
them so it's really cool but again it's
gonna be interesting to see how long
this kind of paint lasts and whether or
not it scratches easily also for those
of you wondering about color wear as a
company I first found them when looking
for a black version of the Apple
keyboard as oddly specific as that is
and after I got it from color where I it
was you know it naturally showed up in
the background of videos that showed up
in a setup tour project
so people kept asking about it so I
reached out to them and we did this
custom MacBook Pro project I think it
turned out pretty well they also do a
ton of other custom devices like I
mentioned ranging from the Magic
Trackpad or the Magic Mouse customized
to Beats headphones those are the least
expensive of the customs ranging to you
know a complete custom computer which
they have to disassemble and paint and
reassemble so that's a much more
expensive process and you'll see that
difference on their site and then the
top of the line you know custom logo
replacement which is literally machine
cutting the logo you provide for them
into the metal and backlighting it which
is an engineering feat in itself
but you know you get to work one-on-one
with their engineers their artists their
designers and that ends up looking
pretty badass there you go guys thumbs
up for mkbhd Edition and MacBook
for I think it looks pretty sweet also
if you guys go to the cover website and
you customize something like looks
pretty sweet also take a screenshot of
it tweet it at me and I'll probably
retweet a couple of my favorites either
way thank you for watching and I'll talk
to you guys in the next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
