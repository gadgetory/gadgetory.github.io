another video in the fastest Matt
committee on the face of the planet
earth video series yeah so if you
appreciate this video series or if you
like it go ahead and give a thumbs up on
this video it really does help us out
and it'll get this next episode of
rolling out pretty quick either way this
is going to be one of the shorter videos
in this series as it's a pretty simple
upgrade but today we're going to be
upgrading the 2011 Mac minis random
access memory yeah so let's go ahead and
get started with this one so for this
particular upgrade there are no
screwdrivers or any sort of tools needed
just the Mac Mini and the 16 gigabytes
of ddr3 RAM which can be found at that
link in the description and possibly a
supervisor to help us out this Ram here
is 1333 megahertz Ram the fastest that
this Mac minis motherboard can handle
and we got it from other World Computing
as you can see here by the way if you're
wondering about the total cost or prices
of this build
we'll have that covered in a sort of
conclusive video later but on with the
RAM unboxing which was super duper easy
I actually did need a tool for this but
you just open it and bam there's the RAM
that right you can take the mini flip it
over and find where the dots line up
that hold the back on and you can twist
it off and have all the access to the
internal same as before and the RAM
happens to be right on top so it's super
easiest for us here and makes it easier
than the SSD install we did earlier
basically we can unseat both of the
pre-installed two gigabyte RAM chips
just by pulling the metal brackets apart
and popping the dims up where they can
be slid out and you can take both of
them out leaving the slots empty and
then installing a brand new Ram is
equally simple just make sure you seat
the RAM first by slipping it into place
and then pushing it down until it clicks
and do that with both of your dims and
that's it the RAM is installed so you
can put the back cover back on the mini
and boot back into Lion once you boot it
back up if all goes well you should be
able to go straight into OS 10 and hit
that Apple logo in the menu bar and
click about this Mac where you can
confirm that your memory total is now 16
gigabytes and if you want further proof
that both of your 8 gigabyte DIMMs are
working just click more info under
memory you'll have a handy dandy little
diagram for you so there you go your 13
three through megahertz random access
memory is now in full operation boom
thanks for watching this video and in
the next part we'll really see what this
machine can do so leave a thumbs up if
you want to see it sooner
either way see you next time guys
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
