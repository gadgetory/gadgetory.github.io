plug so the merch store is actually back
open right now and this is the run you
got to get in on if you want to get your
stuff shipped in time for the holidays
for getting stuff for friends family
that kind of thing and there's actually
some new items there's some long sleeves
since it's getting cold there's some
stickers got a little bit of a Black
Friday surprising coming for you too so
definitely stay tuned for that it's
going to be Jones
so today we got a few headphones in
front of me and they're all wireless
headphones so he probably heard me at
some point in the past year of videos
say smartphones losing a headphone jack
but it doesn't really bother me anymore
because I've been living that wireless
life I'm reviewing and using and living
with these phones year after year for
like the past two years all these new
phones keep coming out with no headphone
jack so you just kind of have to get on
that train so it helped it be less
painful for you I got a couple of my
favorite wireless headphones in front of
me these are all good certified tested I
like them so first off you may have seen
that tweet a couple days or weeks ago
praising these Microsoft Surface
headphones that I started using over the
Bose that I've been using for years
little skepticism on that but these are
the real deal now the Bose are still
great don't get me wrong at 349 bucks
ever since I reviewed them a long time
before I've even had them they've been
an industry standard for noise
cancellation solid audio quality but
it's the awesome noise cancellation and
pretty much anyone who can fly with
these will do that including me until
last week
so these surface headphones came out
they are the same price still very
premium but I definitely like them now
more than the Bose for that money for a
couple reasons first off is the build
now they're still mostly lightweight
plastics but these have this soft touch
feel all the way around the headband and
the ear cups are super soft and they
just look more modern and clean all the
way around like the rest of the surface
products this little yoke angle is a
small detail but it makes a big
difference the way they sit on your head
and they completely envelop the ear that
totally over it instead of on it and
it's just more comfortable and that
makes a big difference for people
sitting on a six-hour flight that goes a
long way the inputs and outputs are also
a bit more modern so USB type-c now for
charging instead of micro USB and
there's a microphone mute button and
every time you turn it on a voice now
says how many hours of battery left
instead of your percentage and they seem
to get the full 30 to 40 hours you'd
expect which is nice that's Cortana at
work and then the dials okay so instead
of a plus or minus volume button on the
side that you're feeling for the whole
side of the headphone is this is dial on
actually both sides on the right side is
just volume up or volume down
on the left side of suggesting your
level of noise cancellation so turning
it all the way forward is turning on
full noise cancellation and all the way
back is all the way off plus there's an
extra level that actually starts to
amplify ambient sound it's like the
opposite of noise cancellation and it's
really interesting actually how well
these works so when you have them in
amplify mode you put them on it sort of
cancels the effect of the passive noise
cancellation so without it you just
wouldn't hear much but with it on you'd
ideally like in a work environment if
someone called your name you'd actually
be able to hear it over the music
so that's decent and then as you turn it
towards noise cancellation it doesn't
necessarily have to be a gradient I
would just kind of have it all the way
off or all the way on but as you turn it
all the way on you'll start to see and
hear sounds around you disappear so if
someone's talking directly to you as
you're turning the dial you'll hear
their voice get quieter and quieter nice
and then these are kind of acting like
smart headphones - they have a mic the
audio is paired if you long hold the
side panel it activates whatever voice
assistant you have Microsoft prefers
Cortana you can get Cortana for Android
or iOS if you want but I never really
worried about that it works perfectly
fine with Google assistant and it works
with Siri it's kind of like a cherry on
top so these are my new go-to flight
headphones and just casual listening
headphones they're not the best audio
fidelity in the world I mean they're
Wireless first of all and then they're a
little weaker in the mids and the highs
than the Bose word but just as far as
bluetooth streaming over Spotify these
are more than fine they sound pretty
good and they're just that much more
comfortable okay so that brings us to
these over here these are the audio
technica ath m50 bt bluetooth so they
made a wireless version finally of the
famous M 50s that I've been a fan of for
years and it's exactly what it sounds
like it's literally a pair of M 50s with
the wire snipped nothing too crazy or
extra they charge via micro USB they
have a play/pause and media controls on
the side and you can still plug them in
if you want to and use them on a desktop
overall this is really just a revival of
a classic for the 2018 situation we find
ourselves
the comfort is the same the build and
materials are the same they're just
still super flexible and adjustable and
the sound signature is the same which is
what I loved about these there is no
noise cancellation but the passive noise
isolation from the pads is pretty great
so this is an awesome pair of casual
listening headphones as the previous and
50s were but now they're wireless for
your phone especially if you don't need
noise cancellation plus these are way
cheaper so I'll leave a link to all the
stuff talking about down below now of
course with all of that there is fitness
and working out I still kind of consider
these all a little too nice to wear
while working out plus I don't want to
like have them fall off and break so I
still stick with wireless earbuds for
working out so you might expect me to go
directly to the j-bird run four wireless
earbuds but they're still not quite
exactly what I prefer
they are pretty great for their first
pair of truly wireless earbuds as
they've done before they sound amazing
but in your ears there's still a little
bit clunky and a little bit heavy mostly
thanks to the batteries so if we're
working out and moving around and things
like that I still prefer the earbuds
that have the wire connecting them in
the back it doesn't bother me there's
still Wireless to my phone and I just
feel like they lock in my ear better
they're more comfortable so I still like
these jaybird x3 has actually been my
go-to for a while I have multiple pairs
they sound great still they're super
lightweight they stay in my ears the
battery lasts forever for these tiny
little earbuds like eight hours straight
there is matte black or matte red or
whatever color you're into and they are
less expensive than the fully wireless
versions so can't really ask for much
more than that
the j-bert x4 has come out since then
they are a bit more rugged and a bit
more modern but there's still not USBC
in fact I actually find them harder to
charge so I haven't felt the need to
upgrade yet maybe there will be a u.s.
PC version coming soon anyway that's
pretty much where we're at so far for
wireless headphones at least for me on I
phone believe it or not air pods are
still sort of the go-to as far as
portability and convenience we've had
them in matte black in our store wink
wink
but these these are easily some of those
popular headphones or earbuds now for
iPhone that have ever existed now there
are also rumors of air pods to like
starting to pop up I'm not sure how
credible those
they seem pretty early and I'm also not
sure what would be different about air
pods - maybe wireless charging but I'll
keep an eye on that and also I gotta
mention I've heard a lot about these
sony 1000 XM 3 i think is what they're
called they're again the same price as
the bows and the surface headphones i
haven't tried them yet but a lot of
people seem to like them so I may end up
checking those out too but so far this
is what I found I like ok that's pretty
much it alright as a prize for making it
to the end of the video I have a little
bit of a an extra for you we have a
couple extra of the audio technica ath
m50 BTW you get the little early heads
up that these will be in a giveaway some
will be on instagram some will be on
twitter so make sure you're following in
these two places over the next week to
get all the info for those when they
come out that's pretty much it
have a happy holiday thanks again for
watching I'll see you guys in the next
one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
