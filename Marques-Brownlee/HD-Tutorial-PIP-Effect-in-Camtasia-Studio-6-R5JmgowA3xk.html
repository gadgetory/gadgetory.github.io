tutorial in this tutorial I'll be
showing you how to customize a
picture-in-picture effect in Camtasia
Studio 6 now for this first clip I
couldn't actually show you how to get
the picture-in-picture effect using my
screen capture software so bear with me
here I'm just going to show you guys
when you enter the recording basically
the main menu where before you start
recording in Camtasia Studio 6 you'll
come across the number of things so as I
think of the camera here pardon me this
is not Camtasia Studio 6 but you can
record a specific dimension and normally
this will be off right here and you will
just have that big record button and
you'll be able to record now this HP
laptop actually has a built-in webcam so
it recognizes it automatically so what
we're going to do is come down here and
hit the camera button there I am and
it's recognize the camera so now I'm
speaking to the camera up here and it
won't actually start recording but what
I actually do go up and hit the record
button it will begin recording both of
this screen and it might webcam at the
same time so I'm gonna get the audio
actually so I'm going to get back to you
guys and actually show you now a test
video and just go over customizing the
picture-in-picture effect in Camtasia
Studio 6 so I hope you did storia
alright we switched over to the actual
screen recording software here and what
we're gonna do is open up Tempe AZ
Studio 6 and in order to first of all
modify the picture-in-picture effect
we're going to go over to the import
media tab and import a little bit of
media and make sure this is media that
again you recorded using Camtasia Studio
6 with the picture and picture effects
so I'm just going to import this camrec
file it's very small file so it should
load up quickly so here it is just drag
it down to the timeline and it will be
on your timeline you will have first of
all you'll have to select your preset
and I'm going to choose my HD preset
because I like to make all my videos in
1280 by 720 if you want to know how to
make that preset by the way I did a
video on and got a lot of good ratings
so that's a good good idea to check that
out so yes smartFocus not all right so
here is our clip on
time line it is a dot EBI and you will
see there is a video one and there is a
picture and picture and audio now I
didn't actually do any talking during
this test so it'll be a very a very flat
line for the audio but there is a
picture-in-picture video which is the
webcam video picture and fix your audio
and the actual screen recording itself
so what we're going to do is if we want
to customize a picture-in-picture effect
which you can see down at the right hand
side that's a little preview of what
we've got here so there's me in the
bottom right hand corner what we're
going to do to customize this go over
here to edit and go all the way down to
picture in picture and select it and
here we have one picture and picture
clip which you saw I just imported and
we're going to select modify selected p
IP clip and here's what it really gets
pretty cool what we can do here is we
can first of all over here on the right
hand side you can modify and drag the
size of what you want to be or so I have
my keyframe I'll go at the beginning
here I want I want to be taking up a
good portion of the screen at the
beginning of the of the screen capture
however I'm a little blurry right there
so I'm gonna shrink it down a little bit
it keeps the aspect ratio I'll put
myself right in the little screen hit
okay then we hit finish we're gonna play
this clip a little bit and we got to put
to a point where I move myself either
way pause and I'm going to actually make
sure that keyframe is selected then I'll
go up to picture and picture again
modify and here it is we were actually
going to move ourselves down to the
bottom right hand corner and shrink down
to a smaller size so it's a good high
resolution like I'm all the way on the
bottom of the screen right now and
that's a good small size other things
that we can change in the picture and
picture effect
first of all the dimensions are right
here we can change the opacity so if we
want to completely disappear and show up
later we can actually fade ourselves in
right here it'll be a hundred percent
opaque and this this works if you're
just a watermark or if you actually want
to show yourself and something might be
behind you and you don't feel like
moving it you can just set yourself to
be a little more transparent so you can
see the entire screen recording next you
can include a border and you can also
select the border color and thickness so
here's the the palette for selecting
your border color and you can also fade
the pig
chin picture in and out which is very
useful and I do do that also we can do
is add a drop shadow to the picture and
picture effect and I'll go to the top
left since them in the bottom right hand
corner of the screen and then I can see
I'm in the bottom right hand corner of
things you can do is show and hide the
picture in picture obviously that's the
basic the general dimensions and things
you can do with customizing the picture
and picture effect which I'm using right
now you can also hit the assist me
button and TechSmith will give you a
whole ton of modifying picture and
picture tutorials and if you have to
show me button they actually have video
tutorials using their own software
demonstrating their own slot for so
that's pretty cool so once you're done
with all this changes just hit OK and
finished and your picture and picture in
effect has been completely modified as
you can see by the preview I got the
shadow the red border and everything so
I hope you like this tutorial and thanks
