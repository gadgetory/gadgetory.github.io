another high-definition video and today
we're going to be taking a look at
Google's latest creation if you couldn't
already tell Google is yes one of my
favorite companies and today we're going
to be taking a look at this magnificent
browser here what you're looking at is
Google Chrome 7 you may have noticed it
looks just a little tiny bit different
from other versions of Google Chrome but
why don't we gonna be taking a look at
today that includes benchmarking for
some speed tests some opening tests and
some other things like that and just
getting to know this browser a little
bit better first of all something I want
to address as we go ahead and view about
Google Chrome is that all your
extensions will still work so as soon as
you visit the link in the description
and of course check out the latest
version of Chrome note that unlike
Firefox and unlike opera and unlike
Internet Explorer all those hundreds of
thousands of extensions you have
available are gonna work so that's just
great so the first thing I wanted to
show you was the new ability to use side
tabs say I have a number of tabs open
here say Tumblr I have open you might
have noticed I actually do have a tumblr
now might be a little bit late what I
want to do over here is right-click on
the tabs and what we can do is hit that
use side tabs button and you can see it
immediately switches to this interesting
little view that I kind of kind of like
kind of don't like but you know it's
it's new and it's something most other
browsers haven't had the ability to I
believe opera does and this ability
allows you to just add new tabs simply
just like this and X amount on the
left-hand side here it does save some
vertical screen space if you have a
widescreen monitor this can be very
helpful as you don't have a whole lot of
room from top to bottom so this is
really cool and of course in order to
switch back you right-click and uncheck
use side tabs and bam you're right back
into this view of the top tab view so
that's the first thing about Google
Chrome 7 next thing we're going to show
you is over here on this wrench this is
something that has been constantly
evolving through versions of Chrome and
I'll go ahead and show you right here
say I type in tests of course we have
Google Instant up here what we're gonna
do is go to well first of all I'll walk
you through this whole thing here you
have the new tab button which is control
T the new window and new ink on
a window button there still is no
ability to use a new incognito window
but our new incognito tab you can also
have this copy button edit cup copy and
paste right here so I'll hit copy you
can just go ahead and copy what is
highlighted there and go ahead and paste
it just like that
didn't exactly work that time but if I
had a text field open it would
definitely have worked hopefully well
well obviously these things are still in
beta but obviously obviously obviously
obviously obviously when you get this
working together it should work when the
full version of Google Chrome is out
obviously gotta stop saying that by the
way you have the full screen button you
have the zoom buttons and you have all
your typical buttons here and now you
only go under tools you also have the
extensions button which was usually in
the main section of Google Chrome but
you have your extensions button over
here on the left hand side under tools
now and you also have the ability to
create an application shortcut which I'm
going to do now
when you click that I'll go ahead and
just put it on my desktop I don't want
it on my Start menu or anything and
click create it just makes a little a
little window here and it's actually
just a program literally an application
you don't have a URL bar or anything
fancy like that it's just a Google
google.com box and you can of course use
Instant Search in there and it could be
a nifty little application also you have
that on your desktop which I'll go ahead
and delete so that's an interesting
little feature that's adopted from
Google Chrome 6 that they've carried
along into version 7
so now something I want to show you is
the fishtank test this is a performance
test it's pretty much the next best
thing to the acid3 test and this tests
hardware acceleration I have this link
here in the description it will be
shortened with bitly but trust me when
you visit it it will be this link I'm
going to go ahead and paste it up here
in the top and we'll see if we can get
chrome to respond here and we'll go
ahead and visit the Microsoft this is
usually used to test Internet Explorer
and basically you can go ahead and do is
test a fish tank this fish tank
animation here so typically it'll be
running at a slightly higher framerate
but right now
have this little fish swimming around
the tank an Internet Explorer
when they introduced the new version
this was a big deal with hardware
acceleration and if we are using Chrome
6 you would be able to tell this is 1280
by 720 I'm not sure
oh it's smaller here it would be a much
slower animation and if we got up to
just 10 fish in chrome 6 you'd be down
to about 12 frames per second here and
if we got up to 20 fish with a screen
recorder going it would be almost
unplayable you couldn't see movements
it'll be in a single-digit frame per
second it would be really slow and with
hardware acceleration well it's just
playable at a much higher frame rate of
course it's not a game but you can
definitely see this is much nicer so the
last thing I'm going to show you guys is
the acid3 test and of course Google
Instant takes us there immediately and
Google has been pretty much mastering
the acid3 test for a while now Google
Chrome pretty much dominated at Google
Chrome 5 Google Chrome 6 they both
killed it and Google Chrome 7 is no
exception
you'll get up to a hundred out of 100 in
the acid3 test and one more thing I want
to demonstrate to you guys is that yeah
it does open really quickly you can see
over on the side here I'm going to go
ahead and drag a copy to my desktop so
you can see how fast I actually open
Google Chrome and you can count down the
milliseconds from the time I click
access the Internet to the time I'm on
the Internet
so it is a very fast browser there's
been nothing to bring me back from
Firefox nothing to bring me to opera
nothing that this browser can't do that
any other browser can do so if you've
been on Internet Explorer if you've been
on Firefox or opera or something
something just out there maybe chameleon
or some other web browser I highly
suggest you give version 7 beta of
Google Chrome a try as it is pretty much
the best software I have ever used and
it's something I use more often than
anything else on my computer so this is
man mkbhd with a slow sweet little video
about google chrome 7 i'm getting back
into the screencast if you guys couldn't
tell this one is a more casual video but
I hope to talk to you guys in the next
episode of mkbhd and until then thank
you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
