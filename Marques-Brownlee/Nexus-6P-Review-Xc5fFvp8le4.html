this is the larger of the two brother
nexuses that came out this year Nexus 6p
it's the successor to the Nexus 6 and
the P apparently stands for premium
which I think is fitting this is one of
the most anticipated smartphones of the
year before it came out and after using
it for nearly a month I can say it has
live up to a lot of the hype which is
hard to do for a smartphone nowadays and
quickly become one of my favorite
smartphones right now for a bunch of
reasons first of all it is a big phone
again it's technically the successor to
the huge Nexus 6 but 6p is a little more
manageable with a slightly smaller 5.7
inch display and a thinner flatter body
and more importantly flat sides that
actually kind of help you with the grip
a lot there's also three colors graphite
aluminum and frost they're all the same
feel in the hand same texture and I like
this stealth graphite look personally a
bit more it sort of hides the visor look
of the glass up top but it is the most
fingerprint magnet II of any of them so
you might go with the white if you like
the more traditional Nexus look or you
could rock a skin which can also look
super dope I'll leave a link to this one
below but yeah Nexus 6p has a super
premium build all metal all the way
around these chamfered edges and a nice
bit of weight to it and it has this
ridged power buttons next to the volume
buttons all of which are relatively
clicky and decently tactile and overall
it's definitely fitting in the premium
package with its industrial design and
the material choices it's top-notch
which is always awesome to see in a
nexus the hump on the back of the phone
with the camera and the flash and the
window for radios to pass through it's
really not all that bad and it actually
spans the whole width of the phone
kind of like the Droid X back in the day
so it still sits flat enough on a table
to type without rocking I personally
don't mind it and it actually kind of
helps tell which side is up when
grabbing the phone without looking
the only weird part of the build for me
was the bottom back panel which felt
slightly more Ray
is on one side than the other like it
kind of didn't quite fit on my review
unit Nexus 6p but my retail units were
just fine one of the coolest new pieces
of hardware with the new nexuses or is
it necks I I'm I'm gonna go with nexuses
unless someone from google corrects me
one of the coolest new pieces of Nexus
hardware is the fingerprint reader on
the back dubbed Nexus imprint it's
really good and knowing how good some of
Huawei's other fingerprint readers are
this shouldn't be much of a surprise but
the touch to unlock was really quick
with this one and I really got used to
it being there on the back of the phone
right where my index finger rests to the
point where at reaching in my pocket and
grab the phone with an unlocking grip
and that would just be ready to go
before I even got it up to my face so
the unlock is just as fast as using a
power button here but obviously way more
secure the only real downside to it
being on the back is if your phone's
sitting on a table or something you
either have to use that pattern unlock
or I guess pick up the phone to
physically unlock it a little less
convenient but I got used to it
alright so continuing with the theme of
premium up on the front of the sky you
have a beautiful crispy 5.7 inch quad HD
OLED display this isn't a huge upgrade
on paper Nexus 6 had a quad HD OLED
display too but this one is slightly
better slightly brighter slightly less
pink at low brightness which is a nice
improvement slightly better viewing
angles before rainbows out and slightly
more accurate color it still pops like
an AMOLED should but color accuracy is
tight with this one it's a latest
generation samsung panel so it should be
I put this display right up near the top
for any smartphone short of the galaxy
note 5 which seemed to get really bright
but overall thumbs up for the screen on
the Nexus 6p
on the wallpaper link is right below
that like button you're welcome now you
probably already noticed that the
display is flanked by a pair of
front-facing stereo speakers they're
outstanding speakers really big loud
crisp full sound easily comparable to
like boom sound from an HTC One m9 or
Moto X pure speakers I said it before
this makes for an awesome music
listening experience awesome video
watching awesome gaming awesome
conference calls awesome alarm clock
everything sounds great coming from this
phone and that can't be overlooked I
love them now this is still a really
high-end phone in the specs Department
as it should be for the price so inside
you're getting a snapdragon 8
ten version 2.1 ship the audrina 430 GPU
three gigabytes of ram and either 32 64
or if your ball or 128 gigabytes of
storage and these high-end specs paired
with the latest version of android 6.0
marshmallow translates into a really
smooth experience from top to bottom
front to back inside out using this
phone is awesome it's extremely
responsive and snappy and it handles
pretty much everything I've tried it
like a champ and look I throw a lot at
phones especially when I'm testing them
so I noticed when they hang up or when I
stutter or when they start to slow down
or when they can't quite push all their
pixels and a month in this nexus very
rarely hiccups over much of anything the
one thing it's a cupped over the most is
probably the camera app which I'll get
to in a second but everything else
multitasking opening and closing apps
web browsing all that fun stuff
buttery gaming - has been great I know
there's been you know the concern over
the Snapdragon 810 chip but I have no
problems with them using it here because
this phone only gets a little bit warm
maybe sometimes now the heat dispersion
is great with the metal body and
performance has been consistent and
clean and smooth I have no complaints
with that so yeah without any worries
about performance you're kind of just
your freedom mess around in the newest
version of Android without worries of
anything hanging up and marshmallow has
been pretty great so far right out the
box there are less pre-installed apps so
you have the option to install most of
Google's stuff from the Play Store and
I've always been a fan of clean stock
Android a lot of it is for aesthetic
reasons but it's getting a lot of
functionality improvements too and this
is the stuff that you see trickle down
into other non Nexus phones later down
the road classic example brand new
Android 6.0 feature Google now on tap so
you still have the Google now cards but
Google now on tap is a sort of a next
level of convenience to accessing quick
information basically it reads what's on
your display whatever is text and when
you press and hold the home button after
that animation and about three or four
seconds of loading it brings up some
cards related to what's on the screen
linking you to more information about it
so for example I'm on someone's tweet
here I hold home to see what's now on
tap give it a few seconds and it
recognizes the person who tweeted and
the stuff that they tweeted about so
then I can go grab a link to go get more
info this can be useful in like a text
conversation maybe someone mentions a
restaurant on now on tap can bring
more info about it show you a menu give
you a phone number to call and make a
reservation or maybe someone mentions a
movie and you want to see the channel
trailer real quick just neat little
things that can save you a bunch of taps
if you know when to use it but the thing
is it's really inconsistent right now
sometimes I hold down and there's
nothing on tap even when I was hoping to
see something specific and other times I
actually tried now on tap twice with the
exact same thing on my screen and one
time it gave me interstellar and the
Martian and the next time it gave me
interstellar the Martian and Matt Damon
I'm not really sure why I got that the
second time not the first but yeah now
on tap you can definitely tell it's
young it's early it has room to grow I
feel like it's in a year or two it'll be
much faster and much more consistent and
useful as it evolved kind of reminds me
of the early days of Google now when it
didn't have nearly as many cards and yes
you can still access Google now cards by
holding down the home button and hitting
the Google G at the bottom it's always
there just one extra tap to get into it
I kind of miss just swiping up from the
home button but yeah outside of that
there are plenty of other little new
features here and there in Android 6.0
the new share card with your most
frequent contacts up at the top the new
launcher with your most frequent apps
during certain times of the day also up
at the top the new permissions manager
is also much more powerful you can grant
or remove any permissions from any app
at the drop of a hat if you wanted to
which puts all the power in the users
hands there and of course the battery
optimizations on an app by app basis as
well the battery life on the Nexus 6p
has been pretty damn good we all know it
has a 34 50 million power battery so
even in such a thin form factor a pretty
sizable battery but with a quad HD
display and all these high-end internals
you don't expect it to get the longest
battery life ever but it does pretty
well I've gotten somewhere between three
and three-quarters to four and a half
hours of screen on time which in my book
is like an AAA - especially for a phone
of this size but it's not the screen on
time that's so impressive about this
phone it's the standby time one of the
news features in Android 6.0 marshmallow
is called doze which essentially is
using the sensors to recognize when the
phone is not being used
sometimes it's facedown on a table or
it's in a bag or something for a while
so the phone will refresh things in the
background more slowly less often to
save battery
the result is these new phones barely
sip any
our in standby mode which is awesome you
can forget to charge your phone with 50%
at night and wake up the next day with
48% and lit lighter days where you don't
use the phone a lot you can end the day
with 30 sometimes 40 or more percent
battery left because you can see in the
battery charts where was dozing and
saving a ton of power which is pretty
legit on top of that this is a phone
with USB type-c as you probably saw in
the unboxing and supports fast charging
so you can get something like six or
seven hours of use out of a quick 10
minute charge no wireless charging here
which is a bit of a bummer for some
people but I always prefer quick
charging if I have the choice now
there's one last big change with these
new nexuses that a lot of people
including me were curious about and
that's the camera Nexus 6p is rocking a
new 12 megapixel Sony sensor no optical
image stabilization but an F 2.0
aperture laser autofocus and a really
large pixel size apparently this was a
sensor originally designed for point
shoots not smartphone cameras so that's
cool here's what's good with the camera
it's pretty solid definitely way better
than any Nexus camera in the past
although that's not a super high bar to
clear and you can double tap the power
button from anywhere including the lock
screen to launch the new Google camera
app and its overall quite fast to snap
pictures which gives you a certain
confidence when shooting a photo that
you're going to get it also I noticed
it's a particularly wide angle lens on
the back facing camera and the photos
themselves look quite nice there's a
full size photo gallery on mkbhd comm
linked below if you want to check out
those full size images but here on
YouTube you can see you're getting
pretty sharp photos plenty of detail in
those 12 megapixels not too saturated
but nice color and overall pretty good
looking it does have a tendency to
overexpose though and dynamic range is
probably the biggest weakness it's not
terrible but you definitely do get blown
out highlights pretty frequently even if
you tap to expose the right place most
of my photos never had any problems on
the shadows but highlights got blown out
all the time of course a natural way to
fix this is to turn on hdr+
and I did that it worked and you can see
before HDR the highlights are blown out
and after HDR you get your highlights
back so it works like it should once you
get in low-light Nexus 6p photos start
to show some grain as you'd expect but
they stay surprisingly blur-free for
something without optical image
stabilization and
basically what it's doing here is
cranking the iso way up and keeping a
relatively fast shutter speed to
compensate for the lack of stabilization
and then relying on really heavy image
processing to get rid of the noise from
such a high ISO you can see in these
low-light photos some areas get really
soft because of all the noise removal
turns out again the best trick for all
this at night is to use hdr+ again takes
a little bit slower but the photo once
it processes looks a lot better check it
out regular shot hdr+ regular shot HDR
plus it's definitely it works
it's keeping a more natural and lively
tone for those low-light shots and does
better with noise overall you can tell
the camera and the Nexus 6p is really
not bad I think the area where it hurts
the most from no OIS is in the 4k video
where those tiny little shakes from a
handheld shot are normally smoothed out
not so this time around but outside of
that you can really tell Google's put a
lot of work into the stock Google camera
to make image processing better not
overly sharp or overly processed but
pretty natural-looking and while there's
no raw or manual modes with the new
camera app you can actually do that
stuff with a third-party app so at the
end of the day Nexus 6p checks a lot of
boxes for me in terms of what I want in
a phone I've talked about how before
there's basically no perfect smartphone
and there's still one or two or three
things that I would have liked to have
seen in this Nexus but as far as Android
phones go this is my new favorite this
is easy a daily driver pic for me and I
really like using as far as recommending
it goes I think this is one of the
easiest Nexus phones ever for me to
recommend to someone to buy especially
with the much improved camera the great
battery life and just an overall awesome
experience throughout fast fingerprint
reader great display and awesome
performance throughout the clean bloat
free stock Android so if you're an
Android thighs 'ya store a smartphone
enthusiast you're pretty much good to go
this is a smartphone that's not going to
disappoint you at all in pretty much any
way and if you're just getting into
smartphones or just getting into this
budget of a smartphone I still think
it's going to be a great smartphone buy
especially because you'll be right up at
the front of the tr4 new Android updates
and new features and new things that
come along with what Google tosses in so
uh yeah highly recommended
good stuff Google thanks for watching
