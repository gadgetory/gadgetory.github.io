hey what is up guys I'm could be HD here
and I've been using the lpx 13 D build
of Android 5.0 lollipop on my Nexus 5
for the past couple of days and surprise
I really liked it a couple weeks ago I
showcased an earlier build of Android
5.0 the Developer Preview back on it was
just known as Android L but now with
lollipop there are a lot of new features
and this build is as close as we have
now to Final so this is a rundown of a
lot of the new awesome features that I
think people are going to like so right
off the bat
two words you're going to hear a lot
when it comes to Android 5.0 our
material design and while that's an
entire redesign of all of Android you
can probably sum it up best in one word
which would be animations basically
everything you touch brings something on
to the screen or moves it off so you
know exactly where things are coming
from and where they're going and that's
the whole point
so the straight-up unlock screen here or
just unlocking into the dialer will give
you an animation or unlocking into the
camera and you can see the animation
shows what you're doing isn't just
popping out of nowhere it's coming from
somewhere and same with the new app
drawer it springs to life out of that
button instead of fading in out of
nowhere like before and you'll see a lot
more transitions and animations all over
the place in lollipop just like this so
it keeps with the whole theme and I'll
actually consider that a feature it's
legitimately helping with creating an
intuitive UI although it still doesn't
help that the back button in Android is
still just as inconsistent as it has
been in previous versions but there are
a lot more helpful animations that
you'll notice every time you pick up the
phone which is really cool and it's also
awesome to see these animations really
always running at a pretty high decent
frame rate especially since this is a
Nexus 5 a 1 year old phone and hopefully
Android L on older devices or lower end
ones will still be just as fast at least
I hope so so if you're thinking Nexus 6
is going to be too big
looks like Nexus 5 is beginning to look
like a steal at under 400 bucks so first
off there's a new Google launcher app
drawer and wallpapers now all material
design themed if that makes any sense I
already showed you the app drawer
animation but check out these new
wallpapers here too some of them are
pretty sweet-looking and I have my
favorites but I'll link a downloadable
album in the description right below
that like button if you want to check
them out too and
next is the notification area which has
also been redone so you can see all your
notifications and obviously all the same
functionality as before but now you have
a clear all button which was gone in the
previous build so thank gosh it's back
and you have another swipe down to get
into your quick settings or two finger
swipe if you want so you have your
brightness slider which wasn't there
before that was another click away and
you also have Wi-Fi and Bluetooth
toggles etc some new stuff here that
wasn't in KitKat you have a flashlight
toggle which is new very nice and a
screen orientation lock again very
useful for many and a screencast button
which will allow you to screencast to a
TV if you have a chromecast also that
second swipe down reveals a bunch of
information with that smooth animation
again showing you your time a clickable
alarm text a clickable battery
percentage to show your battery settings
a clickable shortcut to settings and a
profile switcher so now you can have
multiple profiles on Android on your
phone just like you could on a tablet if
you share one and you can have two
people signed in three people signed in
or if you want to just let someone
borrow your phone for a day or something
give him that guest account which is
basically just like you got a brand new
phone no apps or anything are installed
they can pick their own apps to install
and I don't see any of your media and
then you can just password protect your
main account and you're good but if you
switch back that will actually show you
that when you get to your lockscreen the
lockscreen also now shows notifications
which is pretty cool it's just like an
iOS except swiping them away here
doesn't open them and dismisses them if
you want to open one you actually have
to double tap it to open the app so
here's another trick with a notification
area you can hold down any notification
to see what app is showing it and then
you can go into that app and go the app
settings to change whether or not that
app can show you any more really useful
if some game keeps pestering you to buy
the premium version or something
annoying like that there's also now a
shortcut to three different Do Not
Disturb modes when you tap the volume
button so if you leave all that's just
normal just continues to show all
notifications priority will only show
the most important notifications and
your alarms and when you switch to none
that will not let anything through not
even alarm so totally silences your
phone so you can pick the amount of time
it stays in that mode so if you set a 45
minute commute you can have it silence
for the hour
you're driving and then it automatically
turns off also you can choose what
priority mode includes so you can choose
to have text messages included or calls
included basically customize it to your
liking I always leave on priority mode
when I go to sleep so that the only
thing that can wake me up is my alarm so
there's also new look inside some of the
stock apps in Android 5.0 the dialer
looks very material design II it's super
round super flat there are animations
everywhere there's a new in call look so
if you call someone and it looks pretty
clean the one thing I don't like is that
the hang-up button is now way smaller I
actually liked it when it was a huge
full screen thing so I can just end a
call without thinking but I guess I'll
have to get used to the smaller centered
one and there are other little things
all around Android 5.0 really that you
might not even notice for a while even
using the phone a fun one is that the
screen off animation is actually very
very slowly fading to black and white
before it turns off your display pretty
damn cool but you may not even notice
for a while the new setup process in
Android 5 is a lot easier when you first
sign into your Google account for the
first time especially if you have
two-step authentication that is a huge
improvement Android Beam now allows you
to share any file type where you can
only really share links and images
before and the keyboard and Android is
redesigned and the letter presses look a
little bit different from before as well
you can also use NFC or Bluetooth
devices like smart watches for example
as a trusted device to let you bypass
your lock password they call a smart
lock and it works very well I use it
with my Moto 360 all the time and also
now if you have multiple Google Chrome
tabs open all of them will show up as
separate activities in your multitasking
carousel so you can open them up or
close them by swiping away one by one in
here oh and you also notice they kept
google search available in the
multitasking menu as well I don't know
how useful that is but it's there now
the new clock Believe It or Not the
clock app changes the color of the
background depending on the time of day
so if you're in the middle of the day
when of the sun's out it matches the sky
and it's all blue at night it goes dark
purple etc I think that's pretty neat
and there's now a battery saver mode
that prompts you to turn itself on at
about 15 percent and once you turn the
battery saver mode on your notification
bar and bottom nav bar
our turn bright orange so you can't
accidentally forget you have the mode on
and this will turn off most of your
background data turns the vibration
motor off basically turns your phone
into a local media player but hey it
gets you an extra hour or so out of the
end of your battery which can be useful
for a lot of people now here's one more
really good one screen pinning so let's
say your friend wants to borrow your
phone and say hey dude let me borrow
your phone I just want to make a call
and I trust you friend I trust that
you're going to just borrow my phone and
make a call and not buy a $3,000 paper
shredder on Amazon two minutes later but
if I can guarantee that if I can
guarantee you only use the phone then
that would be really nice so if you go
into security settings and enable screen
pinning you can then go into your
multitasking app pick the app you want a
screen pin let's say the dialer and then
you can pin that app to be the only app
that you can use so then you can
confidently hand him your phone knowing
that he can't get out of the dialer or
do anything else crazy he can just call
someone and that's it of course assuming
he doesn't know how to exit screen
pinning mode which is a long press of
the back and recent apps button at the
same time but honestly you probably
won't and I mean imagine handing this to
a kid or something with a game screen
pinned that sounds like endless
entertainment to me so in summary it
seems like Android L is coming along
really well I was at first worried about
the lighter look everything seems to be
bright white or very pale and light
looking compared to the total opposite
which would be Hollow of Android 4.0
which was all dark so it's something we
need to get used to but other than that
I'm liking a lot of what I'm seeing in
Android L and I can't wait to see the
final final version on the Nexus 6 and
the Nexus 9 but until then I'm going to
leave it that can't wait to get the new
hardware in hand thank you for watching
leave a thumbs up if you enjoyed I'll
talk to you guys in the next video peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
