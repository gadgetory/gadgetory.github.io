here from mkbhd and welcome to another
HD YouTube video and in this one I'm
going to try to show you guys the new
dimensions of the YouTube widescreen
player the really wide screen player now
if you go to youtube channel such as
mine where I uploaded my most recent
tutorial in the full youtube widescreen
I don't know if you guys have seen this
one yet but it does take up the entire
screen so if you look at this as I'm
talking in this video here with my eyes
closed I have the entire YouTube wide
screen filled up and this actually kind
of like it the way it lines up with the
rest of the YouTube page with the right
and left edges unfortunately it's not
the usual 720p or 1080p that you guys
are used to so the dimensions of the new
youtube widescreen player are 1920 by
960 not 1920 by 1080 but 1920 by 960
I'll put that in the description just so
you guys can remember this and favorite
it if you need help remembering but that
is the dimension to the you the new
YouTube mega widescreen player and I
actually kind of like it now if you're
viewing this video in the smaller
condensed size there will be little very
small black bars on the top and the
bottom because this is a little bit
thinner than 16 by 9 and obviously
thinner than 16 by 10 but I just felt
like getting this video up to you guys
to let you guys know I'm actually a bit
sick right now so I pardon my voice but
I just felt like you know letting guys
know for all of you who have asked just
to put it out there is 1920 by 960
officially so thank you for watching
this YouTube video I hope this was
helpful and I'll be actually uploading
an mkbhd
update video very soon so I'll stay
tuned for that again thanks for your
support so far and I'll be answering as
many questions as I can on this account
because obviously this is one I'm
connected to most people with so again
thank you for watching and I'll talk to
you guys in the next video peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
