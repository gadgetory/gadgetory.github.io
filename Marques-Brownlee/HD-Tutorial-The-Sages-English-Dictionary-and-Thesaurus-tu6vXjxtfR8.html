tutorial in this video I'll be showing
you how to get and download a free
dictionary application as well as a
thesaurus application that'll work on
your Windows machine so basically what
this is is this an alternative to maybe
your built in maybe go to dictionary.com
for maybe if you have a project and you
need to look up a few words and define
them etc here is a much faster way to
find your definition or your synonym so
I'll give you guys the download link
it's a scene at a PC world download so
it's very obviously quite reliable just
go ahead and paste it in here so this is
going to be the sages English dictionary
and thesaurus it'll store basically all
of these words and all these definitions
and synonyms in only 8nf Meigs on your
hard drive so this is really really
great
it's basically it's basically a
comprehensive dictionary thesaurus and
it's unavailable for students in my
opinion so in order to get this just
right click on the link in the
description and opening in new tab and
you can follow the audio here I'm going
to hit the Now button and it'll say
thank you for downloading in a second it
should come up with the download here we
go the download window open and that was
fast eight point three megabytes or
downloading already so let's all er all
right here's your Installer we're just
going to open the dot zip file and when
this is done open and exit out of Safari
and whatnot so we just have this it's
just going to be the sage sped up and
it's an application we're going to
extract all files and we're going to
extract it to a place we can remember
something that's not in the way I have a
specific folder for these types of
things so I'm going to save it there and
make sure you check the box that just
show that says show extracted files when
complete hit extract
and when this is done extracting you
should come up with folder exactly where
you saved it so we're going to scroll
down to find exam the name of the setup
file that we just saved it to so let's
look for the sage setup and double click
on it and if you don't have UIC or if
you have disabled you may see it will
not pop up if you have it still enabled
then it wasn't visible to the screen
recorder but it did pop up so we're
gonna hit next to continue within this
installation we're going to accept the
agreement we are going to we're not
going to put a shortcut everywhere we're
just going to put a one in the Start
menu so we can find it whenever we want
and then to hit install and we're going
to pause this video so you guys can come
back right when the installing is done
all right now it says the sage has been
configured successfully so I'm going to
close this and it says installation
complete so I'm just going to hit next
and it says it has been installed on my
computer so click finish to run this
lizard and then run the sage I let that
box checked so here it is I'm I don't
actually have a full screen application
screen recorder going on but you can see
it's very very intuitive if I want to
search definitions I will just search
let's see catapult
maybe that's Facebook catapult and hit
the lookup button and here we go it'll
say did you mean catapult that's exactly
how you spell it I just double clicked
it and it says BAM it's in now and it
gives me the exact definition this is a
really sweet application a great how do
I say this a great alternative to
dictionary.com I'm searching and fishing
around so now it has add on the verb
version for search tad just hit enter
just like you're searching Google and it
knows extremely fast I don't aim up but
I'll search wiki BAM and it comes up
quite quickly so that is that is the
application for you you can also use
your internet browser just to online
insert
you can search similar words and you can
also look up on double-click which is
what I already have enabled this button
here says you can enable Concorde answer
I have yet to figure out what that is
but I'll definitely get back to you guys
on that software part and then here we
have just basically the definitions now
up here you have the history of what
you've searched I can inked it and
delete parts of the history if I want so
that's really convenient and on the
right-hand side we have a menu but if I
hover over it it'll tell me exactly what
it does this is option style of this
right here is the information yes it's
the view the documentation tweak the
graphical user interface by the way this
is very customizable next this button is
the click to view the information dialog
and last but not least sending out the
high-end system tray which is also
convenient here is the actual icon down
here in my system tray and up here all
the way owners to make sage the topmost
window icon so there we go that is
basically my limited software review and
I will definitely do a much more
in-depth software review of the sages
English dictionary thesaurus so thanks
for watching guys if you have any other
toric idea for me or software ideas for
me to review even hardware go ahead and
make your suggestion just by subscribing
and sending me a message so thanks for
watching subscribe peace
