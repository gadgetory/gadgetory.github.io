been a lot of talk about fiber recently
not that kind of fiber google fiber so
what exactly is Google Fiber well to put
it the most basic possibly it is your
internet and if you want some TV from
Google right now you're paying one
service provider for your TV service if
you pay for TV in your home and then you
get that signal from that provider and
that's where your box comes in and gets
that signal and displays it on your TV
same thing with your internet you're
paying another service provider most
likely or you might have a whole package
that gives you a generally subsidized
package with your internet your TV and
maybe your phone service Google has
decided to get in the game and become
another one of those providers but with
a lot of things you might want to
consider over those other providers
there's a complete package now I'm gonna
work my way up from the bottom here
there are three possible plans plan
number one you pay the $300 installation
fee for Google Fiber and you get free
unlimited internet for the rest of the
time that you live there five megabits
per second down one megabit per second
up free internet forever that's it but
that's not why you get Google Fiber plan
number two and this is where it gets
awesome there's no installation fee for
this one and you pay $70 a month for
gigabit internet and a Google Fiber
router that can handle this Internet
I said gigabit that is 1,000 megabits
per second down and 1000 megabits per
second up 1,000 megabits per second
downloads and 1,000 megabits per second
upload plan number three is a small step
above plan number two what we just
talked about because you get all the
things we just mentioned in plan 2 plus
you get Google provided TV which is
supposedly this very very high bandwidth
very good-looking 1080p TV service where
you get a Google box and you get a TV
remote the Nexus 7 the only problem with
this TV service right now that would
prevent me from wanting to go with plan
number three is the fact that there are
a lot of big channels missing like ESPN
and HBO but the super high definition HD
TV does sound really awesome
but I think if I was involved with this
I would definitely go with plan number
two you're probably thinking why aren't
you already involved in this right now
why isn't everyone involved
well it's only available right now in
one city in one country in the world
Kansas City Missouri and Kansas City
Kansas it's a city that lives right on
the border between two states but I
can't help but think how insanely lucky
those people in Kansas City are I mean
that's an incredibly low cost of living
City and you get super super fast Google
Fiber internet right now I'm thinking
and you can agree with me or disagree
with the like button down below I think
I think plan 2 is the sweet spot right
now
I don't think plan 3 is going to be the
most popular option because there's not
a lot of TV channels but plan to a
thousand megabits down and especially a
thousand megabits up that's awesome
right now there's a link in the
description below from Google explaining
Google and Kansas City right now there's
not a whole lot of information about
going anywhere outside of Kansas City
yet but you can definitely hit that
signup button and be another sign up in
your city to be considered to be next on
the list for Google Fiber I'm hoping
that this is really successful in Kansas
City so that this is able to expand all
over that state all over the country and
internationally that would be pretty
awesome pretty sweet actually a thousand
megabits per second raise your hand if
that's faster than your current internet
speeds and high-five actually no don't
hit your screen that's probably not a
good idea
so if anyone's unfamiliar with gigabits
per second that is not the same as
gigabytes per second one gigabit per
second is about a hundred and twenty
five megabytes per second megabytes
gigabit s-- it's a translation so that's
one gigabyte every eight seconds that is
ridiculous that's 25 huge songs per
second you could download two albums in
one second you could download enough
movies to fill a 64 gig
iPad in nine minutes you could download
the entire contents of a DVD in less
than five minutes if you're a youtuber
you could upload your one gigabyte video
in eight seconds that's ridiculous
either way I hope you guys enjoyed this
video it's a brief explanation of Google
Fiber and again I'm really hoping this
expands too far and why farther than
Kansas City now anyway and let me know
if you guys think about it in the
comment section down below and I'll be
you know responding to comments as I
usually do down there either way thanks
in this video and I will talk to you
guys very soon in the next one base
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
