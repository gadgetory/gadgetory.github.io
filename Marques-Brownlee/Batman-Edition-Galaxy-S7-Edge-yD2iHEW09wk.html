from Samsung this year it's Batman so
this is the Batman edition galaxy s7
edge so obviously this phone looks
really sick but if we put it aside we
get a little bit more on the box there
is a VR headset in here which explains
why the box was so much bigger this is a
full black themed version of a newest
gear VR that Samsung Galaxy s7 edge is
compatible with nice and is also this
plastic Batman case which is a pretty
nice touch it has some depth to it for
sure and then a little bit of paperwork
and underneath that you have your fast
charging accessories which I would have
thought would be the black and gold
theme but they're not and then you also
get a pair of Samsung headphones which I
thought would be the black and gold
theme again but they're not and you also
get a SIM card ejector tool as well
anyway here's the phone itself and all
the stealth black Batman themed glory
why I always put the sticker here on the
back right in the middle I will never
know but once you get rid of it you can
admire the phone in all its detail I
thought Iron Man was actually a pretty
cool look last year if you remember that
with the red and gold all over it but I
guess Batman might be the perfect
superhero to do a smartphone with
because you can just go stealth black
and that's exactly what Samsung did here
with the black metal rails and the black
buttons and the whole black edges this
thing is murdered-out from top to bottom
and then it has these little bits of
gold accents that you can see like the
ring around the home button and a bit of
gold in the earpiece and the gold around
the camera and the flash cut out
basically anywhere where you've
previously seen glossy silver it is now
gold and then of course you get the gold
Batman logo on the back oh and once you
boot it up just like last year you'll
also see there is with this phone custom
software
Batman injustice theme right out the box
obviously you can disable this one right
off the box or if you plan on using a
stock theme you can do that as well like
if you actually use this phone as your
daily driver
but yeah it's all in there and not gonna
lie it's not the prettiest software
theme I've ever seen but at least they
stay consistent with the wallpapers and
the Batman black and gold theme to match
the precious hardware you're holding you
get that animated lockscreen with the
wind sort of blowing through Batman's
cape you get that full icon pack and
then black and gold everywhere you'd
expect to see colors changed in a theme
notifications settings etc even the
always-on display which is new to the
galaxy s7 shows the date the time and a
faded Batman logo just for good measure
I actually think that's pretty sweet but
yeah galaxy s7 edge was already a pretty
unique phone to begin with and I mean we
talked about how other phones all look
so similar to each other nowadays but
galaxy s7 edge with the glass front and
the dual curved edges and glass back it
was kind of already a unique phone but
this just kind of takes it to the next
level with a fresh coat of paint
literally feel free to drop a thumbs up
if you'd cop this one Samsung doesn't
have to keep doing these superhero
edition designs and custom packages but
I'm glad they keep doing it so keep it
up Samsung this one I'm holding is
number 396 of only 1000 of these that
they will ever make and I'm giving it
away so feel free to follow on Twitter
for a shot at this $1200 super limited
edition smartphone pretty soon after
this video I'll make a post it'll be
super easy to get in on winning this
internationally again thanks for
watching this quick video on the Batman
Galaxy s7 edge and I'll talk to you guys
in the next one peace
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
