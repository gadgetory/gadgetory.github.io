mkbhd channel and I hope you're enjoying
your holiday break I know I am and I
know a lot of you guys including me have
gotten some battery-powered gifts this
holiday season and this is a video to
help you guys out who have been
wondering about the batteries in these I
was actually doing some research on
lithium ion batteries which is the
rechargeable type of battery that you
find in just about every mp3 player or
phone or device out there and to sum up
my hours of research I basically have
three main myths that I can dispel right
now myth number one is that you need to
do a very long like overnight initial
charge before you can use a lithium-ion
battery power device for the first time
this is false lithium-ion batteries
actually don't require any sort of
initial charge or priming as what they
call it so if your new iPod comes with
40 percent battery out the box you can
just start using at a forty percent
battery don't worry about any sort of
overnight charge myth number two is that
you should unplug a device as soon as
it's done charging so you can avoid
overcharging and diminishing the battery
life this is one of the most common
myths and I only recently figured out
that this is actually also completely
false
look named ion batteries are actually
kind of smart in a way they have
built-in circuits that cut power once
the battery is fully charged if you
actually look at a battery charging
chart they charge really quickly to the
first light 80% and then they basically
gradually fill in the last 20% and if
you look at it really really closely it
actually bounces off 100% a couple times
so it'll go from a hundred to like 97 to
a hundred to 97 and that's the battery
rejecting the charge saying all right
we're done charging and then when it
gets down to 97 it's like all right I'll
accept a little more but basically they
never get overcharged the only thing you
have to worry about is overheating and
that pretty much never happens unless
you're using it in a really hot
environment so you don't have to worry
about whooping it off the charger in the
middle of the night when it's done
charging myth number three is that you
need to calibrate a lithium ion battery
which is basically people draining their
battery all the way down to zero percent
then charging it all the way back up
again to 100% while this is sometimes
true and Tim sometimes work on certain
devices where it has a battery memory
the battery itself doesn't ever need to
be calibrated it's the phone software
itself that sometimes has trouble
reading the battery percentage left so
you may want to do this every year or so
but lithium ion batteries have the same
performance level from just about any
standard discharge the reason these
myths exist is because old battery
technology was nickel-based these old
nickel batteries needed to be calibrated
and discharged from 100% to get their
peak performance which is well now it's
old technology now so if all that
plugging and unplugging I just saved you
I think you owe me a high five or four
thumbs up I don't know whatever you want
to do
either way this been mkbhd in this
entire video was filmed on the Samsung
Galaxy Nexus hope you guys are enjoying
your holiday season and I'll talk to you
guys the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
