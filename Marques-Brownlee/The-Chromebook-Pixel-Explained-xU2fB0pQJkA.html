how about those Chromebooks huh many of
us have thought that Chromebooks were a
dead or dying breed but one of them has
been the number one best-selling laptop
on Amazon since the first day that it
was introduced so what's going on
Chromebooks have been doing really well
as very cheap but also very easy to use
laptops they're basically a $250 laptop
that you can get for mom or grandma or
something like that and it just runs
Google Chrome you can use all the Chrome
Web Apps and everything like that and
it's been doing pretty well just as a
basic product like that a couple of
weeks ago a very interesting video came
out that sort of showed a high-end
looking Chromebook with a sort of a
Retina display and all these really
interesting things that we would have
loved to see but never really happened
but it was sort of dismissed as sort of
a non-real product but yesterday Google
came out with announced and made
available the Chromebook pixel it's real
and looks sort of a bit like a squared
off MacBook Pro it looks good and the
specs are actually high-end so start off
with the display that's basically the
highlight of the hardware this thing is
called the Chromebook pixel because it
is a 13 inch 2560 by 1700 display which
gives it a pixel density of 239 pixels
per inch that makes it the number one
highest pixel density on any laptop
display out there it's also a three by
two aspect ratio which you might think
is a little bit weird especially if
you're going to do media consumption on
this thing but when you think about it
it's a Chromebook you're going to be
using this thing entirely for web
browsing and media consumption and for
that extra vertical pixels are better
than not enough especially when pretty
much every website Scrolls down you want
to be able to fit as many things as
possible on that display so the extra
pixels are definitely helpful and then
it's a 400 nits display that's the
brightness level this here happens to be
a 300 nits display and it's a high-end
display so the display on the Chromebook
pixel is already very high-end and it's
touch screen so the touch screen layer
adds a whole new level of interaction
and sort of immediate experience you can
you know tap it just like it was sort of
an Android tablet you can tap to play
and pause videos you can tap to actually
click the way you'd use a mouse this
sort of the same way we've seen Windows
8 touchscreen laptops so this is
absolutely a really high-end display and
that's probably why they named it the
book pixel inside is a dual-core 1.8
gigahertz core i5 processor with
integrated graphics and around the
outside it does look pretty good it's
made of anodized aluminum it has two USB
2.0 ports a mini display port and an SD
card reader and up top is an HD webcam
there is a Wi-Fi only version of the sky
for 32 gigs and that's basically $1,300
and there's an LTE version of this guy
that has 64 gigs of storage all the
links for that will be down below right
below the like button on this video so
seems like in terms of pure specs the
thing is shooting at the 13-inch retina
MacBook Pro plus a touchscreen but then
you consider the fact that this entire
package fits in a 3.4 pound body that's
just sixteen point two millimeters thick
which is actually thinner and lighter
than that 13-inch MacBook Pro there's
been a lot of talk about the price of
the Chromebook pixel at $1300 base price
it seems a little bit high very high
actually but when you think about it it
still seems very high let's like step
back and consider the purpose of this
machine the real reason it actually
exists right now and for that we take a
look at a quote from Google's blog which
says this brings together the best in
hardware and software and design to
inspire the next generation of
Chromebooks this is a halo product this
is the Nexus 10 and the Nexus 4 of
Chromebooks this is the inspiration for
the next hardware manufacturers to start
making Chromebooks that are actually
high-end and from high end specs right
now always seen so far is 250 and $300
cheap plastic HP and sort of basic
Chromebooks this is the inspiration for
the next generation of high-end
Chromebooks so in its creation it's not
even really made for the typical
consumer it's not made to sell well it's
not a flagship it's just a Chromebook so
what is a real purpose of this
Chromebook pixel well Jean Luc's Quyen
on Google+ put it best in his post the
Chromebook pixel is really just an
experiment but it's one that's crucial
for Chrome OS it may not so well at all
in fact it probably won't and the chrome
team may not care how well it sells
after all what they will watch closely
is what happens next specifically in the
webstore this is similar to what this
nexus one did for Android consider the
two biggest complaints you've heard
about Chromebooks in the past few years
one is cheap hardware and 2 it lacks
powerful apps so the critics have called
it just a glorified web browser and to
them the Chromebook pixel looks exactly
the same as the rest most early reviews
will conclude that it's too expensive or
the hardware is premature but as we've
seen repeatedly in blog posts and videos
from Google the pixel really is for
what's next what today's announcement
shows is Google has chosen to address
Hardware first in doing so on its own
they're not relying on samsung or acer
or HP or anyone else and they're doing
so boldly no longer our Chromebook
synonymous with budget hardware they can
be cutting edge and specs are no longer
an excuse now we have high-end hardware
so now the hardware's out of the way
Chrome OS really needs to step up it
needs cutting-edge applications to make
it more than just a glorified web
browser the chrome team has known this
for a while and they certainly know
today it's the missing element what they
need
it's what consumer sets that are keeping
them from adopting Chrome OS or
switching completely from Windows or Mac
users need powerful productivity apps
and games and even photo and video
editing apps and the webstore has to be
better it has to offer that the
groundwork has now been laid over all
these years with the cheap Chromebooks
and Google needs the developers to make
the rest happen they also need a
Chromebook to get excited about
that's the pixel so over the next few
months you'll see Google doing its best
to get the pixel in the hands of and the
minds of as many developers as possible
in fact the pixel will probably be given
out for free to developers at Google i/o
this year meanwhile the chrome team will
continue to push development until the
web is all users really need reducing
hardware dependencies and bringing in
things from Android like notifications
and Google now so when the apps become
powerful enough and the pixel is
powerful enough Chromebooks will become
more than just a glorified web browser
in the eye of the mainstream consumer
and that is the gamble that Google made
today so in the end the Chromebook pixel
is a halo product it is sort of a
beginning and a sort of an entry into a
new market that doesn't really exist yet
but it's Google pioneering a way where
it wants others to follow its paving
that path
wants manufacturers of other Chromebooks
to start to follow to make high-end new
generation of Chromebook and the reason
sadly that it is so expensive is that
touchscreen
it's that better be a really good
touchscreen in order for it to be so
expensive my biggest problem with
touchscreen laptops was actually
pressing it the hinge would bend and it
would wobble back and forth this needs
to be a great touchscreen to justify me
paying $1,300 for now all that being
said I still haven't held one yet I
haven't actually held it so expect a
video on it coming up in the next few
days when I get my hands on one until
then I will leave you with my Chrome OS
explained video which is down below
first link in the description but yeah
that's it so hopefully I'll see you guys
in the next video and this was the
Chromebook pixel explained thank you for
watching and I'll talk to you guys later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
