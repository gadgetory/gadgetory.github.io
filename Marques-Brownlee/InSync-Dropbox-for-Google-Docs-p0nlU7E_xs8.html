a pretty nice tool to show you guys by
the folks over at NSYNC
no not the musical group I swear but
when I first heard of instinct I saw
this it's okay to break up with Dropbox
and I was like whoa whoa whoa like who
do these guys think they are I love
Dropbox you know and if you've never
heard of Dropbox it's this really easy
to use convenient cloud kind of storage
system where you save a file on your
computer and a copy of it appears on
every other device you have linked to
Dropbox in sync is like Dropbox with
Google Docs so this software links your
computer to your Google account so you
can throw anything in this folder and
that's game and will be uploaded and
synced with Google Docs so let's check
out the interface basically here's what
it looks like on the web it looks just
like Dropbox and you can go through all
your files and folders just like you
could on your computer and just like if
you double click them if you click them
here it'll go ahead and open up that
file and it will pop up in Google Docs
so if you have any images or things like
that they preview right by opening in
Google Docs you also have a number of
things that you can do you can hit the
drop-down to get a link to share the
file or view other versions of it and
also you have the number of people who
can view the file in the blue box on the
left and more info about the file to the
right so it's a pretty pretty basic
organized structure here so here on the
desktop you get an NSYNC folder that you
can put all your documents in so
anything you put here will get synced to
the Google Docs really fast but yeah it
operates just like a normal computer or
a normal file manager on Mac or Windows
so if you change let's say this notepad
file here it syncs I don't know if you
saw but really really ridiculously fast
it syncs with Google and of course when
you go to Google Docs on your web
browser you have the beautiful Google
design and the neat organization of all
your precious priceless files so
glorious so here's that txt file that I
changed unfortunately you can't preview
a txt files that will good and
downloaded here and you'll see that it
is already that updated text file this
is brilliant so why would you choose
this over Dropbox you know both are on
Mac and Windows what's the difference
the short answer is storage both Google
and Dropbox offer the first gigabyte
free but after that Google is way
cheaper all the way
wait cheaper than Dropbox storage I'm
talking like 20 gigs for five bucks a
year it's a no-brainer
so go ahead and give this video a like
if you enjoyed you can try everything
out below Happy New Year and I will talk
to all you guys in the next video thanks
for watching peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
