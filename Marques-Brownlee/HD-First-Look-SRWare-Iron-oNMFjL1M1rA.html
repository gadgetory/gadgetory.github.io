looking at a new browser called the SRO
where iron browser as recommended to me
by a user I will link you up in the
description to this exact website where
you can find download link to download
the iron browser that wasn't on right
now and it says this is the installer
for XP and Vista I wanted to download
that as opposed to the portable version
and hit open and it's an 8.5 Meg
download it's all wait for this to
finish and I will close sorry in the
background I just like this to finish by
itself it's my first attempt at
installing and using this browser so
I'll do a little review session on this
and HD so I'm loading and it should come
up with a run dialog here it is hit run
and that likes it out of this Safari USC
came up although that was invisible of
camstudio you can select your language
I'll just say you guys that these are
the languages it is available in I'm
going to choose English next this is
going to install it on my computer so
I'm going to agree to that accept the
agreement next Program Files that's
exactly where it will install it I'm
going it next again and last but not
least it will add a shortcut to the
Start menu folder so I'll pay next I
will leave stop icon but uncheck the
launch icon just because I'm happy with
what I have in my quick launch right now
next and this is what it's going to
install I'm good with that
so here you can see it's extracting
files this is the typical installation
process and it's done so I'm going to it
finish and it launches the browser
instantly and now I'm going to just mess
around with it so first of all it's
looking a lot like Google Chrome right
now there's a little little mess up with
the arrow up there but it looks a lot
like Google Chrome and my first
impressions are it looks nice it has
that super bar as opposed to a start URL
bar and a search bar so if I want to
search for
it will automatically Google friend
let's see I'm going to try an acid
through test I remember doing a video
and showing you guys that the Safari for
what kid brand that I showed you don't
spaz with a hundred root on the acid3
test and there we put it does have a 100
out of 100 but it does say link test
failed and it's supposed to look like
this so an interesting little glitch
link test of youtube.com it is pretty
speedy although there is like a built-in
delay again when I press it and when I
actually when I press ENTER in the URL
bar and when it actually begins to
buffer there's a small difference so
Wikipedia calm I'm entered 3 and then it
starts downloading so it is a pretty
speedy browser actually I do like it I
have to look around see what kind of
add-ons I can actually get for it there
we go a for me now arrow was working for
a minute but then there we go
arrow actually does work if I shrink
this little it's transparent just like
Google Chrome it's really remind me of
Google Chrome so I'm guessing it's just
a spin-off of the WebKit in Google let's
see if it if they can remember passwords
yep it says you want iron to save your
password and I will say yes so I guess
there's a little ironing chrome they go
hand in hand and yeah it doesn't seem to
work I already have Google gears
installed so those are a few impressions
of Google of iron and there's the logo
and you can obviously unlock your object
or your rocket dock and just drag it
right in so something cool I learned
today so yeah if you like this browser
just click the link in the description
and you obviously you can obviously
download this this browser and test it
out
for yourself now you like it over Google
Chrome or if you like it at all
let's see signs and here we sign in
YouTube and I'm going to see if I can
find me the person who actually
suggested it there was a comment on one
of my videos by mmm butter chicken yeah
so they suggested that I actually try to
web browser so they say there you know
it's it's it buffers the page quite well
it has same layout as if I were to open
it in Firefox or Safari and he said it
so far it's not the fastest try at our
where iron it is made from the source
from Google Chrome which I can tell
quite easily by this layout and
everything and it is faster than Safari
with the WebKit which I have yet to see
it also gets a 100 out of 100 on the
acid3 test and in my opinion it looks
better too and I have to agree I check
it out and I'm doing a video review
right now and I'm liking it I tried
Google Chrome before and it was pretty
pretty good speed I mean Google Chrome
obviously one of the faster web browsers
out there and I'll I'll pull up now see
how much resources it is using so if we
go to processes we can see Firefox
preloader in the background is using
about a hundred two megabytes and I'm
going to look all the way down to iron
and it's using only fifteen mates so I'm
actually very impressed by its resource
management that's very very good feature
what else can I say it's not using any
CPU if I were to open youtube.com
we'll see it spiked a little like m320
and it's using 16 mates so it's very
very good if I were to stream the video
over here the most I can probably get
them to get it up to 20 megabytes but
that's a very very good resource
management from this browser far too
compared as the you as the user I showed
you did to Google sorry to Safari and I
opencast
manager and said were to go to
youtube.com we already see safari
climbing to the top at 40 megabytes so I
suppose if you don't have a lot of RAM I
have 4 gigs of RAM if you do not have a
lot of RAM that'll be good I did use a
less resource-intensive browser such as
I'm so I guess I would recommend this
and people just trying out new browsers
I've already tried out awkward Ken alpha
the chameleon Safari the WebKit browser
the Safari browser and now s are aware
iron browser which works in conjunction
with google chrome so if you guys like
this video and then go ahead and
subscribe and I do a lot of videos and
you can you can send me a personal
message with a request should you want
to get a video done just with that so
thanks for watching and subscribe peace
