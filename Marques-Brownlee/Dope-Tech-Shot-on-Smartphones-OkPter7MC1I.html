taken in an iPhone 7 plus the earth is a
very small stage the only home we've
ever known additional equipment I've
ever wondered about those shot on iphone
commercials or about any of those shot
on any smartphone commercials are those
clips actually shot on smartphones well
the answer is technically yes but often
with some heavy adaptation a lot of
times you can get a perfect shot out of
a smartphone with just the camera
handheld in perfect conditions no
problem
but that's pretty rare and you can often
guarantee a much better shot if you have
a little gear with you so take this
example of a video shot entirely on
phones some of the shots are literally
just a smartphone so a smart phone on a
selfie stick
or a smart phone on a mount no special
attachment needed but a lot of other
shops get much more complicated
smartphone on a tiny drone smartphone on
a much bigger drone smartphone attached
to a cine lens with a wireless follow
focus on a gimbal attached to a
motorized remote control for wheeled
skateboard that is a lot so at the end
of the video or the commercial or
whatever you're watching you see shot on
a smartphone and the main point of those
commercials is that you see that it's
shot on a smartphone that you can get
it's supposed to make you feel like you
can make movies just like that because
you get that same smartphone but when
you see the behind the scenes of how a
lot of these shots go down and how these
things are made they can actually kind
of have the opposite effect that kind of
stuff is not available for 99% of us
mere mortals to use but there is luckily
for us quite a bit of dope tech that can
bring a lot of that down to the consumer
level and help us maximize our
smartphone cameras more cameras are
obviously for the most
are really good they're also the most
popular camera in the world at this
point you may have heard the saying that
the best camera is the one you have with
you I think that's true but of course
you like to take it to the next level so
for photos obviously the sensor and the
glass on the front of it are the only
permanent thing about a smartphone
camera lens adapter systems out there
exist to add another layer to that so
there's a bunch of different styles out
there
clip-on versions bumper versions case
holster versions this one I've grown to
like the most is the moment lenses so
that's actually the new version the
moment v2 and I've gravitated towards
this one mostly because of their focus
on quality it does require a case which
acts as the lens mount and any tiny cine
lenses mount to the case to change the
field of view the focal length and the
capabilities of this camera entirely
there's an 18 millimeter lens which is a
little wider than the normal field of
view there's a super wide angle fisheye
version there's even a 10 x macro lens
that can get some crazy close up shots
so this I think is pretty awesome now
the fact that you need a whole case to
be the lens mount instead of you know
maybe just like a little clip-on
accessory means you are a bit restricted
it means when you upgrade your phone you
have to get a whole new case so that's
the downside but the benefit is the
precision so you mount the lens over the
exact center of the sensor every single
time there's never any even getting in
the corners no loss of sharpness
anywhere in the frame they're polarized
lenses too so in terms of really upping
the quality gain from the camera of
photos these are pretty dope these in
particular support a couple of phones
but not all of them in fact some I
thought they would support they don't
but they said it's because they actually
wouldn't be a precise fit or they would
have something getting or it's not
practical so they have a couple you can
check out if they're compatible with
yours and I was never really into used
before as like a cheap alternative to
DSLRs but when you think about it that's
exactly what these are you can never
really match the quality of a DSLR that
will always be better but this will
always be smaller and always be cheaper
now for smartphone video you add a whole
other dimension you add movement of the
camera a big part of video is movement
and you can do a lot handheld you can
have really study hands but after a
certain point you're going to have some
shake you're going to want to stabilize
this so taking videos shot on
smartphones to the next level means
taking
stabilization to the next level that's
actually where DJI Osmo mobile comes in
it's pretty much the standard right now
as far as smartphone stabilization goes
this thing is built specifically to
stabilize a smartphone camera it has
some extra controls on the handle of
course which are nice when it connects
to your phone which can trigger to pan
left and right and tilt up and down and
get all kinds of cool shots but mainly
the operator gets to just point and
shoot and start moving and the gimbal
smooths out and stabilizes all the
little twitches and shakes that come
from being handheld and it works really
well and I can add a whole new dimension
to videos or even live streams or
whatever you decide to shoot on your
phone it's just up to you to decide how
to use it now I found that it doesn't
really handle the extra weight of also
adding the moment lenses to it so you
can't use the Osmo and your phone with
the lenses at the same time you need a
bigger gimbal that supports a little bit
of a heavier payload like something like
this Zoo yen
tete crane which is made for actual
cameras but the gorilla pod adapter let
me put my phone on it but that's just if
you're feeling daring so bottom line is
all this tech exists to help you take
your smartphone photo and video game to
the next level and of course it's not
just about the gear it's also about the
strategy and all that you know about
photography and video already I could
probably make a whole separate video
about just that but the whole point is
yes a dedicated camera Wald's bigger
will definitely do a better job every
time in the quality department that's
what it's built for but your smartphone
cameras will always be at your side
they'll always be smaller and they will
always be cheaper than actually going on
buying a separate camera system so well
it might not seem super practical to
actually go out and be able to shoot
those commercial level crazy high end
videos that people are doing with
technically smart phone sensors on crazy
rigs and jibs and stuff like that it's
also a lot of fun to try to maximize
what you can do with detect ups in your
pocket right now and I feel like that's
where a lot of people I tell is to start
your YouTube channel with your
smartphone cameras you see my inbox like
every day there's questions about I have
this gear and this lens is this enough
to start a YouTube channel right now yes
you're probably already set if you can
watch this video on something you
probably have a device that can shoot
video just start doing it right I'm
going to end this before I start renting
that's pretty much it thank you for
watching this quick one and I'll talk to
you guys the next one
