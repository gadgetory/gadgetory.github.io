high-definition video and today we're
going to be taking a look at Internet
Explorer yes I didn't think I would be
saying this or ever doing a video about
this but today we have the newest
version of Internet Explorer 9 beta
which is actually a humongous
improvement over Internet Explorer 8
the final version so just so you guys
know this yes is still in beta which
means it's not meant to be your
full-time browser but you certainly
could go with this option if you're
still using Internet Explorer 8 so this
is the first page it greets you with you
can see it says welcome to a more
beautiful web you can see how it works
and you can see it's actually pretty
much broadcasting at fishtank test we
looked at back in our google chrome 7
video so basically I'm gonna give you
guys a look over the overall the user
interface what I like to call an
interface lift so we'll close out of
that here so you can see there's a whole
lot of screen space at the bottom and up
here next to the URL bar there's a very
nice user space which I could actually
get used to in something like Chrome or
whatever who else decides to adopt this
you have the URL bar on the left hand
side with back and forward and your
typical omni bar here which you'll see
with something like Google Chrome then
you have the X button for stopping
things in reloading then you have your
tabs here you can open a new tab and
you're presented with this nice little
most visited sites so you can see this
is the least active I've only visited
this once visit this once and I've
visited Google a ton of times so that's
basically how it'll sort your most
viewed pages so you can open a new tab
that way all the way over on the
right-hand side here there's your home
button of course my home is Google com I
wanna clean enough there's also your
favorites button typical Microsoft you
can obviously obviously obviously move
it over to the left hand side with that
button and close your favorites here and
it has a chrome like tools button with
that little wrench so you can print and
do all your different things I really
think there's a much better
implementation if you saw Internet
Explorer 8 there was a giant area here
you would actually have all your tools
and things you wouldn't be able to have
them just behind one little button right
here just like that so that's really
nice something else I want to show you
guys is that fish tank tests
remember I did that in the chrome 7
video it did perform relatively well not
stunning but certainly better than the
last version of Google Chrome so you can
find this out the link in the
description along with the download link
to Internet Explorer 9 and I'll make
sure I get it right this time so you can
see right off the bat with the screen
recorder going you can see we're getting
about 55 frames a second with 20 fish
which is very impressive you're not
gonna get all those frames see with
Mac's out of 60 frames a second here we
go 250 fish with hardware acceleration
we still maintain that a hundred fish
with hardware acceleration or over 30
frames a second so this is gonna perform
a lot better than chrome 7 I never
thought I'd say that but it's actually
really basically with hardware
acceleration movements going on within
your browser and things like this are
going to perform much better so of
course with one fish we're going to get
a ridiculous frame count something else
we want to show you guys is the acid3
test a very popular test of course by
standard it'll Bing search everything
you can obviously well you can change
this to be Google I haven't exactly gone
through the Preferences yet you can go
to Internet Options just like you could
in the last version and I suppose you
can change that to Google but I'm
actually fine with the Bing I don't have
a problem with it so let's go ahead and
notch I got the acid3 test you saw the
scrolling bar up there and it looks like
we are going to be stuck at an awkward
7095 I do recall people saying in the
chrome video that they got 95 out of 100
and that was just a quick little image
rendering problem somewhere you're not
really going to notice it in everyday
browsing but there is something to
notice that you're not going to get 100
out of 100 so like I said this is a much
faster version of this browser I'm going
to go ahead and exit out of it and
actually bring a shortcut over to our
desktop so you can see how fast it
actually opens up so here we go three
two one so it's actually pretty fast if
you if you ask me it's not quite at the
speed of Chrome but it's definitely
going to force me to drop something like
Firefox not to make any Firefox fans mad
out there but that does take quite a bit
longer to open than Internet Explorer
and you got a
admit that's that's something to look up
to so if we go to YouTube the site that
we might visit every day it's still not
the fastest browser out there but you
can tell it's got a whole lot more
enhancements especially in the user
interface side of things than Internet
Explorer 8 so overall this is definitely
a thumbs up if you want to go ahead and
try this if you're still using an older
version of Internet Explorer you can go
ahead and upgrade to this beta you won't
have any problems so this has been a
quick little overview of Microsoft's
latest attempt at a decent browser and I
have to say they've done a much better
job than I had anticipated but it's
still not going to be bringing me off my
trusty Google Chrome just throwing that
out there
all right so mkbhd here with a video
review of Internet Explorer 9 beta talk
to you guys in the next video signing
out peace
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
