essential fo see what you I see what you
did there hey what is up guys I'm Kim
PhD here and this is the essential phone
it's a new phone from a new company but
with a not so new philosophy of just
sticking with the essentials you know no
bells and whistles no fancy widgets or
crazy features or head-turning stuff
just seven hundred dollars of the pure
essentials I'll be using this phone for
a little bit now and I have a pretty
good idea of how well they did and
whether you should buy one or not so
that's what this video is so first of
all the hardware is awesome and that's
usually really hard for new companies to
get right off the bat so I'm impressed
here the essential phone feels great in
the hand it's this all-black titanium
and ceramic slab no protrusions at all
no logos at all no branding or anything
like that it's just an essential
rectangle with rounded corners
the titanium sides that material is
actually a lot harder than your typical
aluminum so that means you should hold
up to chipping or any drops much better
and the back which you could easily
mistake for Gorilla Glass is not glass
at all it is polished ceramic so that
makes it much harder than glass making
it way less likely to scratch it all but
also theoretically making it more likely
to break some ceramic is more brittle
than Gorilla Glass basically what I'm
saying is this would be a really
interesting phone to drop test but no I
won't I'll leave that to other channels
well you will notice right out the box
though is the ceramic makes the phone a
bit heavier just more dense feeling in
the hand and it's also a serious
fingerprint magnet it's like a mirror
finish which is super nice when it's
clean but it will never be clean so
definitely worth getting a deep brand
skin on the back of this one and they
can actually make the phone look a lot
better than without the skin if you ask
me this is one of those rare instances
so I'll link to this matte black one
right below that like button but long
story short I liked the industrial
design here it's simple not too flashy
but obviously still has a signature look
the only thing you're missing here is
waterproofing a lot of other phones in
this price range have some IP
certification not this one maybe next
year the favor
this guy is actually pretty quick to
recognize your finger but it always
feels like there's a tiny delay when I
actually turned the screen on and unlock
the phone if you can see that it's not
bad but you can definitely address that
with a software update and the rest of
the back of the phone is the mic and two
pins for attaching small modular
accessories and providing power through
them so the one that exists right now is
the world's smallest 360-degree camera
it just snaps right into place with
magnets on the phone which is really
convenient so hopefully there are more
mods added to their ecosystems sooner
than later I don't have any of them
right now but we'll have to wait and see
how good that gets the speaker for those
who care is it's actually really loud it
gets very very loud but it's not like
the best quality loud so there's no big
dynamic range there's no bass or
anything like that it's just really loud
and it's also this small pretty
blockable grill at the bottom of the
phone and there's also no headphone jack
anywhere on the essential phone so audio
is clearly not a priority with this guy
so yeah I guess the easiest joke to make
about the essential phone is they didn't
include a headphone jack which is
essential to most people it seems kind
of weird
yes I do think they could have included
one but they didn't welcome to 2017 I
guess any way around the front is the
5.7 inch display with the sort of the
signature look at this point the cutout
in the top of the middle for the
front-facing camera and the absolutely
tiny bezels on the top and the sides
originally I thought I wouldn't like
this or it might get distracting or
annoying but I can tell you right now
that disapear is just a couple hours
into using it and the phone looks
awesome in my opinion with the thin
bezels we just talked about this in the
most recent video yes technically moving
the display way up closer to the corners
would seem to make it easier to damage
it with a drop but the ceramic and
titanium should also work against that
and all the times that the phone isn't
using the full display it just blocks
out that bar to match the bottom bezel
so it looks like a completely normal
phone most of the time anyway it's also
a quad HD display and it gets up to 500
nits so decently bright but not the
brightest like I can see outdoors but
I've seen better in fact the only real
downside I can see with this screen is
that it's not an OLED if it were an OLED
you could do some cool tricks with
totally blacking out the top and the
bottom or you could do some cool
wallpaper tricks where it fades to
complete blackness up at the
and you could do some cool essential
tricks where you like only light up a
display for notifications instead of the
whole thing little things like that but
it's not it's an LCD which you know
that's just fine for now maybe next year
but where this phone really lives up to
the name the essential is in the
software it is so clean this one is
rockin basically stock Android 7.1.1 and
I imagine it'll be getting Android 8.0
Oreo through a software update pretty
soon it's already gotten two software
updates since I got the thing and so
once you get past the essential boot
screen you get you know stock Google
launcher stock Android notification
shade just a couple google apps
installed absolutely zero bloatware out
the box the only third-party app
installed on this phone when you get it
is the camera app which we'll get to in
a second so this is delivering
essentially the exact same software
experience as a pixel no extra features
are buried in the settings no waving
gestures or iris scanning no extra
assistance or any of that the essential
part in the settings is just to tick
whether or not you want to send
diagnostic data to the company or not
it's just just Android it's clean the
pure base essentials and so of course
because of that performance is great I
mean it's also because of the specs to
you know Snapdragon 835 four gigs of ram
you don't need the craziest specs to run
pure android smoothly but this phone
balls-out gaming is fine multitasking is
fine hiccups aren't at zero but they're
minimal and lag doesn't happen much at
all except in the camera in fact you
know what let's let's talk about the
camera this is the weakest part of the
device straight up so if you were
looking for a reason not to buy this
phone if you want to tell someone why
not to buy it link them to this part of
the video the essential phone actually
has two cameras on the back a 13
megapixel color camera and a 13
megapixel monochrome camera and they're
used together to enhance the detail and
contrast and sharpness in everyday
regular photos unfortunately most people
will never actually notice this so the
only other benefit just ends up being it
can also take black-and-white photos in
the camera app and the camera app is the
only app that I've ever really seen lag
hard on this phone and it's been pretty
consistently slow it lags to take photos
it lags when turning
HDR on and off and it lags big-time when
switching between modes if you have a
lot of stuff going on so that's really
disappointing and it's not even like
it's a super complex camera app in fact
it's one of the simplest camera apps
possible every option available to
change is shown on the screen right now
so there's no other hidden settings
there's no manual mode no pro mode this
is it and then the photos themselves are
pretty mediocre at best
again you would think a phone at this
price that adds a second sensor just to
add detail and dynamic range would be
great with the sharpness and photos
something seems like it really focuses
on photography but the photos from this
phone are still soft they're lacking
dynamic range they're noisy and anything
but perfect lighting and often have the
totally wrong exposure all together
turning HDR on also didn't help as much
as I thought it would you've seen HDR
from other phones like the s8 and the
pixel they're great but this one barely
adds a little bit back to the highlights
and that's it so the lacking camera and
camera app here are pretty disappointing
even the videos off it are really shaky
and also disappointing the one thing
about photos and videos though is they
can be improved via software updates in
fact that's usually the number one thing
that gets the most improved over time
with smartphones software updates but
I've still never seen one go from not
good to really good with just software
updates so I feel pretty safe saying
you're not gonna want to buy this phone
for the camera well you should buy this
phone for our the great stock software
experience that's pretty obvious it's
clean and pretty unique you could buy it
for the premium build quality the
ceramic and titanium as far as I can see
aren't combined like this in any other
smartphone you might even get it for the
battery life this thing gets great
battery life it's been really impressive
for a 3040 milliamp hour battery and a
5.7 inch display but I keep getting four
to four and a half hours of screen on
time so it lasts comfortably all day you
might even get it for just the little
things you like about it the display the
tiny notification LED right above the
screen which gets a really bright or
Bluetooth 5.0 or even the awesome
accessories included in the box which
are also first of all totally non
branded no logo anywhere but also really
high-quality and really cool to see a
smartphone bundle Brady
high-quality cables in the box that feel
like they're gonna last a long time and
a super high-powered 27 watt charger
that goes extremely fast so the bottom
line is what I would I recommend buying
this phone and as much as I enjoyed
using it probably not don't get me wrong
it's awesome to see a new company get so
much right in their first try but at the
same time it is 700 bucks so it's kind
of for me like it's floating around in
that void of other really good smart
phones from the established
manufacturers for the same price you
could get a Galaxy s8 that also has a
software skin but also has a way better
camera and also has waterproofing and a
headphone jack all for the same price
you could also get a Google pixel from
last year which may have bigger bezels
but it has better speakers and it gets
the exact same software updates put way
faster we can just wait for the new
pixel to come out this year that will
have smaller bezels and the new software
so a central phone to me is a great
episode one it's a great start and I'm
excited for episode 2 when essential
phone 2 comes out hopefully has 1 or 2
more distinguishing features at that
price range that aren't proprietary mods
and then I'll be really into it and I'll
probably be more likely to recommend it
but until then this is still really cool
to see save your money
thanks for watching talked to you guys
the next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
