this is just a quick video going over
the brand-new red Nexus 5 a fairly
unexpected product in addition to the
black and white Nexus 5 that we already
had available for months so what's the
difference what's new with this Nexus 5
well literally only the color that's it
just a new design here no other added
value other than the additional color
choice now you might remember actually
did a video on the black versus white
Nexus 5 when they first came out because
they're actually made of slightly
different materials this red Nexus 5
takes on the same materials as the black
one so it has that matte finish all the
way around and no glossy plastic so when
you're looking at this red Nexus 5 here
it has the same contrast as that
stormtrooper one where the back is a
whole color including the dark Nexus
logo and the dark LG logo it's all red
here sort of a bright red cherry color I
would say and then you have the black
volume rocker on the left hand side and
the black camera ring on the back again
reminds me the stormtrooper look has a
pretty nice contrast looks pretty good
and then a black power button on the
right hand side although the SIM card
tray is actually painted red so it
blends in so then turning around to the
front of the phone you actually get even
more interesting you have a red earpiece
so the black Nexus 5 has a black
earpiece the white Nexus 5 has that
white earpiece and now the red one
continues that matching trend and
there's also that bezel so unlike the
white you can actually see the red of
the phone creeping around to the front
of the phone while you're using it that
might or might not annoy you but since
the paint extends all the way around
there the bezel will appear a little bit
red on the edges now as many of you know
I'm a huge fan of the contrast between
red and black I've mentioned it in
videos before that I have a soft spot
for those colors and it's actually kind
of hard to show you the exact red color
that this phone is it's really bright in
fact it's actually called the bright red
Nexus 5 on the Google Play Store and
it's color is actually much brighter
than a lot of the red I already have and
the things that I own that I've shown in
videos so that might be the case for you
too I've compared it to a lot of other
red things around that I've also shown
on this channel but if you're wondering
exactly how red this will look in your
hand I found a red that the Nexus 5
matches
most closely and that's the red on the
mkbhd youtube channel banner so right up
top of the channel here if you visit it
a color that the red most matches
closely is that banner red so there you
go I think that's enough for me to call
it the mkbhd edition Nexus 5 obviously
Google didn't go out and make a phone
nee color just for one thing but they
obviously actually I said it was for
Valentine's Day but now whenever I look
at the full Nexus lineup I'm kind of
reminded of the mkbhd logo and that for
me is just priceless so there you go
thanks for watching this quick video if
you're interested in more in Nexus 5
videos or coverage like this I've done
several on my channel already I have
them linked right below that like button
I have the full review I have the black
versus white Nexus 5 - revisited what's
on my phone video it's all there so
that's been it thank you for watching
and hey maybe we'll see a green Nexus 5
for Saint Patrick's Day or blue or
yellow that would actually be pretty
sweet thanks for watching
I'll talk to you guys later peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
