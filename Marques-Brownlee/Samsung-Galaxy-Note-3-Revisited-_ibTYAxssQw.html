this is a revisiting of a phone that
probably got some of the biggest hype of
2013 and judging from the comments
section of my CES bag tour video and
many other people on twitter etc people
want to know how this phone has been
holding up and it's been about four
months since the full review so the
natural place to start would be the hard
word because when it first came out this
Galaxy Note 3 design was one of the most
talked about in Samsung's lineup
specifically the material choices so the
size of the phone were the first and any
Samsung phone to appear sort of metal
like the Galaxy s4 but it's a soft
material and it's held up pretty well
but really it's the back of the phone
here that's gotten a lot of attention
it's the fake leatherette
stitching and soft touch feel now I
actually like this feel on my Black
Galaxy Note 3 I've actually switched to
the black one since the review it's a
little bit less soft on the white Note 3
to avoid staining and I think that was a
smart move from Samsung and as soft as
it is there's really only one small
blemish on the back of my phone and it's
only noticeable from certain angles when
it catches the light well that would
have been a full-on scratch on a plastic
phone like the galaxy s4 but then again
it probably never would have been seen
on a metal phone like the HTC One so
this this soft touch design and the
stitching is somewhere in the middle and
I kind of dig it I like holding it and
the stitching is also now made its way
through all of Samsung's lineup
including the Galaxy gear SmartWatch and
their new tablets and even some of their
packaging so I wouldn't be surprised at
all to see the Galaxy s5 Rock this same
material but that's another video either
way I take really good care of all my
electronics and I don't really actually
use any cases or screen protectors on
any of my phones which some people think
is crazy but this Galaxy Note 3 has been
perfectly fine to withstand that test
anyway what I was hoping would be better
with this phone is the software so in my
original review I talked more about this
in depth and of course I'll leave the
link to the full review right below that
like button if you want to check it out
again relive that but essentially since
I've gotten it I've done everything I
can
routing it to make it a sort of a Google
edition Galaxy Note 3 I grabbed the
Google experience launcher from KitKat a
bunch of the AOSP Google themed apps the
keyboard and I basically mirrored it to
my Nexus 5 as much as possible to make
it more pleasant for me to use and of
course with its top-notch specs none of
that really impacted the performance but
here's the thing no matter how hard you
try you can't shake TouchWiz it pops up
wherever you go in this phone in the
settings in the notification panel in
the visual styles and the fonts it's
everywhere and at this point I actually
don't really like TouchWiz that much I
much prefer stock Android from something
like the Nexus 5 and not only that but
you got to remember that since this
phone has come out a new version of
Android has released its Android 4.4
KitKat and this phone doesn't have it
yet it's still running Android 4.3 jelly
bean now not that that's old or anything
but just today Samsung announced they
release the kernel source for Android
4.4 on the note 3 so that's definitely
on its way soon but even when that drops
it'll still only change so much and
ultimately it will still be TouchWiz and
TouchWiz has so many features and so
many alterations that it actually
impacts speed in a couple of ways it
impacts the speed of the operation of
this phone it's such a heavy skin that
the phone actually needs all three gigs
of RAM that it has and it impacts the
speed of updates so you know how we keep
seeing those Motorola phones like the
Moto X and the Moto G gets super fast
updates to KitKat it's because they run
a version of Android that is very very
close to stock and that will never
happen with the Galaxy Note 3 because of
TouchWiz so if you're not into routing
you'll have to settle for finding
equivalents of stock Android features in
the Play Store like I did and I managed
to find a lot but really not everything
is a perfect equivalent I look through
all the stock themed camera apps for
example in the Play Store and they all
seem to work alright they can take quick
photos none of them are particularly bad
but none of them can record 4k video
like the TouchWiz camera can on the note
3 and they all seem to crash when
attempting to take a photo sphere or a
panorama or do anything too fancy so
this is the reason why I have two of a
lot of apps on my note 3 1a OSP themed
app and onetouch was one to back it up
that I just
have to keep around and that camera one
is actually kind of a big deal I really
wish I could tap into 4k video more
often with the stock camera interface
because the footage looks phenomenal
hey if you don't believe me check out
some recent super scientific videos shot
on his Galaxy Note 3 they are crispy
I'll leave some links below but other
than that this phone is just as grey as
you'd expect after a few months of
launch and it's been surprisingly
successful so Samsung you know we the
whole Galaxy Note line started as
basically an experiment and this third
version has sold way more than 10
million for them so they are really
serious about it now it's no longer an
experiment other minor things I wish the
camera had optical image stabilization
to make the video even better I wish it
had wireless charging built in like the
Nexus 5 instead of having to spend extra
money on a case that adds it and I wish
the design of the UI was just better
than what Samsung has here with TouchWiz
so really at the end the day when you're
looking at a phone like the note 3 and
you look at the software if you like the
software that that whole touch was
experience and you like the hardware
this is still a great phone and it's one
that I have no doubts will be super
super duper future-proof because of all
the great specs the massive amount of
RAM the great display it's just all
around a great phone and we all know
that I'm not a person that uses a stylus
that much so I'm actually really into
this phone still because I can pretty
much guarantee you that when this phone
gets a CyanogenMod build a stable build
of the ROM that brings the AOSP
experience to this phone it'll be
getting a lot more use from me than it
already has
so there you go guys thanks for watching
and I'll talk to you guys in the next
one peace
