how to change the volume level for
different applications so first of all
say I have those media player open and
I'm playing a song I'll play quietly is
and next we're going to have say one
browser open we're going to be watching
a youtube video at the same time as the
song is playing in the background so all
these things are happening one song is
playing I'm also uploading YouTube
videos so this might be a bit slow and
let's just watch one of my videos real
quick mm-hmm so this is my video on how
to use Safari add-on so that is playing
HD and we want to try to find out a
little we want to change the volume
level in different locations
well Windows Vista has down here it is a
volume level changer you know when you
left click it once you'll get this thing
right here which changes the overall
volume of your system which is the Mac
to volume but if you hit mixer you're
gonna get a mixer for all your different
applications so should I get a type
phone call right now it would ring at
six volume 50s 60 volunteers volunteers
go to scroll to the right and say I'm
recording right now at this volume quick
launch buttons which is when I you know
hit the it's an HP thing but I'll go
over that in a later yeah here's the
YouTube video that we're watching we can
turn that down inside of inside of
windows basically without opening
Firefox and when this media player will
turn it up and you'll see the you'll see
the mixer show it here and then I'll
turn it down again and you see how low
that is so that's what's causing most of
the volume and we can click on that
click on it again to open it it up and
I'm actually going to go in here and
close it and you'll see Firefox
actually Firefox is no longer playing
any sound and if I should stop this and
even close Windows Media Player now it's
no longer in the mixer so yeah that's
how we change the volume level of
different applications this is the
master volume of your speakers or if you
have headphones plugged in so if I were
to drag this you see all the different
applications increase and decrease
accordingly if I were to drive one
application in the master volume then
that means the master of all you must go
up I can drag everything the highest and
the master volume which I will do drag
everything up to the top I can still
change the master volume to switch
everything lower and change the entire
system sound say to 80 so that is how
you change to be a the volume level of
different applications simply left-click
once and hit the mixer button to access
all this functionality if you want any
other tutorial to me to make guide just
send me a message subscribe and I will
do that for you so thanks for watching
