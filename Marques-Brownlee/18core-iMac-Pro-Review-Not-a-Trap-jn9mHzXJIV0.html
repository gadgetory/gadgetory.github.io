first true Pro desktop workstation in
years and it's pretty damn good so I
made my first impressions video of the
new iMac Pro using somewhere what I'd
call like a mid tier iMac pros the 10
core the total price ran around 10 grand
for that machine the a Mac Pro starts at
about 5,000 bucks
on launch day though I did order what
would be the highest end available iMac
pro spec config with the intention of
making it my full daily driver I'm gonna
give it a shot and replace the Mac Pro
so that's what this is turns out to be
the 18 core Xeon CPU 128 gigs of ram the
16 gig Vegas 64 and a 4 terabyte SSD and
all that runs around 13,000 bucks and I
have actually really liked it so a
couple months ago I was wondering if I
Mac Pro was a trap I was thinking I
would try it and it would just be my
interim machine until that fully modular
and new Mac Pro comes out maybe this
year and that may still be true but
after using this I can really say that I
can highly recommend iMac pro maybe not
this 18 core one but this is one my
favorite and new Apple products in a
really long time so of course anyone
considering buying one will want to know
why should I get an iMac Pro over a
regular high-end iMac you know you can
get a maxed out 5k iMac with a core i7
64 gigs of ram all of that for about 5
grand so why pay more for this so this
is everything that's different about
this deceivingly different beast the
iMac pro so the outside dimensions are
exactly the same as a normal iMac which
means same 5k display but also same big
bezels and same huge chin and same non
adjustable stand so you know part of the
reason I was looking forward to the new
Mac Pro is because I've never really
been a huge fan of the way the iMac
looks I'd rather use my own monitor I
actually prefer dual monitors and a
matte finish but that's not to say this
5k display here is bad in fact it's
excellent it's one of the best and it
always has been but here's what is new
number one the space gray obviously I
think it's hot I would love an even more
like matte black undertone but I know
we're not getting that so for now I
can't appreciate the space gray paint
the space grey keyboard the black
buttons the trackpad the black lightning
cable black Apple stickers even all the
stuff that you can only get with an iMac
pro it doesn't save the Magic Mouse from
dumb design but you know at least now
it's better-looking so number two the
built-in speakers of the iMac Pro are
actually significantly louder and fuller
and better than a regular iMac now you
may or may not care about that if you're
a pro user you probably don't use the
built-in speakers obviously don't I use
an audio device to my external speakers
and I also have this little Satechi
little hub here that plugs and gets my
ports around the front and goes right
into the speaker but if you do use the
built-in speakers that's a nice bonus
and speaking of ports of course number
three is those ports so the iMac Pro has
a 20-18 workstation suite of high
performance IO has four full-size USB
3.0 ports four Thunderbolt 3 USB C ports
an SD card reader a headphone jack and
tend to give an Ethernet which is pretty
huge for networking professionals right
there I'm currently using most of these
ports on mine so for my external storage
the Pegasus the audio device the red mag
reader things like that but I have a
couple left over so I haven't found that
I need more ports but if I added another
5k monitor which you can do that would
fill my Thunderbolt 3 ports but so far
I'm alright now again it is an
all-in-one but technically it's an
all-in-one desktop and for any desktop I
gotta say I usually want the port's to
be pretty easily within reach so that's
yet another reason why I'd prefer a Mac
Pro but I'll link to this little Satechi
hope I got right below that like button
if you want more info on it and I'll
also link the 12 South Stand I have mine
on as well I've talked about them before
in my setup tour video but there's that
so number four is the built-in webcam so
it's now rocking this 1080p FaceTime
camera which you know this is also
better than a normal iMac but it's not
that great I mean we still have these
incredible cameras these 4k optically
stabilized cameras in this little device
here but in this entire bezel of this
whole iMac purim looking at this is the
best they could fit apparently not a big
deal so number five is the vents and the
cooling this is pretty minor but I Mac
Pro is dead silent even with a heavy
edit going on in Final Cut Pro or a
massive amount of multitasking it seems
like apples
pretty into keeping the fan speed low on
this thing I've heard it speed up maybe
twice ever while using it and both of
those times is word during rendering and
final cut so the slot at the bottom is
air intake and the vents at the top near
the stand or where the hot air is
blowing out some people have definitely
mentioned that it seems like the angle
of the IMAX stand would take the hot air
output and bounce it back into the cool
air vent but I've never found that the
fan spins fast enough to move the hot
air out that fast so it just kind of hot
air just kind of Rises and the cold air
intake takes in whatever is at your desk
level and that brings us to number six
the one that really matters the
internals like I mentioned this is a
maxed out iMac Pro here so this is the
18 cores E&amp;amp;W workstation chip the 128
gigs of air correcting memory 16
gigabytes of memory on that Vegas 64 GPU
and the 4 terabyte SSD workstation grade
parts and also something that doesn't
get talked about as much is the t2 chip
which is new to the iMac pro but that
integrates a bunch of the smaller
formerly discrete controllers into one
like the cameras image processor
encrypted storage etc and with the
performance I feel like I've actually
noticed a major difference in the way it
feels both in heavy everyday projects
and in the day-to-day which is not
something I thought I would now you can
look at benchmarks and obviously the 18
core Xeon and all the high-end specs are
going to destroy a regular i7 and all of
those and obviously I perform a little
bit something like a custom built PC but
just in the way I've been using it and
it's kind of like the eye test I've
noticed it feels faster which is awesome
a lot of the most intensive work I do in
the studio of course is video editing
and that's actually pretty GPU heavy
which matters more in Final Cut Pro I
Mac Pro flies through this stuff like an
iMac or even my trashcan Mac Pro never
quite could and of course every I my
craft ride has had Vegas 64 so that's
important but cutting through and
playing back a K read code at 12 to 1 or
even 8 to 1 compression on the timeline
would cripple a MacBook Pro it would
just kind of chug along with a lot of
dropped frames on any old Mac Pro but it
plays through almost like pro res on
this iMac Pro this is in the better
performance mode obviously but I can add
effects colors layer stuff on top and it
plays it back smoothly after maybe a
split second of buffering which is
awesome it makes video editing feel a
lot better it feels easier in a weird
way so from top to bottom performance
has been great you know the bottom just
being swapping around the UI and just
web browsing in Safari and Chrome all
the way up to the most demanding work my
Mac Pro has absolutely been worth it for
what I've put it through so we actually
have this kind of a unscientific scale
for measuring render times and videos
out of Final Cut Pro we measure it in
how many games of rocket league we can
play before it's done exporting so
finishing an 8k raw project transcoding
and down to 4k on the trashcan Mac Pro
for example would you know you hit the
render button and then you head over to
the ps4 boot it up fire up rocket league
and we get in two to three full games of
rocket league before you turn around and
it's done rendering and we can upload we
got the ten core I mic Pro in here and
it was the same thing you'd hit render
and then you go over and fire up the ps4
get to rocket League and we get like one
full game but by the middle of the
second game you turn around and this
thing is done already the 18 core iMac
pro this literally happened we hit
render and then we went over the ps4 and
booted it up and there was like a little
software update for rocket League so we
fired that up and before that even
finished before what you think got to
start playing this was done exporting
the video but even when it all goes
normally everything boots and you fire
up rocket League will get in maybe one
game before we turn around and it's done
and ready to upload damn that is
immensely satisfying because now you you
actually know that only the most major
most intense projects will actually take
a long time to render and more normal
videos that are just a couple minutes
long
won't take forever so if it isn't
already clear by now I really like the
new iMac Pro a lot more than I thought I
would I am fully aware that yes you can
build a PC with a bit more for a bit
less you can customize a tower
infinitely more of course as a matter of
fact I still plan on moving on to a
fully modular desktop Mac Pro when it
eventually does come out but now that
I'm Mac Pro exists as a product and I've
used it I can comfortably recommend it
to what I would consider graphics
professionals and Final Cut editors
alike
it's the elegant clean super-powerful
Space Gray all-in-one
it's it's the iMac I always wanted at
the end of the day this is my new
full-time daily use and editing machine
for everything for now obviously I'm
willing to deal with the bigger bezels
and the non upgradable display and the
totally sealed internals because the
performance is that good and at the end
of the day that's what I'm paying for if
you are a Final Cut Pro Editor as a
professional this is worth it 100%
no-brainer if you're a pro using some
other suite of apps like maybe the Adobe
suite or something else consider if you
can get away with doing all the things
you do now on a regular high-end iMac or
not so if you're an Adobe like the
premier suite or after effects maybe not
this would definitely benefit or if
you're in like Maya or Maxthon again
you'll benefit a lot here but if you're
in motion or maybe something else maybe
not but my last piece of advice if if
you're considering buying an iMac Pro
and you're trying to think about where
to save money where you should upgrade
because it's not an upgradeable machine
I would say go with the 10 core if you
can only upgrade one thing that seems to
be the sweet spot in terms of cores
versus clock speed obviously it's not
appealing to be stuck with the same
amount of RAM forever like you are with
an iMac Pro but I think the 64 gigs of
the base model is actually enough for a
lot of people and then of course if you
can find the room to upgrade one more
thing I would highly suggest the GPU
upgrading to the Vegas 64 that's where a
lot of the big improvements with
performance with Final Cut Pro and just
with moving around the OS and general
swiping back and forth between spaces
that's all been improved with that so
all that being said I Mac Pro turns out
to actually be a pretty good buy
especially if you're in the category as
I described all that also being said
modular Mac Pro this has me a lot more
excited for that either way that's been
it let me know what you think thanks for
watching talk to you guys in the next
