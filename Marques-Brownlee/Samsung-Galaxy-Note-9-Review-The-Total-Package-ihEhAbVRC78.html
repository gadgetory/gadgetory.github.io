this is the Samsung Galaxy Note 9 an
absolute unit this is that Android phone
again that starts at a thousand bucks
this year which is making headlines
again it's a very expensive phone I've
been using it since it came out since
that impressions video so for well over
a week and I got to say I think it's
worth it so last year I was talking
about the five pillars of a great smart
phone so if you recall some of my
previous reviews I've had about five
pillars of a great smart phone those
five and the one that the note 8 didn't
have was great battery but literally
everything else about it was great and
it's still one phone of the year this
year the note 9 upgrades literally
everything about that phone and makes
the biggest improvement to the battery
so it's getting a lot of flack for being
just an incremental upgrade to the note
8 but actually think that's one of the
best compliments that you could give a
phone right now so what are those
pillars again you might be asking they
are great display great build quality
great performance great camera and great
battery life I always say if you check
every single box you got yourself a
great quality smartphone if we look at
galaxy no.9 now it checks every single
box and then some so the display is
incredible some including me we even say
it's literally the best display in any
phone last year's note was already the
best display in any phone this year it's
point one inches bigger and it's
magnificently bright you can read it
outdoors in direct sunlight it's super
vibrant and contrasting color accurate
this is an A+ display great for gaming
for watching videos and also no not in
case you forgot about that the only
downside to a display like this is how
big it makes the phone feel I just came
from the oneplus 6 as you know with a
smaller display and the pixel before
that and using an iPhone 10 a lot so
moving up to this note it's one of the
few phones that really makes me work
hard to use it with one hand and I
prefer often to use it with two hands
and I don't say that about a lot of
phones so there's a lot of reaching to
get up to the top of the display and
then back down to the bottom and you're
gonna notice it but then again if you're
getting a note you already know what
you're getting yourself into and
sometimes that's just something you
gotta calibrate
for but all in all great display no
question that gets a thumbs up and that
kind of leads me into the second part
which is great build quality with the
infinity to display the kind of bleeding
of the edge of the screen over Samsung
still does that it's recognizable versus
other phones that don't do this and I
like it it they don't have to reinvent
the wheel here they found something that
makes it feel really immersive and they
just keep doing that well but really I
think we just keep forgetting like the
build quality the industrial design or
just generally the hardware of this
phone is one of the most underrated
things about it it's really great you
have the premium build materials right
so you got metal all the way around this
is the new blue one that I actually kind
of liked a lot tight corners like really
boxy as a phone much more squared off
than most but I like that they still
have the rounded corners of the display
but not by a whole lot and then overall
it just has this chiseled dense look and
feel and it checks a lot of boxes
it's ip68 water-resistant it has a
headphone jack it has excellent clicky
buttons and I'll talk more about those
in a bit and one of the more underrated
upgrades to the hardware is the speakers
they're in the same place as they were
but they're now much louder and fuller
sounding and just straight up better
than before I definitely appreciate that
slight downside to the hardware is the
glossy back that will 100% collect tons
of fingerprints as you can see as good
as Samsung's glass looks when it's clean
it can get pretty clouded up but
obviously the easy fix you can drop a
dbrand skin on it I may recommend a
black skin specifically for this one so
you can rock a super clean black and
yellow look with that s-pen but overall
this thing is built like a tank build
quality is not a problem on the note 9
I'd even say it technically counts as a
little bit of an upgrade because they
move the fingerprint reader down just a
little bit to be more reachable minor
detail but makes a difference when
you're using it every day but build
quality is great okay so performance
galaxy note 9 has been a great performer
it's a fast high-end flagship so you'd
expect that Snapdragon a 45 and 60 eggs
of ram here etc I'm always worried about
Samsung's skin though because it's not
light it's kind of a lot you worry about
software updates with it but from my
youth so far it's been smooth and snappy
it's what I've come to expect and it's
gotten one software update so far now
this is 128 gig version with 6 gigs of
RAM
yet gotten to try myself the 512 gigan
with 8 gigs of ram but the thing about
that first of all it's 250 bucks more
expensive than the baseline version so
that's a lot and then I don't really see
myself actually using 500 gigs of
storage on a phone as amazing as it is I
love that it's an option it's 2018 why
not push that limit but almost all the
stuff I use as far as media music photos
the stuff is all cloud-based anyway if
you are the type of person to have an
insane amount of local media and movies
and games whatever it is you're doing
there can only be one phone that's
offering this half a terabyte of storage
right now I mean maybe 2 or 3 but that's
what note is all about giving you these
power user features plus an extra 2 gigs
of RAM doesn't hurt but I think pretty
much anyone including me will be fine
with the 128 6 and then there is also a
new cooling system to mention so Zack
jerry-rigged everything he tore into his
note 9 and showed the much bigger copper
heat pipe inside this phone Samsung
calls it a water carbon cooling system
all I can tell you is just from using it
this phone definitely still gets a
little bit warm on the back especially
when gaming for a while or navigating in
a warm window of your dashboard or
something like that but definitely never
overheated it is for sure a great gaming
phone though it has the specs and more
to keep up and the most incredible
display and some upgraded speakers so
that's still a solid combo and so then
there is the camera or cameras and this
is a this is the firmly third place
camera as far as smartphones go right
now which is pretty awesome I mean you
got pixel to you at the top which is
amazing then you got this an iPhone 10
right around second and third you can
watch the blind test video if you don't
believe me but this is essentially the
exact same camera setup as the galaxy s
9 plus from a couple months ago which
makes it an upgrade from the last note
so just like the s 9 plus you give it a
lot of light and it is an excellent
camera you can get real shallow depth of
field if you get close enough to your
subject as you're pretty classic Samsung
vibrant colors and slight
over-processing as far as sharpening and
noise reduction you've already heard
this all for me before the one new
addition is the AI in the settings which
they call a scene optimizer that will
automatically adjust certain colors when
it recognizes a subject so with flowers
that might boost the warmer colors or
with land
escapes it might boost the blue of the
sky but I found this more inconsistent
and annoying to me than useful so I
turned it off after a while but what I
do think was useful is what they called
flaw detection where basically if
someone blinks there the photos blurry
or it finds a red eye or something's
messed up in some way it'll let you know
right away so you can take another one
that part's cool but overall yeah so
Galaxy Note 8 had a great camera then
galaxy s 9 and s 9 plus had great camera
now we got no nine still great camera so
that brings us to what you were all
probably wondering about from beginning
which is the battery the no nine bumps
up to a four thousand milliamp hour
battery which is a pretty big jump from
last year last year they were a little
conservative you know sort of following
up on the heels of the problems they had
so they had a 3300 milliamp hour battery
in note 8 so that's a plus 20% battery
capacity sighs that's not iterative I
know a lot of things we've said about
this phone have been iterative that's
not that is a massive jump but that's
just on paper so as far as actual life
of the phone goes it's not the best
battery life of any phone that that'll
still go to phones with smaller screens
but note 9 is now comfortably lasting
all day with a little extra room to
spare which it didn't do that before so
I'm getting around 5 hours of screen on
time with most of my days occasionally a
little more never really less which with
my heavy usage is pretty damn good I'm
gonna say a minus grade battery that I
was pretty happy with obviously having a
massive six point four inch super bright
display cranked on all the time is gonna
take a toll on a phone so we felt that
last year with the big screen I think
four thousand milliamp hours is actually
the appropriate battery size for the
Galaxy Note and I don't think anyone
getting it will be disappointed this is
great battery life so looks like they
did it they like I said literally
upgraded everything on paper about this
phone from last year which was already
good so I mean you got a better bigger
brighter display it's great he got a
great performance he got a great build
quality he got a great battery life and
a great camera now all in one phone and
like the note always does also has a ton
of extras just because samsung has tons
of features to throw in for people who
are into that kind of stuff those are
people who are buying the note like all
the different screen modes and advanced
tinkering Samsung throws in the settings
for people who want to dial
the exact color balance and look at
their displays things like that it's not
it's clearly not flawless such a
perfectly placed bixby button that can't
be remapped I can't ignore that it's a
damn shame
I just want to remap the big suis button
to launch Google or Twitter or something
else I want to do what you can't
Samsung I thought you were about that
and the s-pen remote feature it works
and it's great I I just don't see myself
using it all that much
I don't do powerpoints from my phone or
any presentations or stuff like that so
I still just use the s-pen for just
taking it out jotting down a note and
putting it away you know the extra
features are welcome and there will be
people who love them and use them a lot
but it turns out I'm just one of those
people who use a stylus the way I always
have but for me at the end of the day
honestly I would have no problem using
this phone every single day it checks so
many boxes you can't really find another
phone that does an incredible high res
OLED display no not CH ip68 water
resistance a headphone jack and then up
to half a terabyte of flash storage
Snapdragon 845 8 gigs of ram expandable
storage on top of that dual cameras both
of oh is and a four thousand milliamp
hour battery
a thousand bucks is a lot to spend on a
phone but if you're gonna spend a
thousand bucks on one this is for sure
the one to get you're getting your
money's worth and people who are looking
into buying a note already know what
they're getting themselves into and
they're gonna love this but if you're in
the other side of that camp if you're
not a note person if you're if you're
already typing in the comments a
thousand bucks is way too much to spend
on a phone I would never do that then a
phone like the Galaxy S nine or s9 plus
which are several hundred dollars less
that's gonna be there out for you to go
so Samsung is kind of offering the whole
wealth of different budget options and
you can choose and I think you'll find
something you like in there it's a good
phone good job Samsung until the next
one thanks for watching
dodgy guys later peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
