display part 1 hey what is up guys i'm
kb HD here and this is the galaxy note 3
from samsung this phone is really new
it's really quite nice so far and it's
really big this is a huge phone and it's
not the biggest phone out there
obviously but we kind of had to see this
coming I mean the first Galaxy Note was
a runaway success and I had a screen
size of 5.3 inches and then the Galaxy
Note 2 came out a year after that and it
has screen size of 5.5 inches and here
we have the Galaxy Note 3 and the screen
is 5.7 inches diagonal now I have big
hands so sometimes it's kind of hard for
me to show how large or small devices
are relative to other things and I mean
you know this phone is big but it's kind
of hard to show exactly how big it is so
that is exactly what this video is for
I'm gonna be comparing it to some other
relatively similar sized smartphones and
some other household objects to
hopefully give you a better idea of
exactly how big the Galaxy Note 3 is now
no this is not the full review obviously
this is just a size comparison but that
is definitely coming up soon so be sure
to subscribe below if you haven't
already to be among the first to see
that when it comes out it'll be a very
in-depth video but without any further
ado let's go ahead and check this out so
the easiest way to get the point across
is with the exact dimensions of the Note
3 so if you have a ruler get it out
handy this device is 5.95 inches tall by
three point one two inches wide and 0.33
inches thick
that's 151 millimeters in height and 71
millimeters wide and the thickness is
8.3 millimeters so it's actually a
little bit narrower than the Galaxy Note
2 was by a little bit as you can see
they really took the design of the
galaxy s4 here but you might not have a
Galaxy Note 2 or a galaxy s4 but here's
something a bit more familiar this is
the iPhone 5s and all its fingerprint
sensor glory this iPhone has a 4-inch
display diagonally so I'll move that
over the side here now there's another
phone that comes in a similar size body
but with a slightly larger display and
that's this moto X and that comes with a
4.7 inch display and you can see how
similarly size is actually out
put them next to each other but a lot of
people don't get to do that but either
way moving right on up here we have a
five inch display in the form of a
galaxy s4 and you can see we're starting
to get a little bit bigger here to the
point where you think that's a
significantly larger device than the
iPhone and then we get to another even
larger device the Oppo find five that
also has a five inch display but when
you put it alongside the galaxy s4 you
can see it looks even bigger and you're
starting to push the limits of your
pockets here and of course then we bring
in the galaxy note 3 this is our 5.7
inch display and you can see it actually
doesn't look all that much bigger than
the Oppo find 5 despite having a much
much larger display but at the end of
the day when you zoom out a little bit
and take a look at the smallest of the
tablets it's still nowhere near the size
of the Nexus 7 and it's significantly
more pocketable so the bottom line here
is a Galaxy Note 3 it's big it's not
ridiculously big it's not too big for
most people like some other devices that
I have shown on this channel before and
some more that I have in the pipeline
obviously but it's nice to know exactly
how big it is relative some other things
on a scale now there are some devices
that I wasn't able to show you guys
because I don't have them but I'm gonna
point you guys to a link right below
that like button to phone arena site and
they have a tool at that link where you
can actually basically calibrate your
display to the phone you have and hold
it up to the display and get a real-time
comparison of what other similarly sized
smartphones look like so it's really
useful tool so if you have a smartphone
that I didn't show or if you just have a
smart phone and want to see the exact
representation of the note 3 size
relative to your phone you can do that
at this tool so I'm gonna point you to
that
that's the link below that like button
either way this has been it thank you
for watching if you enjoyed it feel free
to give a thumbs up and without any
further ado I'll sign off and get to
work and get to testing got some testing
with you
