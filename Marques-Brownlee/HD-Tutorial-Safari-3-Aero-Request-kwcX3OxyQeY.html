here from mkbhd and i'm here with
another quick tutorial this tutorial is
more or less about a ton of questions
I've been getting so yes this is a
request video but there are no channel
links in the description because this
was so highly requested I've gotten a
lot of questions about how i got safari
3 I never even never even minding the
homepage how I got safari three to have
those arrow borders now i'm running
windows vista home premium 64-bit and it
does have those those windows outsides
it has the little transparency going on
on the outside and the transparent
toolbar and I'm instead of having a
little mac OS 10 the tiny little dots
and I do remember watching a video about
how to do it but every time someone
asked I couldn't really recall it so now
that I found the way and I've actually
um given a few people the answer I'll be
able to show you guys now how to do it
so here's the here's what it look like
first of all we're going to go into our
Start menu and type in Safari so that we
can actually go into this farias
properties right click on it or you
could do this to the icon on your
desktop it works the same way and go to
properties and actually in properties if
we just go under compatibility which is
the third tab from the left to the right
you'll see a disabled visual themes not
normally that will be unchecked and
it'll look like this so i will apply hit
ok open safari and you see here it has
those tiny little mac OS 10 buttons you
don't get that arrow theme so now let me
exit this out and right click on safari
go to properties compatibility and what
we're going to do is disable visual
themes because the visual themes that
Apple applies to Safari is actually that
that toolbar thing because um basically
windows wants to apply that arrow tool
bar to every application unless it has a
different sort of theme like a game or
something so yeah we just hit apply we
hit ok and every time you open up safari
from now on it'll look a little more
like Firefox or whatever you wanted to
look like and it has that arrow theme so
i hope this i hope this tutorial was
helpful to you guys i hope you you enjoy
that new arrow theme kind of looking a
little like safari for beta but not
sacrificing any of the features you like
in safari 3 so thanks for watching this
one guys
I hope it was helpful and stay tuned I
got two or three more hardware videos
and unboxing I got a lot of stuff a lot
of ideas also for more tutorials for you
guys so if you like what you see here
subscribe and trust me you'll be entered
into all my giveaways that's a new thing
and that's basically it so thanks for
watching please</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
