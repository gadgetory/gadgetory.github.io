mkbhd channel back with another youtube
tips episode so thumbs up to that and
this is actually a video featuring my
good friend duncan three three three oh
three Austin Evans so if you'd like to
check out his channel BAM it's right
there
you can visit the other half of this
video which will show you some more of
these youtube tips that were going over
to create better videos so we're going
to start off with is the more off-camera
things in this video in the other video
we talked about the camera itself the
first thing I'm going to talk about is
sound and you might see my microphone
right here
the first thing we talked about in terms
of sound is what type of microphone
you're using so we'll start with a USB
microphone a youtube favorite four USB
microphones is the blue snowball very
very popular you'll see this all over
YouTube people really enjoy the
convenience of having it just sit right
on your desk plug it right in and play
literally plug and play and just go
right there so it's a very popular
choice and you can get some options on
the back for changing the patterns the
second option for a microphone would be
something that mounts directly on the
top of the hot shoe of the camera itself
a lot of Canon DSLRs and Canon
camcorders have a microphone jack so the
most popular I think YouTube on camera
mic is a rode videomic you've probably
seen this before
just mounts right on top of the camera
and hotshoe and is a very popular option
for those of you guys who get a camera
with a microphone input and last but not
least there's a completely off camera
stuff that literally sits next to you
and you can position wherever you want
not connected to a computer and the
number one option for that would be the
zoom h1 now you do have to post per dose
you literally have to go back and sync
the audio in post-production that's a
step you don't have to do usually with
on-camera microphones or usually with
USB microphones so if you do prefer to
have the most control over where you put
your microphone and how much volume you
get out of it the zoom h1 is a great
option and very popular for YouTube when
the best parts of having a DSLR is the
interchangeable lenses what this means
is you can swap out the lens for
whatever you want so for example I'm
shooting right here prime lens is going
to be nice if I'm going to be doing a
lot of zooming of course it's super zoom
is going to be good if you just want to
get by cheaply the kit lens on your
camera is going to be just fine
however for video I really like having a
prime lens so for my pick on a candidate
would be the 50 millimeter 1.8 now this
is
absolutely cheap lens it built cheaply
called the plastic fantastic however it
is fantastic so you're going to get some
really nice depth of field and it's
going to get some pretty sharp images
for the price likewise if you like Nikon
cameras the Nikon 50mm 50 millimeter 1.8
is also going to be a good choice now
both of these lenses are not going to be
absolutely superb you can absolutely get
better as you spend more money before
relatively reasonable budget both of
these are going to be really good for
filming YouTube videos so lighting is a
pretty popular option also and in terms
of YouTube videos you typically the more
light the better you like to be able to
see your subject and three-point
lighting is the most popular way to get
your videos lit so say you're lighting
an object you can take advantage before
you buy anything of a lot of free light
lights for a you know comes from the Sun
you can use some windows that you have
you can use a video light that's
completely out of the range you know you
can have a light just from the top of
your room and once you get all those
lights on you just want to make sure you
have a pretty accurate color
representation before you go out and buy
more lights if you do choose to buy
lights there are some very inexpensive
light kits from things like Amazon and
some even dedicated retailers for video
stuff but I suggest that before you go
out and buy lights and take advantage of
as much free light as possible that's
going to help you out a lot of course at
the end of the day no matter what
equipment you have you're going to need
to add your videos and my recommendation
if you're on Windows is to check out
coral VideoStudio Pro x4 so I've been
using videos to do for the past couple
years now well it's certainly not going
to be as advanced as something like Sony
Vegas it's also going to be a lot
cheaper and a lot simpler to use so it
does have plenty of power with all kinds
of picture and picture support chroma
key everything that you'd really need
of course it's a little much cheaper
price point it should run pretty nicely
on most computers on a Mac I recommend
iMovie now a lot of people kind of
dismiss iMovie better that's a little
unfair well sure yes it is free and it
does come with all Macs that's not to
say it's not any good so I movie does of
course support a lot of the same things
that video studio does a lot of the kind
of mid-range features that most people
would need but not a lot of they're
really extreme stuff that stuff like
Final Cut has that's going to cost
obviously a lot more than free so that's
basically it for this YouTube tips
episode but keep in mind this is only
part 1 so like I said before you can
check out part 2 whenever
you want is probably done watching this
video now so check out part 2 on
Austin's channel Duncan 3 3 303 and you
can subscribe to him as well thanks for
watching guys I'll talk to you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
