these are the audio technica ath m70x
yes there's been a lot of curiosity
about these brand new headphones coming
out especially since the a th m 50s have
been so damn popular and these seem to
have an upgraded name and a bigger price
tag with an MSRP up over 400 bucks
although you can get them on Amazon for
300 bucks linked below so with the m70x
the number one question I get and
actually the easiest way to talk about
them is how do they compare to the M 50s
the M 50s get all this praise all the
time for being some of the most
incredible sounding headphones for a
very low price so now that the M 70s
come along for a much higher price
naturally we're all curious about if
they're that much better so with
headphones my comparisons can be very
simple I don't have to worry about
battery life or display tech or anything
crazy like that
it's just how they're built and how they
sound so with the build quality the m70x
are very simple and pretty similar to
the M 50s I'll be honest I was looking
for a bunch more metal or other premium
materials because I honestly expected
that with such a price increase but nope
it's all steel hardened plastic again
this time with a matte coat instead of
glossy plastic so it's a soft touch and
they have a pretty traditional styling a
pretty sharp tuxedo look here in black I
think it'd be much more interesting if
they offered it in some other colors
like the M 50s but that might come later
so they ditched the big bold Technica
branding on the top of the M 50s for a
much simpler subdued look on the M 70s
but this band here is still very
flexible it will suit all sorts of head
sizes although now it is actually only
padded in the middle where it actually
touches your head and overall the
headphones are just actually a lot
lighter this makes them more comfortable
to wear for longer periods of time
actually no that was a pretty big
complaint about the M 50s that there
were a little bit too tight the M 70s
still have a fantastic seal with even
softer ear cups and
all around them but they sit a little
bit lighter on your head now the only
one notable difference here with the EM
70s is that they don't fold anymore so
if you remember them 50s those could
fold up right on and just fit in like a
little travel bag with about half the
footprint of being fully expanded and
the EM 70s are lacking that hinge that
it needs to do that so you can still
swivel the ear-cups 90 degrees to lie
flat but that means you need a larger
case here that actually comes with it to
store them and travel and I guess that's
a pro and a con it's a con because they
are a bit bigger and it requires more
space they don't fit into quite a small
of a bag but it is a really nice case
that it comes with it's a high-quality
hardshell with padding on the inside and
this soft matte finish on the outside
that's pretty pleasant to hold so it's
free and it comes with in everything so
that's great
I also get an additional cable bag on
the inside too I didn't use it that much
since I really only used the one coiled
cable but the m70 s do come with three
cables so it has a two meter long short
straight cable a three meter long long
straight cable and a three meter long
Club cable so I use a coiled one most
often like I said and they all connect
to the headphones via that same new
twist and lock mechanism that we saw on
the m50x so again it does mean you can't
really use any third-party cables if you
wanted something colorful or something
braided or something like that but the
twist and lock is a pretty secure fit
and a high quality way to connect your
cable so overall yeah these things are
built pretty well but there's obviously
nothing spectacular about them which I
guess it isn't really meant to be you'll
see why in a second but of course the
most interesting part is how they sound
so I did a lot of listening I don't know
if I believe in the whole burning in
headphones or anything but I've had
these for about a week now and I've been
doing plenty of listening mostly to
music lots of it on Spotify on my phone
but that also plugged into the DAC on
Mike and Peter and how to listen to some
higher quality audio files there
including actually mixing the last video
I did which was the Dell tablet review
and the bottom line about the sound is
this
these are studio monitors like for real
so that means they have a very neutral
sound signature which is what you want
if you're monitoring or mixing audio to
the untrained
year that may sound like it's lacking
base or even might be a little bit tinny
but you got to understand that this flat
frequency response is exactly what you
want when editing so the m50 s will
sound very rich because they do have
more bass in the EM 70s they'll sound
way more colored and they will continue
to sound better for everyday listening
and music and movies and gaming and all
sorts of stuff like that but for
monitoring and mixing and producing the
even more flat sound and lightweight
comfort of the EM 70s
is really what you want now if we back
up for a second the EM in m70x stands
for monitors right so closed back
headphones but audio technica actually
newly introduced something called the
ATH our 70 X and our is for open back
reference headphones and a lot of times
when you step up in price for audio
quality like this you're going to want
to move to open bag headphones it's kind
of like moving two speakers in your room
that are right next to your ears it's
something that I can explain in a later
video but for now I think the m70x is
really the upper limit when it comes to
closed back production headphones that
you want to get in this price if you've
bought the EM 50s or the m50x already no
need to worry I'm going to continue
using and recommending them in their
ridiculously awesome price bracket for
their rich clear sound I use them all
the time for traveling and listening but
for production headphones I say for the
price the EM 70s are starting to compete
with some open-back headphones but if
you absolutely must have closed back
monitors can't go wrong with these so
there you go that's the audio technica
ath m70x and a recap of the m50x thank
you for watching and i'll talk to you
guys in the next one bass
