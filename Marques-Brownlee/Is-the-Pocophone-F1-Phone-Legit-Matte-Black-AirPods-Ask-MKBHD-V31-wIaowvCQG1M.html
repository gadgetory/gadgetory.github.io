mkbhd number 31 for august 2018 first
things first the merch is back so
they're probably aware by now the merch
sort of comes and goes and waves but
every time we get a new wave of things
it's announced thing you guys all know
when it goes on sale and we'll link it
below and everything and every time we
do this we also tend to add a couple
things I think this might be my favorite
group of things we've added yet so the
glitch shirt which you've seen in a
previous video there's also the matte
black hoodie which I've also worn
previously they're actually some people
got mad at me when I called it a hoodie
because it's it's technically a
windbreaker or a jacket I think all
these words are fine it has a hood so I
called it a hoodie but it's got a couple
interesting things about it mine's
really wrinkly right now but it has this
little logo and it's made of 3m material
where it's kind of really subtle but
when you shine of a light on it or like
take a flash photo it's really
reflective so that's pretty sweet and
it's also appropriate because
technically some are just ended I think
two days ago is the first day of autumn
so having a little windbreaker is not
such a bad thing and then one of my
all-time favorites I'm sure these these
matte black air pods with you guys in
the past especially on like Twitter and
Instagram color wear who we worked with
who generously made these was
comfortable enough with doing a batch of
them a super limited edition batch that
is now also in the merch tour which is
pretty sick there are definitely not
cheap it's expensive to do these like
handcrafted painted air pods and get
them as precise as color wear it does
but they've done it and if you're crazy
enough to actually want these well you
can get them now and last but not least
is these couple of wristbands which I
think are pretty sweet I've shown these
before and there's been people asking
where they can get the bands that have
worn in videos so that's a thing now the
links below like I've said okay let's
get any questions so obviously August
was a pretty incredible month for a lot
of reasons most of the questions I think
were about the Elon interview or about
Elon or Tesla of some kind I can kind of
address some of the fa Q's or things you
might not know but right off the top I
can say I mean honestly what an amazing
experience it was a lot of fun it was a
big learning
variants going into an environment like
that and trying to shoot a video again I
highly recommend watching John's behind
the scenes video where you get an idea
of not just the the gear we used and the
sort of a process that went into making
that and the rehearsal we had before but
just the the chaos of actually going
into a factory and trying to make a
video there I've gotten a lot of like
interview requests from news companies
who want to interview me about the
interview but what I've noticed I've
declined them all but something I've
noticed is a lot of their questions have
a pretty similar theme to them so aside
from the like typical how is Elon
obviously he was super nice with us and
very generous with his time that he gave
us but it was mostly a lot of questions
like why didn't you talk about X or why
didn't you do this do X Y &amp;amp; Z so first
off this all came from or was born from
a Twitter conversation which is kind of
amazing and it all when it was all
locked down and scheduled we had
scheduled 30 minutes that was our
absolute guarantee you'll get at least
30 minutes may or may not be more
depending on how it goes but plan to do
everything in half an hour now knowing
that most of the interviews he's done or
he's had to do like in the last year are
these like super stiff sit-down
interviews we wanted to make this one a
little more fun so it was split into two
halves which you saw it was to sit down
just conversational half and then the
sort of a factory tour part but I have
to sort of self time in my head getting
all this down in 30 minutes because once
the 30 minutes is up it's sort of the
guarantee is over and it may end at any
time so that little notebook you saw
next to me in the interview the one on
the chair that I never once reached for
during the entire video that one that's
this notebook here that one had that I
wrote down all of my questions in it
that's when they saw me rehearsing with
in John's video I'd written down all of
my pages of questions they were all on
this once we got in the interview and we
sit down shook hands and started talking
and the conversation just sort of went
and I never once never once looked at
that notebook during the talk that was
useful that I kind of had most of the
things I wanted to talk about memorized
and the conversation actually sort of
nicely flowed between those things it's
not the same order that I wrote down but
it was Chloe we just talked about Tesla
and tech for a while but I definitely
there were a couple things in here
that I wanted to ask that I didn't for
sure so yeah for everyone wondering why
I didn't ask you on what phone you
carries that's because I didn't get to
it although I'm pretty sure you can tell
it's an iPhone like it it's definitely
an iPhone so anyway yes I definitely
again recommend you watch the BTS video
and now on to the Twitter questions so
will you will you use the pixel three as
a main driver if it has that knotch
so I don't know if you've been living
under a rock or just not paying
attention to any tech news but the pixel
three XL specifically over the last like
three weeks has been leaked into
oblivion I think there's actually a full
review of the phone out already and it's
still two months away from being
officially announced like legit for real
this time Google could probably just
have someone walk onstage at the event
and just go yep that was it and walk
offstage
and just a price shows up that would
just be it but of course naturally what
a lot of people are focusing on is that
gigantic notch up at the top
first of all yes I'm gonna test and use
the pixel three and the three XL I am
NOT a fan of the just massive notch it
seems to have but I'm still interested
in that phone because of the camera it's
gonna have a better write a better
camera and possibly an interesting
better front-facing camera or camera
pair than the current pixel too so I'll
be interested in that it looks like it's
keeping the front-facing speakers as
well but it is a just ridiculously ugly
horrible looking knotch
if the leaks are true which they
probably are did you see this poco phone
f1 what are your impressions about the
super aggressive pricing I've read
mostly information about this xiaomi
poco f1 so if they did their poco f1 and
then F phone same thing essential did
you guys have seen that already but I've
seen most of the stuff about this phone
on my timeline it's apparently an
extremely inexpensive phone Snapdragon
8045 six gigs of ram top-notch specs
under 300 bucks not coming to the US I
think it's India only for now but bottom
line yes I am interested in it I hope to
actually probably get my hands on it
soon depending on how fast that
availability happens but it's kind of
getting a peel the same way oneplus
originally got my attention which was a
lot of bang for the buck
bringing the highest end specs you can
get into the lowest imaginable price
that's like why most people
are paying attention to the poco phone
which by the way not a good name you
should have just called it the xiaomi f1
separate video on the flamethrower I
don't know I don't know if it's worth
it's kind of a is it worth a separate
video it's just a small little it's a
prop essentially it ends up looking
pretty cool on camera relative to most
other flamethrowers and I don't know I I
guess I could see it being worth maybe a
short Twitter video or something like
that I don't know it's kind of needs a
propane tank and it's it's a prop right
now right now if someone asked if this
poco f1 is a one plus killer again if
it's only one market right now which is
just India then I can't say it's a one
plus killer because oneplus isn't a
bunch of places and may even be coming
to carriers with the next version which
is a big deal in the u.s. that's how you
get in people's pockets but yeah it's
again a lot of parallels with oneplus I
agree with that have you ever cleaned
your read sensor no but that does kind
of remind me of a funny story
so I travel a lot with camera gear as
you probably already know and it's
always in like the same couple of
think-tank bags it's the the one that's
the exact size of the domestic overhead
bin it fits perfectly every time we have
this layout that we go through I'm used
to traveling with camera stuff so what
I'm also used to is going through TSA
and when I have that bag which has all
the batteries in it and the camera body
and the carbon fiber they always see
that and pull it to the side and open it
up and swab it it's like 90% of the time
but I'm flying through these big
airports like Newark and San Francisco
and LA and usually they just pull to the
side swab it it doesn't come up with
anything close it give it back to you
you're good that's fine but a couple
weeks ago or months ago we were on a
shoot where we went to we flew into the
smaller I think it's San Jose or
somewhere in there a smaller Airport and
so we were one of the first flights out
of there like 7:00 in the morning there
is no one else in the TSA line no one
else in the security line just the crew
and the camera bags and they're gonna
check they got nothing else to do at
6:30 in the morning at the airport if
these things go through the x-ray and
they look a little bit weird they're
gonna swab them and they're gonna check
it but these guys not only did they swab
you know the inside of the bag they took
out all of my lenses Oh
all the lenses in the bag took the top
of the lens off took the body cap of the
lens off and swab the glass on both ends
and looked through it to make sure it
was glass that's like five or six lenses
right there then they get to the camera
and I'm okay with all this up to this
point like I get it you're doing your
job this is what you're supposed to do
but they get to the camera the red
monstro and they're like yeah we're
gonna have to swab the inside of this
and I'm like okay wait a second no he
wanted to open up the body cap and make
sure it's a sensor and swab the inside
of it and I drew the line there but they
did do their job and and check the rest
of our gear and eventually we made it
through that Airport but yeah that's
funny that they wanted I don't know if
they I don't know if they knew what they
were doing whatever they kept this safe
the flight was safe everything was safe
what question did you forget or regret
not asking Ilan aside from the the
forgetting like that last part about
what phone you carry the one regret I
have is a question which was how did you
find these videos how does someone as
busy as Ilan who probably has better
things to do than watch youtube videos
end up watching tech videos at all land
on the channel decide that he's cool
enough with it to be on it how does that
happen by the YouTube algorithm to thank
for that or the trending page or just
maybe he just looked for some some phone
reviews one day who knows would you buy
would Joey would joy buy would you buy a
rim AK I would drive a rim AK but that's
also like a million dollar car so I
don't not gonna buy one how are you
liking your new kicks those okay so for
those who were wondering or think that
was my kicks of the date choice it
wasn't to go into that factory you need
steel toed boots and so Tesla provided
steel toed boots for the whole team we
weren't all rocking the nursing-home 2.0
s or anything crazy like that that was a
safety feature safety first
how much footage do you generally shoot
for one video the answer would vary a
lot between different video types like a
review way more typically a couple
hundred gigs closer to a terabyte but
this video it's just a lot of talking to
the camera one shot so I'll leave I'll
try to put the amount of footage this
video took up right here there you go if
you could shoot either Airy 2997
red 23 nine eight for a year which do
you choose how dare you John it's
actually you know what it's not actually
that bad I think I would just shoot re
2997 that's just me I know you guys know
I love red
but I also love 30 frames a second and I
could shoot Ari I could learn to shoot
Ari for a year it's only a year if you
told me like a a lifetime I might have
other thoughts about resolution and
things like that but for a year I'll
shoot all right that's fine what is the
biggest misconception for you as a
successful content creator that's easy
it's the amount of work that people
think it takes to make what we make even
a totally different topic level or
anything else like people watch a five
minute YouTube video and they assume it
took five ten fifteen minutes to make
people watch even if people watch I'd be
curious what you would think if you
watch a seven minute really well-done
review of something how long you think
the process from inception to completion
took and I think 99% people would guess
way not enough time videos that we make
in tech have a writing process a
research process like this sort of a
summary process to turn it into a video
form oftentimes there's storyboarding
and shot listing and shot planning and
they go into the actual shooting and
production phase and there's all the
editing and the post-production and
everything that goes with publishing it
and distributing it there's a lot it's
not like a seven-minute video it takes
an hour and I've said it before a
creatives greatest trick is making it
look easy but that still stands today
the biggest misconception people have
about youtubers period is how much work
they think goes into it but hey that's
where I'm gonna end it thank you guys
for all your questions on Twitter and
for watching this video for ask mkbhd in
general to live on hopefully the next
one's even more exciting but definitely
stay tuned in the next couple weeks for
some of the most exciting videos of the
year on this channel given what we just
had that should mean a little something
thanks for watching Josh you guys the
next one days</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
