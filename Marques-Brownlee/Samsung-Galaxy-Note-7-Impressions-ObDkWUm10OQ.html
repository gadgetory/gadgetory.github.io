the other day someone asked me like hey
I know you probably get this a lot but
what's the best phone out there right
now just the top dog just recommend one
and I just said galaxy s7 you know I
usually have a top phone that I can just
recommend to everyone
Nexus isn't for everyone specs aren't
for everyone but you know Galaxy s7 edge
it's the go-to right great screen great
camera great battery life it's fast some
fun features mixed in there can't really
go wrong so yeah I recommend that but
now galaxy note 7 has just been
announced and it's coming out on August
19th and as we expected note 7 is not
super different from the galaxy s7 edge
we already have in fact you could
probably call it like a galaxy s7 edge
plus and from the first impression this
is everything that was already great
about the galaxy s7 and then even better
so that's a good thing now first of all
just get it out the way what happened to
the note 6 I don't really know but with
the edge this is technically the seventh
note plus it just kind of lines up
better with the galaxy s7 so this phone
takes all that's great about the galaxy
s7 edge and adds all that's great about
the note series so from the s7 edge you
have your great specs you have the
Snapdragon 820 4 gigabytes of RAM you
know no 6 gigabytes but whatever you
basically have your gold standard here
at this point and you get your dual edge
display but adjust it a bit basically
they moved the apex of the curve a
little bit closer to the edges so
there's more flat glass at the front and
just a small curve on the sides but that
subtle curve really pushes the side
bezel to almost nothing as you can see
like this is something we were dreaming
about five years ago and now we have
this basically nearly bezel this phone
on the sides and they curved the glass
on the back this same way too so the
phone is symmetrical in shape in the
hand and it feels really good
plus it's all these premium materials
still as well the glass with the metal
rails all somewhere a little bit smaller
than the last note but also a little bit
bigger than the s7 edge but yeah overall
very familiar you also get the same
exact camera from the galaxy s7 a 12
megapixel F 1.7 shooter with optical
image stabilization and super quick
autofocus that's also good and I'm not
even mad that it's not a new camera this
one is already extremely good at
photos and videos and it might already
be the best low-light shooter in any
smartphone so I'll take that and then
you get the expandable microSD card
storage up to 256 gigabytes that's also
from the galaxy s7 and it's also now
fully ip68 waterproof like the galaxy s7
and even the stylus is waterproof too so
no need to worry about dropping in water
or even using it in the rain or anything
like that now from the note line of
course you bring in the bigger size so
the bigger display it's now your 5.7
inch quad HD Samsung Super AMOLED
display and from first impressions it's
super lit and you get the larger battery
as well it's a 3500 milliamp hour
battery in this bigger phone and then it
wouldn't be a note without all the added
s-pen features so of course the s-pen is
improved again this year like I said
it's also waterproof and now it's even
more sensitive and has a couple new
features my favorite just from the time
I played around with it is the jiff
capture which literally just lets you
screen capture any portion of your
screen quickly and save it immediately
as a gif jiff if it's super convenient
and it might be the most underrated
feature that nobody's talking about I
haven't always been a big stylist guy
honestly I usually try to give it a
chance at first but then gradually use
it less and less but when they add
convenience features like this it makes
me want to give another shot also I
almost tried to stick the s-pen in
Reverse just to see if it would get
stuck again but now I'm going to let
someone else try that anyway so you have
this Frankenstein combination of the two
best phones Samsung makes plus a couple
of extra features on top fast wireless
charging is still here and it works with
this sort of a moto mod like accessory
where you snap on a battery back on the
back of the phone and it Wireless
charges so it doesn't even need any pins
another thing is they finally switched
over to USB type-c so this is the first
USB C phone samsung has ever made it
still has fast charging might be a sign
of them starting to shift over all their
flagships to USB C in the future and
they even tossed in iris scanning as a
security feature now believe me I was
definitely skeptical about this like
when they set it on stage but they let
us try it and it seemed pretty damn cool
so you hold your phone up about a foot
from your face maybe a little less and
you just look at the phone to unlock it
it takes a couple seconds to set up
and then it seemed like each unlock got
a little bit quicker one after the next
like it was learning my eyes better and
after a while it was unlocking almost as
fast as the already really good
fingerprint sensor so it can seem like a
gimmick at first but it's good to know
at least it's a good gimmick it's not a
crappy trash feature it actually works
pretty well they have an entirely
separate IR sensor on the front of the
phone for this so it's not using the
front-facing camera and since it's
infrared it can work at night it can
work through sunglasses and apparently
it can't be tricked with a picture of
you apparently I'm definitely going to
try that though
so overall the Galaxy Note 7 looks like
it has a lot going for it I think the
stealthy black version might be my next
phone honestly looking at it of course
there's also the new blue one with the
gold sides looks pretty cool and then
there's the silver and gold phones
naturally as well but there's something
about a stealthy all-black phone that
draws me the software experience is
tuned up a bit again as you would expect
and obviously it's not like their skins
going anywhere they've been consistent
with this Samsung bright white and
colourful UX over the past couple years
but it's you know it's better than it
used to be I don't know I guess I'm a
fan so far from the first impression so
definitely stay tuned for the full
review so we can figure out if this guy
is worth the premium price tag it's
going to be going for so make sure you
subscribe to see that if you haven't
already and that's basically been it
that's the first impression thanks for
watching guys and I'll catch you in the
next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
