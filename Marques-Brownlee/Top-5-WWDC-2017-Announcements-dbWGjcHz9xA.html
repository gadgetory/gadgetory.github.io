today was Apple's WWDC 2017 and there
was a lot of stuff announced actually so
those of you don't want to sit through a
video of the entire three-hour keynote
that we sat through this video is for
you so there were actually six main
announcements at WWDC this is a top five
so that means one of them didn't make a
list so TV OS hope you don't mind didn't
make the top five but you know it's
better now it's refreshed it's got a new
UI it now supports Amazon Prime video
but yes about it so it didn't make the
top five but now I know about alright so
the number five announcement is a new
watch OS 4 for the Apple watch now I'm
not a big SmartWatch person and I don't
wear SmartWatch that often but if you do
you will notice that there are quite a
few little improvements to the Apple
watch they added some watch faces so a
kaleidoscope watch face which is fun a
Toy Story couple of washed faces and
also now a Serie watch face which shows
a bunch of new information and there's
some other minor stuff like being able
to send data back and forth between
compatible gym equipment and your watch
Apple watch is a pretty popular Fitness
watch so make sense but all together and
all these little minor improvements
there wasn't really anything massive
that would make someone who wasn't
considering it Smart Watch now think
about getting an Apple watch it was more
of a bunch of improvements that would
make someone who already owned one and
stopped wearing it try it again
maybe stop collecting dust on a shelf in
the corner maybe it'll do that for me
actually I'll try it so number four is a
new version of Mac OS so the current
version we have on every Mac the latest
version is Mac OS Sierra the latest
version now which now has a new name is
called Mac OS hi Sierra that's that's it
there's no that's there's no joke just
that's the new name I guess the
reasoning is it's supposed to be an
improvement on Sierra like a perfection
of all these little new features that
make it great so it's hi Sierra I don't
know just ignore the name again the idea
here is the same it's a refinement it
has a bunch of minor improvements things
like safari now auto blocks those
annoying autoplay video ads and I also
have intelligent ad tracking prevention
to help you stop seeing the same ads
over and over all over the web it also
now has a couple new filters and the
Photos app does a split view in the mail
app you know little things like that the
nerd in mail of the announcement of
h.265 support which is a new
yo codec which will now also be hardware
accelerated and built into Final Cut Pro
let's go and apples not gotten serious
about supporting VR and external GPUs so
for VR they're now supporting the unity
and unreal engines natively in Mac OS
and for external GPUs are now focused on
harnessing the power of Thunderbolt 3
and making that a more viable solution
for a lot of people so there's now
actually a developer kit with a
reference box external GPU enclosure
with a Radeon pro graphics card inside
that you can buy from Apple I kind of
want to get either way that's Mac OS hi
Sierra that's the real name public beta
coming in late June and then free
upgrade for all Mac users coming in the
fall now number three home pod now this
was the announcement that was probably
the most hyped coming into this event we
knew like a tiny bit of what might be
shown but there's a whole lot more that
just got revealed and it was a bit of a
surprise so the home pod is this this
balloon size like toaster small coaster
size high 5 speaker that also has some
assistant features built in on top I
know I personally don't think home pod
is that good of an idea for a name I
would've gone with something probably
more like Apple home or Siri home or
Siri speakers or whatever something like
that but you know iPod branding is so
strong and it is a speaker first so they
went with home pod so this thing has
seven tweeters these horns all the way
around the circumference around the base
so omnidirectional audio there and then
a four inch woofer firing upwards and
Apple spent a lot of time hyping and
talking about how good this thing is
going to sound it is definitely a
premium hi-fi speaker first it's gonna
have some smart features I can detect
wherever you put it if it's near a wall
it will know to bounce certain sounds
off of that wall and spread out certain
other sounds away from the wall it's
supposed to be an extremely smart
speaker and they spend a lot of time
with that on stage now you couldn't
really listen to it that well in the
demo area but I did get to listen to one
in a quiet area and I actually compared
it to an Amazon Alexa and a sono speaker
I can tell you for sure it sounded a lot
better than the Amazon Alexa speaker and
it sounded decently better than the
Sonos - it has a lot of bass obviously
the smaller speakers are lacking and
plenty of highs to but what struck me
was the mids were
actually really full and rounded and
legible where they weren't in the Sonos
obviously the Alexa was not forget at
all so I got to get one at home
obviously and listen to it with my own
music and my own sounds and figure out
if it's worth it in that category but
assuming the Siri functionality on top
of it actually works well where you know
you can use voice controls to listen to
music and ask it questions about the
music and ask it for the weather and for
calendar appointments and hopefully it's
gotten better since that comparison I
did with it versus Google now assuming
all that stuff is true then it looks
like it'll be a pretty decent product
it's supposed to come out for $349 in
December so it's got some time before
that comes out and before it's actually
a finalized product but that gives it
time to get good and we'll be able to
see if it's actually worth that price
three and forty nine bucks sounds like a
lot but when compared to other high-end
speakers that's right in line and
hopefully it does more thing I hopefully
also by December that gives us time to
know what we can do with it like right
now they advertise it as just like a
Siri and Apple music box but what if I
don't use Siri up what if I use Google
and and Google play music or Spotify or
SoundCloud or any of those things what
work is just a Bluetooth speaker I don't
know that's to be seen all right so
number two is iOS 11 and it's got a lot
a lot of little feature is added to it
and then a surprisingly big visual
refresh they didn't even talk about it
that much but it's a lot flatter and
more colorful now but it's clean it's
clean so the new features include things
like iMessage in iCloud so now when you
switch between phones it'll also bring
all your eye messages across
you can Apple pay between people so now
if you want to pay someone who also has
an iPhone you can use Apple pay inside
iMessage to pay them so that kind of
makes it tough on things like then
though and PayPal is this catches on
there's h.265 video support again and
there's also now at high efficiency
image format which supposedly take a lot
less space on your phone with all the
photos you take and there's no image
processing to make better quality photos
from the camera and Siri got a new voice
it's a little bit smoother and there's
also a male version to use the programs
for the next two days sunny sunny sunny
I love the scenery especially in China
machine learning and the control center
is redesigned now this definitely looked
a little bit odd to me at first and I
didn't like
it right off the bat but it's definitely
going to take some getting used to I
think this is one of the things we're
going to have to get used to because iOS
Control Center right now on the iPhone
is a little bit finicky already so it
looks to be an improvement to that even
if it's not pretty the response to 3d
touch it's now no longer paginate it so
all your controls are your fingertips
and it appears to have more control than
you did before so hopefully this is
something that I can get used to even
though it's not the prettiest thing
there's also some improvements to other
first party apps like Apple photos and
to Apple maps it's got things like Lane
Guidance now which is long overdue but
why I really like iOS 11 and why it's so
high on my list at number two is because
of what it did for iPad for the long
time the biggest weakness of iPads for
me was for how much they claimed to be
able to replace the PC and be a primary
machine for so many people they could
never really do even some of the most
basic things that pcs could do at least
in the multitasking and productivity
side of things they were severely
lacking but I look 11 on the iPad now
has for example a full-on dock like the
Mac so a bunch of apps that you can
store down there you have not only just
the split-screen multitasking but you
can copy and paste things between them
you now have a full files app so you
have access to file system on the iPad
there's new scanning feature in the
Notes app or if you take notes with the
Apple pencil it will actually be able to
scan that as text and recognize all your
handwriting and then be able to archive
and search through that with spotlight
which is amazing and Craig on stage went
through all this stuff and even more
insanely fast I could barely keep up I
was scribbling it all down but bottom
line was it actually made me reconsider
how I think about the iPad as possibly
really being a first computer or a
primary device for a larger number of
people that's obviously going to be its
own full deep dive I have to get my
hands on the new iPad and that's
definitely going to be its own separate
video plus possibly the most underrated
announcement from all of today's stuff
and no one seems to be talking about it
as much as they should is that the new
iPads the new iPad pro came out you know
ten and a half inch display slightly
slimmer bezels but it has a display that
refreshes at 120 Hertz 60 frames per
second constant every animation and you
notice it if I carefully dropped it
onstage like oh it will dynamically
switch between refresh rates you know
lower pressure rates for slower tasks
like reading but also high refresh rates
and you normally go up to 60 Hertz on
most displays but this will be 120 Hertz
not just for gaming but for like all the
swiping through the UI and swiping
through pages and typing and drawing
with the Apple pencil it's extremely
responsive it's like butter it's like
water like pulling your hand across the
UI it's hard for me to show because this
is all thirty frames per second video
but trust me when I say it's very
different and people should be pretty
excited about that so that takes it to
number one the highest profile new
announcement from today's WWDC which is
new Macs and the new iMac press so there
were Hardware refreshes announced
throughout all of Apple's lineup you got
new MacBooks new MacBook Pros new iMacs
there's now also a baseline $13.99 4k
iMac and Nu baseline $13.99 macbook pro
13 inch and all beyond max now have
brighter displays 500 nits standard
which is great now has fusion drives by
default which is math but they also now
have the SSD option is faster and can go
up to 2 terabytes so I highly recommend
that and they're all running KB Lake
Intel chips on the latest gen AMD Radeon
pro graphics cards faster RAM more RAM
and they added 2 USB type-c Thunderbolt
3 ports on the back of the new iMacs
it's about time so now it's looking like
a real nice solid 2017 refresh and that
out of nowhere out of literally nowhere
we got out of left field this iMac pro
this all space grey matte black
workstation grade beast of an iMac that
I mean out of nowhere
up to 18 cores on the CPU side
workstation grade Zeon's AMD Vega GPUs
up to 128 gigs of ram and then up to a 4
terabyte SSD and tend to give it
Ethernet on the back and 4 USB type-c
Thunderbolt 3 ports where did this come
from
it even comes with a brand-new exclusive
Space Gray Apple wireless keyboard with
the number pad a Space Gray trackpad and
a dark grey Magic Mouse all for this
workhorse of an iMac with a 5k display
so I got to look at it I got to admire
it I got to even touch it
obviously this thing has my attention
that even kept the SD card
slot on the back which is great it's
looking like a pretty robust suite of
i/o for a pro user and the numbers in
this section making it look pretty damn
tempting for a pro user for someone who
uses Final Cut Pro this seems like a
machine that would crush final cut prep
but the more I think about it it
actually seems like this is a really
elaborate trap set by like Johnny eyes
preying on content creators who Mac
froze are on their last breath this
thing is going to be starting at $5,000
in December so it's not like you can get
one right now you actually have to wait
a little time or pre-order and get one
in a couple months but if you think
about it who on earth is in the market
for a super high-end all-in-one with
workstation grade parts that's totally
not upgradeable what is a total beast
you know you know if you want to think
of two completely different things you
can't upgrade the RAM CPU drive GPU any
of the things in this computer but it's
going to be an absolute monster people
who are buying multi-thousand dollar
workstation grade computers like this
don't buy IMAX unless you paint them
space grey I don't know maybe I'm not
learning my lessons from the 2013
trashcan Mac Pro but I really want an
iMac Pro this thing looks absolutely
sick I don't have people from the photos
I've posted and reactions on Twitter
have also been really into it too
but either way let me know what you
think are you into this I'm mic Pro or
any of the other announcements from WWDC
2017 I'm certainly interested to hear
your thoughts down on the comments
section below right below that like
button we're all talking about it all
day and that's where we're getting out
down there so that's pretty much it
thank you for watching this recap video
hopefully it suffice your needs for not
watching a three-hour keynote you got
all the info you need quickly to share
this info for anyone else you might want
to see it that's pretty much it thanks
for watching tough together the next one
