with another video in the youtube tips
video series so if you like this video
idea or this series idea give it a
thumbs up as i really does help me know
which series you want me to keep going
on and i'll keep making videos if you
like this video so either way this is
going to be an episode on getting
inspired sort of inspiration and getting
video ideas making better videos and
this is also going to be one of those
sort of less edited videos so just
hopefully you like that as well so the
first thing the question that i get the
most often is yeah how do you make
better videos now i might not be the
person to tell you like how to make a
better video because different is good
is different for everyone so john for
lakers might tell you one thing and
mystery guitar man might tell you
another thing and I might tell you a
totally different thing and it's it's
really all up to you so when I was
thinking about this you know how to make
better videos I was really thinking when
I try to make better videos I try to
make videos that are better to me that I
would actually want to watch so you can
even use this one you're thinking of
ideas for videos to do later think of
what you would want to see in your
subscription box like if I was browsing
YouTube right now and I'm just want to
search for a random tech video what do I
want to see what I want to see someone
talk about something or what I want to
see someone explain something that's
what I would end up making a video about
because I don't see it on YouTube and I
want it to be there and I will put it on
YouTube and that's that's just the one
of the little things that I think of
that but here's a tip an actual tip
because this is the youtube tips video
series so you've made a video and you've
finished creating it you've produced it
exported it whatever it's sitting there
on your desktop maybe you've watched it
a few times let it sit there shut down
your laptop go to sleep and sit on it
for one day
a whole entire day sleep on it and then
wake up the next day do your thing and
then come back to that video and watch
the video again and you will find so
many things that you would rather have
different about that video I swear I do
this all the time I'd make a review
video keep the project file so you can
actually go
can change it and you might notice like
an awkward pause in the audio or you
might have wanted to say something
differently you can go back and actually
do that so it's like you've had a video
up and you want to go back take it down
and change it that's what I would say so
actually sleep on it and let me know if
you try this because it actually worked
for me I found a lot of my videos change
a lot just from doing this having a
video concept in your head and making it
a reality can really evolve a lot when
you sleep on it so overall I'd say when
you're trying to make better videos I
know this very general tip but yet try
to make videos that are better to you so
you know watch the video you're trying
to make a funny video try to make
yourself laugh if you're trying to make
a really informative video do a lot of
research put things in the video that
you didn't know before you decided to
start researching that is what you want
to try to do and make a video that you
think is good and then chances are it's
a good video so get that's basically
what I got for you guys today just a
quick little video letting you guys know
an answer to a very frequently asked
question I get so again if you like the
YouTube tips video series just give this
video a thumbs up and I'll probably know
how that you guys like it and I'll also
be advancing some other series as well
in the near future as you guys already
know either way thanks for watching this
video and I'll talk to you guys later
peace
