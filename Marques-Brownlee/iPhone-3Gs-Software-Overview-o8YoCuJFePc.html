unfortunately in the first place but I
apologize for my voice I'm getting a
little sick here but I apologize for
that I'm just going to go over today the
new iPhone 3.0 software that has come
out and pardon me I'm going on my my
notepad document here to actually pull
it up for you
released today March 17th of my Apple is
going to be a free upgrade for iPhone
users ok so the original iPhone had
iPhone version 1.0 software then iPhone
3G I version 2.0 software and etc now we
have version 3.0 software and I don't
know about anything hardware related yet
but we'll get into that so first of all
um copy cut and paste for the iPhone is
a big thing and everyone who was waiting
for it once said if they can get this
off on the iPhone that would be a great
thing and they finally did it so they
have copy cut and paste on the iPhone
something about a double tap and you
would have a little bubble popping up
saying you could um copy cut and paste
so that's a really nice feature actually
a lot of people have been waiting for
that again the iPhone had a lot of
features that a lot of phones didn't
have already but this is one of the
features that it was lacking and now it
finally does have that it's making it
just more complete the next thing I have
is there's push notifications so on its
it's not really what we were expecting
about like background tasks if you watch
my own uh post video responses as my
predictions video I'll link the two
videos together so you can see one
predictions were a few days before today
yeah it's not really background tasks so
you can get like an instant message or a
text message while you're playing a game
and you looking a little little bubble
or a notification that'll say you got
the message but it's not like more than
one task reading a once but again it's
push notifications so that's good the
next thing we have is what did I you say
okay we have neat voice memos
not really that exciting that we have
voice memos but like I'll show you on my
phone here you may or may not be able to
hear this but if I just hold it down
hold down one of the buttons on the lg
board hit the okay button to start
recording and it stops it starts
recording so you can just say like Oh
pick up the groceries I need milk
lettuce juice and then hit stop and
it'll save it as a file and you can
always have that file for later
reference so the iPhone finally has that
built in okay just basically Cheers
completing the whole iPhone um you know
iPhone software thing spotlight it's
gonna have two little things in
spotlight number one you're going to be
able to have a source
search feature and a lot of applications
so your email your texting holds a bunch
of different clients you'll be able to
search your music on your iPod obviously
you'll be able to search all your music
and it's a really nice spotlight feature
and second you're gonna have little
spotlight icon this is my phone
obviously it's not an iPhone but you'll
have a little spotlight icon on the
desktop if your iPhone and with Yogo
you'll be able to click it and search
through all your applications for
everything you need that's pretty cool
it's really useful it's a lot more
useful than you might think but it's
really good for um what people will do
looking for in spotlight like if you're
used to Mac os10
it has finally a landscape keyboard I've
been talking about this this isn't
nearly little width of an iPhone but
before iPhone users wrote or stuck with
a portrait keyboard you would always
have the vertical up-and-down keyboard
and you would have to type with that I
was for texting that was for everything
except for entering a URL into a web
browser now we have the full landscape
keyboard
yes landscape view where you can turn it
sideways take use of the entire gorgeous
screen you have I mean it'll make it
much that faster for texting for
emailing all these things are going to
be built in a ton of different apps so
that's going to be really good and
obviously MMS has come out and the mess
is now available for the iPhone 3.0
software so you'll be able to send more
than one picture or at least a picture
or a contact or a calendar event or a
sound file as a message right
so it's going to be SMS and MMS
available for iPhone 3G so again a lot
of these features which were available
on a lot of other phones before are now
available for the iPhone 3 or 3.0
software just making it more complete a
lot of the features that did not have as
a really great multimedia phone with the
iPod and everything are being put
together into one great software package
I did in my predictions video predict
some sort of a camera of thee and
there's not much happening to the
cameras still new video so I'll get back
to you guys maybe there wait for new
hardware maybe they're not there they're
not telling us yet about anything about
hardware they're going to be releasing a
lot more 17th on a calendar behind me
so we'll see about that we'll see what
happens and last but not least we have
ingame voice so you could have you could
have wiring items a stereo Bluetooth yet
but you can have stereo Bluetooth
headphones and everything going on with
your iPhone so ingame voice is like you
can be playing a game with your friend
who's in your neighbor is swinging on
his iPhone you want to tether up your
games or whatever you can actually play
the game at the same time here until
there's voice kind of like Xbox I don't
know how to start it but that's what
it's called so if you do want to look at
the if you do want to look at the
keynote offer a link in the description
you guys can watch it I'm pretty sure
that's that way I don't remember but
again look at the description there's a
whole video on it on Apple comm and I
hope you guys like this um this is my
basic breakdown of the iPhone 3.0
software overview I'll get back to you
guys with more videos obviously starting
at time 3 I'll get back you guys with
more videos and hopefully you'll get a
better look at the ISO 3.0 software I
was in the best I can so thanks for
watching this one and subscribe please</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
