tutorial in this video I'll be showing
you a quick a quick little helpful trick
I learned on that you may or may not
already know that's just kind of helpful
if you're actually composing something
in Microsoft Word that you're using a
lot of characters now I was in Spanish
class and I had to do a Spanish si and I
opened up Microsoft Word and I didn't
feel like changing it to the complete
Spanish language and going all the way
back and forth and downloading the
language and everything like that so I
had Microsoft Word open and what I
wanted to do is just have all the
accented characters like handy so here's
a quick way to have them all up for you
to always on to always have them and be
able to answer them as quick quicker
than you normally would have been able
to I'm using what's actually built into
Microsoft Word so here we go I'm just
going to right click on my desktop for
this tutorial and just go to new and go
to shortcut and in this new shortcut are
we're going to type is charm map CH AR m
ap hit next and you can rename this I'm
just going to rename it in map and hit
the finish button and all this is going
to do all its going to do is give you a
little shortcut that looks just like
this on your desktop called Mac or which
is what I named it whatever you named it
that's what it'll have double click on
it and this is where you have all of
your characters if I scroll down here
you can see there's hundreds of them all
these characters different languages
with the accents and everything so I if
I wanted to use one of these and say
like a some rang something in Spanish
like you guys watched my um my Google
translations video if I didn't have
those accents imported I would go into
this Microsoft Word document here and
all you would have to do is copy and
select it and then just paste it and
that's it so um I hope you guys found
this tutorial helpful just a quick
little video for you guys I hope it was
helpful for you guys if you're looking
to get a character map if you like to
use it go ahead and thanks for watching
this video if you like what you see here
go ahead and subscribe and thanks for
watching my videos peace
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
