tutorial in this video I'll be showing
you a quick a quick little helpful trick
I learned on that you may or may not
already know that's just kind of helpful
if you're actually composing something
in microsoft word that you're using a
lot of characters now I was in Spanish
class and I had to do with Spanish si
and I opened up Microsoft Word I didn't
feel like changing it to the complete
Spanish language and going all the way
back and forth and downloading the
language and everything like that so I
had Microsoft Word open and what I
wanted to do is just have all the
accented characters like handy so here's
a quick way to have them all up for you
to always on to always have them and be
able to answer them as quick they're
much quicker than you normally would
have been able to i'm using what's
actually built into microsoft word so
here we going we're just going to right
click on my desktop for this tutorial
and just go to new and go to shortcut
and in this new shortcut all we're going
to type is charm map CH AR ma p hit next
and you can rename this i'm just going
to rename it in map and hit the finish
button and all this is going to do walls
is going to do is give you a little
shortcut that looks just like this on
your desktop called mac or which is what
I named it whatever you named it that's
what it'll have double click on it and
this is where you have all of your
characters if I scroll down here you can
see there's hundreds of them all these
characters different languages with the
accents and everything so I if I wanted
to use one of these on and say like a
some writing something in Spanish like
you guys watch my um my Google
translations video if I didn't have
those accents imported I will go into
this microsoft word document here and
all you would have to do is copy and
select it and then just paste it and
