here from mkbhd and welcome to mkbhd
update 5.0 yeah it does seem like a lot
of updates but actually in my 1 year or
so on youtube it does seem like a
realistic amount for me so basically
this is a testing sort of video for me
and also for the audience to see your
guys your responses the first thing i'm
testing is the quality of this new Sanyo
zack vc g10 camcorder obviously I've
done a few macro focused tests as well
as this which is a slightly more distant
strat with decent lighting so it looks
good the second test is for this new
camera angle you can see my monitors
behind me you can see a little bit more
of what I look like when I'm sitting in
my office not a whole lot but it's a
little bit better quality obviously than
me sitting in front of my webcam built
into my PC and this is also going to be
a test for two more things one is the
transition you're about to see between
this video and the screencasts that I'm
going to go into and the last and
probably the most important part of this
update video is that every machine in
this home office is now running Windows
7 home premium so you guys are going to
get the best for the best quality most
likely in 1080p video this is going to
be a pretty big change in my videos but
not the most in terms of what it's so
going to be about but in terms of
quality so you guys are going to get the
highest quality professional video that
I can possibly output several times a
week due to this upgrade to Windows 7 so
I'm going to test out this transition
pretty quickly and we're going to switch
into our screencast then we're going to
just demonstrate a quick piece of
software I'm not quite sure what I'm
going to do yet but it should be fun so
uh welcome to this new transition this
new angle this new sort of video setup
and let's just get right into this
so here it is guys this is the quality
test of the screencast with Windows 7
home premium everything is pretty much a
clean install I've yet to import my
settings and documents for my external
hard drive but this is what it looks
like so I've I've obviously downloaded
and installed Camtasia Studio 6 as well
as a number of other programs just to
get me started and to help me know you
know what's really on my computer and
get things going so I have a nice little
carbon fiber background going on here
things are very very snappy extremely
fast on Windows 7 in comparison to
Windows Vista so yeah that is basically
it for mkbhd update 5.0 if you would
like more information about this
camcorder you can go back to the
unboxing video that I did and the
quality test that I did and if you want
more information about Windows 7 I'll
leave you guys some sort of link in the
description to check it out so anyway
thanks for watching mkbhd update 5.0
it's been a pleasure and I hope you guys
continue to watch my videos in the
future so thanks for watching and K Bhd
signing out peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
