holiday season right around the corner
these are the two tablets that are going
to be competing for your hard-earned
cash this is the Battle of the midsize
tablets of 2012 go ahead and hit that
thumbs up button and let's begin so this
is a new product category that was born
in the second half of 2012 with the
Nexus 7 the devices are bigger than the
largest smartphones but smaller than
your traditional 10-inch tablet starting
on the outside in terms of pure Hardware
right off the bat these are very
different tablets on the outside the
iPad Mini takes the thinness crown and
it takes on a bigger footprint
thanks to that slightly larger display
which we'll talk more about in a second
and the Nexus 7 on the other hand does
feel a little bit more natural to hold
especially with one hand and that's
partially thanks to that soft touch
material on the back and those rounded
edges that make it pretty comfortable
compared to the iPads more premium
feeling industrial square style design
now besides the Lightning port on the
iPad these tablets have a pretty similar
port and button situation going on
although the iPads power button is up
top so that could get a little awkward
when trying to one-hand it but the iPad
Mini does have the back camera advantage
so in the event you need to take photos
or video with your tablet the iPads your
choice both do you have a front-facing
camera though so that's convenient also
on the speaker's the Nexus 7 has an
average tablet bar speaker on the back
of the device it fires backwards but the
iPad Mini has a much louder speaker but
the iPad Mini Speaker faces to the side
of the device meaning when you hold the
device in landscape mode
it fires sideways now for some reason
the Nexus 7 speaker didn't bother me but
the sideways audio from the iPad Mini
drove me a little bit insane when trying
to game and watch youtube videos and
speaking of watching stuff the displays
are very important because that's what
you interact with that's why you're
constantly looking at when you're using
the tablets the Nexus 7 has a pretty
average display it's not bad it's a 1280
by 720 seven-inch display which gives it
a pixel density of 216 PPI
it's a pretty decent display honestly
it's not the brightest in the world but
it's responsive and kind of crisp and it
gets the job done for the price you pay
the iPad Mini
on the other hand has a 7.9 inch display
with a thinner smaller bezel with a
resolution of just 1024 by 768 this
gives it a pixel density of just 163 and
I think this here is the iPads biggest
flaw least from my experience Apple
really skimped on the display and it is
noticeable even when not directly
comparing it to a super-high resolution
display side-by-side
I noticed pixels especially with text on
the iPad Mini now that being said the
next generation I've had mini absolutely
will have a Retina display of some sorts
but until then this is sort of the
feature that does it down for me I can
see pixels everywhere either way with
this thinner bezel sometimes you end up
resting your finger partially on the
display so there's a neat improvement
made to iOS specifically for the iPad
Mini to reject that accidental input so
that's really cool the Nexus 7 has a
thicker bezel though so they I guess
trust you in the software not to
accidentally touch the screen but of
course outside of the hardware the other
difference between these two tablets is
their operating systems Android 4.2
jelly bean on the Nexus on iOS 6 on the
iPad now besides coming down to peer
preference there are some tangible
differences like this means you can pick
between the Google Play Store and its
700,000 apps or the Apple App Store and
it's 1 million apps one huge advantage
for the iPad here is at least because of
this 1024 by 768 aspect ratio this is
the same aspect ratio as the iPad 2 and
3 &amp;amp; 4 so all of the tablet optimized
apps and games that work perfectly on
the iPads will work on the Mini just
fine with no letterboxing or stretching
required so it has the apps advantage
here but then again Google Maps or Apple
maps Google now or Siri YouTube or no
YouTube it's your choice
I've also found that the battery life on
these two tablets is about the same
sometimes the iPad lasts a little bit
longer on standby when you're not using
it but once you really get to using
these two they're about even with each
other and for performance
it's the nexuses quad-core NVIDIA Tegra
3 versus the iPads dual-core a5 from the
iPad 2 and in real world performance
both are quite snappy no performance
issues here but I would say the iPad is
overall smoother but the Nexus is
overall faster and I guess what I mean
by
that is the frame rates and animations
will be faster on the iPad thanks to
better graphics but the load times will
be faster on the Nexus 7 thanks to
better processing so in the end the
Wi-Fi nexus 7 starts at 200 bucks while
the equivalent iPad Mini is 330 bucks
but I got to hand it to Apple for giving
it a 4G option which is nice while the
unlocked Nexus will get you HSPA+ speeds
overall you might go with the iPad Mini
if you're familiar with or enjoy that
simplicity of iOS it's like a large
flattened out iPod Touch for 30 extra
bucks think about that or you might go
with the Nexus 7 if you enjoy messing
around with Android or if your budget is
lower or if you do a lot of video
watching on a 16 by 9 display or
youtubing does that YouTube app but you
can't go wrong either way I'm sure
whichever you choose this holiday season
you won't be disappointed either way
thanks for watching if you enjoy the
video feel free to +1 or give it a
thumbs up here and enjoy your turkey day
if you celebrate it and I'll talk to you
guys in the next video peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
