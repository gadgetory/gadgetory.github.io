tutorial in this video I'll be showing
you a website where you can get
royalty-free music that you can use to
put in the background of your tutorials
or if you're your unboxing videos or
something so you might have heard other
youtubers use this website and use music
from this website in their video so I'm
gonna pull it up here
it's incompetech.com up here is the URL
with their little logo
WW incompetech.com so the link will be
in the description wherever that is so
good and check it out and basically at
the top of the website you can search
the website so if you want to search a
techie one or if you want to search a
smooth music or something you can search
that at the top of the website but
basically they offer a lot of different
themes of music different themed music
so if we scroll down here there are
obviously credits to the author but this
is royalty-free music so on let's find
one that we like and we'll just click on
it and it'll bring us to the page where
you can put where we can preview it so
you'll see here it says you can show
preview and download so first of all um
it'll say it's highly processed piano
and instrumentation its length genre
title all that we hit show preview and
it comes up with the little QuickTime
toolbar here so I'm just gonna hit play
and this is basically how you can hear
the preview sounds pretty cool if we do
want to download this then we just hit
that download button right there and
then Safari or Firefox or whatever in
our browser are using just hit the Open
button so you can save it so it's
already done downloading it is in an mp3
format so all the music you get from
this website will be in mp3 so if we
open the containing folder here just by
right-clicking it and opening containing
folder or I'm in Safari just hit the
little magnifying glass this is actually
where they saved it now it is in a
temporary folder so you're not going to
be able to find it instantly I'm just
going to cut cut it and paste it
someplace I can remember like the my
music folder or the desktop so I'm going
to go ahead and paste it on the desktop
and there it is we can rename it add all
the credits to it and everything and
there we go we have
that music for free now when you're
using the music you get off in
incompetech.com make sure you include in
the description music royalty mute
royalty free music provided by
incompetech.com
something like that in the description
I'll try to put some soft music in the
background of this tutorial so you can
hear an example of what it looks like
but basically I'm actually a Minot
because I'm using my new microphone here
still trying to get a chance to use it
there you go that's basically um where I
get royalty free music I've saved it as
a bookmark up here as we royalty-free
music I couldn't write the whole thing
but there there you go so I hope you
enjoy this tutorial and you have your
music on your desktop right there so I
hope you like this one thanks for
