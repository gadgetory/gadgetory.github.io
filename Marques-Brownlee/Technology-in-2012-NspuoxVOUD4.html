mkbhd and this is what I see every time
someone asks me for my tech predictions
in 2012 yep yep mmhmm yep yeah so who's
in that bus you might be wondering I
have my big three my big three tech
companies that I think are going to just
take over in 2012 those are Google Apple
and Amazon I'll start with Google Google
in 2011 introduced of course we all know
Google Plus and finally released the Ice
Cream Sandwich Android 4.0 and that is
uh which we see on the Galaxy Nexus
right here and they've been pushing
Google+ to be integrated in everything I
think in 2012 Google's gonna do a lot
more the same thing they are probably
going to release a revision of ICS maybe
ICS 4.1 but what I'm most excited for is
to see Google Plus everywhere also
Google Chrome is kind of a big deal as
you know Google Chrome has been a very
high growth rate browser in the past
couple months and I think Google in 2012
is gonna push those two things Google
Plus and Google Chrome for Apple 2012
will be the first year that they go
through a full year without Steve Jobs
and I think this is kind of a big deal
for them but most importantly they have
some new products to announce and to
release the Mac Pro hasn't been updated
or refreshed or anything in a long time
so I'm looking forward to seeing what
happens with that the iPad 3 is looking
to be released actually in the next
couple months and the iPhone 5 or 6 or
whatever they call it if it's a six
generation but it's the fifth in line
either way apples got some very
enthusiastic audience members to please
and I think they're gonna have another
strong year in 2012 just like they
always do now you might have expected
Amazon to be in my big three but it
honestly is the third biggest company
for me as a tech enthusiast I mean think
about it when's the last time you
ordered something online that wasn't
from Amazon Amazon I don't know if you
know started as only an online bookstore
and now sells just about everything and
they they might even sell groceries in
2012 who knows their Kindle Fire was
also ridiculously popular in 2011 and I
think that we'll see a Kindle Fire -
around the same time in 2012 other than
that yeah that's that's pretty much what
I see for tech in 2012 just my sort of
short round of video if you guys have
any other thoughts or if your big three
would have been different or in a
different order let me know in the
comments section below of course that's
always wide-open and I'm always
answering comments and a thumbs up on
this video is definitely appreciated
thank you so much for watching and I'll
see you guys through the rest of 2012 if
you're going to see yes by the way
better put up videos because I want to
see it
face
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
