mkbhd channel back with the first video
in a sort of a winter series and we're
gonna call this the tour of series
basically if you have a suggestion for
something of mine that you want to see a
tour of go ahead and leave it in the
comments down below I'm sure you guys
have a lot of things maybe a tour of a
desktop or a tour of one of my laptops
or a Hut of my desk or something I don't
even know but if you like this series
idea go ahead and give it a thumbs up
right there as the thumbs up button
let's see if we can come up with some
great ideas for this series but I
figured I'd keep it simple to start
because I don't have a ton of stuff
installed on my tablet now before you go
saying well I don't have an Android
tablet this doesn't help me at all you
might learn some things so don't dismiss
this immediately you might learn some
things about how to set up your tablet
and touchpad or fire or iPad whatever
you might have so this is as you can see
my tablet of choice is the Motorola Xoom
and we are running honeycomb I'm really
excited for Ice Cream Sandwich whether
it's on my Galaxy Nexus first or on this
tablet but this is my my lock screen as
you can see and the wallpaper if you
want to check that out
will be in the description down below so
one of my favorite wallpapers I have
this on my desktop and on my tablet so
as you can see I have a couple of icons
lined up just sort of sort of a tablet
friendly mode for my thumbs to be able
to reach them pretty easily Google Plus
which I do use you can follow me at
Wolfram Alpha which is a boss app Google
Reader music tweet deck or tweet comb
which is a tablet optimized Twitter app
I really enjoy using it and YouTube
which as you guys know is pretty much
the best video site you could possibly
come up with ever
gotta love YouTube and the browser and
Google Currents so the keyboard I'm
using in case you want to know is the
thumb keyboard which is a sort of a
split layout keyboard and this is the
Ice Cream Sandwich theme so let's go
ahead to the right one pane and you can
see I have this very very minimal pretty
simple and the wallpaper really accents
that so you can see I have my weather up
here it's pretty chilled a less than 40
degrees
nice and down below we have navigation I
actually have used this for navigation
and Google Calendar Google Calendar is
awesome I use it to keep my life
organized and it is a lifesaver I
honestly is it all the time so this is
my nice neat little healthfulness screen
if you will then to the right is sort of
my auxiliary screen I have some
frequently contacted people and I have
my Google pages for Google+ and I have
all my youtubers on Google+ so if you
are a youtuber and you circled me on
Google+ I'll see that so I'll probably
circle you back so I can keep up with
your stuff and here's all the Google
stuff so Android YouTube Google Chrome
all those people they are putting their
stuff in here so that's what I have on
the right most homescreen then we'll go
all the way over the left we have our
Gmail widget guys are blasting me with
emails which I really appreciate because
I read all of them we have our camera in
our gallery and I will open the gallery
because this does change an ice-cream
sandwich so here's the honeycomb gallery
and all these pictures are from Google
Plus mostly and then Dropbox so that's
what I have in my gallery and you can
see the wallpaper here looking pretty
fly yeah um
then we have the Gmail widget which lets
me go through all my emails then I have
a blank screen which is pretty much
where I test stuff if you guys didn't
know I do videos for the Droid dog
YouTube channel and that's where I can
test stuff to see how the widgets work
out whether or not it works out for the
tablet or not but that's basically my
tablet this is the Motorola Xoom 32 gig
Wi-Fi I don't have a ton of apps
installed so you can see my home screen
layout overview right there and if you
want to see my apps there you go those
are the apps that I have I have
beautiful widgets as you saw before
catalogs facebook Messenger couple
things I haven't shown you scroll to the
right there's the thumb keyboard and I
have a stopwatch I've sound hung
infinity a whole bunch of great apps and
stuff I don't keep a ton of stuff on my
tablet because to be honest I really
like to keep it on my phone and the
Galaxy Nexus will probably only improve
that but that's basically it guys like I
said if you have a suggestion for
another tour of some sort of gadget let
me know I'd be happy to give you a tour
of it either way there's been MTB
HD thanks for watching and I'll talk to
you guys in the next video peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
