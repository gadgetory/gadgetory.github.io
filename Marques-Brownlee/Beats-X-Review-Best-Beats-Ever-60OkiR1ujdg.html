the beep X are brand new there are now
the cheapest wireless beats that you can
buy and even cheaper than the earpods
now and they supposedly actually sound
better too so that means they're
definitely worth the money right well
let's break that down so the beats X are
another new pair of wireless bluetooth
buds for 2017 it's 2 in earbuds
connected by a wire with an inline
battery and a bunch of little controls
and tricks and features that make them
work so in that way to beat sex compare
really well to some other wireless audio
options we've gotten recently like a
jaybird x2 and x3 and of course the air
pods in fact I'd say the beats X are
pretty much a hybrid exactly in between
those two the beats have a little bit of
a different shape and a different
functional layout but obviously they're
still pretty recognizable with a logo
and everything as beats to anyone
looking for them now wireless earbuds
have a bunch of different ways of
sitting slash cable management you know
some are retractable some have some sort
of a wire clip like the Jaybirds some
have no wires at all these beats have no
cable management at all except for the
magnet in the head of each earbud which
turns out to be just enough I think the
wires a little bit longer obviously and
it's meant to basically sit on your neck
which isn't too bad and you can barely
seal it and then when you're not looking
to anymore you can take them out of your
ears
and basically clip them together and
then that makes this sort of a beats
necklace so I guess if you thought the
beats were out of the fashion game
they're totally not so you still have
all the functionality of a normal pair
of headphones which is good you have the
inline controls so your song forward and
backward you have the volume up and down
a play/pause button and even an inline
microphone for using phone call but
since it's now 2017 they're also now
completely wireless and also use Apple's
new super low powered super awesome w1
chip the same thing as the air pods you
power them on and your iPhone
immediately recognizes them and tears
them to that and every other Apple
device you have but also unlike the air
pods you can connect these to an Android
phone via bluetooth no problem and they
keep all their functionality you can
connect air pods to an Android phone if
you want but if you do you lose like all
the cool features and functions like you
lose the play/pause when you take it out
here you lose Siri you lose volume
control it just like a very basic
headset at that point but if you connect
beats X to an Android phone you still
have the physical inline controls here
so you still have volume you solve a
microphone they all still work so inline
controls are good but there are some
downsides of these headphones too
durability wise these aren't sweat proof
or water resistant at all like in anyway
now I have had any problems with mine
and I haven't heard about any problems
yet but it's kind of weird that they're
lacking even those basic protection
pretty much just don't take these out in
the rain or if you workout and you sweat
a lot then you can't use these for
working out either which isn't that kind
of the point of wireless headphones like
this it seems like a glaring omission
but people smarter than me will tell you
that that's just so beats can point you
towards another pair of headphones they
sell just for working out so okay if
you're not using them for working out
then you're just you know you're walking
the dog walking to class just very
casual use around how do they do with
that well first of all they sound pretty
decent they sound like a lot of other
premium Bluetooth earbuds which isn't a
super high bar to clear but they're not
garbage at all they definitely are a lot
heavier and on the base of your side for
sure their beats but that's fine for a
lot of people volume is good and they
managed to make a really good seal in my
ear even better than the j-bird X 3s
thanks to the wing tip so the seal makes
the noise isolation that it creates
really really good at least with my ear
shape it's excellent I know some people
can just like put air pods in their ear
and run around no problem they don't
fall out I'm not one of those people my
ears don't work with that so having the
wingtip like the x3 really works well
with the beats X stays my ear seals
really well the little wire around your
neck line your first wearing them is a
little annoying at first especially
since they have these little batteries
in line as well but it was really easy
to get used to now I can never quite
forget it was in my ear like the
Jaybirds which go around the back of
your neck but beats do still get points
for comfort here and then the battery
life is pretty solid you're looking at
about six to eight hours tops of charge
but then they also have this awesome
quick charging if you pick them up and
they're dead
you can plug them in for five minutes
and add two hours of listening time
which is dope and they charge via this
lightning cable so no dock or pouch or
cradle needed just literally plug them
directly in with the same cable you
charge your iPhone with
and you're good to go so this is
obviously further reinforcement that
this is made for iPhone users first if
you're an Android phone person you have
a USB cable so you need to carry two
different Chargers one for headphones
one through phone not really meant to do
that it's made for the iPhone and of
course they are portable too that's like
a big point so they come with this case
that looks like a mouse and you can just
crumple them up and shove them in to
this case it's not very clean it's not
super elegant I just ended up shoving
them in a sweatshirt pocket or in my
backpack more often than not well yeah
they're definitely still portable so as
150 books as a total package are the
beats X the best beat ever sure yeah I'd
give it that I'd say at least in the
bang for the buck category and the bang
for the buck for Beats category yeah
these are pretty good but that doesn't
mean you get them like you've got to
know who who beat are made for people
who want beat people who work out with
their headphones who are really active
sweat a lot do fitness sports activities
they'll want like sweat proof headphones
we'll find stuff like the j-bird x3 much
better but if you just want like no
wires at all you want totally Wireless
then they'll spring for something like
the air pods but people who want beats
can now justify getting these beats
thanks for watching talk to you guys the
next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
