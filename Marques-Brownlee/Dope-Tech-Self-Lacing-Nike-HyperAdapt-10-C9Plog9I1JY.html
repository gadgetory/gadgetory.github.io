remember the Back to the Future
self-lacing shoes the air mags that I
made a video about well that was a prop
you know a super limited edition almost
no one could get one but even if you did
you wouldn't wear them every day you'd
put them in a glass case and display
them for the world to see but shortly
after that we saw that Nike would
actually be making a real pair of
self-lacing shoes that people can
actually buy and wear in 2016 this is
those this is the nike hyperadapt 1.0
welcome to your Super HD exclusive first
look so right off the bat this is one of
the first pairs you will see on the
Internet and this pair in particular is
a custom colorway that not everyone will
be able to get their hands on it's all
white damn Daniel over one that you will
actually be able to buy the ones that
you've seen the articles about will be
in the black color and they look a lot
more subtle in person actually prefer
them in that color
but you can see with the general shape
here the hyper adapts have that classic
Nike style to them you know looking a
little bit like the older Kobe's maybe a
little bit of kairi's in there I'm no
sneaker head by any means I leave that
to my cousins for the most part but
these look pretty clean I gotta say now
obviously the mags would look crazy on
your feet in public they're like moon
boots but these have done a good job of
looking like a normal shoe while adding
the ridiculously convenient self-lacing
feature these lights on the side and on
the back are pretty cool and they
actually serve a purpose so after you
use the buttons there to adjust the
final tightness same as the mags up
button to tighten down button to loosen
after you do all that the color the
lights glow at the bottom represents how
much battery life you have left so blue
is good to go yellow means you're
getting lower might want to think about
charging and red means low battery but
what's different is unlike the mags the
lights on the shoe don't stay on 24/7
when you're wearing them again they're
blending in so you don't need them on
all the time so that saves you a lot of
battery life so the hyper adapts should
last you a pretty comfortable 2 weeks on
a charge if not way more than that now
to recharge them this is actually way
better than mags you might be asking how
exactly do I get battery back in these
guys well in the massive box they come
in there's what looks like a weird
double stethoscope thing yeah that is
the wireless charger
yes these shoes have wireless charging
there's magnets in the chargers and
magnets in the bottom of the shoe that
are actually pretty powerful so I guess
while MagSafe may be gone in the new
MacBook Pros it lives on here and the 2
amp charger that connects to the bottom
of these shoes they take about two hours
to fully recharge from zero and Nike
reps I've talked to have said they've
worn them for much longer than two weeks
with no problems so you can even charge
them up real quick from a power bank in
case of emergency
dead shoe battery situation it's a very
2016 sentence so now that these shoes
already have a feature that plenty of
smart phones don't have it should be
pretty obvious that these are super
smart you know I consider them a piece
of tech just for that they also have a
memory to them so the automatic lacing
might not be the perfect snugness for
you but you can mess with it you can
adjust it on the go and then once you've
decided you like it you can hold both
buttons for a couple of seconds to set
that to the tightness as a preset so
next time you step into the hyper adapts
they will remember just how you like it
so this is it this is the first gen of a
new product and Nike is encouraging us
to actually like wear them around you
know wear them everyday put them to the
test and while I don't think I would
ever walk out of a Nike store with the
mags on my feet I can actually see these
being everyday shoes for people which is
the idea like considering there is a
motor a battery some magnets and LED
lights all on the bottom of the shoe
it's actually pretty lightweight like
under 15 ounces and the shape and
snugness have it pretty comfortable and
there's just something about having this
shoe lace up for you as soon as you step
in them fastest shoot I ever honestly
you don't realize how easy it isn't to
actually try it and to then be able to
stop in the middle of your day and press
the button for one second to tighten the
shoes is way easier and way faster than
untying and retying laces so basically
long story short if I'm thinking of
these shoes as a tech product that I'm
seeing them as like version 1.0 I mean
they're called hyperadapt 1.0 s so
similar to like the first generation of
smartphones or first generation of
tablets the tech inside has a long way
to go you can kind of see it like I mean
they do a pretty good job of making it
look like regular shoes but you can tell
that they're not normal shoes so if
you're the type of person who would love
to hang on to like a first generation
iPhone or a g1 or a first gen product to
see what it ends up looking like with
the contrast of today's tech then you're
also the type of person who would
probably want to hang on to a
first-generation pair of hyper adapts to
see what they look like next to shoes in
like eight years which is why I am
giving mine away and it's not just me
it's me and my buddy John from the TLD
Today channel so you should check out
his channel he dropped a video at the
same time of these shoes as well he's a
size 11 he's given his pair way I'm a
size 13 I'm giving my para way and in
case you're not the type to actually
want to wear them everyday we'll throw
in some other tech to spice it up and
make it actually worth winning the
giveaway even if you don't wear the
shoes or happen to be our size so we're
going to throw in a tech backpack we're
going to toss in a battery bank and the
winner will also get the smartphone of
his or her choice so there are two of
these kits being given away all you have
to do to get entered is to drop a
comment right below that like button of
which smartphone you would want in your
pack and one of the winners will be
selected in exactly a week from today
and will be announced on Twitter and
that person will get a pack again enter
on his channel as well sub to both of us
and get yourself entered so good luck
