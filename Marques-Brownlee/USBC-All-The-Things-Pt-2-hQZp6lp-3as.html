and this is USB see all the things part
2 so part 1 was going over the best of
USB type-c accessories to help you
bridge the gap between the old outgoing
full-sized USB a standard and the new
income Universal standard USB type-c now
that was more than six months ago but
this part two is talking to you
manufacturers of electronics so a PSA 2
electronics companies now is the time to
go ahead and just feel free to USB see
all the things it's 2017 and we're in
this awkward sort of middle phase where
it's not quite a no-brainer to go with
USB type-c and a new device even though
you totally should a lot of electronics
and computers and accessories and things
are coming out that don't use USB type-c
even still because it isn't quite
everywhere yet you might be a little
worried about compatibility with older
customers or people getting confused
about having this new port when they
still have this old port in other places
but I'm telling you that you guys can be
the ones to push forward into this
feature to make it less confusing take
Apple for example with their laptops
obviously Apple's one of those companies
who can do this but they basically just
declared and decided that they wanted
USB C to be the future of connectivity
in their devices so with all the new
MacBook and MacBook Pros their entire
laptop lineup they took away full-size
USB a ports and replace them all with
USB type-c 3.1 there's no downsides and
now there's way less confusion because
you've gone straight from the old one to
the new one the old port to the new port
and now all the ports on all the mac
books are USB type-c that's a much
easier mental hurdle to clear of why a
new port exists and the old one doesn't
anymore
another example is Samsung with their
smartphones they've wizened up a lot too
they used to have microUSB in some
phones and USB micro-b for the note that
was a weird one but now if you check out
the smartphone lineup boom its USB see
across the board in fact many
smartphones coming out now are USB
type-c and that's a great categorical
example of companies moving forward
quickly because of heavy competition so
pretty much every smartphone you'll see
coming out now
has USB type-c except for the iPhone but
other categories don't necessarily have
the same stiff rigorous competition so
they're not necessarily in that same
race to adopt the most badass features
as quickly as possible take this mouse
for example Logitech MX master literally
one of my favorite mice ever came out in
early 2015 so a couple years ago and
then recently Logitech decided it's time
for a refresh so they came out with the
Logitech MX master 2's nice so a little
bit of a refresh new coating some new
color choices to pick from the newer
longer-lasting battery a higher dpi
sensor but at the front the same micro
USB now in something as simple as a
mouse Logitech probably accurately
thought it probably doesn't even matter
if you switch to USB type-c or not
there's no crunch for space because no
need to use a smaller faster port here
and the only thing you actually use the
cable for with this mouse is charging
anyway so who really cares why spend the
extra money on a new chipset inside just
to use a newer fancier USB type-c but if
we're going to move faster into this
world of USB type-c everywhere then this
is the kind of stuff that has to get
switched to USB type-c
even if it doesn't seem like it's going
to matter it actually does in the end
maybe the best way to do it if you're
concerned about laggers are concerned
about confusion or compatibility is to
do what Samsung did with their portable
SSD this is the samsung t1 SSD you know
the TLD guys originally recommended it
to me and it's just been awesome to rip
around files and move stuff between
machines
it's a terabyte right here in the palm
of my hand but it's split micro USB but
that's of course an older product so you
fast forward to 2017 you get the newer
versions of these guys the t3 and the t5
and the t5 is of course straight to USB
type-c but if you look in the package
the t5 comes with two cables one is a
USB type-c 2 USB type-c cable for the
future we're looking forward to but the
other is a USB type-c to full size USB a
cable that way anyone can use it you
have the cable option there but it
clearly still favors moving forward to
USB type-c now of course USB 3.1 and the
new connector really do matter in a
product like a port
Oh SSD where speed matters but this
would be even more awesome to see
everyday in things like the Logitech
mouse with portable battery packs with
cameras with keyboards with speakers
with whatever accessories are being
refreshed or coming out in 2017 and 2018
that would be really great to see so
that's just my brief PSA shoutout to the
manufacturers who are already putting
USB C in their devices even though no
one told you you had to and looking
forward to those who aren't catching up
for 2017 and 2018 until then there's
been MTB HD thank you for watching
toss you guys the next one please</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
