video on how you can customize your and
prompt so first of all you have to be
able to find command prompt so I just
type CMD and the start search bar and
hit enter which will open the first
program here and you can see I've
already changed my text to read so how
you change how you customize command
prompt is very simple you right-click on
the see the command prompt icon and hit
defaults and you'll be able to change
the options the font the layout of it
including the size the petition and the
colors that are involved so first of all
I'm gonna go over font you see a little
preview window over here you can choose
the size of your command prompt window
I left mine at 7 by 12 just cuz I'm used
to that size and then you can choose the
actual font that's involved there's only
one font here I'm going to use Lucita
console and I'll use size 14 make it
easier to see then all in terms of
layout I can actually change pixel by
pixel how wide it is if I want to make
my more widescreen I can change the
actual length of it or the width of it
and shorten the height maybe to 250 or
275 which is good and then change the
colors the colors is usually the most
fun to play around with you can choose
the screen text which is the actual red
that I've chosen here and you can change
it to a brighter red I'll leave it at
that and how you can change the screen
background which is this black you see
you can make it be a Sony code you can
make it a different pink gold I'm gonna
leave it at black it's just a very sharp
contrast and then also the pop-up
windows I left that purple and white so
that's pretty cool that's basically how
you can oh yeah so you can shoot choose
you can have it in quick edit mode and
you can also choose your cursor size as
you mouse over it that's how you
customize command prompt console window
I hope you found this tutorial helpful
and by the way after you made all your
changes you're going to exit out and
then I've been CMV again that open it up
and we'll have applied all your changes
notice a little different size and it's
also brighter so that is how you
customize command prompt to your liking
and it'll open the same way every time
you might notice I had a web kit up here
every time I open web kit it'll it'll
all look instead of being just plain
black and white you'll have a little
something we'll look at it'll be red and
black so just if you're bored so that's
how you customize command prompt I hope
you found this tutorial helpful if you
have any other video ideas for me or for
me requests and just subscribe send me a
personal message and I'll get right to
it
so thanks for watching peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
