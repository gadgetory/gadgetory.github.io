stream starting stream beginning alright
so now I gotta look for the law looks
like we're live yeah we are so I'm gonna
get the link oh yeah more and more noise
that's fine
oh there's a chat what's good all right
so where's my link then hmmm stream info
sup guys
oh man
well here what if I go to the live yeah
I'm gonna go to the channel hold on I'm
sharing the links of Twitter has it I
think Twitter would love to be on air we
go share copy/paste
tweet-tweet there it is alright there's
not that much to let either I don't
think
oh boy yes so we are live what's up
concept creator Oh concept creator yeah
that's good the super chat is enabled
it's up NASA is streaming right now yeah
so the end of the Saturn Kissimmee is
how you pronounce it Cassini mission
where that that thing has been in space
for so long and it's finally descending
into Saturn after sending all that info
back to earth
much appreciated Cassini uh where's the
can I point to it oh wow look it's right
under there that's the thing that's
happening right now
um yeah it's good I can so I can see the
chat and it's going extremely fast but
like this this number if do you see this
number it's it's 1,300 messages per
minute you see that in the corner there
I see that 1312 but super chat is
enabled and so I can see that too Rick
says go to bed so we've been up since
like 3:30 4 o'clock this morning timing
it out trying to see when to do this
live stream so much noise
but we're good now
uh-oh the basically the amount of people
that have subscribed in the last two
days meant that this I can now just
point to that this is happening a lot
earlier than we thought it would
hi hi hello hello I give away I'll talk
more about a giveaway in a little bit a
little little bit
oh man that's like lagging the counter
just a rolling counter if you refresh it
maybe it'll like less ideally what's
good
what is up Gabe yes this isn't
interesting way to spend money I agree I
always wanted to ask why do you like
wireless charging so much I always found
it to be an inconvenient gimmick we have
reversible charging cables now should
know your opinion wireless charging is
not a necessity for me but I do
appreciate when phones have it and I
think it's gonna get a lot better now
that the most the best selling phone in
the world the iPhone 8 and the iPhone 10
are getting it it's gonna show up in a
lot more places which means it'll get a
lot better you'll have longer range
wireless charging you won't have to put
it directly just she goes right on the
mat well how does that is that social
base of all of the browser's fault
it's probably the brothers well but yeah
what's up
did you try face ID doing a hands-on no
so the way they had it set up with the
hands-on area was they had a bunch of
Apple employees like all out there with
the phones and every single one of them
had face ID set up on their own like on
the phone they were holding so when they
handed you the phone to to get your
videos or to get shots or whatever which
was rare but when they did it it was
already unlocked and setup to that
person's face so I didn't really go in
and like take his face out and like add
my face I didn't really do all that I
would have loved to but I didn't really
get the chance but uh yeah I do I
haven't actually tried setting up or
trying face ID which is why I don't have
footage of it what do you think of the
v30 I made a whole video about what I
think it'd be 30 there we go
it's like in that window yeah been dying
to know how do you take a screenshot on
the iPhone 10 i I do think that a
screenshot on the iPhone 10 since it
used to be the home button since that's
not there anymore
they could do a pressure-sensitive like
press but I think they're going to do
the way iPhone does it now which is just
squeeze the phone one on the power
button one on the volume button boom
squeeze it screenshot makes sense right
what's up hello
way to go from Canada now you guys are
awake early I mean it's not that early
anymore
it was weird cuz we were here when it
was dark this morning at like 4:00 a.m.
like timing us out and there was a fox
right outside the door it's kind of a
weird sign Firefox well Apple sells more
singular phones Samsung sold way more
phones with wireless charging shouldn't
be much better already
so Samsung has sold way more phones but
a lot of those don't have wireless
charging the ones that do have wireless
charging the higher end ones
Wow mad people are unsubscribing then
the the war the galaxy note the galaxy
s2 those they're still really high in
volume but the iPhone is the phone that
so many of these these
third party manufacturers care about and
that's why all these these mo fees and
belkin's and everybody who's so
dedicated to making iPhone accessories
they're now going to make wireless
charging accessories huge achievement
marques I'm still have the freemen
you've inspired me to start making
videos to that is dope man appreciate
that I'm glad you did too
is periscope doomed no I think periscope
and Instagram live still have their
place but uh it's a YouTube's where it's
at
so we picked this number to go live at
because oh man Matt unsubscribes I see I
see you all now we've picked this number
to go live at because it was going up at
roughly like 400 an hour so now that's
at like 700 it'll take less than an hour
we'll be here for like an hour and we'll
we'll talk we'll talk give away we'll
talk whatever you guys want to talk i
phone things like that
yeah you should vlog your Tesla your
frisbee your life will be interesting to
all of us you're not going to be Casey
but that doesn't matter
I agree but I'm also like the vlogging
would take so much time away from this
that it's like almost not worth it like
if I vlogged I wouldn't do half the tech
videos and all the editing and stuff
that we do now because then you have to
edit the vlogs and it becomes this whole
thing so that's why I kind of stick with
the Q&amp;amp;A s and the occasional livestream
like this we are gonna hover at that 700
for a while cuz yeah we started is that
when we started the livestream when it
oh and then people thought oh man you
want to switch to my screen so you can
see if we can see that drop right now
so all of you lovely people
unsubscribing can see what you're doing
this is when we started the livestream
right around now it kept going up and
then it kind of disappeared and then
everyone's I'm subscribing again so
you're doing something also the lifetime
unsubscribes for the channel is now
pretty close to a million I think the
last time I checked which was like a day
or two ago the lifetime unsubscribes for
the channel is nine hundred ninety two
thousand so we're at a pretty clean like
five to one ratio of subscribes to
unsubscribes it's just gonna go so low
enough I'm not gonna talk about it
anymore
super chat hi marques from New Zealand
how does a Tesla Model 3 compare to your
s what is the biggest missing feature
from the model 3 I'll say in short it
compares really well the biggest missing
feature right now is probably the dual
motor option there's no all-wheel drive
model 3 I think a lot of people who like
pre-ordered one and like Northern States
and Canada and up north would have
wanted that but yeah also there's no -
right behind the screen we're right
behind a steering wheel do you think the
next iPhone design will follow the
iPhone 10 I am kind of confused about
the next iPhone because maybe not
confuse but I don't really know what to
expect because right now we have iPhone
10 and iPhone 8 first of all the naming
for the next iPhone do they get rid of
the bezel iPhone and just stick with
iPhone 10 and we just have iPhone 11 or
do we go iPhone 9 and new iPhone 10 I
don't really know what exactly is going
down do we title this live stream
because right now it says marques
Brownlee livestream okay I probably I
could probably refresh it for change it
to yeah yeah let me get the link just to
make sure yeah it says marques Brownlee
livestream
alright I'll change it to say the road
to five million and then enter this is
safe oh okay good looks like it sweet
alright cool um yeah we can go back to
one trying to read this super chat like
oh cool
you got yeah what do you think about
India's new bullet train I haven't been
on it I don't know unsub is for those
who are trying to beat a five millionth
sub about to unsub but then you have
more unsub's
and then you have two sub that's a
really good point yeah maybe maybe stay
subscribed until it's about to be no I'm
not gonna troll like that you guys are
all gonna do it anyway when you're
changing your name to MK be 4k
not HD I've definitely mentioned this
before in a QA HD encompasses 4k 8 k
Ultra HD super ultra HD it's all HD it's
all high definition basically high
definition is a threshold and everything
above it is HD and 8k is 4k is so I
don't have to change the name anytime
soon yep
forget iPhones how am pay-for LGV 30 I
really liked it man I still have the
pre-release unit at the moment but I
made my video about the top 5 features
of it and it's pretty nice
iPhone is released another big deal is
pixel 2017 do you think Google and Apple
would have a close battle like last year
or Apple has one already there's a lot
of a lot of different opinions about it
I think pixel XL to the XL specifically
because the pixel to the smaller one is
not going to be that state-of-the-art
iPhone competitor it's gonna be cheaper
but the pixel XL 2 will have the thinner
bezels will have the top notch specs
will have the first in line Android
updates will have front facing speakers
will have premium build will have one of
the best cameras I think in any phone so
for people who are you know phone
enthusiasts that's definitely something
to look out for and that'll be around
the end of the new smartphone wave for
the year and you can safely pick your
new phone after that comes out but yeah
it's a I do think it'll compete of
course I'm an optimistic person I wanted
to a few things did you have any updates
on lucid air and the red hydrogen one
love your quality Congrats for 5 mil
thank you any updates on lucid err no
any updates on red hydrogen one a little
bit
I did my hands-on video with that red
phone and a lot of people were really
into it basically when I was in that
room with Jim he told me basically he
was showing me the prototype of the body
of the phone and he had a separate
prototype of the holographic display in
a different unit without the red stuff
on it and he said within I think 30 to
45 days of when he was showing you that
he was like within 30 to 45 days we're
gonna have a prototype a phone with the
red back and the holographic display so
it's been that long now they now have
that prototype and they're now choosing
to slowly reveal little bits of
information about the red hydrogen one
including the actual display technology
which is really cool so that's out there
now
but yeah I haven't shown any more myself
since the video they're doing their own
strategic not leaks but like reveals of
things
that's just my video is just one of
those ways to show people the phone
which I'm really honored by hmm what's
up girl
thank you are you going to take your
pixel with you to Cali well yeah of
course if we're if we're going to Cali
for the event of course
all right it was about to be the last
hundred but then like ten people
unsubscribed or a thirty why don't you
make videos in 60fps not that it's good
now just a thought I just I've never
really thought it looked natural like
sir
I mean there's advantages to 60fps video
but I think there's more advantages to
resolution and clarity but I prefer
30fps when I look at 24 FPS video it
looks choppy when I look at 60fps video
it looks like just unnatural and weird
what were your thoughts on the Steve
Jobs theater what was the vibe of the of
the room during that opening sequence
honestly that theater was really cool I
took a bunch of photos of it from inside
I still don't know how they hold the
ceiling up I don't know if you guys saw
that tweet but the top floor of the
theater is all glass completely
surrounding you oh I got to find a
picture of it it's all glass and then
the ceiling on top of it Steve Jobs
theater oh yeah here we go you want to
show my screen right now there's some
good photos of like people who got one
to the event took pictures of it but
like how do you how do you hold the
ceiling up I don't know so like inside
each of those little glass panes in
between them there is like a small like
metal rod maybe an inch wide but that
doesn't explain holding up the ceiling
does it here's it this is a good angle
right here it's like a bowl
anyway it was really cool architectural
II it was like a quarter of a mile away
you could see down the hill was apples
giant spaceships circle campus it is
huge but yeah we were wondering as we
saw it like we were in it like how do
you back under nine hundred yeah we were
wondering how how how do you hold the
ceiling up downstairs as a theater
itself and it was really it was really
cool it was a quality theater
amphitheater style like it's the stage
at the bottom the audience up above him
the mood was pretty chill during that
opening sequence it was the designated
of course the 10th anniversary iPhone to
Steve Jobs but ya know I think it was
pretty cool but you go to one again oh
my god 50 people's unsubscribe just vice
I think when they see a number they like
they just hit unsubscribe or subscribe
or the chat there it is what do you
think about Samsung wanting to release a
foldable galaxy next year I like it I
mean I don't know how useful the fold
will be I definitely have talked about
foldable smartphones in the past but I
don't know Smyly reviews thank you
to five million thanks for the awesome
videos thank you for watching them I
haven't said that a whole lot lately but
the fact that there's so many of you who
actually come back and watch the videos
over and over again is the reason I'm
able to make them I wouldn't be able to
go to the Apple event if Apple didn't
see a value in inviting me there and the
value they see is I get to share their
product with you guys so thanks for that
thanks for watching the videos and I'm
glad you enjoy them that's what I want
to do 850
it's gonna be 54 for a while
do you think Bixby will ever be able to
compete yeah
sometime just not now Bixby has had so
many false false positives like okay
Bixby supposed to recognize like I'm
saying it now it's not recognizing but
if I say yo Bixby it's supposed to light
up and start listening and that time it
worked that's my key with phrase is yo
Bixby but sometimes it's just lights up
for no reason like I'll be watching a
video where someone says like yo trick
shots huh and it'll just light up or
actually the other day I was editing and
or not editing I was typing before we're
editing and just typing and just lit up
and started listening like hello what
what did you say what I don't know it's
a very sensitive to its name even though
clearly I didn't say anything beside the
seems inferior to touch ID for a variety
of reasons do you think Apple has
started to prioritize design over user
experience form over function how dare
you
yes/no form over function is definitely
a thing um I think here's a question I
could ask you guys this iPhone 10 the
way I think this one down and why they
went so all-in with face ID is because
they couldn't fit the fingerprint reader
under the glass in time if this is true
next year they could put the fingerprint
reader under the glass but they still
have face ID I guess they don't abandon
the face ID but they can offer touch ID
again and it would kind of seem like
you're backing off because the way we
saw the event they're like all face ID
is the future
you don't need touch ID anymore this
replaces it you're all good don't even
worry about it and that makes it seem
like all right we're done with touch ID
in the next like three years like it
won't be on any other there's touch ID
on this MacBook Pro there's touch ID on
the iPhone eight there's still touch ID
out there but they made it seem like
they're moving on like we're gonna have
face ID in MacBook Pros and face ID and
all the new iPhones
but I think if they can get a
fingerprint reader under the display
like is planned with many others maybe
uh maybe they bring it back maybe they
never abandon it in the first place and
we just have this little awkward pre
abandonment step thanks for all your
hard work Thank You Phil really Congrats
bro I make similar tech videos but in
Spanish hope someday to grow to be as
big as you that's awesome I've met a lot
of people I met a lot of people at the
Apple event who are like hey I make tech
videos like you but in insert country
here or answer language here that's
pretty cool
hi from Australia pixel to leeks dots I
made a whole video on my pixel two leeks
thoughts
I'm currently lining up for the iPhone
810 days early to gain exposure to my
channel could you give it a shoutout
so you're like at the store now bro why
would you do that oh man
Oh what just happened Wow Wow how many
of you were on that and button sitting
on that button that's a lot of you guys
on that button holy smokes
yeah it's like a spike uh cool oh that
went a lot faster wow that went way
faster than I thought it would well geez
thank you guys thanks to the 400 of you
who just unsubscribes to go re-subscribe
oh boy that was crazy and it was like
it's exactly 8:00 a.m. right now so it
was like pretty much on the dot that's
funny what we did it will keep going for
a little bit so I was talking about
giveaways earlier oh wait
we're talking about giveaways or oh yeah
yeah there's gonna be there's gonna be
giveaway we I try to do I try to keep
giveaways few and far between because
when you do a lot of Giveaways you get
the crowd of people who's not watching
the videos they're just in it for the
giveaways so I do a giveaway every once
in a while when I feel like it's worthy
uh and I think this is one of those
times whoa
you got five mil and cassini died at the
exact same time two great achievements
at the same time don't butcher my name
though I did yeah I don't know if I said
that right I'm sorry
the cusine you really die at the exact
same time cusine is the the probe that
was like crashing into Saturn's
atmosphere today like the life yeah I'm
pretty sure that's also live right now
well that would be pretty funny I don't
know if that's true but I hope you're
right and that's funny
the giveaway so yeah no expected here's
the thing I want to announce what we're
doing but because of some recent
announcements the giveaway isn't right
now the giveaway is gonna be in a couple
weeks and we'll make it happen and it
will be absolutely worth the wait and it
will be on the theme of five million
subscribers so that's pretty much what
I'll say so if you just subscribed don't
unsubscribe you're not gonna want to
this is something to stay onboard for
but again I don't I don't do a ton of
giveaways cuz I don't want people to
just subscribe for the giveaway and then
leave you know so I'll make I'll make
some videos in between now and the
giveaway and hopefully you watch those
Congrats on five mega subs is that the
prefix from million Omega thank you do
you think it's too late to start a tech
review channel from zero subs Congrats
man and well deserved thank you
I don't think it's too late the thing
about starting a new channel in anything
right now is you need a niche so you
can't just start a gym there
tech channel that does the same thing
everyone else does and you need a way to
be unique in some way so bring your own
unique perspective your own unique style
your your own unique theme maybe talk
about certain types of technology or you
you do hands-on you dive really deep in
a certain certain rabbit hole and nobody
else talks about and starting from zero
subscribers there's no problem there
because you're filling a gap that's not
already filled I think I see a lot of
people starting YouTube channels now
that try to do the same thing that's
already being done you're not really you
kind of are adding to value for people
but if people can get the same thing
somewhere else then they will so I'd say
make unique and make it fun Congrats on
five million keep up the awesome work
what do you do in your downtime when
you're not focusing on tech it's pretty
much always Ultimate Frisbee it's we
have the double practice this weekend we
have a tournament in a week after that
or traveling for that all the time
there's a pro series there's that
there's the Club season it's all its
everyday bro man that's a funny spike
though
I don't even know to say it five
Millions it's such a weird so like the
numbers on YouTube obviously YouTube is
like the universe it's like expanding
with scale and there's no way to like
fully understand that context but I
remember like a couple years ago back in
the day the first channel ever to hit a
million subscribers do you remember that
was does anyone remember who the first
channel was to hit a million subs a
million subscribers it was Fred Fred I
don't know if you know Fred the YouTube
channel that was the first channel ever
to hit a million so there you go
and it was like wow there's a million
people who not only are on YouTube and
watched videos but there's a million
people who have heard of this channel
and liked it enough to subscribe to it
and come back to watch the next one and
that's like a pretty big milestone like
it can't believe there's that many
people now there's channels with
obviously 50 million plus subscribe or I
mean there's one but the scale is insane
and I would have never seen a tech
channel going past a million let alone a
couple million so it's still kind of a
striking all inspiring to me to see that
number and think that's a tech channel
but I'm thankful that there's that many
of you who come back to watch tech
videos I just I just to say I've been
watching and following you from years
before you even finished college back
when you're still trying to find the
groove I'm proud of you bro and keep it
up man thank you sir congratulations I
some videos and work even after five
million your main modest and genuine no
fluffiness or fakeness we get marques
thank you there's so many cake emojis in
this chat I guess that's a good emoji
for it
hashtag worth it still can't add a tweet
stuff man that's what it so fast you get
on one plus new get on one plus uh
probably soon I think that one plus will
probably be pretty early on the update
train right near stock Android quick
updates oh but do you guys know what
this have you seen this before this has
been in the background of maybe one or
two videos so alright you've seen like
the little tiny Android figurines I've
had in the in the backgrounds of videos
or like in random videos you can buy a
giant green android figurine and it's a
smells like paint it's a cookie jar
kinda or whatever you want it to be
piggy bank whatever your deal is and I
sent it to if you look up on Twitter I
am sloth or Timmy ham really talented
artist I sent him a MacBook Pro the
black color MacBook Pro also but this is
the first project that he did and look
at the detail look at the paint look at
the logo so this is like one of my
favorite new like ornaments to just have
around pretty sure I can wave and say hi
yeah
making sure yet okay do you think it
could hold that probably not it's
handled too far away
yeah but can definitely be happy there
you go now it's happy but yeah it's real
I'm excited for that MacBook Pro I think
that'll be sweet I think it'll be right
here in front of me on live streams
actually mm-hmm yeah definitely
expensive the iPhone 10 is an expensive
phone you got that right man I don't
know I don't know what to do we got to
we got to five million it's like just go
to sleep now thank you thank you guys
his iPhone 10 worth it
so my the video I just did the follow-up
video well that cuz oh I thought his
name was Brownlee but what the last
video I did which was last night about
iPhone 10 the follow-up that covers a
lot of the questions that people had
about iPhone 10 so you did the first
impression the video you know we got our
hands on time and then I go back to the
hotel I edit it I publish it and then I
go to sleep and then we come back to the
studio here and I've kind of like just
been processing like all the things that
I was seeing there and all the things
that I felt about the iPhone 10 and so I
followed it up with that video about
okay is it worth it what are some
frequently asked questions so you should
definitely watch that video that's the
most recent video on the channel bottom
line I think it's people will pay extra
for the better iPhone and but but at the
same time I know a lot of people who are
on like the last leg of their phone
their screen is shattered it's slowing
down it shuts down randomly the
battery's dying and they just want a new
phone those people are just gonna get
iPhone 8 when it comes out and no
problem but I think they might be a
little bit disappointed when they see a
new iPhone two months later that's
better but also not that mad when I see
it's $1,000 and they're like I wasn't
gonna buy that anyway
how much do you expect to earn from the
super chat feature I have no idea and
will it be good enough to buy iPhone 10
well I will be buying iPhone 10 anyway
because I plan on making videos about it
that's what I do but I'm glad I mean
super chat is enabled so it lets me like
get through some some slower foiling
questions because the chat is absolutely
flying do you explain tech to your
parents as well so one asks actually mmm
kind of not that much not as much as
you'd probably expect it's more like
like extended family during like
Thanksgiving and Christmas where it's
like hey my printer is broken again
would you mind fixing it and then the
next time it breaks they call you
because you're the last one who messed
with it that kind of thing my parents
are actually not bad with tech
especially my dad he's he works in IT so
he doesn't really need me explaining
things as much although I do sometimes
still have to break it down a little bit
greetings from all your Brazilian fans
thank you Italian tech youtuber here
inspired by you since 2011 just to say
thank you
hope I'll meet you anytime soon at an
event here in Europe MWC yeah I went to
MWC in Barcelona how long ago is that
two or three mmm WCS ago and that was a
lot of fun but um yeah it's kind of like
I have to pick and choose when to go to
those cuz there's it's a big trip for
like not a whole lot of stuff but you
kind of get to walk around and see stuff
it's like it's like CES but for Europe
you know I was just wondering this
morning in the last five years have you
used any phone consistently for more
than six months straight as your daily
driver I think maybe in the last five
years yeah I haven't in the past five
years I was thinking of the last year I
think I think pixel Excel I used for
more than six months because the way it
kind of works is you have a bunch of
phones released this is the time of year
when the most phones are released
because the holiday season is right
around the corner you want to get your
product offering on the table sometime
in September and October so that by the
time no
December roll around people are buying
gifts they're all buying your product so
September a bunch of phones August
October a bunch more phones and only get
to January no phones get released to
like April it's like January February
March April
a couple things show up here and there
but that's the point where I usually use
a phone for the longest period of time
so I think last year I used pixel excel
from like when it came out October from
October until probably when the note or
the oneplus came out so a couple months
oh yeah that's usually out goes that's
the that's the drill with the way phones
work what is this hey from Mumbai India
quick question what if I what if I blow
scrolling what if I plan to make videos
but this stuff I interests me
smartphones tablets etc is the same as
most other people well my content and
style be enough to differentiate my
videos short answer is it has to be uh
because yeah a lot of people will make
videos about computers and tablets and
smartphones and headphones and cases and
stuff accessories so yeah it's got to be
the style and what you're actually
making and how you talk about it that
differentiates you if the products don't
cake cake cake in HD appreciate that man
what advice would you give someone who
is pretty deeply rooted in Apple
ecosystem and looking into switching to
Android - yeah if you're deeply rooted
the hardest thing to switch really is
iMessage I think everything else is
pretty close you might not find the
exact same apps but if you use a lot of
Apple services that's gonna be hard if
use Apple Mail if you use iCal like you
basically have to go into the web
service export it import it into Google
and then go from there but the the
reverse way is always easy because you
can access Google Calendar on everything
so going from Android iPhone is super
easy but Apple has created this thing I
don't know if you know what it's called
a
walled garden where it's really pretty
and beautiful and luscious on the inside
but leaving is really hard they call me
the mkbhd of India no not really but
you're an inspiration mate
trying to make quality videos like you
Congrats on five mil all the best for 50
thank you for 50 150 mil Jesus you're
awesome I appreciate out of content
thank you do you feel any lag in the
note eight I'm a bit used to stock uhm
lag I don't think is the word there's
some occasional delay that you don't
feel in closer to stock phones but
that's just the way samsung phones have
been for a long time man mmm-hmm what's
the future of Sony Mobile I saw a new
Sony phone the other day and it had a
huge forehead and a huge chin so I'm not
really sure what to make of that I don't
I don't really know
oh want to talk about okay let me talk
let me talk about the color for the new
iPhone because I want to ask you guys
this I'm gonna read the chat as we talk
about it but the color of the iPhone
eight there is a black space gray it's
upright yeah there's a Space Gray which
is which is like dark dark grey there's
a silver which is the one we've all seen
which i think is probably the least
fingerprint II looking one but they both
have a black front but with the iPhone
eight there is a this gold color and
almost everyone I've seen said they
liked it I think it looks terrible am I
alone in this am I the only one here
comes all the unsubscribes
i I don't think this is a good looking
gold and we just had a gold the oneplus
phone in here a second ago
which is like an actual like kind of a
gold color when I saw this at the event
like I thought this was I who I actually
thought it was rose gold so I've
on X let me show you my clip for my
video oh wait a second wait for it wait
a second okay so the beginning of the
video I talked about iPhone 8 this is
the silver with the glass back and this
is the gold and it looks like a I said
band-aid color I've said it looks kind
of like like a sandy sandblast kind of a
look the outside ring around the camera
and the side ring around like the metal
around the edge of the phone looks like
a copper sort of blush look but I don't
think it looks like a good gold
what is the chat saying not the gold or
whatever it is terrible not gold sand
color I want to send you with $1000 pink
pink it kind of does look pinkish I
don't know man I don't I'm not a fan
either way you know what I did was today
this morning at 4 a.m. I ordered the
gold I ordered it I'll take a second
look at it I think I ordered so I got a
64 gig gold iPhone 8 and I got a 64 gig
Space Gray iPhone 8 plus so that's what
I ordered for for what I'm gonna be
reviewing but yeah those reviews are
coming soon but yeah I don't know I'm
just not a fan of this side of this like
super gold color this whole web pages is
like pale I think pale is the word that
describes it I don't know it's weird
anyway
yeah this is this has been fun
I am definitely shout to the Philippines
shoutout to the Philippines this is fun
I think we're gonna do a couple more
live streams or the path over the next
couple weeks but there's a lot of videos
coming up that we're gonna be working on
there's the QA for September there's a
note 8 review September September
there's all the Apple stuff all those
reviews
there's gonna be a bunch of pixel to
stuff when that comes out and then
everything in between all the I still
want to show you the Hasselblad stuff I
still have a bunch of other things to
work in a thousand people have
subscribed since we hit the milestone
but basically I just want to take a
second at the end of the livestream here
to say thank you thank you for for being
a subscriber I kind of talked about it
earlier in this livestream but like
again the reason I'm able to make half
the videos I've made in the last month
the reason I'm able to make them is
because you watch them so I try to give
you guys a bit of a unique experience
when you watch the videos
that's an evolving style I think about
evolving style all the time and that's
something we've been working on but uh
obviously a lot of you guys are
interested in the same tech that I am so
that's why we're showing it and it's
just been a fun ride I still remember
like it was yesterday the video that I
did when the channel hit a million
subscribers which was I was sitting in
my college apartment on the bed talking
to see 118 to 35 and the same mic setup
and everything and just like when I say
we're getting started like we're just
getting started
like I really mean we're just getting
started so that rings true the the
evolution continues but yeah that's
pretty much it
all right stay tuned on Twitter stay
tuned for new videos and for giveaway
information since I know you guys are
all into that let me just put this
Android
it's too tall all right shout out to
everyone watch this this livestream
