is the unboxing and some first
impressions of the brand new Nexus 10
tablet from Samsung and Google so what
better place to start than the outside
of the box here and you can see the
design is pretty similar to that of the
Nexus 7 box and the Nexus 4 and you can
have your Google Nexus logo and Samsung
logo peacefully on the side of the box
no problem and on the back you do get a
little bit of a write-up about the
device and Google Play but without any
further ado let's go ahead and get into
the unboxing itself and you can see the
outside is just a sleeve so the inside
box is this sleek black and you go ahead
and open it up and right on top of
course is the Nexus 10 so we'll go ahead
and move this guy to the side just for a
second because there are a few things
behind it this mouse tablet and that'll
be your USB charging and data cable and
the charging adapter free of the wall
and whatever country you're in and a
little bit of paperwork just a little
bit and of course after the unboxing be
gone with the protective plastic on both
sides of the tablet and let's get into
this alright so first impressions of
this product without even having turned
it on yet of this hardware is that it is
built pretty well first thing that
sticks out on me is the front-facing
speakers on the sides that's probably
gonna be really nice and something else
also is this front-facing camera is a
little bit off to this to the right-hand
side so it's not quite Center but that's
no big deal
popping around to the back I love this
back this texture is surprisingly tacky
you can probably see that Nexus logo
here but it's surprisingly tacky so you
can grip it with one hand no big deal
and of course the camera also happens to
have a flash next year which is cool and
a microphone but I'm gonna go ahead and
without any further ado turn the device
on for the first time of course you can
see up top or the power button and the
volume keys and on the bottom down here
is your Pogo pins and of course charging
will happen over here on the left hand
side and there's also a three-and-a-half
millimeter headphone jack but of course
I am holding on the power button to get
a first look at the display as it turns
on that was a little weird got some snow
at the bottom huh but there's a Nexus
logo and we are booting up the Nexus 10
for the first time so it's strikingly
noticeable about the webcam is to the
side that was fast
that was really fast okay well we're
gonna go right ahead and set up the
Nexus 10 we're gonna head walk through
the setup process here for English in
the United States and I'm gonna connect
to Wi-Fi now connecting and I'm guessing
it's gonna ask me for my Google account
information which I also won't be
showing you but I will show you that
screen anyway yep so it's asking Google
I'm gonna go ahead and put in my email
and stuff now right so it'll ask me if I
want to backup and restore
I don't want to restore anything right
now but I definitely want to keep this
tablet backed up to my Google account I
want to use Google's Wi-Fi or Google's
location and Wi-Fi and setup is already
complete and of course it's gonna have a
gigantic Google Play widget and we
already are in Android 4.2 jelly bean my
first impressions of the keyboard as I
was putting in usernames and passwords
of stuff was that it was really
responsive it does have a motor inside
which will vibrate so if you have a
vibrating notifications you'll get those
as well of course we can see all the way
on the right-hand side is our quick
settings and we can scroll that down and
it'll slide back up and then we have our
regular notifications so we have a bunch
of updates in the Play Store which I'll
get to in a second and we have this
magnificent 2560 by 1600 display so I'll
go ahead and move around here through
the notifications and the app drawer and
all kinds of things and right off the
bat it's obviously really smooth project
butter is of course present here and
let's go into our settings and check out
that jelly bean Easter Egg about tablet
Android 4.2 looking good on this display
I gotta say I'm immediately impressed
with the 2560 by 1600 resolution and I'm
gonna be getting some close-up shots
with this of course in the full review
video but the point of me asking you
this right now is I want to see what you
guys want to see in the full review
video I want to know what you guys are
excited to see what you want to see more
information about you know maybe its
battery life maybe its web browsing
performance gaming let me know because
this is how I get all the information to
provide reviews for you guys so
definitely let me know what you're
thinking
of course whoo we have Google now we're
gonna go ahead and hit next because I of
course want Google now to give me all
these cards to be useful I'm in showing
my team show me stocks of course all
this stuff is very useful if
