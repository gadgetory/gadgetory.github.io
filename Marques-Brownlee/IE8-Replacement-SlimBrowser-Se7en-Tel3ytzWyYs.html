from mkbhd and welcome to another HTT
tutorial and in this video i'll be going
over a web browser you may or may not
have heard of brand new for windows
called slim browser so slim browser as
you heard me say before is a brand new
web browser for windows that really
allows for a very light and as you can
tell by the name a very slim web
browsing experience now it does happen
to be based off of Internet Explorer so
I'm going to give you guys a basic
rundown of this internet browser first
of all you can get this at the link in
the description it is build Oh point 3
version 4.1 2 and just gotten a lot of
positive reviews from cnet com so I'm
definitely going to be showing this to
you guys and like I said the link that
you can get this at to download right
now is in the description so anyway I'm
going to open up the browser itself here
this is the shortcut on my desktop if I
just go ahead and double click it you'll
see the speed at which it opens up well
first pretty much for a cold boot is the
slowest boot then once we maximize you
can tell it's gonna have to be pretty
much a whole boot is going to be the
slowest boot then every time from then
on out it's going to be pretty quick but
that's the first time I've booted this
browser today so if we just go ahead and
take a tour around to here you'll notice
it is definitely based off of internet
explorer like I said however Internet
Explorer as we all know is a pretty bad
web browser however if we just go ahead
and not just a few page loads here such
as youtube com and I'm actually signed
in because of the auto remember that
I've selected I does open really really
quickly so I just go ahead and I go to
the my subscriptions which actually does
tend to take a while it's pretty quick
and it works very quickly now if I go
back up here to the top you have a tool
bar called my search this is a tool bar
that is built into the browser and as we
can go down here we can search different
categories of things so we can search
our building calendar we can search news
movies sports TV weather etc so if I
search TV it'll automatically redirect
me to the built in my search TV
searching website
so it's a very very uh it's a fully
functional browser in the first place
and it does seem like a watered down
version of something like firefox or
internet explorer but it does have a lot
of features built in that you normally
wouldn't expect so back to the YouTube
tab you'll also notice you can right
click on it on a tab in this second
column here and you'll have a number of
options for things that you can do with
this tab you can close it or you can
right click on a tab and duplicate it
which is basically opening the exact
same tab twice you can also right click
on one and hide it lock it to burnet to
prevent it from closing you can add it
to a group and are basically a favorite
you can close all tabs or you can close
all but current tab which is actually
one of my favorite features also you can
add this into whitelist into black list
and a number of other things that you
would really have to get to use this
browser for a while to know the name of
and also there's a built-in auto refresh
feature now if we look up here on the
right-hand side of the browser where the
minimum maximum and X buttons usually
are you will see some very similar
looking buttons that actually perform
the same tasks with a different look
this is the minimize button this is the
maximize button and this is the exit out
button so if i press this button right
here it'll minimize and exactly this is
the restore button as you could say to
bring it down to a window and to resize
the window so it does have very very
similar features with Internet Explorer
so the last really unique feature about
this web page is the toolbar up here at
the other side the top left-hand corner
so if we go ahead and hit the file
button file edit and view are really
very standard features that you'll
probably also see in any other web
browser favorites are slightly different
in this web browser but not really
notable if we go to language this is
something that's actually quite
convenient if you happen to be on a
Spanish or a different French website
and you speak English you can hit ctrl T
and the built-in web browser add-on will
just go ahead and translate that page
into English for you you can also use
babelfish translation or Google
translation I think that's a very
convenient feature and it's nice that
they built that in next is groups it's
very similar to favorites however you
have a different method of organizing
your groups you can save different
groups and different types of groups and
basically it's very very
way of organizing your bookmarks also
auto login is directly in the toolbar as
well so you can control different ways
that you auto login to pages as you saw
before I auto logged into Google and
YouTube and they work flawlessly tools
is in any other YouTube or any other web
browser as you can see you can set this
as a default browser you can I use your
email settings or your so your filters
and set all these different internet
options and as well as your autofill
options as well and tools last but not
least there are windows and help which
are also quite normal options for any
other web browser so as you guys can see
it's a very clean very quick web browser
it's going to import your bookmarks
directly from Internet Explorer so if
you have any saved like I said they'll
definitely be killer loading times and
you'll pretty much have the off the
optimal web browser for your pc if
you're looking for something lightweight
so this has been marques Brownlee from
mkbhd and thank you for watching this
tutorial on flash peak slim browser I
hope you enjoyed and maybe you'll be
inspired to check out the browser
yourself and that is basically Bennett
so thank you for watching this tutorial
and I'll catch you guys in the next
video peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
