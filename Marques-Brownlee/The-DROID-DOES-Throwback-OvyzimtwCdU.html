the past couple months or on Twitter
some of which I can agree with but
they're all sort of looking at phones
coming out these days and saying they're
mostly pretty similar they're all big
screens on rectangular bodies with big
batteries and big cameras and there's
only so much you can do with a rectangle
I also kind of said it but maybe a
little bit differently but in a previous
video I said like we don't even really
measure smartphones by how good they are
anymore or what's so good about them we
measure them by what's wrong with them
and how many flaws they have and if
there's enough flaws to make a phone
like a deal breaker
Bishan
yep see this this is a classic the Droid
came out in 2009 and that was the same
year that we had the iPhone 3GS
so this phone was aimed directly at that
I phone and all the shots fired in that
commercial all the the rips in that ad
were shot at the iPhone 3GS and you
don't even really see an entire
commercial for a phone dedicated to
comparing yourself to another phone that
doesn't even really happen anymore
but I'm so that we got it because that's
sort of a diss track from Motorola was a
pretty good to highlight a lot of the
differences in style okay yeah so the
iPhone had a software keyboard and the
Droid had a physical keyboard that it
was pretty proud of the iPhone was
slightly infamous at this time for not
doing multitasking well and the Android
phones didn't even really do it that
much better but you did have sort of a
little carousel for your most recently
used apps and you can sort of switch
between them within Ram before they
closed so in that way it was a little
better and you could have that as part
of your ad the iPhone 3GS had a three
megapixel camera on the back the Droid
has a five megapixel camera and if there
was ever a time that you could convince
someone that higher megapixels in a
camera automatically makes it better
it's 2009
this was a big one remember when you
couldn't change your wallpaper on your
iPhone this was around that time so you
kind of see where they coming from and
this is still an argument used today
people will continue to say that Android
phones have way more customization to
the way they look and the way they
operate then on Android and this is
super true when it was just i OS 3 this
is another Android thing iPhones still
don't run widgets boy has that changed
the Play Store was a big deal for
Android at this time and also the App
Store was not nearly as much of a
monstrosity as it is for iOS today so I
guess in that category the iPhone wins
the most approved award so the iPhone
3GS didn't have a flash on the back fun
fact but should you remember that also
the Droid does so again this phone had a
removable back which would allow you to
add microSD storage and swap out the
battery which is again two things that
the iPhone has not done since and
probably will never do so that's
something that's also been different
style so I think what made the droid
stand out was it was just a much bigger
phone so a bigger display had this
keyboard and then the software this
Android experience being very different
from iOS 3 so this isn't just any droid
this is my droid this is the first thing
I ever reviewed this is should I link it
oh sure I'll link it I'll embarrass
myself this is the first review I ever
made was of this phone and I used it
every day for like two plus years and
that's a long time for me and I still
I'm not gonna lie and say I could still
use this phone today but there are a lot
of things that still stand out about it
that are good that are quality things
that you look for in phones right now so
just kind of fun to look back at a
device that made a big difference in the
way phones are talked about the way
phones are viewed today I kind of want
to pick up some other and look at some
other classic phones like I would say
this is a classic I would say the first
iPhone is a classic I would say the
t-mobile g1 I would like to look at as a
classic and maybe some others around
this time too but my question to you is
and this is kind of an interesting one
what do you think is the oldest phone
that you could still use today like I
know people were mostly using
phones from like the last three or four
years I'm using phones from this year
you might be using the phone you bought
last year 2015 or 14 but I think I think
I could use this which is the Galaxy
Nexus back from when it first came out
in the Verizon days I think I could use
this pretty confidently as my daily
phone right now I think let me know what
you guys think thanks for watching
I'll talk together the next one taste
they just don't make them like that
anymore</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
