frigid day in the Northeast
it's December but that won't stop
autofocus episode 4 this is a McLaren
720's you may have heard of it
so McLaren McLaren pretty much
exclusively makes high-end sports cars
they have their their 540 their 570 GT
then they have their Super Series which
includes the 720 s and then they have
their million-dollar hyper cars the p1
and the Senna so as you may have seen
from my Twitter or Instagram I've had a
couple days with the 720s it's been
ridiculous here are my five favorite
features number one is performance
everything about this car is fast now by
the numbers you would expect that
700-plus horsepower weighing around
3,000 pounds it's super nimble it's
rated 0 to 60 in 2.7 seconds it puts
down big torque numbers this is clearly
one of the fastest rear-wheel drive cars
period but here's my favorite part
McLaren is very very conservative with
their estimates for what the seven 20s
is rated for it's rated to do 0 to 60 in
2.7 seconds but there are videos all
over YouTube of it doing 2.6 2.5 2.4
it's it's faster than that off the line
there are owners putting it on dinos and
getting bigger horsepower numbers than
McLaren is claiming the theory is
McLaren doesn't want to make their
million-dollar p1 and Senna customers
too angry because the 720 s is actually
just as fast as those cars this $300,000
car is apparently just as fast sometimes
faster around a track than the
million-dollar p1 unreal so you probably
never feel the full extent of that
awesome acceleration in that 200 mile an
hour plus top speed especially not me
because I'm driving a $300,000 car that
isn't mine on the streets of New Jersey
in the winter but what I do feel and
notice really is how fast the shifting
is with the paddle shifters it's instant
so
want to accelerate while you're cruising
in six or seventh gear you can drop down
to gears
real quick as you get on the gas and
it's all super responsive also for a gas
car and for a rear-wheel drive car it's
quick off the line yes but something you
really notice and this is coming from
someone who regularly drives a P 100 D
is the 60 to 100 speed that speed after
60 miles an hour is really fast so yeah
it's a fast car again New Jersey
potholes cold weather it's so hard to
demo but trust me this is fast so number
two is the arrow now generally a
supercar shape is designed to cut
through the air as efficiently as
possible at high speed and they all sort
of do that but this one takes it to
another level you can have crazy numbers
on paper really big horsepower and
torque etc anyone can have big specs but
there are so many little things that you
have to do with aerodynamics that make
it just a little bit faster it starts on
this car with those headlights you saw
in the intro the actual headlights
themselves are just the slits in the
middle and the top and the rest of that
area is actually a carbon-fiber lined
opening for air to pass through the
front of the car to cool the brakes so
the air goes through the front past the
wheels through the holes in the door so
these are some of the most incredible
doors to a car I've ever seen
as there's massive slots for air to pass
through them and then when the air
finishes over the back wheels some also
goes up past the engine and out the back
over the rear wing this this whole car
is a teardrop shape around the
mid-engine and you're basically in a
cockpit cutting through the air it's
kind of amazing
visibility is also surprisingly good too
when the wing is down but I do have to
say when the wing is up it cuts into
your rear visibility a bit luckily
there's a button to put the wing up or
down at any time it's down by default at
lower speeds but having it up is better
for downforce and it can flip up to
vertical to be used as an air brake from
really high speeds that's actually a
perfect segue into why I had the car in
the first place McLaren partnered with
oneplus to make him a clarin Edition
phone the oneplus 60 so their theory is
the same way things like aerodynamics
can make an already fast car faster
they've also done some things for this
phone to make an already fast
faster than it already was so there is a
new design with little hints of carbon
fiber in the top and it's got that
McLaren Orange but this phone also now
has what they're calling warp charge so
an even faster fast charging and it also
now has 10 gigs of RAM so thanks to
oneplus we're sponsoring this video and
getting me in touch with McLaren for
this all right now back to the car so
number three is the modes now pretty
much any sports car at all nowadays has
some sort of like a comfort mode and a
sport mode maybe a sport plus mode or
something like that but this is a sort
of next level of modular adjustment that
I can appreciate
it actually splits the modes into two
mode dials one for handling with the H
up top and one for performance the P and
each of them has their own comfort sport
or track so C S or T so you can
independently decide you want your
handling stuff which is steering weight
suspension traction control that type of
thing
to feel more comfortable while you want
the performance or how much power the
engine is putting down to be more sporty
or vice versa whatever you want and then
anytime you put any one of these in
track mode the card dramatically takes
your entire dashboard and flips it down
to hide all the unnecessary information
and just gives you a new narrow screen
at the top that shows your gear your
rpms and your speed that's it
super badass and there's also a mode
called variable drift control which lets
you literally in the cars display dial
in an angle you want to drift at but
again New Jersey winter potholes didn't
really get to try that but number four
is the design this car turns so many
heads not only is a red and a McLaren
and loud but there's just so many cool
unusual bits of design on this car that
looked like nothing else the exhausts
lifted way above the road level where
it's more visible and louder the doors
that not only flip up but also have
windows in the top of them so you kind
of have this little sunroof and a little
extra Headroom when you're sitting in
the cockpit and this is my favorite
steering wheel of all time in any car
I've ever driven which is pretty
important it's like having a favorite
display of a phone it's the main way you
interact with it all the time so it's
important that you like it the
headlights are pretty mean-looking the
whole front end is solo with that front
splitter and also the rear end
whether the wing is up or down is always
a looker so even more in the NSX or any
other car I've driven people are taking
pictures from the sidewalk from next to
you on the road so much snapchat
happening I really get asked if I play
basketball like a lot but I've never
been asked more if I play in the NBA
than when getting out of this car and
then once you park this thing I'd say
half the times I came back to it in a
parking lot
someone was either waiting at the car or
taking pictures with it or just wanting
to talk to somebody about it it's kind
of hilarious I wish I'd mic myself up
for these conversations because half the
time they were amazing like conversation
starters with people who used to work
with car companies or they'd test drive
cars or they'd have a friend with a
sports car all kinds of crazy stuff and
then last but not least number five it's
all the little things the details the
amazingly geeky well-considered
details I mean I guess for $300,000 you
should consider all the details but yeah
they do I'm talking about the sound of
the engine and the turbochargers every
time you accelerate the startup sound
and just how badass this car constantly
sounds there is a front trunk that's
actually pretty big bigger than my Tesla
and I didn't get a clip of it but the
backup camera shows up on the huge
screen behind the steering wheel which
is pretty smart and the relatively
minimal looking interior despite being
surrounded by tech and even a lot of
speakers actually impossible
distractions everywhere and the fact
that when you put the wing up since it
blocks the tail light there's another
light on the wing that replaces it so
you're always visible and just the
amount of carbon fiber in this car from
the front splitter to the headlights to
the engine bay to the rear diffuser
right through the interior on the
steering wheel and everything driving us
car to me feels like Tesla Roadster
training wheels which is probably weird
to say because I think most people would
probably take this over a Tesla but you
can't get over the fact that it's
rear-wheel drive and an all-wheel drive
car to me always feels more planted and
stable and under control especially when
you're really driving it but bottom line
this car is just insane in so many ways
it's like it has too much power for its
own good
I only got to drive it for a couple of
days but honestly you learn a lot
messing with a car like this and I hope
to do it again someday until then thanks
for watching catch you guys in the next
one
