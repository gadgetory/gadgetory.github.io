and if you saw my reddit AMA a couple of
days ago then you saw one of the
questions was I'm trying to start my own
YouTube channel I was wondering what
equipment do you use and you recommend
what you have and my answer 99% of the
time is nope no like I don't recommend
what I use on a daily basis to most
people like you might see me prodding
Austin Evans was going to does something
similar to me on Twitter to switch to
red or switch to the dark side or
something like that but a red weapon or
pretty much any cine camera is total
overkill for not just YouTube but for
most of all you could possibly get out
of it on the web I use stuff like this
because I love it I made a dope tech
video all about the red weapon and why I
use it what it's capable of and things
like that but for most people it's not a
good choice so before I use the weapon
Helium and shot an 8k I use the red epic
and shot in 6k and before that I shot
with the red scarlet and before that I
was actually using the Canon c100 back
in my college apartment before that it
was a canon 5d mark ii before that the
canon 60d and before that the Canon t2i
my first DSLR but before that it was the
Sanyo zack d cg 10 the most important
statistics really are that it does shoot
in 720p HD at 30 frames a second and 60
frames a second VGA resolution and takes
10 megapixel photos so here it is guys
that's for two last week I found one of
these brand new unopened on Amazon so of
course I picked one up first thing you
notice out the box is it's way small not
just smaller than other cameras I've
used but even smaller than most
smartphones now probably smaller on the
phone you're watching this on it's hard
to understand exactly what I mean until
you get some scale but it's rockin a
seven hundred million power rechargeable
battery like as you an idea and a big
selling point for this guy used to be
that is super portable that's why it's
the pistol grip design it would be great
for vlogging because you could just turn
it around and point it out yourself you
could show to the pocket just keep it
everywhere you go it fits in places that
today's cameras don't obviously it's not
the same quality of today's cameras but
you get that point four specs
it has a 12 megapixel sensor
advertises 10 megapixels on the box but
that's in sixteen by nine you can take
it up to 12 megapixels and use that
whole four by three sensor if you dig
into menus and it has a six point eight
234 millimeter lens so about 5x optical
zoom maybe a little less but it says 5x
and that's from a maximum aperture of f3
point 5 2 X 3 point 7 so not the widest
max aperture in the world but it can
definitely blur backgrounds if you get
the subject close to the camera and you
use the old trick of zooming in as far
as you can while being as closest to
your subject as possible it does work
for any lens you can create a blurred
background even with the CG 10 and it
advertised a 60 times digital zoom but
we all know how I feel about digital
zoom I've talked about it before it's
about as fake as the leather on the side
of this camera so no point in using it
but optical zoom is real and it's useful
that's a big point again a good selling
point for this camera also I like the
warning that hey this camera might heat
up a little bit while you're recording
but just ignore it that's supposed to
happen but yeah this little 8 year old
camera shoots 720p video right to SD
cards as Mike's built-in has this
built-in 3 inch display which is again
about the same size as some other
cameras out here today has autofocus
even has a macro mode for close focus
and if you get enough light it can
actually take some footage that looks
pretty decent certainly good enough for
YouTube in 2017 now ok this is going to
look a bit different to you because you
just watched a bunch of red footage but
for an eight-year old camera it does ok
so moral of this tiny story is it's not
all about the quality of the video it's
more about what's in the video itself so
people who are trying to get started
don't have to go buy a great camera you
can probably start shooting a video
right now on the camera on the
smartphone you're watching this video on
the best advice that I can give to
someone is trying to start making videos
on YouTube is not about what equipment
to buy it's just to start making videos
with what you have now and then the rest
will come so get out there and create ok
back to your regularly scheduled
programming thanks for watching plus you
guys an excellent base</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
