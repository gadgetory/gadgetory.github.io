this is the Nexus 5 this is easily one
of the most anticipated phones of this
whole year and now it's here now it's
official and this is the full review so
start off with the design so this one
comes in black or white and a 16 or 32
gigabyte model I chose the 32 gig white
I'm calling it the Stormtrooper phone
others are calling it the panda phone
but I like it I think the design is
pretty classy pretty clean and neat I
did a full video actually on all the
differences between the black and white
model so that'll be the first video link
right below that like button but the the
only thing I found since that video is
that those white Nexus 5 is really not
actually pure white it's actually more
of a shale or off-white color to prevent
it from getting noticeably dirty very
quickly and that works but the Nexus 5
has a very understated design like some
other Google hardware LG manufactures
this guy but it looks almost nothing
like the LG g2 that it's technically
based off of as a soft touch finish on
the back and it's totally flat like very
little curved until you get to the
outside edges and then there's a camera
bump but one thing that really strikes
you when you're holding the Nexus 5 is
just how light it feels in the hand when
you first pick it up out the box it
feels unreasonably light but it's only a
hundred and thirty grams so way lighter
than the Nexus 4 and the HTC One that's
made of metal it's actually the same
weight as the Galaxy s4 but it still
feels more solid in the hand because of
that soft touch finish on the back the
rubberized back
and although this white one does have
some glossy plastic on the sides but in
the words of Matias Duarte this is
hardcore plastic now seriously he
actually said that
either way the rest of the Nexus 5
design is pretty solid the buttons are
really nice and clicky ER and more
tactile than most other phones that
screams quality and speaking of quality
another thing about this phone that's
impressive is the display and rightfully
so
it's a 5-inch 1080p display and it's
incredibly sharp as you'd expect with
441 pixels per inch and it's an LCD
display so it's super high brightness in
daylight the viewable
a ton of angles and overall a very
accurate pleasing display to the eye the
only possible complaint I could have
about this panel are the contrast ratio
sometimes it looks a little bit washed
out and the fact that I could see the
LCD panels backlight when holding the
phone at an angle I don't know if I just
got to use 2 AMOLED displays that don't
have this problem or never realize this
but it became a thing that I just kept
noticing but this is hands-down a big
beautiful display it's even accented a
bit more by the fact that the navigation
bar at the bottom and the notification
is up top or transparent so the display
really just dominates a big wall on the
front of the phone also another minor
thing I noticed on the white model the
circular earpiece which is already
pretty unique kind of glows a bit and
every time I pull the phone out of my
pocket especially outside I kind of have
expected that to be the notification
light because it's so bright but it's
not it's just a really bright constantly
glowing white orb in the rest of an
otherwise black phone the actual
notification light is multicolored and
it's in the bottom center just like the
Nexus 7's but I think it would have been
awesome if they put the multicolor LED
in the earpiece oh and the the earpiece
on the device and the voice quality are
actually pretty good actually really
liked that little accent for the
earpiece but what's not really good is
this speaker oh you try to cram the same
specs as a high-end $700 phone into a
350 dollar phone you inevitably have to
make some sort of shortcut and speaker
at the bottom of the Nexus 5 is
definitely one of those shortcuts it is
very very very very very bad for any
smart phone not only is it firing out of
the bottom of the phone which means
sideways audio and landscape but just
like the iPhone 5s only the left grille
is a speaker and the right grille is
just a pretty microphone so if you
accidentally cover just that tiny area
with your finger which I did all the
time you ruin the audio and have to
readjust your hand easily the most
disappointing part of the hardware on
the whole Nexus 5 is that speaker now
onto something that a lot of other
people have been disappointed by in the
hardware is the camera all right because
of a lot of the other high-end internals
on this phone a lot of people are
expecting the camera to be high-end as
well it's not it's not there one of
those shortcuts that LG had to make to
get this device to be just $350 off
contract so it's definitely a conscious
decision they made
in fact this phone is shares almost all
of the same internals as the LG g2 which
is much more expensive off contract but
they use a different camera sensor and
totally different optics so this was a
conscious decision that they made to go
with this sensor it's an 8 megapixel
sensor behind F 2.4 glass with optical
image stabilization and an LED flash
nothing too extreme here here's the
thing the photos that it takes are
average I'd say better than the Moto X
and the Nexus 4 not as good as the
Galaxy Note 3 or Lumia 1020 somewhere in
the middle average the outdoor
situations and brightly lit scenarios
where you'd expect any camera to do well
it does fine the shots are decent with
sharpness and detail and the colors are
accurate which is nice not every
smartphone gets the colors right but in
situations where you'd say you know hey
it'd be nice to get a really sweet shot
here and questionable lighting don't
count on it don't count on getting a
sweet shot out of the Nexus 5 because it
isn't happening it's just not that
high-end a sensor and it's not up to
that task no shot that you get from the
Nexus 5 is going to blow anyone out of
the water and make them think oh wow you
took that with a phone no way I mean it
does fine and the shots that you take
are good enough to share on Twitter and
really anywhere on the web but like we
said this isn't going to match the $700
high-end smartphone cameras naturally it
actually does its best it really shines
in low-light no pun intended
okay that was totally intended but
low-light is one of its strongest points
thanks to the optical image
stabilization in fact I'd say this Nexus
5 takes some of the best low-light shots
of any smartphone next to the HTC One of
a full gallery of all my sample shots
linked in the description below if you
want to check out any of those I think a
lot of the reason people aren't as happy
with the Nexus 5 camera experience is
because it's not fast anymore it used to
be really fast if you remember when the
Galaxy Nexus was introduced had instant
shutter you could just fire off photos
rapid fire and instant shutter would
take care of that for you really fast
the Nexus 5 as far as I can tell it just
doesn't have it anymore there's no
instant shutter in this new camera app
and cameras have always been the weakest
point of Nexus devices and this is no
exception the software is pretty slow to
open up the camera app and then once the
camera app is open it's pretty slow to
actually take the photo once you've
pressed the shutter button a lot of
times you want to get HDR mode on and
that particular mode takes us a full
second or two
actually turn on and then actually
taking hdr+ photo also takes a full
second or so before it processes and
you're already ready to take the next
shot
so in between shot time is really long
the first time you take a shot it takes
a while to open up the camera and it
takes a while to switch between modes so
I would characterize this as a slow
camera and that doesn't give anyone any
sort of confidence when taking shots
with it I mentioned in another review
video of a recent phone the Moto X where
the camera was just awful as well this
is on a very very software level this
could be entirely fixed through a
software update I would encourage Google
to push the stock camera after the Play
Store like Motorola did with theirs and
make it better through that because this
is really the worst part of the software
this phone this camera app could use a
lot of work but at least something that
I loved about the Nexus 5's camera app
is the video mode the optical image
stabilization makes for some really
smooth video which is awesome focusing
is pretty quick you can take pictures
while recording and the microphone is
really good as you can probably hear
it's easily one of the best in any
smartphone I've ever used and that's
LG's fault so good job LG I appreciate
the awesome mic and the video quality is
that much better because of it but of
course this is the Nexus device so the
main focus here let's be honest really
isn't the hardware it's most definitely
the software and of course this is
running the latest version of brand new
Android 4.4 KitKat in fact it's the only
device right now on the market running
KitKat and the word I would use to
describe KitKat on this phone is clean
that's the word that keeps coming to
mind when looking at this new design in
fact it feels like a very understated
minimal OS for a very clean minimal
understated phone design first thing
you'll notice is the transparency and
they've removed a lot of the holo blue
accents from jellybean and made those
elements pure white so there's no crazy
colors going on here anymore for the
most part except for that Settings app
which apparently they forgot to remove
the blue from but the real point here of
the new design is to let the apps take
center stage let the Play stores take
center stage and apps are now the main
focus even their icons are bigger and as
a newly adjusted Roboto font and even
this further supported immersion mode
which will encourage apps to take up the
full screen and hide the notification
bar and the navigation bar now KitKat is
way less memory hungry than previous
versions of Android
in fact it lowered the system
requirements to half a gig of ram so
that's not a problem for the Nexus 5
plus the Nexus 5 has a Snapdragon 800
2.3 gigahertz quad-core processor and 2
gigabytes of RAM so performance here is
exactly as you would expect it's buttery
it's very responsive and smooth and
silky and whatever other words you want
to use to describe the feeling of using
stock Android on a high-end device it's
all of that and that goes for
multitasking and switching between open
apps and for launching new apps and this
goes for web browsing and scrolling
around in Chrome it's all very familiar
stuff like the Google Play edition
galaxy s4 and the Google Play edition
HTC One it performs just like those
which is great and since jellybean
supports trim an newest version of
android supports trim as well long story
short here is this phone is likely going
to perform really well just like this
for years to come
but even after knowing all that you know
it's weird the battery life I'm
surprised by how inconsistent that
battery life really was with this Nexus
5 now it has a Snapdragon 800 chip and
that's supposed to be a power sipper and
Android 4.4 is supposed to be less
memory intensive and there's supposed to
be you know new location settings in
Android 4.4 to use even less battery an
optimization on a Nexus device should be
at an all-time high and has a
modest-sized 2300 million power battery
but yet actually could not make it
through an entire day on the Nexus 5
battery without recharging at some point
during the day still haven't done it and
that sucks I mean I get up at 7 a.m. and
at some point before maybe 5 p.m. the
battery will be dead and I have to get
it onto a charger now it helps that this
supports wireless charging so I can just
drop it on an orb anywhere and it helps
that it's actually a quick charger
because it's only a 2300 million power
battery but still I wish the battery was
better the phone is very slim it's it's
one of the thinnest out there and it's
already extremely light I would not have
a problem at all if LG had put a larger
battery inside and made it a little bit
thicker bigger phones even the curved
phones out there right now tend to be a
little bit easier to hold from the flat
thin ones and this is a flat fin phone
and I would have rather seen a slightly
bigger and maybe more curved phone with
a bigger battery just to get it through
the day at least once
now as technically a developer device I
don't even know how much Google would
care about the battery
life the camera and the speaker on the
Nexus 5 but at least two out of these
three things could potentially be fixed
with an update to Android straight from
Google and it's a nexus so you will get
that update fast and I love KitKat
already it's the most advanced version
of Android yet it's the most beautiful
version of Android yet and that makes
using the phone an absolute pleasure and
I use my phone all the time I'm
basically a power user I could say and
if I could find a way to get more than
what seems like the maximum of three
hours of screen on time in one charge I
would be super happy with this phone but
even now I am definitely satisfied and
I'm moderately happy using what I think
is a really sharp eye catching device
and the best version of Android out
there KitKat it also has one of the
smallest learning curves of any versions
of Android there is more visual cues
starting right on the lockscreen where
they have an up arrow for Google now and
an actual camera icon like iOS 7 that
tells you that you can swipe to get into
the camera it's an even better
thought-out operating system and you can
see much more attention to detail and a
lot of places even if they did forget to
take out the holo blue from the settings
there are so also all kinds of little
little things in android 4.4 that you
notice after a while they're like hey
why does it do that you know little
quirks like in the hangouts SMS
integration it has a separate thread for
your hangouts and your SMS from the same
person I feel like it should recognize
names and combine those there's also two
photo apps and Android 4.4 not really
sure why if they're planning on merging
them or not I don't know they're just
kind of there so there's little things
like that but you'll probably end up
seeing all the biggest problems with it
fixed in software updates and like 4.4.1
very soon which you will be seeing
immediately if you have a nexus 5 so the
bottom line is this Nexus 5 is the most
Google phone that's ever been made it's
it's some people like to call it pure
Android and as far as we can tell it
still is but it feels like a Google
experienced Android whereas you also
have the Samsung experience Android and
HTC and the Sony experience Android this
feels like the Google version of Android
which a lot of people will like if
you're looking for a high-end device
with no compromises and all the best
specs and on paper statistics and
numbers and things like that the Nexus 5
is just flat out not for you you'd be
better off with something like the HTC
One
or the Galaxy Note 3 or the Lumia 1020
or something like that but if you're
looking for the most pure google
experience and you want to be first in
line for android updates and you want to
have all the same things that the other
Nexus is have plus a little bit because
it's a Nexus 5 well then this is the
phone for you buy it the Nexus 5 when
you don't consider the price is great
the Nexus 5 when you do consider the
price is in a league of its own because
there really isn't any other $350 phone
with a Snapdragon 800 and the latest
version of Android there just isn't
another phone like that for $350 so it's
in a sort of a class of its own which is
why a lot of people have a hard time
deciding what to compare it with it
inevitably gets compared with other $700
phones rather than other $350 phones I
think Google could decide to make a $700
nexus and not make any compromises like
the camera and the speaker but right now
this is the Nexus 5 we have and it's
recommended for a certain group of
people and if you're considering buying
it you're probably in that group of
people you know who you are and I
wouldn't hesitate I would just pick one
out anyway this is Ben mkbhd thank you
