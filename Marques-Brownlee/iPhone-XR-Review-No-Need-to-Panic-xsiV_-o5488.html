later we've made it through October took
a little breath and now we're right back
at it with November and it just keeps
going and I've started my November with
this this is the iPhone 10 are this one
already has a bit of a reputation but
ideally with my testing and hopefully in
this review we can look past that little
reputation and figure out what this
phone really is I mean it's another
iPhone and I already reviewed the iPhone
the 10s so I'll leave that link to the
review below but this one is very
similar in a lot of ways with the new
parts in the new design but with some
key differences so for this video let's
look at everything that's different
about the iPhone 10 are that adds up to
$250 cheaper and what I think of it okay
so first things first is this size the
iPhone 10 are sits right in between the
10s and a 10s max with this 6.1 inch
display it's fine I'm one of those
people who wishes there was an even
smaller iPhone so that the difference
was more apparent but this 6.1 inch
display kind of splits the middle it's
definitely harder for most people to
reach the corners and the tops of this
display because it is so big that's one
of those things though that you can
check out just by getting in a store and
seeing for yourself but this size for me
is fine and on the build the iPhone 10 R
is made from different materials and
it's built differently than a 10 s even
with pretty much the same looking design
there's no stainless steel here iPhone
10 R has anodized aluminum sides which
means they can color match them to get
it to match the glass backs and yes
there are the six new colors and I know
I've said before the red is my favorite
and yes it still is but I'm gonna go
ahead and give my second place to this
blue I really like it I think it's quite
nice the coral on the yellow don't
really speak to me as much I think
mostly because of the rail colors being
a little less saturated and the black
and the white are just black and white
so the red and the blue are definitely
my two favorite 10 hour colors also
small difference the iPhone 10 ours
water resistance is ip67 where the
iPhone 10 s was ip68 so worth noting and
you'll also notice the slightly
different locations for the antenna
bands the 10r is missing a couple just a
pair of visible bands that
on the 10s and @nr since it lacks these
bands does not have gigabit LTE this
only affects a tiny number of people who
are actually in an area where their
carrier supports gigabit LTE but hey
it's different so there you have it
overall I'm mostly a fan of the build of
the 10r I think the colors are awesome
they didn't have to do colors so I'm
glad they did the backs with the glass
are super saturated and bright and
vibrant but the aluminum on all the
colors on the rails is always less
saturated in the glass which makes sense
but it's kind of a bummer if you put a
case or a skin on it because then you
hide the awesome color of the glass and
you just get the metal it's not the end
of the world but just had to point that
out also with the aluminum it's even
more slippery than the stainless steel
this is I think the new slipperiest
phone in the world champ prone to
sliding out of your pockets if you're
not careful so be careful okay so the
display this is the biggest difference
versus the iPhone 10s this is why Apple
was able to make this phone that cost
$250 less this is why this phone even
has a reputation already before people
even get to use it this is the most
controversial part of this phone iPhone
10 R has what Apple calls a liquid
Retina display you can ignore the fancy
name but it's an LCD with curved corners
its 1792 by 828 and it's surrounded by
this slightly thicker bezel the panel
itself it has great color and brightness
pretty good viewing angles and believe
it or not it's actually crisp enough for
me at regular use though I do start to
see it as less sharp than the 10s when I
pics will peep from close-up but it's
really not a bad display by any means
it's accurate it's vibrant it feels like
the easiest way to make the iPhone 10
ours display seem bad is to focus
entirely on the numbers of it don't even
look at the display just look at the
spec sheet and the numbers on paper it's
less than 1080p and it's 326 pixels per
inch
that's the pixel density you know what
else has that pixel density the iPhone 4
that's an easy way to make it look bad
but you know what else has a pixel
density of 326 pixels per inch the
iPhone 8 and that was fine most people
didn't complain about that and that was
a great display so really focusing on
the numbers isn't the most productive
thing just look at well the actual
experience of using this phone and
looking at the display and in practice
the biggest losses for me with the 10
hour display are no 3d touch and no OLED
Apple did bring touched awake to the 10r
so you don't lose that but obvious
contrast in the black when you're
watching a video isn't quite the same
with an LCD and even though this is one
of the best LCDs you're not going to
have the pitch blacks of an OLED I
personally didn't use 3d touch that much
anyway pretty much only in the control
center and the lock screen so on the 10r
you can do almost the same thing with a
long press that will work in the control
center and on the lock screen shortcuts
but you can't peek and pop into links
and previews and things like that that's
almost completely gone from the 10r but
I honestly don't miss it that much you
still have true tone so if you're into
that I don't really use true tone but if
you do it's also here and you have tap
to wake like I said you have rounded
corners it's fine the display no need to
panic it's really fine the matter of
fact what I really noticed the most
isn't the resolution it isn't the lack
of 3d touch
it's the bezels these bezels all the way
around here just a couple millimeters
thicker than the iPhone 10s are
noticeable to me everyday and to be fair
after a little while you do get used to
it but as a person that has used an
iPhone 10s I much prefer that it looks
and feels that much more modern to shave
I guess one or two millimeters all the
way around the bezel so sure it's a
bummer that you can't watch full 1080p
videos especially on this larger display
trust me 1440 does look a lot better I
would know and it's a downgrade to LCD
and there's no 3d touch but the bezels
to me are actually the most consistently
noticeable difference that you'll have
and you'll have to be ok with them if
you're gonna rock this phone alright two
quick ones the RAM and the battery both
of these are kind of a side effect of
them going with the lower resolution
display first of all there is one gig
less of RAM so three gigs of RAM instead
of four but honestly that's kind of all
you need in iOS when you're pushing way
less pixels and RAM management is
already great and then the battery the
iPhone 10 R has a 2942 million power
battery and it's really good now for
most phones that statement wouldn't
really line up but again because that
800 banach is so powerful and it's
pushing way less pixels the iPhone 10
hours battery life is excellent just as
good as the 10s max and sometimes better
it's one of the best parts of this phone
of course I would expect a phone this
big to have all-day battery life just
out of principle but having it be better
than I expected was a pleasant surprise
so that leaves the biggest difference
the camera the single camera on the back
of the iPhone 10 R which is the exact
same as the primary camera on the 10 s
minus ii telephoto some people have
noticed slightly different image quality
from the 10 RS camera versus the 10 s i
have not for me it's still the same a
very good iphone camera but subtracting
that telephoto lens has actually had
some interesting implications that
aren't all negative so that telephoto
camera as you know is good for two
things optical zoom and portrait mode so
optical zoom
yeah that's gone you concede a worse
quality digital zoom but here's a little
not so secret secret about zoom on the
iPhone that telephoto lens has always
been a worst quality sensor and image
that just let in less light so
oftentimes in worse conditions
specifically low-light the iPhone will
realize that the optical zoom coming
from the darker lens is actually not as
good as the primary so it'll just take
the digital zoom from the primary lens
anyway so yeah there is no telephoto
lens on the iPhone 10 are but I think
that affects a lot less zoom scenarios
than we actually realize and often times
we're gonna get better results from
using the better camera and then the
other thing is portrait mode so the 10s
would use both cameras for a depth
detection and then use the telephoto
camera to zoom in for a better natural
bokeh the 10 our portrait mode obviously
doesn't do this which means it's always
using the better quality primary camera
and it's a wider angle and I don't know
if you've noticed but wider angle
portraits with a shallow depth of field
is kind of my favorite look it's kind of
a thing I think it's the most visually
interesting version of a portrait so I
kind of really like this they've
remapped the background blur to look
more like a wide-angle optic than
telephoto and it makes a real difference
through all the bokeh adjustment I
really do notice it the background feels
kind of more swirly sometimes like they
have more character but there is of
course downside which is that it doesn't
have depth detection anymore at all so
it's doing pretty much all of the work
with software and with that Apple has
limited it to photos of human faces only
so if you try to take a portrait mode of
anything else it won't work it'll tell
you it's kind of waiting for a person to
be detected so that's kind of a bummer
no portrait shots of objects which I
started doing more on
plenty of other Android phones but
that's the price you pay in Apple's
world so all those previous points have
added up to the iPhone 10 are starting
at 750 bucks for 64 gigs definitely not
a budget phone don't let anyone tell you
it's a budget phone but at $250 cheaper
than the iPhone 10s this is a much
better deal the biggest downsides are
the display and the camera I know a lot
of things I kind of spoke about in the
camera we're pretty positive but don't
let me fool you into thinking it's a
better camera those are the biggest
downsides of this phone but those are
when comparing it to the iPhone 10s but
a lot of people are coming from iPhone 8
and iPhone 7 and older and for those
people this is an upgrade in pretty much
every possible way and for not much more
money the iPhone 8 started for 700 bucks
this is 750 so my conclusion is pretty
much the same as I suspected when this
phone first got announced which is this
is the best seller iPhone for everyone
they didn't even have to do colors
imagine if they just did a black and
white iPhone 10 are a little more boring
probably would have flown more under the
radar but the fact that they did the
colors is kind of like a cherry on top
so if you were one of those people who
was already gonna get an iPhone 10s or
10s max you probably still should just
like I said in the review it's not like
you should switch to this instead of
that
but if you're on one of those older
phones iPhone 10 R is a good upgrade
I recommend it there's nothing to panic
about nothing crazy wrong with it thumbs
up for me on this thong that's been it
thanks for watching
tops in the next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
