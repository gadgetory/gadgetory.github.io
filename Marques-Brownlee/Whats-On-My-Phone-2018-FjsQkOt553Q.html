and welcome to the 2018 what's on my
smartphone video now I'm pretty sure
I've mentioned at least once or twice in
previous videos that my setup does not
change that much from year to year on my
phone now fair warning to those of you
who saw last year's video a lot of the
apps are gonna look very similar to that
they'll see I didn't do this video over
and over again because what's on my
phone was mostly the same setup I have
is usually pretty simple and this is
because I switch phones pretty often
during the course of the year
nevertheless here we are people have
asked for it I'm showing it to you again
one of the more interesting questions I
get from friends like outside of this is
isn't it annoying to change your phone
like to switch your whole setup and
transfer everything over and over again
every time you change phones isn't that
and knowing after a while and the answer
is yes but I've kind of streamlined it
in a way I mean Google handles a lot of
the migration of that stuff usually it's
not that big of a deal and then I kind
of streamlined it so it's nearly the
same every time and I know exactly when
I'm done setting everything out but
anyway I'm carrying two phones as I've
mentioned that I did last year two
pockets two phones and it's my favorite
Android phone right now and my favorite
iPhone right now same thing as last year
so this iPhone 10 in silver is my second
most used phone it's good for a lot of
those camera things like snapchat
Instagram live the occasional periscope
things that iOS is good at there's also
a couple of apps some specific VR games
and things like that that are only on
iOS right now so I just kind of always
have an iPhone in my pocket but if you
saw Lou's video from CES a couple weeks
ago earlier this year then you already
know that the main phone in my pocket is
the Panda Google pixel 2 XL but I still
love this phone for all those same
reasons that I loved back when I
reviewed it a couple months ago and I
keep coming back to it for those same
reasons so this is my setup
alright so first of all wallpaper I'll
definitely link that below people have
asked about it I've tweeted about it
recently it's a little bit of a blue
Canyon but this is the setup to start
and I'll just give you that sort of a
walkthrough basically I've said this
before but I use the Google stock
clauncher for a couple of reasons but
mainly because a lot of the features
that end up getting really popular and
are really useful in third-party apps
like Nova Launcher slowly make their way
into this stock launcher now this side
piece here with the Google News and all
these cards it's it's decently useful
but I use it a little bit less because
it's actually gotten worse
you can't swipe away cards anymore like
if you're not interested in something
you can't swipe it away to get rid of it
and that's pretty annoying so it just
kind of ends up filled with things that
I'm not interested in which is pretty
dumb you should let us remove stuff like
this what is it I don't I don't care
about half of this stuff anyway this is
the home screen I got the weather up top
and the date that's cool I don't really
use a whole ton of space so you can see
again like I mentioned it's pretty darn
similar to the last time I showed it so
here's my apps at the bottom I switch to
tick tick which is my task manager app
now it's really clean and it syncs with
itself it doesn't really use Google
Tasks but it's still pretty good and
then I use Google keep to manage lists
like grocery lists so those are the two
must use apps for me Instagram y'all
familiar with that I use it all the time
Yahoo fantasy sports I'm doing a lot
worse this year than I was in previous
years although I do think oh it's a new
week but I did win my last week which is
pretty good my fantasy team is it's
alright I had a late pick well what are
you gonna do there's Google photos
there's Google Maps there's YouTube
studio I think pretty much every
youtuber ever has YouTube studio on
their phone you could use it to answer
comments keep track of videos things
like that that's all there Spotify
my number one music player of choice the
Tesla app that's how you warm up your
car before you go outside in the
freezing cold to get to it high and all
the other management stuff I've done a
video all on that app and then relay Pro
which is my read adapt of choice people
seem to ask every time I show this like
why do you use relay Pro yes there are
other pretty good reddit apps for
Android this one just happens to be
really familiar to me at this point but
anyway I also use this to manage the
mkbhd subreddit which we're using a
little bit more now if you head over to
our mkbhd we're starting to experiment
with that and getting video suggestions
there and things like that so I'll link
that below if you're interested and of
course at the bottom are the mainstays
the phone the messenger the Play Store
the camera app and then
Lemang go is my twitter app of choice
I'm pretty sure when I did this video
last time of the year it was Phoenix
they started messing around with a beta
that I'm not as interested in but
flamingo which is another bird is
another Twitter app for Android that's
really good remembers my spot in the
timeline does everything well it's
pretty it's pretty material it's good
so flamingo I'll link I'll link that
below as well now I'm gonna swipe over
to my second home screen here and this
is my calendar app the full-screen
calendar widget it's the exact same that
I used last time I was showing my phone
but you'll notice it's kind of buggy and
I can turn up the opacity and stuff to
show this better depending on my
wallpaper but I'm cool with it because
it always highlights the top one but it
always says loading at the top of each
day loading loading that's not because
it's actually loading that's just an
android 8.0 bug that this app just has
now I haven't switched to another full
screen calendar widget because I still
like the looks and the functionality of
this one and how good it is I use Google
Calendar for my life but if you're the
developer of this app can you can you
please update this for Android 8.0
please I'd really like it to actually
say the date above each day thank you
anyway going over to the third and final
homescreen it's the shortcuts that I use
just the apps that I'm using pretty
often around now so wallet PayPal and
passes I don't even use Google Wallet
that often but this passes app I use
literally just because of the carwash I
go to which happens to have a royalty
program every tank carwash is you get an
11-3 it doesn't work with Google Wallet
so I use passes I think it's actually
meant for iPhone and a dark sky for
weather this is another one that started
off really popular as an iPhone app
that's made its way over to Android over
the years it's almost as good on Android
as it is on iOS it still has some bugs
though but I mean whether app is a queue
either as you'll see when I go to my app
drawer we have ways I discovered this
recently like in the past year turns out
it's an incredible app for avoiding
traffic and avoiding tickets nest I've
showed that before I've got a couple
Neffs cameras that's the security suite
that's the thermostat that whole thing
the authenticator app pocket cast is
pretty new to me I guess basically
during flights I have to figure out a
way to pass the time and music kind of
gets old after a long time so the pocket
cast app with a couple good podcasts can
be pretty good if you have any good
podcast suggestions definitely hit me up
in the common
below I have the United app that's just
because I fly United a lot and my
boarding passes in there the health mate
app from Nokia this actually used to be
something else but then Nokia bought
them and then now I have a scale that
like talks to the app that tells me how
much it's whatever and then the Google
home app which is all the Google home
devices you have of course if you have
the shopping list I think they ruin the
shopping list I just want to rant about
that for a second you used to be able to
say talk to Google and add something to
your shopping list and then it would
show up in Google keep in a list called
shopping list now if you want to add
something to your shopping list for some
weird reason they changed it to show up
in here inside the shopping list which
opens in your web browser to this
shopping list Google com why they did
this I will probably never know they
should definitely switch it back to
talking to Google keep anyway last but
not least YouTube it's a pretty pretty
great site I've found recently they do
some some interesting stuff over here if
you want to check it out they host a lot
of videos I'll share a link below but
that's basically it for the home screen
layout those are the apps the shortcuts
you see pretty often those are the
things I'm clicking the most anyway I'll
finish it up with the the last scroll
through all the apps that you know I
have on my phone but didn't make it to
my home screen again a lot of stuff
pretty similar to last year but my main
weather app of choice is AccuWeather
platinum it's super accurate and it's
awesome I also have after ship up here
in my most recent that's pretty good for
tracking just about any package anytime
you copy a tracking number to your
clipboard and open up after ship you
asks you if you want to paste it and
track it it's really good it syncs
across platforms backdrops is again
still pretty awesome for finding
wallpapers Chrome Canary is also a lot
of fun fun for showing new features that
are coming to the main version of Chrome
but also it's unstable it's super it
literally has unstable in the name it's
hilarious I have coinbase
that's a thing that's new to me
obviously cryptocurrency in the past
year or two let's see you got daydream
var Dropbox is pretty common
you have the j-bird sound out for
messing with the sound of your
headphones the NBA app I it's it's
alright
it gives me notifications when cool
things happen but scrolling down that's
pretty
it I have pocket I do use that a lot
screener I use once in a while but it's
awesome for sharing screenshots that are
really pretty and I get down here to ooh
BRR and venmo and ZocDoc and YouTube TV
and that's pretty much it for the setup
on my main phone like I said it's pretty
similar to the last year but if you
don't know now you know people were
asking for it so now you have it maybe
in a year if my setup is actually
different I'll be able to share that but
for the most part I'm expecting it to
stay roughly similar so I'll link you to
this video how's that so that's it
thank you for watching talk to you guys
the next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
