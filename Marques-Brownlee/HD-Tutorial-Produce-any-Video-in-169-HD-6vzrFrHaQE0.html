from mkbhd here with another tutorial on
how to render a 4 by 3 video in 16 by 9
HD format now this particular method is
useful like if you have a 4 3 4 by 3
shooting camera and you don't mind it
being stretched like I do have an HD
camera camera but if you do want to get
your videos in HD so that your user can
watch in like in the highest quality
then you can use this piece of software
so the link to download this piece of
software MPEG streamclip is in the
description and what we're going to do
is just do a sample little video for you
using MPEG streamclip so this is what it
looks like when you open it up just very
simple-looking interface we have three
files or four files in order taken here
that we want to render in HD with MPEG
streamclip and also have the
introduction now these are all avi files
so they're all compatible so i'll go to
file open files this is just very very
simple way of doing it go to the desktop
and in order select the files that you
want to use so the introduction and the
one two three four I hold ctrl as I
select these clips then I hit ok so now
the MPEG streamclip will open up all
these files in HD you're not an HD but
this is obviously a preview getting of
the unboxing of those headphones but I
yet basically all those clips are in
order so now what we're going to do to
render this in HD what we're going to do
is go to file and export to mpeg-4 and
mpeg-4 is what I use to get the absolute
highest quality here's a few things
we're going to do to get to the highest
quality we're going to check the D
interlaced video button up by 30 frames
per second up by frames per second
select 30 select the 1280 by 720 HDTV
720p option and last but not least drag
the quality slider now uh this is
different depending on what you want the
quality or the site of the file size to
be like but we all know that h.264 is
the highest quality compression but it's
going to be a really big file size now
yesterday I uploaded a video and it did
get really good response but it was
985 megabytes and it took me a good hour
and a half to upload so I'm be wary of
your file size you cannot apply anything
more than a gigabyte i believe so if you
drag this past about 80 the file size
will start getting big so I'm going to
drag this to 80 and we're going to do is
hit and make mp4 and go ahead and name
it i'm just going to name it name and so
what it looks like when it starts to
encode your video in 720p so you'll see
right here i'm not going to minimize it
but this is the original window up in
the left-hand side you'll have the
exporter preview and we can see it's
nice and wide screen it fills up the
entire it'll fill up the whole YouTube
screen in 720p and up here it will show
us the encoding process how far we are
in our movie the the bitrate exactly how
far we are so it's one percent done
obviously I'm not going to finish this
for the video but yeah you get the point
so I'm gonna hit stop and yeah that's
that's how you render 43 videos in HD so
if you do want to get the the highest
quality out of your videos using not
only camtasia studio 6 which i did a
video on but now out of any video that
you do that you do use a non HD camera
for if you want to get an HD now you
know how to do it so yeah if you like
this video go ahead and rate 5 stars i
love the ratings guys keep up the
comments this is really great and I'm
yeah subscribe if you haven't already
and a lot more HD tutorials to come if
you do have a request go ahead and
subscribe and message me through YouTube
and I try to get to a request video
anyway this has been mkbhd thanks for
watching this one and stay tuned for
more peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
