welcome to 4G and LTE explained so what
is 4G exactly I mean we've seen it on
all sorts of carrier branding and
commercials and stuff sometimes we see
it on the back of our phones or on the
front of our phones but there's no real
widely accepted definition of 4G so
let's try to explain that so as far as
the name goes for G the G stands for a
generation of wireless technology with
each new generation you get
significantly faster data speeds but it
becomes incompatible with the previous
generation so you'll never see a 3G
phone working on a 4G network and there
are carriers that have both 3G and 4G
networks like Verizon we'll get to that
in a second the first G the original G
was the old analog cellular systems they
were obviously super slow 2g moves to
digital but they are still very very
slow somewhere around 10 to 200 kilobits
per second the first iPhone was 2g
funfact 3G is a much faster digital and
it starts at around 384 kilobits per
second 4G systems like LTE and WiMAX
claim to initially start out around 5
megabits per second which is a lot
higher than all the rest we've already
seen but 4G isn't just faster than 3G
the 4G networks also tend to have a lot
more capacity than the 3G networks so
you're going to see a lot less bandwidth
caps when you're on 4G when you're on 3G
you tend to be limited and one on 4G
you'll see a lot more higher data plans
but the complication that has people
wondering what really is 4G is the fact
that there are some really modern 3G
networks like we'll get to in a second
that are actually faster than the
beginnings of the 4G networks for
example HSPA+ it's really its 3G
basically but it's really really fast 3g
somewhere around 7 megabits per second
it's been evolved for so long
t-mobile runs on HSPA+ network and they
plan to continue to evolve it to get it
up to 30 megabits per second so instead
of being left out of the 4G chatter
that's going to be the wave of the
future they just figured they'd stamp a
4G sign on their HSPA+ network and just
declare it 4G because who's going to
argue and one other difference between
3G and 4G since we haven't mentioned it
already is that in order to hop on the
brand-new 4G network like I said it's
probably incompatible it is incompatible
with the 3G network
you need one of those new 4G radios in
your device and those are some very very
power hungry 4G radios
this is why in the United States we
pretty much haven't seen any device any
smartphone at all with both quad-core
and 4G because that's just way too much
power for a single battery to handle
phones these days have you know huge
screens they have extremely fast RAM
these great processors but to throw 4G
on top of all that would be a huge power
suck for the battery and that's why we
haven't seen something like the HTC One
X which is quad-core overseas come to
the United States quad-core which is
coming to the United States and you want
to sell well you just got to put 4G in
there and that's why they're saying I
will make a dual-core and hopefully it
will have enough power last year today
will we ever see a 4G quad-core device
in the United States I don't really know
I did a little bit of a rant on battery
technology already and hopefully a
battery tech and proves we'll be able to
see one maybe the galaxy s3 will be
quad-core in the United States but I
don't really know yet I'm hoping maybe
the next iPhone I don't know competition
is good
either way hopefully this video helped
to explain 4G for you guys in just in
case you were wondering LTE stands for
long term evolution and HSPA stands for
high-speed packet access I don't really
know why those are named that way but
get away give a thumbs up on this video
if you learn something hopefully you
guys like the explained video series and
if you also have anything else that you
want to be explain something technical
that I could break down and make a fun
interesting video let me know in the
comments section below that like button
but either way thanks for watching and I
will talk to you guys in the next video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
