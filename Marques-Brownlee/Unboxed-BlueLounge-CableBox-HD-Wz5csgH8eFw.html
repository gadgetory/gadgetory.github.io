here from mkbhd and welcome to another
hardware unboxing video and as kind of
an awkward sized box here but today
we're going to be unboxing a product
from blue lounge and you can go ahead
and check out the link to this product
the cable box in the description of this
video which should be down below if you
haven't already heard of the cable box
I'm going to say right beginning in this
video there's a product you're going to
want to pick up if you're looking to
start or create a very
professional-looking workspace what I
mean by that is this product has won
several design awards which is very cool
so this has been this is a blue lounge
unboxing so if you guys want to check it
out the before and after pictures for
this are absolutely amazing now if
you're confused when I say that this is
a box that will actually house all the
cables and your ups or your power strip
and that will definitely give your under
even underneath your desk a much cleaner
look whether or not you ever look there
if you have a clear glass desk this will
definitely help your case so again this
is something you're going to want to
pick up if you're looking to create a
very professional-looking a desktop
working atmosphere so this is the white
cable box it comes in two colors in
white and in black of course show you
this later also looks like they've
included the cable drops which are
multi-purpose cable clips which I'll
also be reviewing later later on my
channel but these are very cool just go
on your desktop and hold like something
like a USB cable that's not in use and
you might want to check that out so I'll
include both links on the description
but what we're really checking out in
this video is the cable box so as you
can see on the side this is perfect for
fitting something like a power strip
which may have eight ten twelve power
things going through there your laptop
your desktop your microphone all your
powered accessories and just streamline
it down to make it look very very nice
underneath your desk and fit with the
theme of your desk so what I'm going to
do is go ahead and write and cut this
right open and just go ahead and see
what it looks like what it feels like
this is not a review video but we're
going to be taking a much deeper look at
this
luta near-future on the MTV HD channel
let's go ahead and take a look and I
like to feel this first of all oops and
I'll show you the bottom of it what you
get so this has a nice little plastic II
feel but it doesn't feel cheap I'll tell
you that it does feel solid on the
bottom you have two very large tacky
surfaces along with some instructions on
how to use it which is cool is you can
also put things on top of the cable box
and they match it maybe your wireless
router or your receiver actually fits on
top of it so you also gain some space
from this this is good for single narrow
power strips or the double wide power
strips and this is actually a very good
example of the power strip I do have so
I'm going to showing you this a lot more
in action see if I can take this off and
open it up for you see if we can do this
here this might kind of destroy the box
but this is definitely very cool no need
to unplug anything all you have to do is
open up the top of the cable box put all
your cables into it and close it up so
like I said a very nice full design the
blue lounge logo down here on the bottom
left hand corner and a very clean design
now what I'm going to do is open up the
top of the cable box see if I can show
you what's in it there's a hole on that
side for your cables I'll hold on the
other side for the cables so all you
have to do to open it let's just take
this side go straight up the top comes
off what you have are your instructions
and the cable box itself so here you can
have all your wires all your your before
and after things you can check out like
I said the before and after photos which
look really really good at the blue
lounge website in the description of
this video so that has been the quick
unboxing of the blue lounge cable box
and they even threw in the cable ties as
a surprise which I'll be reviewing very
much in the near future but I do HIGHLY
advise you guys to check this out
so thanks for watching this unboxing
this blue lounge unboxing of an
award-winning product I'll talk to you
guys in the near future thanks for
watching peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
