today I'm gonna be taking a look at a
pretty commonly requested video about
the Samsung Galaxy s3 I've reviewed the
Samsung Galaxy s3 already and part of
the thing that I talked a lot about was
TouchWiz which was on top of it and
TouchWiz is the skin on top of Android
4.0 on the galaxy s3 when you get it
it's planned to have an upgrade to touch
ways the next version which will be on
top of Android 4.1 but I've enjoyed my
Galaxy Nexus so much that I wanted a
pure almost near stock Android
experience on my galaxy s3 so without
any further ado I'm gonna be taking a
look at my favorite ROM so far for the
galaxy s3
if you've root it you can get
CyanogenMod 10 or the nightly builds and
I'll show you what it looks like running
on my verizon galaxy s3 let's go ahead
and take a look by the way I have no
idea this is the final angle for what
I'm going to be doing videos at I'm
still sort of messing around with things
getting it set up but let's get into
this real quick now the first thing
you'll notice about your device when you
turn it on is your lockscreen and that's
because the lockscreen here I have it
right next to the Galaxy Nexus here this
is running pure stock Android 4.1 and
this is running CyanogenMod and you can
see here that the lockscreen is
identical I could add some other
shortcuts up here and up here if I
wanted to but you also have to swipe up
Google now left for camera and right to
unlock and that is where you'll get to
your home screen and that's where the
the similarities are pretty much the
same for the rest of everything else
with some minor additions thanks to
CyanogenMod so first of all to make sure
you have Android 4.1 jelly bean you can
go to menu and system settings and at
the bottom there's about phone you can
see here Android version 4.1.1 and
CyanogenMod is the kernel version and we
have of course our full two gigs of ram
you'll actually find that you use less
ran because TouchWiz does use a little
bit of the RAM and you won't have any of
that RAM being used by TouchWiz when
you're running stock Android some other
neat additions are you get to swipe down
from the notification bar and you'll get
your toggles here from CyanogenMod so
Wi-Fi toggle Bluetooth your GPS and you
can change your volume and set it to
volume on or vibrate or silent or
whatever you want to do there also
project butter is present throughout the
operating system so everything is just
dead smooth there's no hiccups or
stuttering as far as I've seen just like
Android 4.1 on other devices that are
running stock Android
there aren't many but you can get that
experience by running CyanogenMod and it
is absolutely buttery smooth Google now
still works so I'll ask it a random
question like what's the weather like
what is the weather like and it'll go
ahead and tell me what the weather is
like here and if you have the volume on
it'll go ahead and read stuff out Google
now works flawlessly data works
flawlessly there is nothing missing or
wrong or incorrect about this ROM and
that's why it's been working perfectly
as a daily driver for me also I'll show
you the camera this is another big
reason that I've been using the galaxy
s3 is because that 8 megapixel camera
but it still has instant shutter so of
course if we take a picture here it'll
move to the side and it's instantly
available and you can swipe left and
right and go through the pictures you've
taken all that soft force still works
this will take panorama and you can now
take 1080p video and just keep taking
really really fast shutters and eight
megapixel photos will just fly through
like that also for location-aware apps
like say Google Maps the galaxy s3
actually has some of the fastest GPS
lock of any device I have ever used so
if you ever have any issues with that
well you won't have any issues with that
Google Maps Navigation any GPS tagging
stuff like Foursquare that'll all work
perfectly quickly and really really fast
thanks to the fast OS and the fast GPS
lock on this phone some other neat
things I notice there are no software
buttons on the bottom so I'll bring in
the Nexus again so you can see there are
these software buttons back multitasking
and home but you don't have these here
on the galaxy s3 because your home
button here you have your menu button
and you have your back button and those
all still work perfectly in terms of
battery life I've gotten some pretty
decent battery life I do use my phone
quite a bit you can see here it's been
on for 6 hours with quite a bit of
screen on time actually not a lot of
screen on time but quite a bit of usage
basically and it's halfway through the
day and I have 76% battery life left
I typically end the day around 11 p.m.
and I'll have about 20% left which is
pretty good but besides that everything
else about the phone is fast I mean I
haven't gotten a lot of questions about
it but basically people wanted to know
is it daily driver material and from
what I got to say from my experience yes
this is daily driver material so I can
use this for all my apps that are
compatible with Android 4.1 and below
you know Twitter
ABB's notifications all that kind of
stuff it just works I haven't found any
flaws with it and it's been a really
enjoyable experience so far so connects
to really fast data I'll go and do a
speed test here just because I happen to
feel like showing off my new Wi-Fi but I
mean there's not a whole lot that goes
wrong at all I haven't had any random
reboots this happens to be the Verizon
version of the Samsung Galaxy s3 which
means you'll have to get past the
bootloader before you do any of your
routing and flashing your rom so I'll
have instructions for that below but
basically if you have any questions feel
free to send me a message on YouTube or
go ahead and leave a comment below and
I'll do my best to help you out this is
an absolutely highly recommended ROM I
just there's nothing wrong with it at
all and it's a pleasurable experience
here's a quick tip I use on all the 4x
devices if you go to settings and you go
down past all that CyanogenMod and
Google stuff and you go to developer
options you can go down here into your
animations and change the animation
scale to 0.5 X so let's say you want to
make it really really slow by 5 X you'll
see all the animations are really really
slowed down by default it's actually 1x
if you make it point 5 X you'll notice
your device just feels a lot snappier
and you can turn animations off
completely but I prefer to have them on
really snappy and it feels really really
fast and last thing you should know is
there are some CyanogenMod settings in
here so if you go to interface you can
change some settings about the launcher
so you can change your look and feel you
can change all the different signs in my
settings if you have themes if you have
profiles all the stuff is accessible in
here so if you're really hard for
Android person you can go in and
customize and change everything about
this stuff you can change which buttons
you have up here in the widgets you can
change which toggles you have all that
stuff is available to you and that's
pretty sweet so I've been using
CyanogenMod 10 for Android 4.1.1 and I
love it so there you go it's really
really close to stock Android and it is
been my daily driver for a couple months
now actually it's a really really solid
ROM and I'd recommended if you've rooted
your Galaxy s3 for those of you who are
new to the whole flashing a ROM process
and being rooted I'll have some links
below this video where you can check out
the best way to get your phone rooted to
get your bootloader unlocked into flash
Romney want thanks for watching this
video go and give a thumbs up if you
enjoyed it or if it was helpful at all
and next video is one that will be
that's been requested a lot more than
this particular video was so I hope you
guys are ready for that either way
thanks for watching and I'll talk to you
guys later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
