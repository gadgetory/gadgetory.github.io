get a little extended test manager which
is a basically replacement for the
built-in control shift escape built in
task manager for windows vista i'm
running vista right now so here's what
it isn't how to get it um Oh open up an
internet browser and I'll post this link
in your description so I'm gonna copy
and paste that right now this links is
an extended task manager which gives you
a much much much broader system overview
gives you a lot about your memory usage
you're just reading and writing history
CPU history for a longer period of time
networking your port usage and even a
summary tab for a whole lot of this um
this is your port usage so it's really
really nice all the features that they
give you and if you do want it um the
link i give you is this website all you
have to do is scroll down and open this
window now open in a new tab and that'll
bring up this one and you just click on
the free download and ill replace the
control shift escape this task manager
it'll replace this one you will well you
will have it if you uninstall it but if
you hit ctrl shift escape again which is
your shortcut for vista task manager or
if you're an XP is control overly then
this will be replaced by the extended
task manager which is good it's good
that they integrated that in so you no
longer have to search and look for it
every time you want to use it so this is
just a brief tutorial I hope I can get
it up in HD I think it's a neat little
freer program I'll start reviewing
