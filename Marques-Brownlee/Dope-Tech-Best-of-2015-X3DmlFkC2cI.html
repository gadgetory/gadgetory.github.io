was a great year plenty of dope Tech
came out during the year 2015 so instead
of saying 2015 was the year of the blank
insert cliche here let's not put it into
a box like that too much awesome stuff
came out so we're gonna round up all
that stuff this video will serve as a
hub for everything you need to know
about the year that just happened in
tech so number one smartphones they're
kind of everywhere plenty of people have
them now and we got a bunch of awesome
smartphones released in 2015 their
performance got better their features
got better their cameras got better they
got better in a lot of ways and it would
be hard to go wrong with any of the top
view choices of course I made an entire
separate video the smartphone Awards
2015
boom the card is right there that video
details all the stuff you need to know
regarding all the phones released this
year then there were also tablets and I
also made an entire video about those
tablets because they had a bit of a
weird year in 2015 I guess as far as
progress goes that's not to say they
were bad we still got some really good
ones iPad air 2 iPad pro pixels see from
Google surface pro 4 but they definitely
had a confuse trend going on as far as
the functionality goes so you should
watch that video too and then there were
wearables the technology that you
actually wear on yourself and 2015 was
the year of the second wave of
smartwatches including the first Apple
SmartWatch called the Apple watch and of
course we had that alongside others like
the Moto 360 version - the Moto 360
Sport and similar smartwatches from
others pretty much everyone got into the
game in the last two years everywhere
from Huawei to actual watchmakers like
Tag Heuer these pretty much all do way
more than your average fitness band
since they talk to your phone and they
show your notifications and stuff but
that's the thing is they're definitely
all still smartphone accessories not
standalone devices by themselves and
that's kind of the point I was also kind
of cool to see Android wear show up on
the iPhone this year now virtual reality
takes a few steps forward every year and
this was no exception we got new stuff
from Samsung in the gear VR and Google
cardboard these being the headsets that
actually use the display in your
smartphone to deliver that immersive
experience but the standalone headsets
also advanced so we got new oculus rift
new Sony PlayStation VR previously known
as project Morpheus and HTC vive which I
got hands-on time with this stuff is
definitely still niche though so the
hardware required to make a good quality
VR experience aside from I guess Google
cardboard is pretty expensive for the
limited functionality nevertheless early
adopters of virtual reality stuff are
more than willing to drop a few hundred
bucks to give this emerging tech a shot
so on other things you should know about
force touch force touch and 3d touch
became sort of out of the blue a really
big deal for Apple and their whole
ecosystem this year so 3d touch is
software reacting to different levels of
pressure from your fingers so the new
iPhone 6s and 6s plus have three touch
displays and apps are being built to
take advantage of it force touch is just
two levels of pressure it's a hard force
press or a lighter one but it's the same
idea
more pressure equals a different
function so we saw that and stuff like
the Apple watch the new MacBook trackpad
the MacBook Pros that came out and the
new Magic Trackpad - these are all small
services but I would expect to see
pressure sensitivity in larger surfaces
like an iPad next year and I wouldn't be
surprised to see 3d touch used to make a
big design change in the iPhone 7 in
2016 just saying so yeah keep an eye on
pressure sensitivity I think that's
honestly Apple's big innovation of this
year USB type-c if you don't know now
you know it's new it's awesome it's here
to stay it's the newest generation USB
port so reversible carries more power
carries faster data and already this
year we see in a couple smartphones
tablets and laptops and their
accessories we already saw it this year
and a couple smartphones Nexus 6p Nexus
5x one plus two we start to see it in
tablets the Google pixel see we saw some
from Asus and from Dell and then most
notably the new MacBook now when you
look at the new MacBook with just one
port that's so low lonely USB C port and
then an $80 adapter needed to do
anything other than charge it it does
seem kind of weird and behind but I can
pretty much guarantee that the next
generation MacBook will have more than
one of these ports hopefully a few and
expect a bunch more smartphones
have this port in 2016 the later
adopters might be guys like Apple with
their lightning for a while and Samsung
sticking with microUSB but down the road
USB see it'll happen it'll happen now I
gotta give props to Windows 10 which was
a pretty great improvement from
Microsoft this year specifically the
hardware lineup they have out for and
now it's never really had like a Nexus
name but you could say the surface
lineup down now is the Nexus of Windows
10 hardware so you have your surface
book the laptop plenty of pros and cons
to that guy but its high-end in its own
right
then the surface pro 4 as your tablet
and then of course you have a lumia
950xl as your highest end Windows 10
smartphone and continuum which has a
nice way of them all talking to each
other also thanks to your comments my
950 XL is in the mail for here so
that'll be one of the first smartphones
I check out for 2016 should be fun cars
man just seems like the 100 year old car
industry is always a little bit behind
when it comes to the tech stuff but 2015
was solid and 2016 is promising I'm a
big fan personally of two things in cars
one electric cars and two self-driving
or autonomous cars which is probably why
I'm such a big fan of the Tesla Model S
so here's a fun fact about the Tesla
Model S alright so it's a really
high-end electric car and it's a really
high-tech car so it's got its own
internet connection
it can download software updates on the
fly to improve its feature set and the
way it drives and each individual Model
S with the adaptive cruise control and
self steering which combined to be
called autopilot mode it kind of learns
the roads you drive so let's say you're
in a Model S and you take a new curve
with autopilot
on and it's a really tight curve so it
has to slow down a little bit it takes a
little too fast it'll beep at you a
little bit tell you to take the steering
wheel it didn't really quite get it
right that time
that's something it'll learn for the
next time you come around that on the
map and you do it again the second time
it'll slow down a little earlier it'll
take the crevel a little slower probably
won't be P you probably won't take it
too fast and we'll start to understand
the curve a little better so the third
time the fourth time the fifth time that
you take that curve maybe it's in your
daily commute the car is learning it and
eventually we'll do it just perfectly
it'll slow down hug it perfectly and
exit the curve like a normal driver and
that's awesome but Tesla Model S kind of
treats itself like part of a fleet of
every single Tesla Model S so it sends
that data up to the network
and then on your next software update
when you download that software update
everyone else's Tesla Model S will get
those improvements to that part of the
road so if I Drive by there a week later
and I've never seen that part of the
road before on autopilot my car already
knows to slow down a little early and
take that curve nice and tight because
the person before me did it and their
car learned it that's pretty dope all
right so one more thing tech on YouTube
did really well again this year plenty
of new channels plenty of new
communities new people to talk to about
tech and I always kind of have numbers
to support this so of the 86 videos that
I uploaded to YouTube all about tech in
the last year over a thousand years of
human life were spent watching them even
more than the 2014 numbers which were
already pretty ridiculous so it's kind
of cool to see tech on YouTube still
growing and tech video flourishing on
the Internet so in summary 2015 was
pretty dope 2016 has a tough act to
follow but I think we're up for it
thanks for watching I'll talk to you
guys next year peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
