what I'm about to show you is a render
of the Motorola X phone based on
actually confirmed specs and information
there you go oh the Motorola X phone it
seems like it's been rumored since the
day Google bought and started to control
and operate Motorola Mobility but that's
really all we've heard so far isn't it
for that it'll launch this summer with
the latest version of Android key lime
pie for that it'll have just the right
screen size with very little or no bezel
for that I might even have customizable
hardware or let you be able to pick your
parts like you can with certain other
gadgets for that it'll have a
touch-sensitive back for the possibility
of some crazy new gestures that'll be
built into the newest version of Android
we've even heard that the X phone could
have a wooden case option we have heard
so many rumors about this Motorola X
phone I want to tell you a little bit of
story a little bit of story here on
March 1st of this year Guy Kawasaki was
hired into Google to advise Motorola
Mobility after that acquisition and that
was a pretty big deal at the time a
couple of days later Guy Kawasaki posts
on Google+ a video on YouTube of a
Porsche sort of build your own car
program that they're having where you
can basically pick all the different
parts that you want to go into your
Porsche instead of picking between some
predetermined options and a caption he
put was wouldn't it be neat if you could
personalize your smartphone like this
huh huh comments-section went nuts is
this a hint what do you know what does
this mean about the X phone stop playing
with my emotions
they absolutely went insane basically
assuming that he's talking about the X
phone as if this means anything
pertaining to what he does add more
roles so Guy Kawasaki answers I'm just
asking a hypothetical question oh okay
what else do you know about the X phone
thanks for the hint are we going to be
able to pick our own parts for the
Motorola X phone huh there's got to be a
hypothetical answer to the hypothetical
question right it's hard to imagine
customization on this level will be
possible or even viable in a cell phone
what stop stop I'm just a Porsche fan
who works for Motorola
q the news outlets by Kawasaki hints
that possible hardware customization for
the X phone Motorola X phone will have
customizable hardware hence Guy Kawasaki
more to roll a handset will be
customizable Guy Kawasaki hints what ok
here's the thing about the Motorola X
phone it didn't say anything about X
phone in that post or in any of the
actual confirmed information the thing
about the X phone is stop it it doesn't
exist the Motorola X phone is a figment
of our imaginations and our desires and
a manifestation of what we want to see
in a smartphone I mean there's no reason
any of this stuff that's been rumored
could never happen I mean some of it
could maybe actually happen but who
cares I get questions every single day
about I have the galaxy s3 and I'm
waiting to upgrade should I get the
galaxy s4 or the HTC one or should I
wait for the Motorola X phone that's not
a thing so since there is no such thing
as a Motorola X phone and since it is
just a figment of our imaginations of
what we want to see in a phone that's a
collaboration between Google and
Motorola I challenge you this for the
next month
or at least for the next two weeks
ignore any Motorola X phone headlines
and rumor posts you may see just ignored
you're gonna see a headline about what
could be a maybe possible awesome
breakthrough feature in the Motorola X
phone or some other new leaked not
really about what could also happen to
the Motorola X phone and we've even seen
those as recently as yesterday just
ignore them
why would you ignore them you say
because the Motorola X phone can't be
everything when a collaboration finally
does happen to attain Motorola and
Google it won't have all of the things
we've seen in all the rumors and leaks
and that's because well that's just
unrealistic and the point of that is
some people are inevitably gonna be
disappointed by the fact that there's
not that favorite feature that they are
waiting for I don't know if you guys
remember Project Roadrunner in this
supposedly Qui had project butter in
Android 4.1 we were expecting to see
project roadrunner to improve battery
life in 4.2 it was a leak it was
completely made up someone actually
published that as a thing that was going
to probably happen it never happened and
people got mad at Google for not doing
it Eric ravenscraft of Android police
really did put it best he said I love
talking about Android and the future of
Android
imagining what's coming next and I even
love predicting things and being wrong
it's fun it's a learning experience tech
inspires us to do this very thing when
it turns dark however is when we
suddenly start acting like Google owes
us something yes
that is exactly what I did pissed about
sometimes so let's just relax and let
the evolution of smartphones take place
before our very eyes and enjoy the
flagships that already do exist there
are some awesome phones out there that
we should be picking between now instead
of worrying about this Motorola X but
unless you actually do work for Motorola
in which case you should be working your
tail off to make sure that next flagship
phone is an awesome phone either way
that's basically it that's my little
rant talk about the X phone ignore the
rumours thanks for watching this is just
been a quick little rant video and if
you enjoyed it definitely feel free to

subscribe button further below which is

the videos that I upload either way
