this is a video dedicated entirely to
the performance of the new Mac Pro so
this is a bit of a preview leading up to
the full review that I'm working on of
the Mac Pro but I mentioned a little bit
in my unboxing and first impressions
video that I got the 8 core Mac Pro for
a reason over the 12th core I actually
opted for the 8 core model for a couple
of reasons that we'll go into but
essentially this is all the benchmarks
and sort of performance tests that I
thought would make sense for apples only
workstation grading machine so there are
a couple of key benchmarking apps that a
lot of people use to benchmark Macs and
all sorts of desktop machines that you
guys shared with me on Twitter and
things that I've used in past projects
including the fastest Mac Mini in the
world project and the hackintosh Pro
project so the first of these is called
black magic disk speed test essentially
this just measures the read and write
speeds that are going to be capable of
on the Mac Pros PCI base SSDs so if
you'll recall the fastest Mac Mini in
the world project had a single vertex
for SSD and the hackintosh per project
had a pair of SSDs in raid zero but as
you can see by the numbers neither of
these compared to the results of the PCI
base SSDs in the new Mac Pro and that's
going to get you some crazy fast program
opening times and data access all right
so the next test is a very popular
Geekbench app you've probably seen it
already run on phones and tablets
everything from the iPhone all the way
up to the previous generation Mac Pro so
as a benchmark the fastest Mac Mini in
the world project scored around 10,000
on Geekbench that actually wasn't shown
in the video series interesting ly
enough and the hackintosh Pro actually
scored fifteen thousand eight hundred
and actually I want to be clear here
these are the multi-threaded scores as
Geekbench 3 here will always kick out a
pair of scores a single-threaded score
and a multi-threaded score so Geekbench
on this Mac Pro kicked out without
screen recording on 3600 for the single
feted score and 26 thousand for the
multi-threaded score and I'll give more
context on these in a second so the next
test is called nova bench it's a less
popular benchmarking app a lot of people
don't use it but since i've used it in
my two previous projects then i figured
i'd continue to use it now for a
benchmark so it scored roughly 800 ish
on the fastest Mac Mini in the world
and roughly 1600 on the hackintosh Pro
now even though it looks fairly
comprehensive it's definitely an older
benchmark and I don't even know if all
the numbers looked right when looking at
the composition for the final score but
either way the final score here in Nova
Bench was a much higher 2200 on the Mac
Pro now last but not least in the
benchmarking department is called
Cinebench and actually think that
Cinebench is one of the most accurate
overall all-encompassing benchmark apps
you can use it tests both the GPU side
and the CPU side of things and there was
a really wide range of scores you can
get so on the GPU side this Mac Pro has
the absolute highest end dual AMD
FirePro d700 workstation grade graphics
cards with 6 gigs of video RAM each and
these absolutely killed it topping out
the benchmark at an average of 86 frames
per second this isn't necessarily a
representation of gaming performance
because they're not gaming cards but
more of just how much power you have at
your disposal with these cards in here
that a number of production suites and
applications can take advantage of and
on the CPU side this is the 8 core beast
like I mentioned and it ended up with a
score of 1223 which is surprisingly not
that far behind the 12 core Mac Pro at
all and that's actually what impressed
me the most but honestly with 8 cores 16
threads you kind of expect it to crush
benchmarks and it absolutely did so it's
really easy to tell by all these
benchmark results that the Mac Pro is
clearly a very fast very powerful
machine but that brings us back to the
question why did I go with the 8 core
Mac Pro over a 12 core Mac Pro and the
simple answer to that is single core
single-threaded performance there is a
four core six core eight core and twelve
core version of the Mac Pro and each
time you move up in
number of cores you move down in clock
speed from 3.7 gigahertz to 3.5 to 3.0
to 2.7 but the thing is higher clock
speeds mean better single core
performance for everyday apps but more
cores in general means better multi-core
performance for the bigger apps that can
take advantage of it so the four core
Mac Pro would be like driving a van down
the parkway you know pretty fast but
also still pretty strong where the 12
core Mac Pro on the other hand would be
an 18-wheeler cab definitely not the
quickest thing in the world but there is
no way anything is going to slow it down
even the heaviest of tasks so the 8 core
Mac Pro would fall somewhere in the
middle so at the end of the day as a
person that's using the Mac Pro as both
a beast of a video editing rig and a day
to day machine it makes sense to have a
nice balance between amazing
multi-threaded performance and nice
single core and everyday use performance
which means when I'm running around
videos in Adobe Premiere or projects in
Photoshop and things like that all eight
cores are going to be kicking in and
it's going to take full advantage of
that but at the same time at 3 gigahertz
on a single core apps like Google Chrome
and just browsing around the internet
watching YouTube videos day to day
things like that will also be quick and
they won't be quite as slow as they
would have been on the massive 12 course
so there's the reasoning and there's the
performance of the 2013 Mac Pro but
there's a lot more information about
that coming up especially in the full
review video which is in the works and
on its way thank you for watching and
I'll talk to you guys in the next video
