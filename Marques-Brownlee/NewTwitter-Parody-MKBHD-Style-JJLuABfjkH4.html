new twitter or the video that twitter
has put up for it anyway since i don't
actually have it available to me yet so
far to me it looks like someone is being
absolutely surrounded by all things
twitter they might even have a problem
and choosing what to wear that day they
end up going with yes nothing other than
a Twitter shirt then they brush the
excess Twitter logos off of the calendar
to reveal a big night on the 14 and then
it appears that they have visited a
grocery store afterwards and they are
still being followed by a creepy Twitter
logo still on the bus more Twitter they
even find a record in the record store
with another Twitter logo on
pretty much seems like anything and
everything this person has to do today
has something to do with Twitter
now the music gets happier and we
actually find out why this person was
actually in a record store in the first
place to play this record none other
than more Twitter logos on the ground
but we'll avoid them in an effort to
find something that doesn't have to do
with Twitter in this person's get a shot
of the night sky nope I was wrong he
posted this to twitter to oh but look
this is part of the new twitter layout
which takes excessively large amounts of
screen real estate is a JavaScript or
and actually looks a little bit better
than a last version of twitter by the
limited amounts of footage and
experience i have with the new twitter
it looks pretty decent it has a two-page
layout with the standards timeline on
the left hand side and opening lengths
and twitpics and hashtags on the right
hand side hey look it's that Twitter
video we just saw well to make a long
story somewhat less long no I don't have
the new Twitter as of yet but if you
follow at Twitter you'll see when the
hashtag new Twitter actually starts
rolling out and maybe you actually have
the new Twitter and you'll be able to
show me more of that in the screencast
of your own until then this is all I've
got mkbhd signing out peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
