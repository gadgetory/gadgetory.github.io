certain video has been floating around
the internet recently
it's called phonebloks has more than 8
million views more than 150 thousand
thumbs up and more than 20 thousand plus
ones so let's go ahead and break this
down this is phonebloks explained so
phonebloks is the idea of a totally
modular smartphone it stems from the
notion that when people get done with a
smartphone and it's time to replace it
it's usually because of a single reason
maybe it's getting too slow or they
don't like the camera anymore or maybe
the screen broke and they throw out the
entire phone even though the rest of the
phone is probably still perfectly fine
and that creates a lot of unnecessary
waste so the phonebloks concept is a
sort of a central motherboard or base
that all the rest of the parts will plug
into and a sort of a block shape and
they all fit together kind of like Legos
this way if someone decides they don't
like part of the smartphone or if they
want to change a certain thing they
don't have to throw out the whole phone
just like Legos they can actually just
remove and reattach and rearrange the
parts of the smartphone to create
exactly what they want
makes perfect sense what's different
about this video is it's half tech
concept half social media campaign
essentially what they're doing is asking
everyone to build up the hype on social
media about foam blocks until a certain
day when everyone will talk about this
concept kind of reminds me of the Kony
2012 campaign from a while back but
either way it doesn't matter what it
reminds you of at the end of the day
it's working and it's getting a lot of
people's attention and this is the first
time I've seen this dream foam concept
actually catch the eye of a lot of
regular people like this as part of the
campaign they're asking for you to sign
up for a service called thunderclap
where once you sign in on a social
network everyone who signs up will have
their account automatically send out the
exact same tweet or Facebook post or
Google+ post at the exact same time on
the same day so far more than three
hundred thousand people have signed it
so that's going to be quite a trending
topic on that day so there are a couple
of logistic things to consider about
phonebloks
number one who's going to make the block
and the concept video they showed that
they wanted to get the attention of and
work with very big companies big
manufacturers already and get them to
make phone blocks so that people can put
parts from trusted manufacturers in
their custom phones so speaker choices
from Bose Harman Kardon Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen
be
by dre whatever camera choices from Sony
Samsung maybe Canon processor choices
from Intel Qualcomm Ti etc and that
would make sense but there isn't really
any incentive right now for these
companies to buy into it they're all
invested right now in making their own
products because that's where the
margins are speaking of margins number
two this is a very expensive concept
building a phone the equivalent of the
Samsung Galaxy s4 on paper for example
out of phone blocks would end up costing
probably twice as much and it would be a
much much larger device this is because
smartphone makers right now have
something called a supply chain where
they're just cranking hundreds of
thousands even millions of identical
smartphones off the assembly line the
devices they're making have a very
specific extremely compact design you've
ever taken apart a phone or even just
look inside the back of one you'll see
these parts are tied together really
tight woven in between each other and
crammed in there's to keep the phone
thin and light and efficient and also
pretty with this final smart phone
design the more smart phones they crank
out the more streamlined the process
gets and the lower the costs get the
more money they save but building
individual smart phone parts like the
gyroscope and all the sensors and the
camera parts and the battery without
weaving them together that's going to be
a very big and very expensive smartphone
so here's the thing about phone blocks
while the idea itself is really cool and
very positive and the motives are all
great the logistics behind it are damn
near impossible to pull off right now
but that's not the point that's not what
this is about like we said earlier phone
blocks is really just the idea of a
completely modular smartphone there's no
Kickstarter no IndieGoGo no actual
funding and there is no actual product
there's no physical prototype there's no
pre-order this is just an idea and
phonebloks is a campaign to spread this
idea through as many people as possible
to inspire the idea of a modular
smartphone being the smartphone of the
future essentially it's not a brand new
or revolutionary idea it's just the
first time this idea has been packaged
into a two-minute YouTube video with
sweet animations and 3d graphics that
everyone can understand and I hope this
does really well I'm excited I love the
idea of a totally modular smartphone and
spreading this idea to as many people as
possible
gives it hope and it's being pretty
successful right now I do
doing exactly that so that is phonebloks
explained if you want to check out more
information about any of this stuff I've
talked about I'll have all the relevant
links right below that like button so
you can check them all out and I'll also
include my latest video about what I'd
say is the perfect smartphone I'll also
throw in a much older video I did with
my own video idea about a modular
smartphone so if you check that older
video out you'll probably see that the
ideas here are strikingly similar and
also have the YouTube channel linked
below to the guy that did this sake and
check out all the other stuff he's done
and all the other projects that weren't
quite as successful as phonebloks has
been so far either way thank you for
watching this video if you want to see
more like this definitely subscribe
because there are a lot more coming
thanks for watching and I'll talk to you
guys the next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
