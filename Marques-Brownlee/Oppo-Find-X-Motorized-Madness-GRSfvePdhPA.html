most requested video of all of 2018 so
far shoutout to linus from - tech tips
because this is his phone actually so
thanks for passing it along man this is
the Oppo find X so this is actually the
hottest phone on the planet right now
purely thanks to its really unique
design Oppo actually has a history of
doing kind of insane things with
flagship phones but they don't do them
very often they specialize in the
mid-range but you might remember way
back in the day a couple years ago I
made a video about the Oppo find 5 the
first ever 1080p smartphone that was a
huge deal and also the fine 7 so they do
have a little history with actually
doing impressive flagship stuff so now
here in 2018 in this world with lots of
notches and compromise in walks the Oppo
find X the specs even though they're
excellent are actually probably the most
boring part of this phone so Snapdragon
8045 Adreno 638 gigs of ram 256 gigs of
storage a 3730 milliamp hour battery
bluetooth 5.0 dual SIM cards it's a
flagship no doubt well we're here for is
the design because that's the reason
this phone is so hot right now is the
industrial design on the surface it
looks very modern obviously not a whole
lot of bezel anywhere that's the main
focus in 2018 full screen rounded
corners all the way across the front of
the phone but if you look around even
more there's actually elegant touches
everywhere the shape is just a little
unorthodox kind of tapered on the sides
but gives way to this intense color
design there's a blue and a purple
version actually this is the purple
which is called Bordeaux red for some
reason and it has this shimmer just on
the outsides of the phone while the
middle stays dark mirror finish it seems
like the 28th thing to do also to have a
glass back but no wireless charging
that's also the case for this phone but
some awesome design twos Jackie from
that so the huge screen up front
obviously looks super cool but even
around that screen they've done some
things that are really impressive and
unique there's a little earpiece up here
in the top they actually got a real
speaker up there instead of using an
under glass solution the whole phone is
a little on the
site at nine millimeters but I'm totally
fine with this and for me it's more
about the solid weight like this phone
really feels dense in the hand with all
that glass
there's no headphone jack at the bottom
or at all sadly but it has this unique
sort of concave shape with the USBC port
speaker and a dual SIM card tray and
there's just a lot of little unique
touches like that the top of the phone
also has the shape of like a liquid
glass melting into itself and there is
no rear facing or front facing camera at
all until you yeah until you open the
top the entire top of this phone is
motorized for both the rear facing and
front facing camera sensors okay so to
achieve this 90 3.8% screen to body
ratio in 2018 you got to make some
sacrifices so with this phone there is
no fingerprint reader anywhere they
didn't do the under glass one there's no
fingerprint anywhere on this phone and
then of course to do the front-facing
camera they did I think one of the
coolest things I've ever seen in a
smartphone which is raise the whole
thing via a motor and it's different
from the next the next feels like a hack
to just get a front-facing camera in the
phone somehow this feels like an
integrated part of a thoughtful design
but now though you got to think about
again motorized moving pieces in
smartphones like this are still a tough
ask they eventually will fail and they
also make it harder for things like
ceiling and make it easier to break and
this is the whole top of the phone
popping up so I'm pretty sure you can
forget about waterproofing right off the
bat and then when you have this much
surface moving you think about maybe if
one grain of sand gets in there that
could be a problem too it's easier than
you think
obviously Oppo trusts this a lot though
because as you can see they have the
rear camera which you use all the time
and the front camera and a suite of
other sensors including a dot projector
and infrared sensor all appear because
this also does facial recognition that's
right so with no fingerprint reader
anywhere on this phone like the iPhone
they built what you might call a face ID
clone in those front-facing sensors in
the motorized piece here's the thing
though it's actually pretty fast if you
check that speed it's
possibly even faster than face ID you
register your face in like three seconds
flat and then it's just look at the
phone to unlock it's actually pretty
cool it just pops up looks like your
face real quick and then goes back down
all in about half a second
I'm impressed not gonna lie I don't know
if it's as secure as face ID I honestly
kind of doubt it but if it's not getting
fooled easily or tricked by photos then
it's impressive to me out the box this
thing is crazy man and you also have to
consider when you have the back facing
camera which you use all the time and
the front-facing camera and the face
unlock in that motorized piece that
means you're gonna you're gonna use this
every time you open your phone and
hundreds more times during the day so
that's something to think about I don't
know how long this motor is rated to
last but I'd be interested to see how
long it does also I tried a couple other
things just out of curiosity with this
motor if you push down hard enough the
camera just closes the motors just
decide it should be closing and it
retracts completely probably pretty
smart actually and then if you put
enough resistance on the top while
opening the camera and it's trying to
launch by itself it'll pause wait a
second and then it'll try again and then
just keep holding it and it'll just keep
trying over and over it's not really
gonna grind its gears trying to go
against resistance so it has a couple
fail-safes built in but I also found
that I can literally pull the top of the
phone open so you can imagine it's not
the most durable mechanism in the world
if a grain of sand gets in there like I
said that's probably bad news for more
the internal parts and that just kind of
happens sometimes more than I wish it
did so at the end of the day I love this
actually I love what we're getting in
this genuinely interesting creative
design in a smart phone just when we
thought it might have been getting kind
of boring with everyone doing a knotch
and dual cameras and the whole
predictable dance this thing comes in
from left-field a new player has arrived
but I'm curious what you think if this
one came to your region it's gonna be
very expensive but could you rock this
as a daily driver I feel like I could
throw a Nova Launcher on here give the
camera shot and it might actually stay
in my pocket but let me know what you're
thinking in the comments below either
way thanks for watching talk to the next
one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
