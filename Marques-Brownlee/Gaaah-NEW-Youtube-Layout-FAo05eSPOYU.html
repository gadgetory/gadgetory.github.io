just change the layout I have no idea
what was going on my browser stopped
working on you two only and I thought my
internet connection was out or something
something weird was going on I couldn't
get on to YouTube to comment on my
latest video then I realized that was
the only site that wasn't working
Wikipedia worked fine here times worked
fine it was just that one web site
youtube.com that wasn't working then 15
seconds later it's back up again and I
go to youtube.com and I look at a video
and it's all screwed up I'm like what
happened to the YouTube layout why is it
different something is different about
it yes
YouTube did some changes there I thought
my browser screwed up honestly I was
used it in Safari I use it in Firefox
there's an opera I use an Internet
Explorer I use it in chameleon I use it
in like 6 web browsers and it was the
same in every single one YouTube changes
the layout again let me give you a peek
so yeah first of all here's what I did I
wanted to open up Safari and it wasn't
working for a while and then what do you
know you open up Safari this is just my
YouTube page right here thank you to all
my subscribers then you know what you go
to a video to watch it and I'll just
pause it here but you look under it look
at that
what do they do it's it's different you
see the ratings that it's just it's
boring I thought I I personally thought
my browser screwed up but you know what
YouTube changes the layout again how
could they do this to me how could they
change it without telling me I'm not
basically kidding but seriously comment
below do you like the new leap YouTube
layout doesn't look good bad kind of ok
no big deal I just thought it was weird
that they changed it and during those
few seconds where YouTube did not work
it's probably that the whole world was
just like why isn't YouTube working so I
commented on a video and those people
were like yeah it is different so I was
like well it's not just me say it
comment below what do you think of a new
YouTube layout good/bad medium download
