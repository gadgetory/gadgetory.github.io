to boot your computer just a little bit
faster than you normally would
first thing you're going to do you're
gonna want to go to your Start menu and
type run if you're in Windows XP and
select run and then type ms config and
run the Microsoft configuration system
configuration utility this utility under
the general tab I've chosen a selective
startup I chose the first two and you
can just choose a diagnostic I don't
start up at any time if you wanted to
diagnose a problem something but I
suggest a selective or a normal startup
then under the boot tab we're loading
Windows Vista and that's the only
partition I have a lot of people will
have a timeout of up to 30 seconds this
timeline is not necessary that as low as
you want just don't make it zero and
apply says between 3 and 999 so make
that 3 don't make it anything less or
anything higher than 999 you can choose
a safe boot and a new GUI below will
load absolutely blazingly fast but I
actually like the GUI boot so I'm going
to leave it but that's the graphical
boot word hole loading your desktop
settings thing and everything with the
green bar rolling across the screen so
that's the GUI food you can choose to
disable that and that will just glue
your computer extremely fast next click
the services tab and disable anything
you do not need so I don't need that
certain things that you don't want to
boot with your computer and there are
tons of websites that will teach you
which services not to basically not to
uncheck and but there are a few that I
can uncheck just here looking at how
many I have starting I do have quite a
bit starting I don't need let's say I
don't have a tablet PC I just saw where
was it
I just saw a tablet PC input service I
can disable that because I don't have a
PC certain certain things like that will
help you will help you to increase the
speed of your computer starting up when
you're done hit apply and you might be
prompted to reboot after this prompted
yet also at startup the same with many
things as you do not need so go ahead
and expand this so you can see exactly
what it is I've disabled quite a few
already you down here and these things
you can always rename at any time if you
feel the need and then hit apply tools I
just leave it the way it is and hit OK
this will hopefully increase the speed
of your computer starting up or decrease
the time it takes very computer to start
up and maybe it'll maybe it'll do your
needs maybe it won't but hopefully this
will help you guys so uh otherwise
