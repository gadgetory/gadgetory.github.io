I am shooting my first video vlog style
with a front-facing camera thumbs up for
that if you've never seen that before
but anyway I'm taking the time to record
this video to let you guys know a few
things as you can probably see by the
title up there it's been a pretty crazy
week for me and I'm gonna give you a
little bit of information about that as
well as some info on the future which is
behind me so as you guys may man I've
already heard of hurricane sandy which
swept the whole east coast of the United
States which is right outside my window
here it killed the power so there hasn't
been electricity or heat in this
building in I think it's day 11 now so
11 days so this whole deal here is not
operational
without electricity of course so you can
see the empty shell that is the Mac Pro
down there I'm bad with this
front-facing camera stuff but yeah so I
haven't been able to make any videos but
I have a lot of videos lined up both in
my head and on this index card over here
I've been writing down video ideas I
can't reveal those though that would be
a bad idea
uh so yeah I have a whole lot of videos
stacked up but so over the past couple
of days it's been weird the first day of
the hurricane hit Monday night lost
power but that wasn't too bad I was able
to sleep through that but then we
haven't had anything since then the
streets flooded now the waters gone but
now people are getting their basements
redone electricity is being turned back
on hopefully I will have power in this
building soon that being said I had a
lot of videos and stuff planned for the
second these lights turned back on and
two of them are really really cool so
I'm gonna go ahead and give you a hint
over here some stuff that has not yet
been covered yet but you guys already
know there's a lot of great stuff going
on if you want updates on this stuff
because a lot of you guys already knew
this twitter.com slash mkbhd that's
where it's at and if you're feeling
daring Google Plus which is also down
below the like button on this video and
you can check out some interesting stuff
I've been sharing there too also to note
the iPhone 5 and galaxy note 2 giveaway
that winner will be selected very soon
also updates will be on Twitter for that
so you're gonna make sure you stay tuned
on Twitter that's going to take very
soon so stay tuned that's very important
and last but not least I have been
charging my
shout-out to my neighbor / teammates who
have been helping me out because they
have power across the streets I'm going
over there
a lot and charging my stuff and
hopefully I'll be able to use his
internet to upload this video either way
I want to thank you guys for watching
thank you guys for being supportive I've
done a lot of comments you know asking
if I'm okay yes I'm okay yes I am doing
fine without electricity rocking in the
corner slowly no I'm just kidding
I'm being fine but um that's basically
it I just want to let you guys know I
have a lot of fun videos planned so
thumbs up if you're ready for that
awesome swarm of content as soon as
these lights turn back on and catch you
guys later peace stop button stop</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
