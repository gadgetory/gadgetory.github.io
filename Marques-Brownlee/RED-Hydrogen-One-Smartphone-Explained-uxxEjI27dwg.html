and right about at the end of last week
we got a completely random announcement
out of the blue for the red hydrogen one
a $1,200
holographic Android phone so when it
happened I gave my initial thoughts on
Twitter I kind of talked through it a
little bit and then I've been quiet
since then but people have been asking
me about it about what I really think
about it non-stop for the past couple
days so this is all of that so what
happened was red yes this red the red
who makes the cameras that I shoot these
videos on first they made this hype
announcement on the red user forums they
do this every once in a while but they
were like alright new product coming new
product category get your credit cards
ready it's going to be lit so of course
on a couple days up to that people got
really excited and speculating about
what it might be is it a mirrorless
camera are they making a stills camera
are they getting into audio what could
red be doing next and then of course the
day and the time dropped and red
hydrogen one was unveiled so it's the
world's first holographic media machine
in your pocket it's a standalone
full-featured unlocked multi band
smartphone operating on Android OS that
just happens to add a few additional
features that shatter is a mold of
conventional thinking and then this
picture this was the only photo released
of the phone and then there is an order
page 1,200 bucks for the aluminum one
1600 bucks for titanium well hmm so
that's that's kind of weird so red the
company that's making these cameras and
these super high-end sensors is stepping
into the world of smartphones where
these huge players already Samsung's and
apples and these massive supply chains
how does a read gonna stepped in this is
kind of like my two worlds colliding
right now I guess if there's any target
user target demographic for someone
who's going to buy a smartphone from red
it's probably me so yeah I bought both
but to be honest there's not a whole lot
actually known about the smartphone like
I said there's only this one image of it
and it's kind of dark and you basically
just have the order page and this one
PDF of a lot of jargon to decode
multi-dimensional 2d 3d VR a RMR what is
what does this even mean well that's
what I'm here to try to decode for you
and also for myself
because I
ordered them so basically this is how I
see it going let me first of all let me
brighten that photo up a little bit for
you it's a it's an interesting looking
phone and up front they said it's going
to have a 5.7 inch professional hydrogen
holographic display so this is the
biggest question mark of the mall
because we don't really know what that
is exactly but I kind of got the visual
of like a really advanced 3d experience
and it will be glasses free as well and
assuming it's nothing that we've never
seen before which I guess I can't really
assume with red but remember the Amazon
fire phone back in 2014
yeah kind of something along those lines
but obviously four years later and four
years better physically right it's
claiming you'll be able to really look
around and experience real depth with
this display and of course then we'll
have some games and apps to support it
as well not really sure if they're using
the word holographic correctly in this
case but we'll see and you'll also be
able to create and capture and share
these h4v files which are again are
going to be brand new but that should be
optimized for this experience but really
trying to push beyond normal 3d and then
just looking at the phone itself that
brightened image we have USB see on the
bottom a headphone jack nice and then
the camera up top and a pretty
interesting looking back almost looks
like a heatsink like this phone is
definitely going to be thick and then
some grippy sides maybe also with a
little micro SD card slot door because
the phone does have that card slot and
are also advertising this next level
multi-dimensional audio to go along with
the multi-dimensional video and of
course we can't see a native speakers on
the back of the phone which leads me to
believe that they'll be up at the front
kind of like boom sound which I'm hoping
it lives up to and if you read the way
they describe this audio on Red's page
it seems like it should live up to that
then at the bottom of the back of the
phone you have these pins and they look
a lot like what you see on the back of
the Moto Z&amp;amp;Z - this alludes to the
modularity aspect so red cameras as you
already know are already super modular
via pins for the most part so you have
all these attachable modules you can
build a camera up from the base to be
exactly how much or how little you want
it based on your shooting scenario it's
honestly an awesome system and I'm a big
fan of it but it's also a pretty
expensive one because red makes all of
those accessories and they get to
control exactly how much it costs
because who else is going to make red
accessories so this hydrogen one phone
is planning on using those pins
the back of the phone to become its own
expanding modular system with some
accessories that I assume we haven't
seen it all yet because it have to be
the size of a smartphone according to
all the patents if you read through the
Titan application all link it below the
like button if you want to check it out
and read it it looks like they want you
to be able to build this up to be a
full-on cine camera so you can see the
diagram kind of how it looks attached to
things looks like a full-blown lens
mount on the back of this one a sensor
mount and the patent also shows roughly
what the front of the phone could look
like so home button in the middle front
facing speakers that leaks down at the
bottom so that's good but then from the
side the additional modules with HDMI
and more ports and more pins looks
really interesting you can see in this
one the phone is all the way up at the
front and then the modules attached via
these pins on the back and they just
kind of make it thicker while adding
functionality and connectivity possibly
a much bigger and better sensor for
video and photos so we haven't actually
seen any of these accessories in photos
yet but we do know number one they'll be
made specifically for this camera by red
and number two they'll also probably be
very extensive so bottom line it looks
like this isn't going to be the
smartphone for the average consumer
obviously you know that from the 1200 or
$1600 price but also the fact that most
people aren't building up a smartphone
to be nearly as thick as like a small
mirrorless camera that don't have goals
that are very different from a normal
person plus toss in the completely
insane sounding hydrogen a holographic
display I mean it sounds like a lot but
all that makes is a very unusual aspect
so how do I feel about it
honestly I'm optimistic I I think red
knows what they're doing obviously they
are incredible with image sensors and
that tech and smartphones is something
that I'm just kind of generally
interested in but honestly there's so
much good red stuff out there that I'm
also a little bit terrified there's not
that many companies that I would
consider myself a serious fan of like
I'm assuming you may argue that but I
think Tesla is probably one of those and
red I like pretty much everything red
has ever made that I've ever used so if
this phone isn't amazing in some way
like every other red product I've used
I'll be super disappointed but it's
obviously as we've seen in the past
really hard to be new in a smartphone
game right now and
make any sort of dent or impact even a
company like red which is a huge
multi-million dollar company has zero
skin in the game right now and that's a
big deal but I'm hoping this is the
first of many successful projects that
they dive into in this smaller modular
game so good luck red I hope it's not
just a Kickstarter and a money grab I
hope it's a good developing product and
project that we'll see in the future but
that's just me let me know what you guys
think would you be interested in getting
this $1200 and red holographic
smartphone let me know what you think
thanks for watching I'll talk to guys
the next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
