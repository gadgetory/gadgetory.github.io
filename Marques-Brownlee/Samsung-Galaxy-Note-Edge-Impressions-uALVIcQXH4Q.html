with a quick video that I wasn't
expecting to make on something that came
out today from samsung's announcements
this phone you're looking at here kind
of looks a lot like a Galaxy Note 4 I
just did an impressions video on one you
might not be able to tell the difference
it except that it's totally weird this
is the thing now this is the Samsung
Galaxy Note edge and yes this is
absolutely another one of Samsung's
crazy
let's try everything phones that's
actually coming to life and to be fair
when the Galaxy Note first came out it
was another crazy experiment but now
they're everywhere so maybe this is one
of those things that looks crazy now but
you know might look totally normal in
the future who knows so this is the Note
edge is clearly nearly identical to the
Galaxy Note 4 it's brother it has all
the same internal specs all the same
software same camera same everything but
it has some extra display hanging off
the edge and that's what they call it
the edge display or the edge screen so
here's how it works
up front on the front is a 5.6 inch quad
HD Super AMOLED display it's fantastic
so again super high pixel density here
and then curved over on the right hand
side is an additional 160 pixel wide
strip of display and that's it that's
what this one is all about I figured I'd
show to you guys because you're probably
going to start hearing about it on the
news as Samsung's crazy new curved
display but it's really not all that
crazy it already has the super high-end
specs that we know are going to perform
well from the note 4 so it's really all
about whether or not this awkward shape
can actually help using the phone
instead of hurting it so Samsung's built
in a bunch of different features into
the software to work just on that strip
that you can swipe between there's
sports scores custom messages Twitter
trending topics even an alarm clock mode
that will just show the time super dim
but what's really cool or at least what
can make this really cool is that
Samsung is giving out an SDK for
developers to be able to make apps that
actually use this strip it's called the
edge screen there's already a bunch of
settings and a bunch of things to pick
from but the other thing people aren't
talking about is when you really want to
take advantage of that entire front
display that strip needs to get out the
way and when I spend time with it it
looks like it does a pretty decent job
of doing so so like when I'm watching
you
to video and I go fullscreen the bar
disappears so it's fine it leaves this
faint text that says my Galaxy Note edge
but I think it should really be just
pitch black and I want I want to bring
it back I can swipe in at any time move
around between them and when I want to
go fullscreen again I can just tap the
video again and it goes back to
fullscreen so as long as it's this
seamless it seems like it will be out of
my way when I don't want it and it's
actually kind of hard to tell where the
flat part of the screen ends and the
curved part begins because the graphics
overlap so often but I could see this
kind of stuff being useful to someone
once they get used to the swiping
gestures to bring these tools in and out
of view there will always be people
saying that's really dumb I'm never
going to use that but again some people
will probably be willing to try it I
think the one thing they drew up pretty
well is these quick tools which are a
swipe down from the side and they
provide this quick access anywhere to
tools like a stopwatch a voice recorder
or even a ruler and what makes them so
great is they operate entirely in the
side panel so they're not like a window
hovering over the top of your main
activity this is true multitasking
because they're just over the side next
to what you're doing they're not
interrupting that's pretty legit also it
left me wondering a couple things like
which hand am I supposed to use this in
our lefties not supposed to use this am
I crazy for thinking this actually looks
kind of cool I don't know
I figured I would show it to you guys
it's obviously a bit of a weird
experiment but something I felt the need
to get on video if you're into the note
4 this is something that's literally
going to show up in stores alongside the
note 4 when it comes out the only
difference is going to be the edge
screen and the slightly smaller 3000
milliamp hour battery since the curve
kind of takes away some space but
honestly the one that's going to decide
whether or not this succeeds or fails is
you because it's again it's another one
of those Samsung throw it out the wall
see if it sticks experiments so what do
you think even after just watching
videos on it I honestly don't know how I
feel I held one I messed around with one
I still don't know how I feel obviously
it has a lot of the same advantages in
the note 4 with the s-pen the camera
huge display aluminum but on the other
hand it still seems really awkward and
unnecessary and cumbersome but that was
only after an hour of use so let me know
your thoughts the comments section right
below that like button is always open
thanks for watching this quick one and
state
for the next because September is just
getting started
talk to you guys later base</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
