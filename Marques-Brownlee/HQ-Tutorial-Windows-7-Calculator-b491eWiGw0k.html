this one is how to use the Windows 7
calculator in Windows Vista and I'll
even show you a little bit about it um
so here it is this is a calculator so
first of all how do you get it well open
your internet browser and Google windows
7 calculator and first link will be live
lifehacker.com
click that and you will see a bunch of
Windows 7 software available for Windows
Vista and you one of those will be the
windows 7 calculator so give a second to
load
alright yeah it's done so here's the
website once it loads it'll say get the
windows 7 calculator in Vista and I'll
say Windows Vista only I would not try
it with XP I haven't I haven't attempted
that yet I have an XP desktop downstairs
that might just try that for you guys um
so this is a Windows 7 utility and all
the comments down here it is it is good
so I downloaded it and here it is I'll
show you guys um it works just like any
other calculator it you use your number
pad I'm using a number pad where now you
can clear your many it doesn't have
memory in there just here I'll blow up
the Vista calculator next to it for a
comparison so with this one yes you can
use the number pad this one you can use
the number pad but it doesn't have
memory in this one so if you go to view
you have standard mode and scientific
mode this is scientific mode this is
standard mode so this one you have
standard you have scientific mode you
have programmer mode which is all on
Beinecke prep and you have statistics
mode I am medium standard mode I usually
use in scientific mode actually because
I use trigonometric now in school right
now um that's it's not a huge difference
um it's just shortcuts this one you can
copy
and paste this one you can copy paste
and copy certain values and paste
certain values you have history you have
the date of calculation templates even
separators and then about calculator
which I'm sure is going to pull up a
webpage this one is just about
calculator in Windows Vista so it's it's
a modern improvement but I like the
looks so I decided to keep it I put in
my rock which I showed you tutorial of
before it opens up over here next out
that is Windows 7 calculator for Windows
Vista I encourage you to download it
it's pretty cool and when you when you
do download it so when you search it you
have to search calc because that's what
it comes up as it's under files not
programs help and when you click on calc
that's when it comes up it won't if you
actually search calculator you will only
find out will actually will find it but
if you just enter it will bring up the
actual program that comes with Vista so
I saved it to here and renamed it
calculator by going to icon settings and
a calculator so thanks for watching hope
it was useful peace
