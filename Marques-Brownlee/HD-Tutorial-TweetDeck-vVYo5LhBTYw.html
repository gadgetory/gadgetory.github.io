another h2 tutorial from mkbhd and this
one I'll be showing you guys how to
download and install TweetDeck
so basically TweetDeck is obviously a
twitter client if you haven't used
twitter before my twitter link is on my
page you can follow me on twitter to get
basically exclusive updates when i'm
uploading a video when i'm when i'm away
stuff like that so basically go to any
major search engine you can a AOL Yahoo
Google anything like that and type in
TweetDeck and it will be the first link
there TweetDeck com
once you click on TweetDeck com it'll
take you to the beta website it's
version zero point two point five and I
basically just hit the download now
button it is free is a very full version
and it runs on the Adobe AIR platform
for Mac OS 10 for Windows and for Linux
as I'm here we got it will open up the
Adobe application install you're going
to have to install and allow everything
and just continue and if you AC does pop
up and just hit continue so yeah we're
going into the installation process here
it's installing the application and as
its doing us I'll talk a little bit
about TweetDeck it is it has a big it's
a really nice powerful and fast Twitter
client it does have Facebook integration
so you can update your Twitter status
through your Facebook status through
here
so now that has been fully downloaded
and installed I'm gonna exit out of our
web browser and what we can do see we've
got an icon on our desktop and first
thing it does is open up TweetDeck so
here's what it looks like alright let's
wait for it to finish actually I'm not
signed in but I'm just going to see this
icon here I am signed in so here's what
it looks like when you're fully signed
in obviously I have a ton of messages
and replies and stuff I'll just click on
it so basically a tweet deck is a really
full-fledged Twitter client right now I
have three columns open the all friends
people who I'm following whatever you
want to call them those are all their
updates in the middle I have replies so
people who have replied at mkbhd and on
the right hand side are all the direct
messages so if you are wondering
I haven't answered any direct messages
as I was I uninstalled tweet Dex to do a
redo I'm doing a tutorial on it so I'm
just gonna minimize it here and it does
minimize to the system tray and I see
this icon here on a desktop we're gonna
want to put that up in our
communications tab somewhere next to
Skype all I got to do is just drag it in
so there we go
and it's it's in the communications
folder now a lot of people say well I
want TweetDeck to start with my computer
kind of like a I am used to all you have
to do is take a TweetDeck icon drag it
to the Start menu
hold it hover it over all programs and
you have to go and just drag down all
the way until you get to the startup
folder and the startup folder is where
you have all the things that let's start
with Windows so like maybe you have a I
am starting with Windows maybe you have
Skype you can get Skype to start with
Windows so I'm just gonna scroll down
and drag TweetDeck to the Start menu the
startup folder so just hover over
startup and then drag it somewhere
inside there let go
so TweetDeck is now in the startup
folder so now whenever you start up your
computer
TweetDeck will open up so if you're
wondering where it went that I minimized
it down here in the system tray see this
little icon right here double click it
and TweetDeck opens up so you now have
TweetDeck you can obviously tweet using
a tweet button right there doing
recording video hit the enter button it
sends your tweet out if you do on the
right-hand side want to attach Facebook
to this you can also that would be your
facebook status if you have a URL you
want to share you can post paste that
URL there shorten it and then send your
tweet you can also attach a picture you
can obviously shrink the update if it's
more than your 140 characters but I
basically this is just the installation
video so if you do want a full review
video I'm planning on getting to that
very soon anyway this has been a brief
TweetDeck installation tutorial I hope
this was helpful to you and if you're
not already following me on Twitter the
link is in the description in this video
and that's basically it so thanks for
watching
