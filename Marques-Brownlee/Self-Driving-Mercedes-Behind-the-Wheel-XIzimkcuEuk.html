out here at CES 2017 and I guess
Mercedes saw what I was doing with all
the other car videos with Tesla so they
invited me out to the desert to take a
look at the way they're attacking
self-driving so obviously a lot of
people know about Tesla and their
self-driving capabilities it's
practically what they're most known for
but a lot of people forget or don't even
realize a lot of other car manufacturers
are working on the same thing in their
own way so you're probably already
familiar with Mercedes and their great
reputation for you know quality and
luxury and their interiors you've seen a
move for but what they did here is they
took a production eClass that you've
already seen it's on the road but they
outfitted and upgraded the interior with
additional features and there's other
sensors for what they call Drive pilot
so that's coming in s-class later in
2017 so this isn't even out yet so yeah
the car you're looking at is a bit of a
Frankenstein mobile with a black box in
the trunk not the prettiest thing in the
world but hey it's a demo of the
self-driving tech and that's what
they're working on they're going to be
playing in cars pretty soon so you can
see where they've put the sensors they
have the dual camera system all the way
up at the front just like the Tesla it's
reading street signs and speed limits
and things like that and then there's
also radar firing from behind bumpers on
both the left and right hand side to see
around the car and what's near you on
the road and even a forward-facing radar
to bounce off the car in front of you
that's coming from literally behind the
Mercedes logo so I got a little demo
walk through from the Mercedes guys as
they went through it basically they
showed me all the features and walk me
through it and I was comparing it in my
mind to the way Tesla does it and then I
was able to get in the driver's seat
myself and check it out and I basically
found I'd say two main differences
versus the Tesla autopilot so the
biggest difference is basically they're
not using just the sensors and the
cameras in the car for autonomous
driving like Tesla does they're actually
adding map data from a company called
here Maps as well to augment that so
it's not just the sensors in the cameras
it's the sensors and the cameras and
maps so basically in regular driving and
normal roads that doesn't matter too
much but it does add the ability to make
a turn by itself when it's on the map so
for example if I'm on a road and the car
is self-driving and my turn is coming up
you know a couple hundred yards before
my turn I'll put the blame
puron so the car keeps driving but when
I do that it checks the map to see when
the next turn is when you get close to
it it'll slow you down automatically
make the turn for you and then
accelerate back up to the speed limit so
that was pretty cool to see in action
and the other thing is you know Tesla
Model S is already level 2 self-driving
so Lane Assist and adaptive cruise
control combined but they're a little
more relaxed about keeping your hands on
the wheel like I'm used to it reminding
me maybe every 30 seconds or so
depending on the roads too you know get
your hands back on the wheel pay
attention just touch it to confirm
you're still here but that makes sense
in a level 2 system the Mercedes system
Drive pilot is a little more about like
keeping your hands on the wheel to be
ready to take control back even when the
car is still doing the steering so they
put all the controls on the steering
wheel itself instead of on a separate
stock so you can control everything
about the self-driving and the speed
control and navigation everything
without taking your hands off the wheel
and the system also asks you to confirm
you're paying attention maybe every 10
seconds or so it felt like which could
feel kind of annoying if you're feeling
lazy but they kept it easier with this
little touchpad on either side of the
steering wheel so you just basically
touch it to confirm and paying attention
so you don't really have to grip the
steering wheel like you do in the Tesla
you just touch either side of the
steering wheel on the little pad and the
warning on the dashboard goes away but
that's the main difference that's what
differentiates it from what I've used it
doesn't take me that long to get used to
it I got comfortable pretty quick and I
trusted it on these roads I mean
obviously I've used a car with autopilot
before so it wasn't that crazy but the
handling of turns was a nice little
additional feature to have thanks to the
map data the hard part though is GPS
isn't perfect like maps aren't even
perfect we all know we've all seen Apple
Maps
I even tried putting the blinker on near
the end of my drive to make a right-hand
turn but that road actually wasn't on
the map so it just left the right
blinker on and kept going it wasn't
going to slow down so I ended up having
to take control hit the brake and make
the turn myself so it doesn't seem like
a big deal you know it's the little
things you can still do that it's
clearly still evolving it's level 2 not
level 5 but the question I have is will
people trust it like would you trust it
obviously tech enthusiasts like me who
trust computers are totally fine with it
but uh let me know what you think we
think a self-driving thanks for
watching this one and I'll talk to you
guys the next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
