September welcome to the ask MTB HD Q&amp;amp;A
series so this is the middle of what I
would call Hardware season or smartphone
season where pretty much everyone is in
the midst of getting their stuff
announced or released or ready before
the holiday season this is always that
busy time of year it's keeping us very
busy around here but of course we can't
leave out the Q&amp;amp;A so I asked you guys
which one to know one Twitter and these
are some of your best questions so
what's the coolest shot you've taken
with the robot okay so that would easily
by far be the shot that we actually took
while we were at motorized precision and
we did that sort of an orbit intro shot
talking to the robot as it was moving
around not only did it look really cool
but with all the timing and all the
words being said and the sinking of the
movement of the robot with the words
that was actually probably the most
ambitious thing that we've done with the
robot that being said this is Mia say hi
and if you've noticed some shots in the
past couple videos they've been a little
bit more trippy a little more
interesting she's why moving on do you
think the pixel three can get the best
score in DxO mark without having a zoom
lens because the zoom category is
important to DX Oh mark yeah I fully do
not expect pixel three to have a second
lens again as we've seen from leaks and
I also don't expect it to get the
highest DxO score your hundred-percent
right one of the biggest new categories
of the DX o mark score is the quality of
your zoom so if you have an additional
lens to do optical zoom you will do
better just because of physics in fact I
think I saw recently there was a leaked
or basically it could easily have been
faked but like a top new phones of 2019
DX Oh mark scores and whether it's real
or not even though it's probably not
those scores are very predictable and
line up with pretty much exactly what
you'd expect
we're expecting a couple more triple
camera phones to be coming out soon and
those will score high on synthetic
benchmarks that take advantage of those
it doesn't necessarily mean it's a
better camera though keep that in mind
as a youtuber would you rather have one
video with a billion views or 1000
videos with a million each so I guess
that adds up to a billion it's actually
really interesting as a youtuber
the the longevity of a channel having a
thousand videos all with a million views
would be that would be insane that would
be like a career basically then again
there are not that many videos with a
billion views and pretty much all of
them are music videos so there's
definitely no tech videos with a billion
views there's probably no tech videos
with a hundred million views to be
honest I think probably since bendgate
nothing's gotten anywhere near a hundred
million views on a tech video so I guess
as someone in my position I'd probably
be more interested in what kind of tech
video could possibly get anywhere near a
billion views and I'd love to see that
but that's of course a stretch its 2018
why is Apple still sticking with four
gigabytes of RAM you know this is one of
those things that we seem to forget
about every year specs don't mean that
much relative to the way the phone works
like pretty much every new flagship
coming out has somewhat near identical
specs very close if it's a new iPhone it
has the a12 bionic it has some RAM it's
got a screen it's got a camera it's got
all this things if it's a new Android
phone is gonna have snapdragon 845 it's
gonna have four six or eight gigs of ram
it's gonna have a screen it's gonna have
a battery camera etc but every year we
kind of get sucked up into comparing the
specs of iPhones with the specs of
Android phones this is a really easy
mistake to make because it's just a
number to a number I see four gigs of
ram on one phone and eight gigs of ram
on another phone why does Apple still
have four well what their vertical
integration and their optimization and
the fact that they control everything in
there with their walled garden Apple
happens to not need a gigs of ram we saw
this with CPU cores before there was all
these four cores six core eight core
CPUs and then there would be new iPhone
I would have a four core CPU and you
wonder why is Apple lagging behind but
when you actually use the phone just cuz
it has four cores and four gigs of RAM
it's not slow that even reminds me of
this iPhone 10 are everyone's talking
about the iPhone 10 are and the numbers
on paper and that's the fact that the
specs are kind of weak and it has this
sub 1080p display and it only has three
gigs of RAM and all these things are
true but the fact is the typical iPhone
buyer first of all probably couldn't
tell you the resolution of their iPhone
and also probably doesn't care but I
just keep seeing this every time a new
iPhone comes out we latch on to the
numbers and it's easy clickbait
talk about how the numbers don't seem to
add up but until you actually use the
phone which nobody has even I I've
gotten an hour to with it I made a whole
video about it but we haven't really
used the phone yet so until we use the
phone and we should probably reserve
judgement about just the numbers and see
if it actually seems to work well so in
the case of the 720p ish display on the
iPhone 10 R it's really really easy to
just say hey if 2018 720p bad maybe it
is so let's get it in hand let's
actually see how it looks I can tell you
from the couple minutes I've spent with
it it looked pretty good to me but again
we'll have to literally see first it was
the iPod then the iPhone then the iPad
then let's say the Apple watch what's
next I'm gonna go with air power 100%
it's definitely air power I'm loving the
new autofocus series thank you
I'm glad you enjoy those videos and the
videos were great now what comes next
which car is next that is a great
question so we started those auto focus
videos with the Tesla Model 3 then we
went straight to a Lamborghini Aventador
and then we went to Acura NSX the common
theme with these is that they're all
tech centered in some way but as far as
what car is next we there's no plan
honestly there's no slate of cars lined
up there's things that we want to review
and that I want to get my hands on and
talk about but it's just kind of playing
it by ear
maybe Porsche will come out with that
mission e pretty soon and we'll be able
to get our hands on it maybe Jaguar will
come through with that ipace maybe
something else electric or tech heavy
will just show up out of the blue like a
Faraday future or something like that I
don't really know but that's kind of the
way the autofocus series works is when
it happens
what kind of pounce on it maybe you have
a suggestion maybe there's a car that's
out right now that you want to see on
autofocus maybe you want to leave that
in a comment below let me know oh
whatever happened to that Bigsby speaker
are you planning to make a full review
yes in fact for those of you who missed
it I did on April Fool's Day a sort of a
parody because we had all these smart
speakers coming out we have the Alexa
the Google home the home pod
what if Bixby had a smart speaker and I
made this entire joke of a video
destroying the concept of a Bixby
speaker and how lame and
well that would be hey Bixby what do you
think of Siri got it and then what do
you know it's Samsung unpacked a couple
months later boom Bigsby speaker it's
not called the Bigsby speaker but it's a
smart speaker that only has Bigsby this
I cannot wait to use but it doesn't come
out for a couple more months so you know
whenever that happens I'll get my hands
on it somehow I'll buy it I'll find one
Samsung probably doesn't want me to have
one but I'll get one and I will review
it count on it
so Dunkin Donuts recently rebranded to
Dunkin I did see that what smartphone
company do you think needs a rebrand
actually thought about this like I
studied business and marketing in
college like I didn't think I would be
that into brands and brand image and
what that does to people I was one of
those people who thought like ads don't
affect me but brands really do affect
you a lot and so changing a brand image
or rebranding or even adding a brand can
have a massive effect on the way people
perceive something like car companies do
it all the time like in the u.s. there's
a pretty mid tier pretty budget-friendly
car company called Hyundai you never buy
a Hyundai for the luxury it's because
it's a good price and it's practical but
then the same company wanted to get into
making luxury cars and you know if you
put a Hyundai logo on it they just won't
see it the same way as a Mercedes or a
Cadillac they got the name behind it so
they started an entirely new brand
called Genesis they don't have the
Hyundai logo or name anywhere on any
Genesis car but they make these nice
classy luxury cars now and they have a
totally different new brand name they
will never associate the two together
but that's how you do it so as far as
smart phone companies I could take
advantage of this the one that came to
mind was Huawei and maybe even some
others because you know wall way in the
u.s. especially with the authorities and
the headlines and the things that people
talk about with Huawei it's not gonna go
well do you try to sell while we phone
in the u.s. at this point there's just a
name that's just not quite lining up
with the apples and the Samsung's of the
world so maybe just maybe you got to
start a new sort of new sort of brand
name to sort of start over and get a
fresh start in the u.s. you just saw the
poco phone - that's a Xiaomi phone it's
not called the Xiaomi poco phone f1 as
much as it's just called the poco phone
f1 that's for a reason if you could
revive
and refresh any piece of tech what would
it be and why
revive and refresh any piece of tech
what would it be small phones small
phones bring back the small phone the
smallest flagship phone you can buy
right now is like bigger than all of the
biggest flagship phones you could buy
eight years ago
bring back the small flagships tell the
story of your hand and the stitches okay
so this is probably new to some people
like I did that iPhone unboxing video
and I guess I haven't shown my hands on
camera in a while people are like what
what happened to your hand I looks like
it hurt what's with the stitches so a
couple years ago in college I broke my
hand playing ultimate I got a plate and
screws in there they're still in there
got the stitches eight stitches got them
all out that's good then this other scar
my knuckle is also from ultimate from
just like running and jumping and when I
jumped out my hand hit someone's tooth
and then that was pretty deep but that
was no stitches and this other one over
here that I had my band-aid on for that
super car video that was just a
self-inflicted knife wound way less cool
of a story also eight stitches and now
that's done too can you reveal the K and
mkbhd what it stands for at seven
million subscribers
yeah how about ten about ten if we add a
digit I'll tell you how about that
all right I'll end it there thanks for
watching catch you guys in the next one
