they said this year 2014 would be the
year of the wearable 2014 is said to be
the year of wearable tech electronics
that are physically attached to your
body so was it at the beginning of 2014
about 10 months ago but look at the five
best wearables that you can buy and
these are all first generation products
so they're the beginning of a new
product category and they could all sort
of tell you if you have a new
notification they could tell you if
something new was happening but if you
actually wanted to do anything about it
or if you wanted to take action or if
you want to reply to something like a
new message then you still have to take
your phone out your pocket anyway so
that's I guess the main difference
between what we had then and what we
have now at Google i/o this summer we
saw the introduction of Android wear so
it's Google's version of their Android
operating system for wearable tech or
smartwatches specifically it's not sexy
or anything but it's very smart and it's
actually gotten a couple of software
updates since it first rolled out and it
has a bunch of new features now and it's
a lot better looking and wearable tech
has made a lot of steps forward since
that introduction so now here we are at
the end of 2014 with a very different
very new list these are your new top 5
best wearables that you can buy right
now number 5 is the Samsung gear s so
this is a Tizen SmartWatch and we've
talked a lot about Tizen in the past and
what it means to Android but essentially
the gear s is this huge curved AMOLED
display on a SmartWatch it's not small
at all it's not subtle at all it's this
really big thing but it's one of the
more innovative designs and one of the
more interesting looking things we've
seen this year in the SmartWatch game
and actually turns out to be a really
good product mostly because it's one of
the few that actually doesn't require
being tethered to or attached to a
smartphone to work it has its own
independent functions it has its own
independent actions that can do it is a
freaking web browser built-in so if you
want to load up a web page it'll start
chugging that Snapdragon 400 and half a
gig of ram and it'll load up a web page
so if you need to do some things on the
go ad this is actually a pretty solid
option and like I said it's not small
it's not subtle but it's pretty
interesting looking Samsung by the way
has loaded the market with a bunch of
Smart Watch options and they're
basically saturating the market in
typical Samsung fashion one of the other
noteworthy ones is the Samsung gear live
which is their Android wear version of a
SmartWatch pretty traditional looking
SmartWatch as far as they are concerned
and they have a gear 2 as well which is
the sort of a follow-up to their Tizen
based Galaxy gear number four is the
pebble and this is actually one of the
returners from the video that happened
at the beginning is here 10 months ago
which means it's still really good at
what it does because it's very focused
on just delivering your notifications
and it's still really good at that
now it's also not going to let you take
action really on these notifications the
way the Android wear smartwatches do so
if you get a new message you can mark it
as read or ignore it but that's about it
you still have to take your phone out
your pocket to reply but it still has a
display that allows it to have a 7 day
battery life it's not the most premium
feeling in the world but they also have
a version called the pebble steel that's
a bit more expensive but I would
recommend it because it's much more
premium feeling has the metal band has a
clasp that feels much more like a normal
timepiece than the rubber and plastic of
the original pebble so the pebble in the
pebble steel are still very easy to
recommend for the simple delivery of
notifications number three is the asus
zenui
the square display on your wrist it does
look a little bit unconventional it
doesn't look quite as much like a normal
watch but I think the one that strikes
the balance best is the Zen watch it's
probably easily the best-looking
SmartWatch that has a full square
resolution display it has that brushed
aluminum on the sides it has that subtle
curve around the edges it has the
leather band it has that clasp like a
normal timepiece so it's very nice of
striking the balance between something
that looks like a timepiece but also it
gives you that sort of a high-tech look
in the full square display III wouldn't
necessarily pick it over the number one
and number two but I do want to put it
high on this list because it's worth
recommending it's a great performer it
has a solid battery life it's got nice
specs it's pretty solid and I wouldn't
have any trouble recommending it to
someone who's looking to get into a
SmartWatch right now number two is the
LG G watch R and this is an Android wear
SmartWatch similar to ones we've talked
about before but it looks a lot more
like a normal timepiece because it has a
round display and actually has the
notches around the display and the
numbers as well
it has a leather ish band that's not
really that premium feeling and there is
no metal version but it still looks a
lot closer to a normal watch than the
sort of a mini computer that the square
ones look like on your wrist there also
is a square version of this it's called
the LG G watch no R and it was
introduced at Google i/o and that was
one of the first that LG introduced but
the G watch are for round is much better
looking I think and is easily something
I could recommend but the number one I
think is the one that you guys probably
all saw coming
number one is the Moto 360 a moto 360 is
a round SmartWatch and it's also running
Android wear and it has a metal version
too so if you prefer that premium look
and feel closer to a normal watch as a
clasp so it has everything like that you
have that option I think it's one of the
best-looking smartwatches actually might
be the best-looking SmartWatch period
with the minimal distractions around the
display and the almost zero bezel has
that chamfer edge around the display it
has that tiny little bar at the bottom
that people like to complain about at
first but you'll find that it just sort
of melts away and disappears from your
vision when you're checking stuff after
about a day or two so it's a beautiful
option for a SmartWatch this is the one
on the list that I did do a full review
on so if you're looking to get into
smartwatches in general or you just want
to know more about what the best of a
SmartWatch right now can offer check out
that link right below the like button
it'll have the Moto 360 review and also
link my android wear review to go over
all the functions of what a SmartWatch
can do so honestly if you're trying to
buy a SmartWatch especially since it's
the holiday season now it's basically a
toss-up between like the top three or
four depending on what sort of a design
you like and what functionality you want
the clasp design the material design
also there's a Sony option the Sony
SmartWatch 3 and there's those also
those Samsung options that I talked
about as they start to flood the market
so really there are a lot more options
than you had at the beginning of the
year also the Apple watch not the eye
watch the Apple watch was announced this
year but it doesn't sell until next year
and there are still a whole bunch of
questions that we have about it I'll
leave the video that I did about that
also below it's a question mark for me
in terms of functionality and what it's
actually going to be able to do and what
the interface will look like and all
these other things but best watch that
video is totally separate and it's an
interesting concept but we all know that
once Apple
tends to get into things that's what
really gets the competition going and
that makes better products for us
there's also a new version of Google
glass expected with internals from Intel
instead of Ti to be released next year
and we keep hearing about these
murmurings of bringing Google glass back
it was actually on the top-five list at
the beginning of this year for best
wearables but it dropped off and it's
been pretty quiet lately but we also
always had in the back of our mind that
thought of a consumer version of Google
glass for a lower price tag that we just
straight-up never saw I mean Google
glass is still 1,500 bucks right now so
I wouldn't be surprised if that was
wrecker resurrected we brought back from
the dead in 2015 so we'll see how this
list of all is during the course of 2015
and what new stuff comes out keep an eye
out for CES stuff keep an eye out for
new Google glass stuff and also let me
know in the comments section below what
you're looking forward to in the whole
wearable game maybe you're not
interested in smartwatches at all maybe
you want stuff to be more on your face
or maybe you want a moto 360 without the
black bar whatever it is let me know
what you're thinking in the comments
section thanks for watching and I'll
talk to you guys in the next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
