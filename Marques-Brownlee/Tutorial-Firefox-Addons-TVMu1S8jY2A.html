add a theme or any other add-on to your
Firefox Internet browser so go ahead and
open up Firefox for this tutorial and I
want to add this theme into my options I
want to be able to use this theme for
Firefox so I just hit add to Firefox if
if this one's not compatible with your
version of Firefox you can tell what
version you have by going to tools now
going to help and going to about Firefox
to see what version you have I have
what's a three point 0.5 so it'll be
grayed out if you cannot add it to your
version of Firefox I'll say this add-on
is for older versions so with the news
personally I don't add to Firefox that's
why you have to hit it says requires you
accept the user end license agreement I
accept it I install it'll instantly come
up with this box that's how easy it is
so only install some authors you trust
well this is when I want to install hit
the Install Now button first it has to
download this one's just 1.8 makes
simple theme it's gonna make it look
like Internet Explorer and usually
changes will require you to restart so
I'm gonna hit the restart Firefox button
take a little my background there so now
we're our Fox is reviewing and opening
up in boiler now the theme has not been
applied it's right back at my last web
site so tools add-ons themes Vista arrow
and you can use your default theme or
use Vista Aero theme and I'm using this
arrow theme so if I on the top you'll
see it looks like it actually looks a
lot like Internet Explorer it's quite
good
looks decent and that is how you install
add-on with the Internet Explorer if you
ever want to uninstall an add-on say I
don't like the theme hit the uninstall
button on install again and reinstall
fire restart Firefox and that's as easy
as it takes to uninstall of our Fox item
BAM right back into the old Firefox
theme all your old add-ons will remain
nothing's gone I really like it so yeah
we have a few comments subscribe to my
channel
ton more videos coming guides thanks for
watching
peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
