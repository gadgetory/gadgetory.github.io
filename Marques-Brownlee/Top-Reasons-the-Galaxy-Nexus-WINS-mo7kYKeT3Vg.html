mkbhd channel back another HD video
today we're going to be taking a look at
the top reasons to want the Nexus Prime
keep in mind this phone doesn't really
exist yet but we're gonna take a look at
that list anyway so strictly based on
rumors the first of which we have is
Android 4.0 or Ice Cream Sandwich if you
will
supposed to be running the latest
version of Android and I'm looking
forward to that because I've loved all
the previous Nexus devices they're the
first to come out with updates for the
most developer friendly and supported
they're the most application supported
they're generally the best of the best
Android devices so I love Nexus devices
anyway second is the screen this is
supposed to be a Samsung build so it's
supposed to have a Samsung screen
samsung galaxy s2 as we already know has
the Super AMOLED plus display beautiful
display gorgeous display I love it so if
this does in fact have a SAM OLED
display I'd be very pleased it's also
rumored to have a 1280 by 720 resolution
which would be really impressive
especially it's supposed to be a larger
panel as well a four and a half to four
point six five inch screen not so
confident about that being talked about
friendly but we'll see how that works
out and that brings me a battery life
oily D displays have always had
phenomenal battery life the Galaxy S II
Galaxy S 2 even things like the Zune HD
just have great battery life because of
how LED technology works I might be
doing a video about that later but I
don't know yet but like I said great
battery life and this is also rumored to
have a very large battery something
along the lines of sixteen hundred and
fifty plus milliamp hours so great
battery life on a great phone and next
on the list is power Wow this device is
rumored to have either a next generation
dual-core 1.2 your hertz or 1.5
gigahertz processor i don't really think
it's going to have quad-core 'm that
might be saved for the tablet world
right now but still it looks very
impressive it's going to be fast and we
love fast phones
have you seen vanilla Android on the g2x
that is a really fast device so stock
Ice Cream Sandwich on the Nexus Prime
should just be slick as hell
and next is 4G LTE now Nexus and Google
have been very very friendly with Sprint
lately but this may actually come to
Verizon first leaves Verizon please do
not screw this up they already screwed
up the Samsung Galaxy S 2 they can't
screw up the Nexus Prime so prime camera
a prime battery life a prime OS a prime
display
Nexus front there you go thanks for
watching I'll talk to you guys later
peace
I want this phone so bad
