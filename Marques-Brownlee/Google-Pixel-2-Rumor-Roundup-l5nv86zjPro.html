we have some Google pixel - rumors and
at the risk of looking like a rumors
channel at least because like in the
last three videos there have been two
round ups but these are really good so
hear me out let's dive into them so
there's a couple big releases every year
that generate a lot of hype one of them
is the iPhone boom you can watch my
iPhone eight rumor roundup video right
there that's everything we know so far
about the next iPhone and also number
two is the Google pixel the flagship
from Google that spearheads Android
previously Nexus now pixel and is what
we're hearing about so last year's pixel
or specifically the pixel XL was one of
my favorite phones released last year
possibly the best phone released in 2016
I kind of set it in the title stock
Android fast updates to Android great
performance great battery life and
possibly the best camera in any
smartphone even still right now but now
the rumors are swirling for Google pixel
- how does Google follow up a super
solid phone like that and the first
pixel ever with an even better one and
actually kind of said in one of my rific
uni videos on my wish list for pixel -
it would be mostly just better more
modern hardware the software experience
is already great stock Android going to
do its thing
and it's going to get stock Android but
you could use a little bit more modern
pretty hardware well the leaks are
starting to pour in now and from Android
police Android police has a great track
record as far as Android leaks and
smartphones go over the past couple
years so I'll link the full post below
but this is what they say we're getting
with the new pixel to excel made by LG
also keep in mind that logo the Android
police logo as good as it looks is not
part of the design of the phone it's
just a watermark so yeah that's what
we're looking at pretty hot looking
phone looks like it'll have a pretty
similar overall look and feel to the
first pixel which is fine
it obviously has those characteristics
but there are some key differences so
first thing we're noticing here is that
display it's of course much bigger much
thinner bezels on the sides and top and
bottom and they're saying it's a six
inch full AMOLED display so that's dope
and they're saying we're also going to
get according to Android police a two by
one aspect ratio to enable that so the
same aspect ratio as the LG G 6 display
same rounded corners as the LG G 6
display and of course
some amoled but I want to throw caveat
into this a 2x1 display here it looks
great and it looks super clean and
modern but I don't know if a 2x1
aspect ratio on the pixel the flagship
Android development phone is a good idea
I could be overreacting about scaling or
about development and maybe it's not a
big deal but it seems like they could
definitely still do here a sixteen by
nine high-resolution display as well
sort of a toss-up for me there but of
course still an AMOLED still really thin
bezels still really hot it also has
those rounded corners like we said like
the g6 and you know not a big deal there
but a lot of people like that and then
the edges of the glass will also be
curved into the body which is always a
nice touch not quite full Samsung with
the display glass like melting over the
sides but I'm pretty happy about this
new display that's kind of what I was
asking for and then the second big
change you'll notice is the camera on
the back or just the whole back in
general this is a much bigger camera
cutout than the previous pixel remember
how small that was it was completely
flush in the pixel and pixel XL looks
like pixel to has a camera looking a lot
like the Nexus 7 when that came out so
really interesting I don't know if that
translates in any way to the camera
quality and there's still no rumors
about what sensor they may be using but
I am very optimistic for the camera
quality in the pixel too considering the
pixel now still has probably the best
camera in any smartphone I don't think
they could put the same exact camera in
and still get the same praise but if
it's an upgrade in any way it's going to
be an excellent camera something we've
seen on a lot of new smartphones with
the snapdragon 835 chip they can all
afford to do auto HDR on all the time
because that chip can handle multiple
exposures at once so HDR was great on
the pixel if it's on full time every
shots going to look great and then the
head-turning rumor from that Android
police leak is that the pixel 2 will
have a squeezable frame just like the
HTC u 11 now again I don't know if
that's a feature that they're adding
just for buyers or if that's something
that they really expect to see in a
bunch of Android phones like from here
on out when I first saw it in the u 11
and I said this in my video I didn't
really expect it to catch on much at all
but that kind of throws a wrench into it
now that this is LG not HTC and I'm
planning on doing the same thing so
maybe it is
catching on let's just go with it let's
say they make it just as sensitive to
multiple pressure levels as the u11
maybe they'll let us remap it to launch
different things like possibly launching
the camera and taking photos with it or
launching the Google assistant kind of
makes sense but if you don't want to use
it at all if you bought this phone for
other reasons they should also allow you
to disable it and never have anything
react to you squeezing but yeah it'll be
really interesting to see how Google
handles the whole squeeze thing in the
software ideally I think they'd let us
remap it to whatever we want they seem
like the type to let us do that and not
lock it down to one function conviction
but yeah now it'll be interesting to see
now something else to keep an eye on is
the speakers the speaker grille you can
see on this leaked render looked super
wide and I've heard rumors of a very
important front-facing dual stereo
speaker system on the pixel to this year
which would be great because the
speakers on last year pixel were
probably its weakest component and then
a headphone jack yet crossing my fingers
to that
hoping they'd do that USB type-c is
probably a given that'll be there too
and then the fingerprint reader it's on
the back again so no fingerprint reader
under the glass like we're assuming may
happen with the next iPhone again it's
in that video but that technology is
super new so they are going with the
fingerprint reader on the back again but
you may have noticed it's now outside of
the glass like it was inside the glass
on the original pixel so it's a little
bit higher up and that also means that
glass window is a little bit smaller
which also kind of guarantees again with
a metal body no wireless charging that's
something I've always noticed like
wireless charging and water resistance
those two things seem to be the most
polarizing features about new phones
some people really just couldn't care
less like yeah you know I never even
uses wireless charging it's like a bonus
to have water resistance but other
people are like super adamant like I
will not buy a phone that doesn't have
waterproofing and I just need wireless
charging I don't really feel that same
way but let me know where you stand on
that also keep in mind these are all
pixel to XL rumors so this is for the
bigger version of the phone it appears
that the smaller pixel 2 will be much
more in line with like a speck bump of
what we have now might have the thicker
bezels as well it'll have the updated
speakers it'll have the updated camera
but don't expect that edge to edge
display but either way I am looking
forward to pixel to XL I mentioned
on Twitter that pixel was one of my most
used phones of last year and we will be
looking forward to this for a while
because the pixel didn't actually come
out until October 4th of last year it's
July now so there's going to be much
more time much more rumors between now
and when we actually see the new pixel
but I think pixel 2xl will probably earn
its spot in my pocket for at least a
little while what do you think would you
pick up this phone if it turns out to be
accurate these leaks are true let me
know what you think thanks for watching
I thought you guys very soon in the next
