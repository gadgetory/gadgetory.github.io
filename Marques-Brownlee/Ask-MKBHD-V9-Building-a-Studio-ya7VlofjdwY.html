and I'm sure you've noticed the little
gaps in videos since I've started
putting together this studio space this
sort of video shooting space but I
figured since it's taking up so much of
my time might as well do a video about
it or a QA and talk about it so I asked
you guys on Twitter what you guys want
to see or what questions you have at all
about a video studio or this particular
spot and this is what we got how do you
get Wi-Fi coverage in all parts of the
studio well it is essentially just one
big open space so there's no walls or
anything in between the one router and
any part of the studio so there's a
great connection everywhere this is the
router that we're using it's been great
and that's what allows me to get speeds
like this do you think it's better to
partition it or leave it as one giant
space honestly that's probably toss-up
for any studio I think for me I
personally I like being able to see like
all of it at once so I don't have any
partitions it's just one big space right
now for me but for recording audio you
tend to want to have a smaller area with
less reverberation so I will be working
on that just for recording audio how
long did it take to build your mega desk
so the mega desk if you guys don't
already know it's this it's the custom
next desk err pro I already did a video
about an ex desk this was just a bigger
version of it but it didn't actually
take that long so I've already talked
about next desk and honestly with a lot
of the stuff you're building in a studio
if you're putting things together it's
really just about the number of parts
that you have to put together so like
this this is like 400 pieces I'm still
not done with this it's still being
built that was probably like nine I
built it in like an hour it was on my
snapchat story it was actually pretty
easy I have nothing to ask once the
studio is done are you going to do a
tour of it I kind of liked the idea of
it and actually kind of need a use for a
360 degree video and I was thinking
maybe thumbs up below if you like the
idea I was thinking a 360 degree video
of the tour where I like walk around the
camera and show you stuff and I don't
know seems like a cool idea but anyway
yes I probably will do a full tour one
of the things done how did you plan out
the layout of where everything will go
do you just guess as you go along or
make a plan so with me I actually
chech doubt on my iPad Pro with the
pencil of like the outline of the
floorplan and where I wanted things to
be and I'm kind of following that now
it's kind of easier to just go with the
way it looks well in the room not the
most scientific thing ever but I did
actually sketch it out and I have ideas
for where certain things will go certain
sets certain looks certain ways to take
advantage of the light coming in from
one side kind of have a plan how do you
soundproof it so there is no echo right
so as you can probably tell I'm
definitely still working on that but
there are a bunch of different ways to
essentially it's not even sound proofed
I mean this room isn't soundproofed from
the rest of the world but there's a
bunch of ways that you can reduce the
amount of echo and the amount of
bouncing off the wall that the sound can
do before it gets back into the
microphone you want the only way for
audio to get into the microphone to be
straight from the source so behind the
camera I'll take a picture because I
can't even really show you guys but
behind the camera I have some foam
pieces and that will hopefully stop the
sound from going past the camera and
back into the back of the microphone but
it'll still you know bounce off the side
walls and I have foam on the ceiling and
there's some rugs in this furniture and
there's all sorts of other things to
dampen the sound but with the space this
big you can ever really soundproof it
it's just a matter of positioning things
in a way to reduce the echo as much as
possible it's the hardest part of
starting your office over from scratch
so it's actually not that bad for me I
kind of enjoy the process of setting up
something new like you getting a new
computer you know you drop a fresh
wallpaper on it you get all your apps
installed get everything logged in and
set up for the first time like it feels
fresh and new I kind of enjoy that
process so it's not so bad I guess the
worst part would just be just all the
building of things that come some
assembly required why fake grass why not
real ones man if I had real plants in
here it would all die I mean I have the
grass on here because it's green and
green is a nice color on camera and it's
kind of cool to have some different
colors in here once in a while but yeah
I don't think I could keep it alive for
a very long if it was real what is the
one thing you plan on doing to your
studio that you haven't seen before that
will be truly unique to you honestly
most of what I'm putting together has
probably been done already aside from
the literally custom stuff that's built
to order most of it has been already
done I think the most unique thing is
probably going to be how I use the
things that I'm using like again this
wardrobe here for example when you buy
it for Mikey
it's mostly for people who are buying it
to put clothes in it I'm buying it and
putting shelves in it to be able to put
video gear and stuff like that so using
things as a youtuber most of the time is
different from using things as a normal
person other than that most of the
techniques I'm getting or like the
places I'm putting things it's been done
before what do you plan on putting on
the walls any art yes of course I will
definitely be having lots of art in here
and so Justin malar who you've already
seen the art by is hooking me up with
some stuff that's already gonna look
really good but also some other stuff
you probably have even seen before
- hopefully oh dope in the backgrounds
on the walls the blank walls can only be
so interesting to so many people so yeah
we got some stuff coming in to add some
color to the space is there a lot of
natural light in your new studio or do
you have to use artificial lighting so
this particular space does have an
entire wall of windows which is a ton of
natural light that's probably not normal
for a studio I think most photographers
and some video people prefer to be able
to control all the light and not have
the clouds moving in and out so they
like to have their own soft boxes and
everything but I have preached before
and I've said I love shooting with
natural light all the time so any time I
can get outside and shoot in a park or
use the Sun all that light is free and I
don't worry as much about the variation
just because I think it looks that much
better one of my biggest tips for video
especially when you're recording an
object like a smartphone for example is
to focus on that object looking good
with lighting first so before the camera
or the lenses or the audio which are all
really important is to just get the
object to look as good as possible
before the camera even turns on so
photography is the capturing of light
video being the moving photography I
think just having that look as good as
possible before you turn the camera on
is a big skill how long did it take you
to put together that huge wardrobe so
this thing this wardrobe right here is
called the IKEA pack system it's pretty
much again custom because you get to
choose all the shelves and stuff you put
inside of it I chose a bunch of
different things but then you have to
build it all so I got it on Monday and
I'm still building it it's Thursday
does having a separated studio and
apartment make you more productive so
that's a good question I thought about
that a lot for myself I do think having
a separate place to live and shoot makes
me more productive I kind of you know
when you're
you tuber you tend to especially a lot
of other youtubers you'll roll out of
bed into the place where you do work
like you do videos so it's so easy to
just sort of roll back into bed and back
into not working mode so I think for me
it actually helps when I get excited and
I have a video I want to make I have to
go get in the car and drive to the place
to make the video so yeah obviously
it'll take an extra second to actually
get here but yeah I feel like having a
dedicated space to work on this one
thing well let me be more productive
when I'm here mkbhd edition pool table
or ping pong let's just start with an
mkbhd Edition poker table and didn't you
see where that goes we'll see where that
goes if you could put any one piece of
furniture in your studio what would it
be okay so you know the dream desk from
the video over at John at TLD did a
couple of weeks back that is one of my
favorite pieces of furniture of all time
that's from a company called rush Bob
wah this is not a plug for them or
anything but I did order one it takes 12
to 16 weeks to build it they build
everything super custom so that's like
the one piece of furniture I'm really
excited for that I'm waiting for you
won't even see it here - like August
you'll probably forget it even exists
but when it shows up on video though
it's gonna be sick anyway that's pretty
much it thank you for watching thank you
for your questions and feel free to
follow the Twitter or the snapchat story
of course if you want to see the
progress of the stuff that's being built
in the studio every day but yeah that's
pretty much it I'm gonna head off to San
Francisco to Google i/o and then there
will be videos from there then I'll come
back and build some more anyway there
you go
thanks for watching talk to you guys in
the next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
