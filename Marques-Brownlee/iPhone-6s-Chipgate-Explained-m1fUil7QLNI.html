here we are
hey what is up guys i'm pbht here and
the iPhone 6s came out a couple weeks
ago you've probably already seen the
reviews it's out there one of the
biggest changes from the iPhone 6 to the
new iPhone 6s is the updated specs
including the new a9 chip so the a9 chip
isn't actually manufactured by Apple
Apple's not a manufacturing company but
it's essentially designed by them and
then contracted out to be built by a
manufacturer and then put in the new
iPhone so this year for the iPhone 6s
there are actually two companies
contracted to make the a9 chip in the
new phone TSMC and Samsung yes Samsung
one of Apple's biggest enemies builds a
processor in the new iPhone so on the
outside there's no actual way to know
which one of those two guys built the a9
chip in your iPhone before you buy it
it'll just be a random selection
essentially there's also no official
reason given why there are two
manufacturers to such a major component
but it's probably volume TSMC couldn't
crank out 13 million of these chips by
themselves samsung couldn't crank out 13
million of these chips by themselves so
Apple contracted both of them and they
both make the a9 chip and they both get
put into the iPhone so the only way to
know which version of the a9 chip you
have in your iPhone is to check after
you buy it so there's an app called
lyrium in the App Store it's free and
I'll link it below that like button and
on the about screen it will tell you
what model of the CPU you have in the
iPhone 6s it's the n7 1m AP for the TSMC
built a nine ship and the n7 one AP for
the Samsung built a nine and you can see
there's also a difference between the
chips in the 6s plus so here's the thing
the TSMC built a nine and the samsung
built a nine aren't exactly the same i
don't know why you think that would be
identical but the TSMC built a nine chip
is slightly bigger than the samsung one
coming in at 104 point five millimeters
squared
while the samsung one is a slightly
smaller 96 millimeter square on an SOC
like this you can kind of think of chip
size like sensor size on a camera
meaning bigger usually enables better
performance and efficiency the bigger
chip on the TSMC a9 is built on a 60
nanometers construction as opposed to
the 14 nanometer samsung chip so once
people figured out that there could
legit be one of two different size a
nine chips in your iphone naturally
people began to
test to see if there's a legit
difference in performance and battery
life between the two chips naturally we
expect a larger TSMC built chip to do
better at both and it does so one found
out that on the Geekbench battery test
the TSMC phone lasts up to 20 to 30
percent longer than the samsung built 1q
all the articles I guess we got
ourselves another gate well it turns out
the geek bench test is essentially the
worst case scenario if you're a CPU and
it's kind of hard to translate that test
into real-world usage the geek bench
test is basically just maxing out the
CPU at a hundred percent and running it
until the battery's dead and measuring
how long that took real-world behavior
doesn't do this though even with a whole
lot of heavy use you're constantly
cycling between a whole bunch of
different performance levels whether
you're gaming or web browsing or
multitasking with apps or texting or ads
sleep or whatever it's doing so at full
max load the TSMC chip being a little
bit bigger is definitely an advantage
but at every other performance level
that's not max load the difference is
almost nothing and that's exactly what
Apple will tell you that other tests
show maybe 2 to 3 percent difference at
worst my buddy Austin showed in his
video a TSMC and Samsung iPhone running
side-by-side playing an hour-long
YouTube video obviously you're not
maxing out power or anything and when it
was over the TSMC chip burned 14% and
the Samsung 15% another friend John over
at TLD tried a 30-minute time lapse with
both phones at the end the TSMC phone
was at 89% and the Samsung at 84 and Ars
Technica did a bunch of tests with
identical iPhones one with each chip
with a displays calibrated at the same
brightness and everything and found
minimal differences across the board
with battery life tests again the TSMC
phone did better in almost every
category thanks to the slightly bigger
chip but very slightly and even all
these are still benchmarking apps that
are trying to synthetically simulate
real-world usage but by the time you get
your phone and install all your apps and
get to using it in your mix of high
performance versus low performance tasks
you probably won't even notice the
difference at all so obviously it would
have been nice to have that nice big
TSMC built a nine chip in every iPhone
but it's not a huge deal if you get a
Samsung one like I did if you're not
maxing out your phone all the time
the Geekbench test what's funny is
apples actually used multiple
manufacturers for other parts in the
iPhone before they do this all time for
stuff like the RAM and the flash storage
so I guess it's not really unusual
although it is unusual for them to be
different sizes and not identical but I
guess Apple's answer to all this is a
loosely paraphrased close enough so what
do you guys think is chip gate a big
deal to you or not I know I'm a heavy
user and yes I had the Samsung chip in
my iPhone for my review and I was happy
with the battery life so it wasn't a big
deal to me but I feel like if we need to
start another gate which do we really
but if we do it should be about
something that's actually terrible like
the way this Mouse charges anyway thank
you guys for watching this one feel free
to share this video with anyone who you
think might be interested in this whole
iPhone chip gate thing if you hit that
subscribe button below you'll be among
the first to see new videos like this
when they come out again thanks for
watching I'll talk to you guys in the
next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
