is the third phone from oneplus it's the
one plus three it's a new phone from a
not so new anymore company so oneplus
has made their name from their previous
two phones the oneplus one and the
oneplus two and both were really well
known for their impressive specs for a
low price
big specs small price that's what
oneplus does best and they are
absolutely back at it again with this
one plus three so just to get them out
the way this one plus three is rocking a
Snapdragon 820 chip the audrina 530 GPU
64 gigs of non-expandable flash storage
and six gigs of ram six gigabytes of ram
obviously they're flexing a little bit
here but we'll get to that in a bit so I
think the design is one of this phones
best assets this year it's pretty clean
all around it's a full unibody metal
jacket as you can see clean lines and
subtle curves to feel good in the hand
and quality button placement so they're
all easily recognizable and easy to
press and it actually keeps that alert
slider - from last year that I liked I
still wish I could reverse the order of
the alert slider and the settings to
make going down the silent switch but
whatever it's still there but overall
yeah it's a simple low-risk design
oneplus didn't take any huge Gamble's
with the outside of this phone because
that's not really what they do if you
look at this phone you don't really see
anything
design-wise that hasn't showed up in
another smartphone before it so they
didn't like take away the headphone jack
or anything they didn't go with dual
cameras or detachable modules or magnets
or pins it's really much closer to I
guess a traditional look it even looks a
little bit like the iPhone 6s on the
bottom you could say with some slightly
different angles and some different
looking chapters and ports I'd say the
worst thing about this design is
probably the camera bump on the back
which is definitely brand new because I
used to praise oneplus for filling out
the smartphone body with battery deer
every smartphone manufacturer ever if
you're using a large camera module which
you probably are feel free to fill out
the rest of the phone's body with
battery like this
it will not make the phone too heavy or
too thick and everyone will appreciate
the extra battery thank you now I get
the one plus three that is way thinner
has a camera bump and has a smaller
battery anyway up front on this phone is
classic one plus here a 1080p display
and your choice between capacitive
buttons or on-screen buttons thanks
oxygen OS I happen to prefer the
capacitive ones this time around and the
display is again really good for a 1080p
display it's not going to match the quad
HD panels from Samsung and sharpness or
brightness but those are the best panels
on the market and this little guy puts
up a respectable fight it's a 5.5 inch
OLED display with some really thin side
bezels less than a millimeter on each
side I like that and it gets pretty
bright so it's viewable outdoors and of
course it's battery efficient by
definition now know the irony of
launching a 1080p phone with the VR
event did not go unnoticed but oneplus
actually just kind of says yet people
don't really do the whole smartphone in
headset thing very often so 1080p is
just fine and I tend to agree with them
on that plus these high-end chips inside
are so used to powering these big quad
HD panels that you pretty much eliminate
any graphic slowdowns with the audrina
530 just pushing 1080p things are super
smooth battery gets a nice benefit and
most people don't know the difference if
they never hold it up next to a galaxy
s7 the display looks really good the
fingerprint reader is also much improved
it seems to be now to me the
second-fastest fingerprint reader I've
ever used in a smartphone right up next
to touch ID on the new iPhones I would
really only sometimes have it forget my
finger once in a while but that was rare
so I loved being able to secure my phone
really quickly but still unlock my phone
super fast fingerprint reader was a nice
touch to see it improved and actually
using this phone is the best part of it
in my opinion again it's not really that
risky at all it's oxygen OS 3.11
based on android marshmallow as you'd
expect from oneplus and it has that
stock ish Nexus feel plus a bunch of
extra usability features stuffed in
there for a better experience nothing
crazy
not a huge skin or a bunch of new icons
or bloatware or anything like that but
more like pure Android plus a bunch of
neat customization features
that are awesome if you want to use them
but they stay out of the way if you
don't you can definitely tell oxygen OS
has gotten a lot of fine-tuning and
polish since the last version especially
on the oneplus 2 so that's nice to see
and I usually go straight for the Google
launcher on most new smartphones but I
like that home screen customization here
is now super easy so with a long press
you can now mess around with what type
of Google search bar you have home
screen grid size etc and even the Shelf
is back and a bit better than before
I still don't use it much to the left of
all your home screens but now you can
add memos or pin frequent contacts
reminders stuff like that
it holds an auto refresh in weather
widget now which is cool I still think
Google now cards are way more useful
though I kind of just wonder if they
could have built in a page like that but
I guess I'll have to settle with a
widget or eventually using the Google
launcher anyway but either way as you
would probably expect with these top
notch specs a 1080p display and near
stock Android and fast flash storage and
it just absurd 6 gigabytes of RAM this
very well may be the smoothest quickest
Android handset I've ever used alongside
Nexus 6p right now I'm just hoping it
lasts
so some phones start off smooth but then
they find a way to stutter and chop even
with high-end specs because of their
software their bloat I'll be using this
phone for a couple of weeks now and it's
held up just fine I don't think I ever
got over 4 gigabytes of active RAM usage
during my regular use even with a game
in the background and I don't know if a
preload times even matter after a
certain point because the ones that were
cleared from Ram opened up fast again
anyway battery life through all this was
also pretty good although I think I kind
of expected a little better it was
inconsistent at first but then it
leveled out I would give it a B B+ sort
of good rating with a 3000 milliamp hour
battery and a 1080p display so I was
consistently getting near 4 hours of
screen on time with my usage I gotta
wonder though what they could have done
if they didn't make the phone so thin I
mean 7.3 millimeters in a Full Metal
Jacket it's sexy and everything but I
got to wonder how it would have lasted
if they follow their own example from
last year and made it a little thicker
with like a 3600 milliamp hour battery
or something but oh well now one of the
headlining features of this phone is
actually they're fast charging which
they call - charging
you actually get a four amp charger in
the box which sounds crazy because most
smartphones are one or two amp chargers
and it charged so fast
it actually changed my charging habits
this phone and the galaxy s7 are
actually the only phones I stopped
charging overnight and just started
topping them off whenever they were low
like in the morning when I wake up I
mean you can still charge every night if
you want to but when you plug in and get
60% charge in half an hour
it kind of stopped needing to so -
charging is apparently much more
efficient with temperature regulation
which is why the brick is a little
bigger but it'll keep pumping the
current even when the phone is on and
the screen is on and when you're using
it where that's where most other phones
will slow down their quick charge there
is no wireless charging since it's the
metal back but I'm happy with the
convenience of fast charging this guy
just like I am with the galaxy s7 the
camera on the oneplus 3 has you guessed
it no big gambles but just a solid bunch
of choices that put it together it's a
16 megapixel Sony sensor F 2.0 aperture
has optical image stabilization and
phase detection autofocus for the
quickness the camera app itself is
decently fast both to open up and take a
picture so that's good and by default
auto HDR is enabled so it doesn't take
that much extra time to actually take
and process that shot so that's nice
focus is nice and quick but of course
you can turn off HDR to speed it up a
little more if you know you're not going
to need that but the photos it takes are
I would say fairly well balanced they're
sort of tiptoeing a line between being
vibrant but not too oversaturated and
I'd say crisp without being super over
sharpened again you can tell there's
definitely sharpening but it's not too
crazy exposure I'd say it likes to
overexpose just a little bit like a lot
of other smartphone cameras but that's
fine because dynamic range is actually
really good and this is all really nice
to see from a smartphone that costs way
less than the top dogs usually you see
the camera quality dropping off as one
of the big sacrifices in smartphones
that drop the price a lot this is one of
the areas where the oneplus 3 held up
that really makes it worth a while this
is awesome I think the mark of a good
camera is one that lets you just snap a
picture and then put it away and forget
about it and it's an amazing picture and
actually kind of happened to me so I was
up on campus in a sort of a low-light
scenario I was going to go meet
and people who play frolf and I just
looked around and I said hey this this
is like a nice low-light camera test
sort of environment so I took a disc out
snap the photo of it and then put it
away and then we went and played frolf
of course I come back to my computer a
couple hours later and it's uploaded to
Google photos and I take a look at it
and I realize like that's that's nice
like that's a really good low-light
photo this is the first shot I took and
I didn't even think about taking another
one I just open the app snapped it put
it away and went on with the day and it
looks pretty clean so performed pretty
admirably in low-light in Auto
obviously moving objects are still going
to be a blur but the camera also has
full manual mode if you want to get
fancy with it it has that and the raw
photos and to top it off 4k video with
stabilization so it's a complete
smartphone camera package and that
actually kind of summarizes the oneplus
three you know it's despite being so
simple really is still the complete
package it doesn't have any huge big
gimmicks or risks that may or may not be
worth the money like trying to be
modular or something like that but it
also isn't like having any glaring
emissions or missing sensors or missing
NFC like maybe it did last year you can
even say it's boring but you know
there's a couple first party oneplus
material cases so you can check those
out if you want the sandstone back of
course or there's deep brand skins if
you want even more looks this for
example is the concrete look you could
say it's groundbreaking I'll link them
below but it comes down to this my 5
pillars for a great smartphone are still
great performance display battery life
camera and build quality and it pretty
much nails all those again I said before
smartphones in the last couple years are
getting so good that we tend to measure
them by what's wrong with them instead
of what's right about them and this
applies again we're at the worst thing
about the 1+3 is that it's so damn clean
it's just almost boring almost unexcited
when you see other smartphones actually
trying to be you know modular or having
these removable parts or magnets and
pins or showing up with these fancy dual
camera systems or trying to be
shatterproof all those things are cool
but oneplus isn't trying to do any of
that they're just showing up crushing
the spec game and selling it for less
than the phone
you were thinking about buying I mean
six eggs a ram I think you want that so
that's the story for this phone it's a
pretty clean experience I'd say it's a
green light to buy if you're coming from
a previous like one or two year old
stock Android phone like a nexus 5x or a
oneplus one or a Nexus 5 this is an
awesome upgrade and even just compared
to other things in the price range the
experience is top-notch so uh that's
pretty much it thanks for watching this
video review hope you enjoyed it I'll
talk to you guys the next one thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
