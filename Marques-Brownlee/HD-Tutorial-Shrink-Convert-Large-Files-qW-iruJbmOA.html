here from mkbhd and today we have
another freeware tutorial for you guys
and this one is going to be about
compressing videos compressing any video
format to be much much smaller file size
you might have noticed that if you're
not a youtube partner you have a maximum
video upload length to YouTube of 10
minutes and a maximum file size of 1 gig
and recently I had a video an unboxing
video actually that went up to 1.3 7
gigs when I produced it in 1280 by 720
HD so yeah we had a little problem we
had to uh I was looking around for ways
to actually upload this video and I
thought it compressor so now I'm gonna
show it to you guys this one is it's
available at the link in the description
DVD video soft calm and a number of
things after that URL but you can see
there's basically a free studio of
different software utilities and they're
all freeware and if we scroll down here
we'll see there's um not only YouTube
downloaded and uploaders but the one
we're gonna we're interested in here is
free videos to Flash converter for point
one point three and this is actually the
latest version at the time that I'm
making the video but go ahead and get
the latest version so we're just going
to do is click on it and it'll take us
to a download link and you're gonna hit
that download button only ten point six
megabytes and now I'm going to show you
guys once you've downloaded and
installed it which is fairly simple how
to how to actually compress the video so
here we get we're gonna open up this
piece of software here I have it in a
shortcut we're going to double click it
and it actually opens up the studio menu
now I didn't download all 20 pieces of
freeware I only downloaded the youtube
to mp3 converter and the free video to
flash converter which is what we're
going to use so go ahead and click on
the video to flash converter and it'll
open up and here's the the interface of
it so it's very simple interface we have
the input files the output folder and
the format's so I'm just going to browse
for a file that we want to upload or
even if it's not one gigabyte we're
going to look for a file that's really
big that
take a long time to upload we want to
just shorten that time that upload time
so here we go we'll find a file here
this this mattias unboxing which
actually I have not uploaded yet is 0.98
gigs so it's really really close to one
gigabyte and I don't want to be running
that risk so I'm just gonna open up that
file this video file it's a dot MOV file
and yes this does work for MOV mp4 etc
and what we're going to do is choose our
output folder and I'm gonna save it to
the desktop in the mkbhd folder hit OK
and we're going to use the FLV format
the FLV format will upload to youtube
and we'll be actually processed most
much faster because that's what YouTube
uses YouTube's processes videos to turn
them all into FLV format so if you're
uploading an FLV video it won't take
quite as long to process and then when
we go to presets we're gonna go all the
way down to the highest ultra high land
Wi-Fi bandwidth so you can go either
very higher ultra high if your videos
are really really high like 30 40 gigs
you can go from high to hot to very high
bandwidth so I'm gonna choose ultra high
here and go to edit and since we want to
preserve this this HD HD uploading to
YouTube we're going to change the
dimensions to 1280 by 720 and we're also
going to change the frame rate to our
highest 30 frames per second for a
smooth smooth video so we have stereo
audio pretty much pretty much the
highest bitrate you need 1280 by 720
we're gonna hit okay and this is where
the magic happens you know the video is
beginning to process or not to process
but to actually be compressed and
converted into the flash format all you
got to do is hit this convert button
convert so here it goes the file
conversion obviously isn't the fastest
in the world since it is a pretty large
file but I'll come back to you guys
after the conversion is done and we're
just going to speed it up here by going
to high priority so here we go alright
guys we're back and it says the
processing is complete and the
conversion was completed successfully ok
so what this means is that
the the FLV file is now in the the
output folder which we've chosen which
is on our desktop in that folder so
let's exit out of uh exit out of the
converter here and go to that exact
folder and here it is we see a whole lot
of files and most of these are not
necessary so I'm going to delete them
the only one you want to keep is the FLV
file so I'm just gonna erase the rest of
these and we're going to keep this FLV
file so here's the original dot MOV file
you can see down at the bottom here this
is 0.98 gigabytes just about up to the
limit for the largest file size you can
upload to YouTube now let's click on the
FLV file and look down here sixty eight
point seven megabytes and it's still HD
quality video will be uploaded to
YouTube in a matter of seconds and it's
all about a matter of putting in the
description fast enough before the video
is uploaded so yeah if you do have a
video or two that are just way too big
for YouTube and you need to compress
them down to a more realistic file size
then I do recommend this piece of
freeware again available at the link in
the description if you want to go check
it out anyway this has been Marcus
