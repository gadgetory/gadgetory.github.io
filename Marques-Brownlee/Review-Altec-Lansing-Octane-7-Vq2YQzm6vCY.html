hey guys mkbhd here with a
high-definition video review of the
altec lansing octane 72.1 channel high
performance speaker system so as you can
see it's a 2.1 channel speaker system
which means you're going to have two
satellite speakers which you can see are
identical to the left and to the right
and one in the middle and that's the
subwoofer which is the point one part of
that two point one system now there's a
lot to talk about with this particular
speaker system by itself I suppose the
most appropriate place to start would be
those two identical satellites on the
left and right hand sides on the top
part of the satellite you can see there
are two one inch soft dome drivers the
left one is blank and the right one at
the bottom of those two drivers you'll
see a bunch of controls and those
include at the top your volume control
in the middle your treble and your bass
volume control so you can turn up and
turn down the treble and bass and at the
bottom of your auxilary in so you can
plug in an mp3 player directly into the
front of these speakers and get sound
from them that way the octane seven
speakers don't actually come with the
audio cable but I happen to have one and
I was able to test audio this way with
my droid with my Zune HD and with the
laptop of course so by now you've
probably noticed the dome shape at the
bottom of the speakers and this is here
because there's actually a mid sized
cone for all your mids in the bottom
part of this speaker yes they do face
downward and yes it does pump audio
directly onto your desk but I find that
it actually does provide a good
substitute for not having a mid-range
speaker so this gives you a fairly
balanced combination of highs mids and
lows with the tweeters in the top of the
satellites the mid-range speaker in the
bottom part and subwoofer for the very
low lows and yes this subwoofer is the
main selling point of the speaker system
and I wouldn't be surprised as someone
bought this speaker system just because
of the subwoofer and use their previous
satellites in fact this is a compact six
and a half inch subwoofer that actually
shakes the room with enough bass without
eating up a whole bunch of floor space
and getting the way of your feet if you
position it properly you'll definitely
get the best out of this subwoofer
without taking up as much space as a
typical 10 inch subwoofer that gives the
same type of lows the frequency response
is also the same as a larger subwoofer
as it'll go down to about 15 20 Hertz
and it will go up to the top
the baselining your your deepest songs
now in the previous audio review I
didn't actually play any copyrighted
music but I did get a comment and it's a
good suggestion of just letting the
speaker thump at a high volume and this
is the subwoofer for the six and a half
inch and I'll let you guys know I'm
playing the song 5th dimension by b.o.b
so you can actually go ahead and take a
listen on your own speakers the bassline
is actually not here Obul to anyone
without a subwoofer so if you if you can
hear this bassline you know you have a
decent system the back of the subwoofer
is also pretty neat as you'll only have
a couple of connectors one to the right
satellite speaker and one to the left
you'll also have your power on an off
switch which is obviously pretty simple
and you'll have your power cable which
is permanently connected and will
connect to an AC power jack you also
above those two satellite connectors
have a jack to connect it straight to
your computer so you connect that by a
one cable straight from the subwoofer to
the computer to get all of your audio
only one cable which is pretty nice
overall this has been one of my favorite
speaker systems to enjoy reviewing
especially for listening in music and I
have to say if you're a big music
listener and you like heavy bass you
like songs with a lot of thump below
your feet and you like to just get the
full experience you can place these
satellites as far apart as you want on
your desk and you're really going to
like this sound so this has been mkbhd
with a review of the altec lansing
octane 7 speaker system user in an 8 and
a half out of 10 in my book and until
next time this has been mkbhd signing
out please
