this is the Nokia Lumia 1020 I've been
sharing a lot of the photos I've been
taking on this guy for a while with you
guys on social media so Facebook and
Twitter and Instagram and stuff like
that but I've mentioned that the camera
on the back which is a 41 megapixel
sensor with Carl Zeiss glass and a xenon
flash and everything is the only reason
that I have this camera or phone on my
radar at all in fact if this didn't have
the amazing camera that it does I might
not have even ever bought it it would
just be another Windows Phone 8 device
and honestly that's not my thing but I
really love the camera on this guy and
taking pictures with it so that got me
thinking and I actually posted a tweet
about how slapping this camera on the
back of like any phone would instantly
make it better because it's that good of
a camera and then I tweeted this and a
lot of you guys who are already
following me on Twitter took that and
ran with it and it spurred a lot of
interesting conversation and a bunch
more suggestions so you guys came up
with a lot of interesting other dream
phone ideas so that was the inspiration
for today's video and just for this
quick video I'm going to be talking
about what I've reconstructed and
reconsidered in my head this for me in
2013 is the perfect impossible but
perfect smartphone
alright so the body and the outside
design of the smartphone would come
straight from the HTC One there are a
lot of really nice design phones out
there already some people would probably
prefer sony design a lot of people would
want the iPhone I would say the HTC One
is the best designed phone out there and
I would go straight from that I probably
expand it a little bit there's been some
rumors of a bigger HTC One Maxx coming
out soon I'll have the links to
everything I talked about in the
description below that like button by
the way but essentially it would be a
big unibody smooth design it would have
the front facing boom sound speakers and
it would be in matte black as you can
probably tell I am personally not one of
those people who has to have a removable
battery as long as the battery is good
but I do kind of like external storage
so if I had to modify the one a little
bit I would have external storage added
maybe an SD card slot on the side but
more importantly that ultra pixel camera
it's just not cutting it for a super
high-end phone as a dream phone so I
would replace it with none other than
the Nokia Lumia 1020 s incredible camera
on the back obviously it's a 41
megapixel sensor like we said before has
Carl Zeiss glass and they are very fast
glass and of course that xenon flash
will it make the phone bigger a little
bit thicker yeah naturally but I think
it would definitely be worth it in terms
of the picture quality improvement you
get out of putting such an incredible
camera in such a small body for the
display I'd actually take it directly
from the Oppo find five the five five
has been one of the most underrated
devices in a while and I've talked about
it in previous videos but the display on
that guy is magnificent it's a 5-inch
1080p display it's an IPS display of
course but more importantly it's very
bright it has really good color
reproduction excellent viewing angles
excellent outdoor visibility and of
course it's really sharp because it's a
5 inch 1920 by 1080 panel and it
actually gets really really dim so if
you want to read it at night you can
turn the brightness down a lot lower
than you would think
relative to other IPS displays so it's a
really really good display very high
pixel intensity and I would just smack
that right on the front of the dream
phone underneath the hood naturally it
would be the highest M processor
available the most amount of RAM
realistically available right now in
2013 that looks to be the Snapdragon 800
CPU that looks to be about 2 gigabytes
of RAM maybe 3 again I made a video
about the Galaxy Note 3 about how that
is supposed to be the next huge flagship
phone where it basically has all the
is ten specs so let's get a better look
at that in about a month or two when
Samsung unveiled that but basically
it'll have the highest and internals
possible and no doubt that'll give it
some awesome performance no matter what
you put on paper now lastly I would have
Motorola do the battery and this is
because motorola just knows batteries
motorola does battery technology better
than anyone else in the smartphone
market these days we've seen the Droid
RAZR MAXX which easily has the best
battery life of any smartphone out there
48 hours of usable life that's a little
bit insane and it's not even that thick
of a phone so clearly they know what
they're doing they mode the Moto X which
is not even a very big phone has a
twenty two hundred million power battery
but with all the little tricks they have
up their sleeve they were able to make
that phone last longer than the Galaxy
s4 and HTC One so if I had to pick one
person to take care of all the battery
technology and use all the tricks up
their sleeve it would definitely be
Motorola and I think in a phone that's
big enough to house the HTC One Maxx and
the big Lumia 1020 camera you can fit a
big 3,000 million power plus battery and
of course with Motorola's optimizations
that could just get an absurdly long
battery life now the price is yeah it's
a weird thing to say because this isn't
a real phone at this point this is sort
of the Frankenstein phone now but if I
would to say in terms of pricing in the
way it's sold I would want this to be
sort of the same way that Google Play
edition phones or nexuses are now so
nexus price but that's not very
realistic but I would want it to be sold
with you know just pure stock Android
4.3 jelly bean no carrier bloatware or
anything involved then it would be sold
off contract maybe in the Google Play
Store and it would arrive in two days if
I ordered it from the Play Store and
that would be the way it would be priced
sort of like in Nexus maybe we call it
the Google Play edition one Lumia Max or
something really cooks like that of
course there are going to be many
different versions of this perfect
smartphone I mean some people are going
to have different ideas of what
perfection is to them at a phone some
people will want an LG display some
people will want a Samsung display some
people will want the iPhones design or
maybe they want Windows Phone OS in it
that's why I'm asking you guys this is
basically a video to get your thoughts
on what your perfect smartphone would be
so if you have a perfect sort of combo
of Frankenstein phone leave that in the
comment section below the like button
and if you see someone who
posted one that you like give that
comment two thumbs up so everyone can
see those popular Franken fell some
people actually would want a small
variation to an existing phone like a
nexus 4 with a 1080p display or the
Lumia 1020 with Android on it you know
just little changes to existing devices
other people are going to have equally
crazy things like I just talked about in
this video that are obviously impossible
but are still fun to look at and of
course after all that has been said we
still have a bunch of awesome devices to
look forward to this upcoming year we
have you know the Oppo find 7 we have
now the LG g2 that I'll be taking a look
at I will be reviewing the Lumia 1020
very shortly we also have you know the
new iPhone coming out soon we have the
Galaxy Note 3 I made a video all about
why I think the Galaxy Note 3 is going
to be one of the most important devices
to look forward to for the second half
of 2013 but no matter how you look at it
the next couple of months of phone and
tablet and device releases are going to
be insane so I'll leave my galaxy note 3
height video down below it'll be the
first link below the like button so you
can check that out but either way this
has been a quick fun video looking
forward to seeing your comments and
talking with you guys below thank you
for watching and I'll talk to you guys
in the next video
hey
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
