mkbhd mouse game has not always been
strong but as a student and someone who
edits a lot of video I spend a lot of
time at the computer with a mouse
so my first real mouse wasn't all that
special just a pretty standard wired one
but my first real upgrade as with a lot
of other people I think was to the
Logitech and next series so really
popular with the MX revolution and the
performance MX and these two were great
I loved mine but actually after a few
months I got some connection issues so I
stopped using it and went back to a
different wired mouse but now Logitech
is back with a successor this ones
aiming to fill the shoes of the
predecessor and then some so of course
I'm giving it a shot this is the
Logitech MX master so right off the bat
this is a pretty good-looking Mouse and
I kind of have a feeling that a sports
car designer or something was involved
with this design I mean first of all the
commercials
show a whole lot of sculpting and
chiseling of a model mouse and I don't
know if that happens with every other
Mouse but I do know that's exactly what
happens with a lot of sports cars and
the MX master looks I don't know kind of
sporty in a way it has a lot of the same
looks as the previous MX Mouse with the
right E shape and the big sloping curves
but the same time I've never seen a
mouse that looks quite like this with
the little rivets on the thumb rest and
the big arching spine it's actually a
great size and shape for someone with
big hands just like the performance MX
was but even if you don't have big hands
it puts your hand in a more ergonomic
resting position for better long-term
comfort and just you know people with
bigger hands require a bigger arch in
the mouse to make this happen which is
why the Magic Mouse is like the spawn of
Satan but yeah the MX master aside from
a few design tweaks is very similar to
the performance MX that came before it
here's what's noticeably different first
the back and forward buttons they're
pretty small and they're supposed to be
in a pretty comfortable position above
the thumb rest but they're just a little
too far back for me so I had to adjust
my hand a bit when I wanted to use them
which slowed me down still getting used
to that I would have liked to see them a
little bit further up next to that side
scrolling wheel and speaking of the side
scrolling wheel it's back from the MX
revolution of two generations ago and it
is awesome
I use it all the time it's nice and
smooth now it's a bit smaller and I
think it's easy to use you don't really
know
how useful horizontal scrolling is until
you don't have it anymore and I missed
it big-time
actually is it most well video editing
and moving through my timeline in
Premiere Pro and After Effects and stuff
like that so horizontal scrolling is
dope
on the bottom of the mouse you'll find
the third new thing which is the
connectivity so this is a Logitech mouse
so you can use the tiny Logitech
wireless receiver we've all seen if your
computer doesn't have bluetooth but the
mouse also has built-in Bluetooth 4.0 so
you'll have that choice my mac pro has
bluetooth so I just turned it on and it
connected within like five seconds no
problem and you'll see it has three
numbers on the back and a little button
that's because this mouse has a memory
and can live switch connecting between
three different devices at the same time
which can be really useful so I have
number one connected to my desktop
number two connects to my laptop and
number three is actually not occupied
yet so you can see it triggers the
pairing mode and it's blinking waiting
to add any third device but it's super
useful so I can see myself using this a
lot especially if you have a setup where
maybe you have two computers
side-by-side and you don't want to have
two mice on your desk or any other crazy
software solution to make that happen
now it's really useful you can use one
Mouse for multiple computers so yeah
other than that it's all in the software
with this guy the new Logitech option
software is the first thing you should
download when you get this mouse and
it's actually pretty good
so most Mouse software is not that
pretty doesn't work that well but I
don't mind this at all now this is where
you set up the horizontal scrolling
everything it also lets you turn that
thumb rest button yes that's a button
into a gesture pad so you can hold it
down and swipe into mac OS x gestures
and you can also adjust the smart
scrolling here so a logitech is kind of
famous for this where if you scroll the
mouse wheel fast enough it'll stop
clicking and just initiate this super
smooth fast scrolling mode until it
slows down enough to go back to clicking
again so you can toggle how fast it
needs to do that or just disable it
completely there's also a nice little
battery indicator in the software now
the battery in this mouse it's actually
sealed in which is a change from the
performance MX which had a removable
battery but i've had this thing for
about a week and haven't had to charge
it yet so i'm thinking it's probably
going to hold up to its claims of
several weeks of battery life with
normal use plus you can still plug it
into USB to charge it and continue using
it although i'm
kind of surprised it's not USB type-c so
overall Logitech is probably hoping this
MX master becomes the next legendary
Mouse that everyone eventually moves to
the next standard and well I'm already
on board and I know a bunch of other
people who make tech videos who are
already on board too so it's off to a
pretty good start I'd say it's worth the
$99 price tag on Amazon right now but I
say definitely check back at that link
in the description if you don't want to
buy it now check back in a couple of
months it'll probably start to drop like
the performance MX did so my mouse game
is strong again and hey maybe the
keyboard game is next thanks for
watching guys and onto some more
important long awaited reviews talk to
you guys the next one face</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
