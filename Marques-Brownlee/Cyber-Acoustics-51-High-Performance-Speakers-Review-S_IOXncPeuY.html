video review and today we have the cyber
acoustics CA 54 o2 6p speaker system
this is a high wattage premium speaker
system with 5.1 channel surround sound
that comes with a couple of awesome
accessories that you might want to also
check out these speakers retail for
around about $60 which is going to put
them in that range where you're going to
get the most bang for your buck taking a
little closer look at the system here
you can see that there are five
satellite speakers and one subwoofer and
all the satellite speakers are identical
so you can place them wherever you want
without worrying about which ones which
and they all have the same one-inch
driver in the middle you can see when
you buy the speaker system you're not
only going to get the speaker's
themselves but on the left here you can
see I have what's called the control pod
which I'll get into a little bit later
which allows for volume adjustment and
things like that and you're also going
to get an mp3 cradle to hold your mp3
player so if you have something like a
Zune HD or an iPod you can easily put it
in here and connected via an included
audio cable quite simply put the cyber
acoustic system is an elegant and
good-looking and very simple 5.1 channel
surround sound system that will probably
fit in your budget if you're looking for
a home media center PC some speakers to
go with that they can look at the
included control pod you'll get a mute
switch headphone out auxilary in a base
volume control and on the top a master
volume that switches from left to right
and actually glows when the speaker
system itself is on one thing I didn't
like about this control pod is that it
was a little bit light and can move
around on your desk in the slightest
movements the satellites themselves are
magnetically shielded and as you can see
here they are all the same identical
driver which is a one inch which will
give you really nice highs but the lids
might be a little bit washed out now
it's not to say these speakers won't be
good for music as a matter of fact they
are really good with the highs and
they're really good with the subwoofer
which gives a lot of kick now taking a
look at the form factor of the speakers
themselves here you can see that the
center channel speaker which is only one
of is actually a nice thin form factor
you can put it underneath a monitor or
behind something if you don't want it in
sight it's really small enough that it
won't make a big difference on your desk
now I can mentioned earlier the four
other satellites because I told you
about are
identical and they also have a nice
relatively thin form factor for what
they're what they're doing they have a
nice 1 inch driver and they can also be
placed on your desk pretty much anywhere
you want as they're pretty thin so you
can put it to the left and to the right
of two monitors or a single monitor and
you can put the other ones behind you
and they'll really be out of sight no
matter what you want to do with them
overall I got to say the form factor is
definitely my favorite thing about these
speakers all right now we've arrived at
the main attraction which i think is the
most important and most impressive part
of the speaker system and that's the
subwoofer which is 9.25 inches tall 6.25
inches wide and 7.5 inches deep and
produces some really rich deep bass and
I'm really impressed with the speaker
system subwoofer now I would have loved
to place in music for you guys to
demonstrate this but unfortunately it
would really just be a test of your own
speaker's YouTube's compression my video
editor and YouTube's copyright finding
so I'm not really going to get into that
either way looking at the back of the
subwoofer you're going to get all your
included cables but taking a look at the
ins and outs you have your input for the
front rear and center channel speakers
and as we scroll down a little bit here
you'll see the connection to the control
pod which plugs in then you get all your
outputs to all your different speakers
which all plug into the subwoofer and of
course your power switch also when we
zoom out here you'll see this high
quality subwoofer also has a humungous
air hole and that's where you're going
to get your kick it works best if you
put it up against a wall so if you have
it on your floor put it up close to a
wall so you can really feel the bass one
last thing that's worth noting about
these cyber acoustic speakers and also a
large number of other cyber acoustic
speakers they tend to do this is they
include an mp3 cable an mp3 cradle so
you can actually go ahead and plug in
your Zune HD or if you have an iPod or
iPhone you can use that too and this is
actually what I use to test the highs
mids and lows of these speakers overall
just to wrap it up I really like these
speakers if I have to give them a rating
from one to ten I'll give them a seven
and a half typically speaking the tip
the frequency response of these speakers
and any speaker system with the
subwoofer is much accentuated on the low
end and on the very high end so you're
not going to get that the best mids but
if you if you trust me on this the highs
are very crisp from five satellite
speakers and these are going to be
absolutely excellent for listening to
music
if that's all you do with your speakers
this has been mkbhd with a video review
of the cyber coup sticks 5.1 channel
surround sound system thanks for
watching and I'll talk to you guys in
the next one
