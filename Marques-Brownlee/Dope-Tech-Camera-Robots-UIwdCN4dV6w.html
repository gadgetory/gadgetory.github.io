and you've probably seen a Dali camera
move something like that or maybe you've
seen a sort of a slow pan an arcing shot
these are all pretty common what about
something more complicated for that
you're gonna need something a little
more dough
sup guys mkbhd here and welcome back to
dope tech for this one we flew out to
Portland Oregon home of motorized
precision to take a look at some robots
but not just any robots these are what I
would call cinema robots and as someone
that's into video at all
this is absolutely dope tech so like I
explained in the intro there are all
types of stabilizers and video tools and
things like that to help a human move a
camera in a certain way and actually in
most shots you can kind of tell what
type of device is being used like this
shot dolly cam this would be a Steadicam
this is clearly a slider and this is a
crane but you've probably seen some
crazy shots in a movie or in a music
video somewhere for a shot like this
the answer is Keira Keira has been
responsible for tons of shots and
commercials for tech products and car
videos etc and you might not even
noticed but those are the shots that
aren't CGI but that are super precise
and difficult that human could never
deal with any tools that exist now hence
the name motorized precision and then
the level of dope tech is actually
twofold here it's the hardware with the
actual robots and MP studio the software
to control what these robots do and they
can do a lot here's the rundown so the
cure of robot itself is fully metal
extends up to 9 feet tall has a couple
fully articulating axes and it can move
up to 9 feet per second in any direction
while carrying up to 40 pounds and on
the robot is controlled with an Xbox
controller which has enough buttons to
hit every axis so you get forward and
backward you get up and down pan left
and pan right tilt up and tilt down and
even roll clockwise or roll
counterclockwise and once you've set the
position you can move the robot through
space and time to other positions with
keyframes in the software NP studio and
on top of that if you're using a manual
lens which you probably are at this
point there's motorized gears which are
also part of the robot which can control
focus iris and zoom during the camera
move and on top of all of that if you're
shooting with a red camera
which is also connected to the robot not
only do you get a live preview of what
your pointed out and you have a remote
start/stop but you also get all your Red
Rock controls so you can change
resolution shutter speed compression
ratio white balance etc then you hit
record it starts rolling on the camera
and you run the Kirra and it plays
through the move you made at the speed
you picked and then like I said it can
go really slow and smooth or it can go
fast it might be hard to appreciate just
how fast three meters per second really
is but it's really fast you got it you
got to know exactly what you're doing
to keep it safe and then of course the
other upside of knowing exactly what
you're doing is all the shots you can
get with it the moves you can make are
almost literally endless so shout out to
Sean Brown the CEO of motorized
precision for showing me all this
showing me the ropes of the software and
giving some examples of what the robot
can do so really the only thing left to
do now is actually shoot with it
so that's what we did first up the orbit
shot so this is fun this is just a bunch
of keyframes highlighting different
parts from different angles of the same
subject and at every point the camera
stops and we made sure that keyframe
also had the subject perfectly in focus
and the end result just looks ridiculous
like you could see almost kind of like
this CGI the motion blur is just
dependent on the shutter speed we picked
but it's super real and then from behind
the scenes you can see all the hinges
working all the cables plugged into the
camera straight into the robot that's
talking to the computer pretty
incredible if you ask me next up we did
a bit more of a traditional like a phone
on a table shot which you've seen before
but with a twist check this one out
oh yeah okay so this one started off
slow like a normal slider shot like
you've seen before but then moved in
quick and focus on the camera of the
phone you can probably imagine doing
something like this with some motion
graphics or some tracked pointers in
there and again that shows off the
precision of the robot being able to
nail the focus instantly and you can't
forget this shot is also repeatable as
many times as you want so you can do it
multiple times with different phones
different items stack the clips mess
with opacity etc it's crazy but for me
the beauty of it is how close to the
table the whole rig gets without
touching it and there's no worries
because there's no shake or wobble at
all super precise
this one was pretty simple but still if
you saw it in a video you might have
your mind blown but it's up to the top
spinning around and then down on the
other side and I even think having more
time with it we'd be able to make this
all like one continuous move so you'd
float over the top of the laptop spin
around without stopping and then come
down on the other side but nevertheless
pretty sure that's next to impossible
without this robot and then next we
decided to do something a little bit
more difficult okay so that was sick but
the challenge here what really makes
this one more difficult is the fact that
I'm a human not a robot and it's
actually really hard for me to hold
myself on the phone in the exact same
spot for long enough that we can set up
all the keyframes and the robot can do
the move and get the phone in focus
every time so there's actually plenty of
takes that we didn't use that ended with
the phone being like a little bit out of
focus because I had moved but I think
getting this one right and made it that
much more impressive and then last but
not least we broke out a bit of a
different robot also made by motorized
precision this one's called Mia instead
of Kira it's a little bit lighter a
little bit smaller but still equally
impressive could probably fit something
like this in our studio wink-wink but
it's also now on a massive motorized
track system so we did a little a little
walking tracking shot so obviously that
one's equally awesome for the little bit
of time we had to play with it and set
it up you know matching my speed with
the walking of the robot sliding speed
and then stopping at just the right
place so it swings past my head instead
of through my head
obviously absolutely worth it so that's
it that's the beauty of motorized
precision robots that control and hold
cameras that can pull off low speed or
high speed moves precisely that
humans literally can obviously you can
take this thing to the next level if you
got like a slow-motion camera on there
like if you imagine a phantom flex on
this arm swinging around super fast the
shots you could get out of it are
absolutely incredible
and again if you can't underrate the
software NP studio there are older
iterations of this same sort of robot
control thing we literally have to put
in coordinates into an Excel spreadsheet
to get a robot to move like this so
obviously this is miles better generally
people don't buy these robots they get
rented for certain shoots like the
commercials and music videos we talked
about but uh let me know what would you
use a robot like this for so either way
that's been it take care you mind if we
do this outro together so we're just
gonna wave goodbye ready thanks for
watching guys
talk to you next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
