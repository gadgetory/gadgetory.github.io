is do we just pass 20 really last one
was yeah us one was 20 so it's 21 on
point hey what is up guys I'm Kim PhD
here and welcome to ask mkbhd inversion
21 just turned the mic on hey what's up
guys i'm kim Bhd here and welcome to ask
MTB HD version 21 we've done one every
month of this year so far this is number
10 of the 12 for 2017 it's October I
reached out on Twitter ask you guys what
you wanted to know and these are your
best questions that's on the D
monetization situation and how has it
affected you so I think I've touched on
this before but I've been almost
completely unaffected by the D
monetization problems that a lot of
youtubers have been having in the past
year or two but just because it's not
happening to me doesn't mean it's not
happening and just because it's
happening to some other people doesn't
mean it's happening to everyone a couple
days ago Casey nice that made a great
video kind of outlining the entire
situation about the communication from
the YouTube team and the relationship
between YouTube itself and the community
and the problems people have been having
it's worth a watch I agree with a lot of
what he says in that video but the main
thing to get out of that is that the the
biggest problem we have is there's not a
lot of communication between YouTube and
us youtubers about what those problems
are and a lot of what Casey talks about
in his video is about the value of
youtubers to YouTube about how we will
leave at the drop of a hat and go
somewhere else if there's a bigger
audience or a better monetization
solution but I think the problem is
YouTube is the biggest audience has been
for years and will be for a long time so
actually don't see youtubers leaving
YouTube anytime soon no matter how bad
this monetization situation gets because
it's still the biggest audience so
anyway I have a lot of thoughts about
that but essentially I've been
unaffected I'm just keeping my ear to
the ground and keeping a finger on the
pulse and trying to figure out what
other people think - which dual camera
setup do you prefer most one with a
secondary monochrome or one with the
telephoto lens between those two I would
definitely pick the telephoto lens or
just any additional focal length over
the monochrome sensor I've tested a
couple phones that have the second
monochrome camera to add detail and
enhance the photos but a lot of times
those aren't good cameras in the first
place so it doesn't really make much of
a difference to me so I'll take that v30
with the wide-angle camera I'll take the
iPhone or the note or whatever with the
second portrait camera that's cool I
also really appreciate the way Google's
done it and I'll talk about it in the
full review with a single camera for
portrait mode but that's not a story
if you reach down what would you rather
have in your pocket red or iPhone 10
well I do have two pockets so if I reach
down and I mean what why not both at
this point one of the speakers on the
bottom of the iPhone 7 + + a + doesn't
actually work could Apple have put a
headphone jack there instead listen the
headphone jack is dead headphone jacks
not coming back we just kind of have to
embrace it and move on quickly seriously
i've definitely mentioned it before yes
we're in that like awkward stage
in-between everyone having headphone
jacks and nobody needing them because
Wireless is so good but to keep wishing
for it to come back is definitely not a
productive exercise just gonna have to
move along any updates on your
professional Ultimate Frisbee career
what teams are you playing for and where
can we see your games so it's all
offseason right now it's about to be
winter the professional Ultimate Frisbee
season is generally during the summer
and when the summer rolls around I of
course I always tweet where you can see
our games when you can see our games
that's the best place to find that but
right now it's offseason it's more of
like College ultimate and Club ultimate
and just other fun stuff
LA Clippers wins set at 42 and a half
over/under hmm I'm gonna go with over
yeah you know what I'm off to mystic I'm
gonna go with the over on this one but I
have to mention I will be watching
Rockets games also now because I'm Chris
Paul
that's the original reason I became a
Clippers fan now he's a Houston rocket
now I'm watching Houston Rockets games
what do you think of the soon-to-be
announced razor phone so you know what
if red can make a smart phone then I
guess it's anyone's ballgame razor
bought next bit now they're aiming to
make a smart phone and we'll probably be
seeing that pretty soon I'm excited for
that too obviously next bit has a little
bit of a history but we may or may not
see bits of that in the new razor phone
but razor is is a gaming peripheral and
gaming device maker right now so I kind
of expect to see a lot of cues from that
sort of stuff in the new smartphone plus
combined with maybe some of the next
bits past it'll be interesting to see
I'll definitely try to cover that when
it comes out ZTE axon my do you hate it
it's kind of a cool concept so yeah I
treated about this the other day that
ZTE axon M has come out it's a foldable
smartphone but not really it's more of a
dual screen phone with a hinge in the
middle that just kind of unfolds like
that I agree it's it's a cool concept
key word being concept but the actual
execution when you look at the final
result just doesn't look good at all now
I can appreciate trying to one-up
Samsung where you kind of you have a
feeling they're gonna do some sort of a
foldable display in the near future so
you try to be first to that this just
isn't good for anything other than maybe
splitting a movie across two screens it
doesn't do all that much that's useful
I see the demo videos I'll link one
below mr. mobile did a great one the
verge did a great one you can mirror the
display across both screens you can
extend the screen across both screens
but no matter how you use it it's just
weird having a big bezel in the middle
of your display so is a cool concept yes
but if I told you the price tag you'd
probably agree with me that it just
doesn't seem like a good product did you
upgrade to the new monstro 8k
VistaVision
so look no I haven't gotten it yet but
it's pretty likely that I will end up
making that move pretty soon but those
of you who don't know the biggest
difference between the new monstro 8k
sensor and the current helium super 35
sensor besides the cheesy new name is
the size of it the super 35 sensor is
smaller than full frame and the
VistaVision 8k sensor is a full-frame
size sensor that has a lot of
implications as far as what
you can use the type of a look you get
with your video and your bokeh and the
type of flexibility you get and you're
having a much wider angle lens in a
smaller area it's actually useful for
those hands-on areas I could name a ton
of reasons why I'm excited for the
upgrade right now but long story short
yes that's probably gonna happen
what's your go-to everyday object to use
as a weapon in a self-defense situation
that makes it seem like I have like an
answer already like a go-to would it be
cheating to say the weapon just because
it's already a weapon you can hurt
somebody with this it's mostly metal and
it's got sharp edges and it has a handle
yep that'll do it go to me laughter a
game of ultimate that's easy Chipotle
for sure can you solve a Rubik's Cube oh
I don't have one but I I can solve one
face of a Rubik's Cube
I have those algorithms memorized and I
can get the first row around the face
and then I don't know any of the rest
whose vision of the future will win
Google or Apple both are focusing on
different things Google is software
versus Apple hardware that's an
interesting question I kind of think you
have to have both
obviously there's advantages with going
with either way apples ecosystem built
around their super premium hardware is
amazing but on the other end of things
like Google being able to improve things
on the fly and add features and have
essentially a modular experience with
their software also has huge advantages
but it's nothing without the hardware
and vice-versa so you kind of have to
have both and I think both are realizing
that and trying to build that way Apple
is trying to build up their ecosystem to
compete with Google's massive ecosystem
of products and Google's trying to build
their own hardware build their own
phones like the pixel to compete with
Apple's ecosystem at hardware where do
you find your awesome glitch funk
electro intro songs seriously I'm in
love with that genre well thank you I
don't really have like one source I
always go to for music but I can tell
you that in the past couple videos the
intros you've been hearing are

entire thing but I'm giving you these
little sneak peeks and they're releasing
a new track from that every Wednesday
they can just click the link it's
expanding and playlist it's amazing hey
I'm gonna enter right there thank you
for tuning in to this quick episode of
your questions and answers' has been fun
but I'm gonna get right back to this
review video I'm making and then a whole
bunch of other stuff coming up for
October
in November it's just that time of year
there's a lot of new products either way
