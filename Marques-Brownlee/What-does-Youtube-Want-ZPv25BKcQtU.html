what I'm going to be showing you exactly
what YouTube wants from the people that
upload their videos to their will
popular website so what I'm going to do
is just hit my YouTube button it will
take me to youtube.com and pardon my
slow internet connection here I'm using
a few of my Mac's downloading programs
right now for reviews so I'm just going
to go to youtube.com and if you go hit
the upload button right here you'll
notice there's a little new little tab
here that says capture your videos in HD
they're trying to give you tips about
how to upload your videos so if you
click on that more information button
here's the whole Help Center on how to
optimize how to optimize your videos so
that they are perfect for YouTube so
this is a summary of the audio and video
specs you need for the best results on
YouTube for further details you just
look below so we're going to look below
and right back we see a recommended
resolution for your video which is 1280
by 720 that happens to be the HD
resolution in youtube if you can't avoid
it then you may you can float in 640 by
480 which will get you that little high
quality link and but it won't be in 16
by 9 and will be in widescreen so you'll
have little black bars on the left and
right of your view now the one I'm
uploading right now that you're watching
is 1280 by 720 so you can see how hopes
so actually you can see that this is um
this is high-definition content that
you're watching also they recommend a
bitrate and frame rate and here's a
recommended codec this is my personal
favorite
h.264 but there are plenty of other
codecs you can use so I wouldn't worry
about your audio I'm using a two channel
audio um sorry I'm using two channel
audio because I have two microphones
that are hooked up so listen to this um
audio from both channels alright so that
is the other part of it second when you
scroll down you will see that they're
telling you originals please this is
basic basically how to get t2 quality
out of your
use when you're actually so I want to
scroll that you that when you first take
a video and upload it to YouTube you're
going to see when you if recorded in
sixteen by nine in 1280 by 720
resolution then you're going to get that
full YouTube the screen that you're
looking at right now the widescreen
YouTube format and if you've taken the
video in four by three aspect ratio then
should only have a black bar on either
side of the video it shouldn't be both
sides of the video and the top and the
bottom so here it shouldn't be
completely messed up so if you've if
you've actually made a sixteen by nine
resolution and YouTube plays it in four
by three you do not want this because
then like so you've encoded it in four
by three then you have black bars at
their gray bars at the top and the
bottom of the video and then in YouTube
there will be black bars at the left on
the right so this is not what YouTube
wants frame rates are generally not that
important this is 24 to 25 frames per
second yields the best results for
YouTube so that's what I'm going to
recommend right now and resolution like
I said 1280 by 720 is HD and I also do
other other YouTube resolutions that
work just well especially when recording
your screen like I am now so that's
basically um there is no facility to
re-upload video so it's important that
you test everything before you release
it to YouTube so I'm just going to you
know every time you upload a video and
do your editing just walk through the
entire time and make sure it all works
out so I hope that I'm answering your
questions about what YouTube actually
wants in their videos and that's about
it
thanks for watching peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
