this is the samsung galaxy s7 edge so
the reviews are out and more are coming
but it's pretty clear that this is one
of the best phones out right now pretty
much everyone is positive about it it's
an improvement in almost every way over
last year's already pretty great galaxy
s6 you get updated specs a bigger
battery a better camera added expandable
storage and it's also now waterproof so
on a phone is this good it's pretty hard
to go wrong with picking one up but at
the same time the tiny little things
stand out the not so amazing things
about this otherwise amazing phone or
its biggest flaws so not to rain on
Samsung's parade or anything but I've
been using this phone for a hot minute
and I also saw this post I really liked
on droid life I will link that below so
you guys can check it out but these are
the biggest flaws with what's probably
the best phone out right now all right
so first of all the fingerprints this is
definitely in a tie with some of
Samsung's other smartphones for the
smudge East fingerprint East most
reflective slipperiest phone ever and
even though this is a bit thicker and
more well rounded and better feeling in
the hand there's no doubt I'm going to
be putting a skin on the sky before I
drop it and I mentioned the smaller
camera hump in the first impressions
video it is definitely much smaller it's
in the middle of the phone too so that's
nice but with the s7 edge the display is
so wide around the edges of the phone
that letters on the keyboard actually do
go all the way to the very edge so it
still rocks a little bit if you're one
of those people who type with their
phone on the table and depending on the
table it'll probably slide everywhere
too but that's really super nitpicking
this phone is awesome in the hardware
department most of the drawbacks for the
galaxy s7 will come with software first
of all I thought Andrea had established
this for a while now Samsung
multitasking button on the right back
button on the left and home in the
middle not just Nexus devices but pretty
much everyone is on board with that LG
with the on screen buttons everyone else
with the hardware buttons what is this
Samsung this is backwards back is always
on the left
why do you keep doing this another thing
is the app drawer when you first get
this phone that's pretty much out of any
sort of order the apps and folders are
just kind of in there in no particular
order and then when you add apps they
all just go to the end of the list to
your last page little odd but whatever
so you can alphabetize the app drawer if
you want by hitting the A to Z button if
soul doesn't take the apps out of the
folders or anything so you kind of have
to know they're there but at least it
brings a little order right
but even after doing that if you install
a new app it doesn't go to its place in
alphabetical order it just goes right
back to the end of the last page again
why Samsung and then there's the
TouchWiz bloat and it was not called
TouchWiz anymore but I won't even go
into the aesthetics of it you know you
either like bright saturated colors or
you don't and there's definitely some
useful features this time around
especially on the s7 edge but when you
have to email apps and to photos apps
and several music apps and just a whole
bunch of redundant competing samsung
apps out of the box plus if you get the
Verizon version even more redundant
Verizon apps if you get that it's part
annoying part confusing but it just gets
me thinking even more if Android plans
on getting rid of the precious app
drawer anytime soon this will be even
more of a huge pain so there you have it
on paper kind of looks like a list of
reasons not to buy this phone but it's
really not it's just a highlight of how
good these phones are getting and looks
like the tiny flaws are standing out so
much because of how good this is that
being said you might be surprised to
hear I really like this phone like I
really do and you'll be able to hear a
lot more of that and why I like it in
the full review video which is coming up
so definitely subscribe to see that if
you haven't already and that's where
you'll hear all the stuff about the user
experience mixed in with the pros and
the cons so that's been it thanks for
watching this one I'll talk to guys the
next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
