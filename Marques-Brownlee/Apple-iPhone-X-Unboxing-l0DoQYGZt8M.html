guys I'm Kip EHD here and this is the
one we've been waiting for this is the
one I told you to skip iPhone 8 for this
is the one that represents the future of
Apple smartphones this is iPhone 10 and
while it doesn't say X anywhere on the
front of the box people are pretty much
always going to call this one the X I've
just accepted that so this is your first
look at the unboxing experience and
spoiler it's pretty much exactly the
same as iPhone 8 was and almost every
other iPhone headphones adapter stickers
that's all in the box but I guess it's a
good thing there's no surprises here so
you can see right here off the bat it's
a really shiny chrome II reflective
phone this is the silver one and you can
see how shiny the sides are the Space
Gray one though is a bit more toned down
and so the only thing that was actually
new during the setup of iPhone 10 is now
you set up face ID during first boot
instead of the fingerprint touch ID but
yeah this is brand new and it's been a
couple weeks since we last saw this
phone at that Apple event so seeing it
again for the second time is kind of a
reminder of all the things that are new
about this thing obviously the biggest
difference is the display up front the
5.8 inch OLED corner-to-corner screen
that fits in a footprint smaller than
the iPhone 8 plus which has a smaller
screen so naturally pretty much all the
focus is going to be on that and the
notch at the top and how apps handle it
etc and I can tell you that aside from
all the incompatible apps I've come
across that are going to have to get
updated my experience with the display
panel itself have been pretty decent so
far it's bright its contrast II well
calibrated definitely not oversaturated
like some old LEDs can be and just
handling and playing with this phone in
the studio here for the first time it's
answered some immediate questions that I
had about it from the last video so
first of all since there's no home
button obviously you have that swipe up
gesture to go home but we were wondering
how do you take a screenshot that is
power and volume up so that's the new
screenshot combo for iPhone 10 and then
since holding the power button now goes
to Siri how do you turn the phone off
well it's gonna be long pressing the
power button and volume up key and
that'll get you to see that power off
menu so those are two new key combos to
memorize there and then of course I was
reminded of how many gestures they're
hard now to memorize obviously when you
get rid of a button there's a whole
bunch of swiping and gestures to replace
it so there's a multitasking and app
switching motions which are pretty
similar but both kind of useful in their
own way depending on how you use the
phone really that's on top of a screen
shot and power off combos plus long
holding the power button for Siri and
double pressing it for Apple pay but
basically there's a lot going on and if
you're gonna make a phone that's all
screen obviously you have to be able to
do it all without a lot of buttons
anyway one of the biggest differences
between iPhone 8 and iPhone 10 is the
new front facing camera suite up at the
top in that notch the IR blaster the
depth sensor etc and all that enables a
couple of new things with this phone
number one is obviously face ID the
setup like you saw was pretty quick and
painless and it's been working pretty
well since then for unlocking my phone
and I've only really had this phone for
a day like the rest of press but so far
in this time it's been fine and it works
as advertised as far as being smart and
not easily spoofed you can see the
little lock under the time when the
phone is locked and basically instead of
placing your fingerprint the phone will
not unlock until you look at the phone
like you did during the setup process
and then once you do it's pretty quick
to unlock you can see the little thing
open and then you can swipe up to open
your phone and sure enough it doesn't
work with a picture of you it doesn't
work when you're looking away it doesn't
work when your eyes are closed it just
basically waits until it sees what it
saw during that set up process and it's
good to go so no you your girl can't
unlock your phone while you're asleep
with your eyes closed for those of you
who are wondering that I do have some
further thoughts on this face ID versus
touch ID though so stay tuned for that
in an upcoming video and I do want to
see if I can pull it with identical
twins maybe just out of curiosity anyway
with the new notch you also get a new
front facing camera complete with selfie
portrait mode messing around with it it
seems pretty average interestingly
enough that pixel 2 that I've been
testing seemed way more like confident
with the front facing camera portraits
than the iPhone 10 now there's no doubt
both of these will get better with time
and software updates but just from
turning on portrait mode switching the
front-facing camera and snapping a
picture these are the types of results
you're gonna get
there's a pretty big difference between
the two if you ask me especially if
you're looking at edges and hair and
things like that and sometimes the
iPhone just didn't want to blur the
background at all just got really picky
about the lighting but that's something
again we'll be testing a lot more for
the full review of this phone oh yeah
and the new front facing camera suite
will get you and emojis so yeah you can
see in these an emoji is the physics of
things moving around is actually pretty
on point so if you're into it you can
you can map your face to a cartoon
animal head and send it to someone in
iMessage but you still can't edit tweets
though so overall there's a lot to test
with the iPhone 10 now that I have it in
my hands finally as a matter of fact
definitely leave your thoughts right
below that like button with things you
want to see in the full review most
likely things like battery life camera
quality app performance all that good
stuff but don't let me miss anything
but until then definitely get subscribed
for the upcoming videos on the channel
thanks for watching
yeah I'll talk to you guys the next one
peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
