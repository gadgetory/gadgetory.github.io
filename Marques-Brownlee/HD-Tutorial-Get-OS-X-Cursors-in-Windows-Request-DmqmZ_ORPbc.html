and it may not have worked the first
time but here's an alternate way of
doing it when you have Safari open and
you go to your downloads window like
we're before and open the containing
folder you will have the Mac os10 cursor
this is where you double click on it you
know extract all files and first you
have to extract all files and browse to
a place that you know so I saved it to
my user name program documents and then
as 10 cursors so I'm gonna do is ease it
out here and first of all I'm going to
find where I extracted it to so I
extracted it to computer here no I
extracted it to sorry you go to my
username and my documents I can find
these things and program documents so
here's the actual folder I'm gonna
memorize this and what I'm going to do
is go into my computer go into your
local disk level click on Windows and
find cursors double click on this
cursors files folder and then you're
going to go to where you save this right
click and cut and then into here and
right click and paste the macro tank
cursors folder you don't have to extract
every single one and put it in Julie
like this just put the folder in here if
I watch a double click on the folder all
those files will be there and that is
another way to get them to show up in
the control panel Mouse menu if I open
control panel now and I go down to Mouse
or go to control panel home then go to
Mouse angular pointers the OS 10 cursor
should be there for you so I hope that
helps you know those questions go ahead
and subscribe and go ahead and post a
video response or comment or something
like he did and you'll get your answer
so
I hope that helps it thanks for watching
peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
