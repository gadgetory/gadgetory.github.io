mkbhd channel back another HD video
review they're going to be taking a look
at a signal lens for a canon eos mount
and this is the sigma 30 millimeter f1
point for a really logical and very nice
upgrade to the current lens I'm actually
using on the tty right now which is a 50
millimeter f1 point eight so this gives
you a slightly wider angle which is
better more versatile for use indoors
and gives you a couple stops of extra
light at F 1.4 so without any further
ado let's get to take a look at the
sample footage and a look at the lens
itself
so one thing I really like about this
Sigma lens is the accessories it comes
with you can see here it comes with a
pretty nice carrying case that you
usually have to get an L lens version of
a Canon lens to get along with a lens
hood which you also have to get an L
lens to get Canon doesn't give you these
and of course you also get these sigma
30 millimeter lens in the time that I've
had this lens it's quickly become one of
my favorites at 30 millimetres the focal
length is just right for crop sensor
cameras because that gives an equivalent
of about 48 millimeters on the tty and
that's much more workable indoors and
the F 2.8 aperture is really really nice
especially for low light low ISO shots
which I'll show you later basically the
most important difference between this
and the canon 28 millimeter F one point
eight is that F 1.4 aperture wide open
this lens takes in a ton of light and
you can get a good look at that right
here it's an absolutely beautiful piece
of glass not only is this glass really
high quality but the outside of the lens
is rubberized and of really high quality
too so the time I've had this lens I
feel like I've spent me money well and I
won't really have any problems with the
breaking so without any further ado
let's introduce the star of the show and
take a look at the test footage from the
1.8 aperture
