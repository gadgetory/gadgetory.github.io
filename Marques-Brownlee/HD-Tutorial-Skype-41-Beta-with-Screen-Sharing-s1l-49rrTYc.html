here from mkbhd and i am back with
another software video this one a
tutorial about how to download the
latest version of skype 4.1 beta now you
may or may not know um that I do have a
skype ID and I do often take out calls
and most of the time chats from Maya
subscribers who have you know quick
little brief questions to ask this is
actually a new idea because I was
considering going a going live over the
summer doing a few youth streams or blog
TVs depending on who tells me what to do
more on Twitter but I was considering
doing a few blog TVs taking live Skype
calls really getting getting my name out
there onto YouTube on to Twitter etc so
i'm going to show you guys everyone
who's watching us now how to watch or
how to download the latest version of
skype 4.1 beta for windows and basically
you're going to have to do is visit this
link up here skype calm and all this
this will be in the description you can
just control click it and open in a new
tab and it says you can you can
test-drive the latest version for
Windows and I will go ahead and hit that
download now button and we'll go through
the installation process quickly first
of all this will work whether or not you
are already running a version of skype
or you don't have it yet so go ahead and
hit the Run button if you're using
Firefox hit the open button and we're
going to hit the Run button again
because we do trust this trust this
retailer so now we're going to exit out
of our web browser because we really
don't need it anymore we're actually
going to go through the installation
process right here hit the I agree
install button and basically I'm just
going to tell you a little bit about
skype if you don't already know it's a
free pc to pc calling client if you will
if you download it you can obviously if
you have a webcam and a microphone you
can basically do face-to-face chats you
can do calling if you actually pay for a
skype plan you can call landlines and
cell phones as well and it's fairly good
rates you pretty much get to call
anywhere you want in the world and it's
pretty cool so i'm going to wait for the
skype for point
one invaded to install now right now I'm
currently running skype four-point-oh
beta so this is simply updating my
version of skype you'll keep all your
contacts on all that kind of stuff etc
so I'm going to pause this video and
come back once skype is done installing
be right back alright guys this is what
it looks like when you finish installing
the latest version of skype it'll
actually open up the Skype welcome
screen and sign you in if you're already
there so obviously I haven't signed in a
little bit so there's people trying to
contact me but basically it says welcome
to skype get a minute take a minute to
set up your microphone add your contacts
and all that but I actually still I can
exit out of this because I have all my
contacts and they're all in skype now I
don't actually need to show you guys
their names but that's how you do it you
have the latest version of skype already
downloaded and installed know need to
know need to do any further steps you
can now go on and use it use the new
features I heard there's some new screen
sharing features involved I will
definitely do a full overview video if
you guys like of the newest version of
skype but overall that is it and thanks
for watching this video and I hope you
enjoyed this tutorial so thanks for
watching guys peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
