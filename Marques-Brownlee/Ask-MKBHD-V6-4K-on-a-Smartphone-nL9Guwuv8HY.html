I'm not using my main camera right now
my main camera is away from me for this
entire week while it's being sent in to
upgrade so I'm gonna get that back next
week and a whole bunch of videos are due
for when I get the camera back but I
wasn't gonna let that stop me from
making a video so this is a quick ask me
video I asked a bunch of questions as I
usually do on Twitter we got some good
ones will answer it not the main camera
but still crispy anyway a friend and I
are thinking about starting a tech
channel what are your recommendations
for us good no but seriously the best
way to get into something especially if
you're just getting started is to just
dive in headfirst a lot of people worry
too much about like the equipment or the
production quality that you want to
achieve with the very first videos you
make but honestly the first videos of
pretty much any channel if you look
backwards including mine are like
terrible so don't worry about the
equipment you have to start with just
use a smartphone or whatever you have
just do it are you on snapchat and if
you are what's a username yes I am and
the username is mkbhd so creative have
you ever strived to make something
better on your channel because of
someone trolling you about something in
your work maybe not trolling but I
definitely pay attention to the
constructive criticism that I get which
is a benefit of having people who
actually watch the videos I make a lot
of people have this like mentality of
like I'll just ignore the haters they're
just hating for no reason
but a lot of times there's a little
nugget of truth in what you might think
is just hate and that actually could be
the best criticism or feedback you can
get to make stuff better so again maybe
not trolling making this stuff better
but a lot of your comments affect the
next video I make what are you most
excited to see it Apple's event so I
will be there I'm actually flying out to
the event the day after I upload this
video and a lot of the stuff we're
expecting to see at the event is like
it's already been leaked so a new Apple
TV we may see a new iPad pro the larger
display and of course we're definitely
expecting to see the announcement of the
new smartphones so the iPhone 6s and the
iPhone 6s plus if that's what they keep
naming it and I'm excited to see the new
cameras in these of course the design of
the S series always tends to be the same
as the previous so upgrade
eternals exciting but I really want to
see how good the new cameras are what
are your feelings on the new Google logo
you know what actually liked it I think
it's pretty clean
pretty simple obviously to the casual
viewer it just looks like the same exact
text in a different font and that's fine
what's funny is actually Verizon redid
their logo like a couple of days later
I'm sure they were developing it and
spending millions on it at the same time
but it's also a pretty simple clean
redesign with the smaller checkmark and
I think it's fine I like them that
doesn't mean Verizon that does not mean
that I want to see it on any home
buttons anytime soon I'm just saying I
appreciate a crisp clean logo explain
the sport you play all right so Ultimate
Frisbee is a team sport it's sort of a
combination of like soccer basketball
maybe football and a bunch of other
stuff
so there are seven on the field for each
team at a time you can throw off like
football sort of like a football kickoff
and then as you play you pass it down
the field to each other until you score
in the endzone you can run around freely
during the point but once you catch the
disc then you have to stop you're not
allowed to run with it that's a travel
like basketball but you can move and
pivot until you throw and then you can
start running again you have ten seconds
with the disc before you have to get rid
of it or else it's a turnover at a high
level these turnovers are a big deal
which is why you'll see players go up
and over and around and fly everywhere
to avoid turning it over which makes it
an awesome sport to watch to play and
something that could be pretty dope in
the Olympics why does the 1+2 not have
NFC all right so the official reason
given by one plus is that people didn't
use NFC in the 1+1 so they just didn't
include it I mentioned in my full review
video of the oneplus 2 that I think that
could have been included anyway maybe it
would have cost 10 extra dollars on the
Bill of Materials to eventually have
that in the final price but I think one
plus as much as they don't like to admit
it is very focused on cost-cutting and I
wanted to get that magical sub $400
price so they decided not to include NFC
and it's also not able to be retrofitted
later so that's why it doesn't have it
what's your most favorite game of all
time I almost said NBA 2k but it's
actually Need for Speed Most Wanted that
game on PC I made one or two gaming
videos like ever on my channel and one
of
was just me playing that game it was
like in the middle of high school that
was one of the most fun games who ever
played I think it's the best Need for
Speed game ever made and it was a lot of
fun Need for Speed Most Wanted why
haven't you become a member of vessel
and will you in the future so vessel for
those who don't know is a platform for
content creators mostly youtubers to
host their content exclusively for a
while before they put it on YouTube and
they have it behind a paywall on vessel
so they can be rewarded for that I don't
really have a reason to do that with my
videos I think most of them actually
benefit from going directly to everyone
for free and I also benefit a lot from
you guys commenting on the videos
immediately so it wouldn't really make
sense for me I don't think I'm going to
do that anytime soon what would a
smartphone look like if it were designed
for a t-rex so will probably like fit
around their chest and would have like a
support where it would be like two
buttons on either side for their claws
probably and like I don't know it would
probably be a pressure-sensitive screen
the Nokia 3310 recently had its
anniversary what passed piece of tech
gives you the most nostalgic feeling I
have two answers for this number one the
original Motorola Droid that was a phone
that I waited a long time to get when it
first came out the commercials for it
since I want Verizon really tempting and
when I finally got it I was pumped and I
made several videos about it and the
other thing number two fun fact the the
first piece of tech that I ever really
got that I bought with my own money was
the first generation iPod Touch and this
is before I had a YouTube channel I
wanted to unbox it I was going to go
through and set it up and customize and
also two ways jailbreak it and then the
next day at school it got stolen so that
never happened that I didn't yeah not
that's not really a fun fact
why hasn't Apple implemented
touchscreens and all their Macs honestly
it's mostly because Mac OS 10 is not
finger friendly it's not touchscreen
built
that's why iPads all run iOS and not Mac
OS 10 and honestly if you think about it
if you think of like an iMac right now
if it was touchscreen enabled you just
have this big glossy fingerprint covered
wobbly screen on a hinge I just feel
like I wouldn't be comfortable to type
on or use anyway so I don't know
expect that anytime soon what are your
thoughts on the Xperia z5 premium
alright so just to get it out the way I
know that it's been a while since I've
made a video about a Sony smartphone but
this is going to be the one to change
that for sure
the Sony Xperia z5 has three variants
the compact the regular z5 and the z5
premium and the premium if you haven't
heard has a bunch of new things about it
new materials and new back and new
camera but it also has a 4k display I
called it I said later like in this year
we would see a 4k display on a smart
phone and we're seeing it already yeah I
want to see it and I can't wait to get
my hands on it I want to review it I
want to compare it to other quad HD
displays and also to other stuff so yeah
sony if you're listening to this
when is your setup to our 2015 right so
there's always a lot of questions about
one's the next setup tour happening I
usually say that the next set of tour
will happen when there's a new setup so
this setup is the same as it was in the
last setup tour but when I do move or
when I change places like I've said I
would previously that is when I'm going
to be making a new set of tour videos so
that's that are you worried about OKC
taking out your Clippers next season you
know what I'm honestly not and the thing
is I realized that Oklahoma City is
going to have a healthy Russell
Westbrook and a healthy Kevin Durant for
this upcoming season and that's one of
the hardest hitting one-two punches in
basketball but the reason why the
Clippers were basically doomed to
failure at some point last season is
because they weren't deep they had a
great starting five but then their bench
tapered off really quickly and I see the
same problem for Oklahoma City their
starting five is going to be great but
the Clippers have a massive bench now
this year they built up and in a plus
off season I would say I think this is
the year if any for the Clippers to at
least go to the finals what drove you to
get into the whole YouTube thing well
for me I've always been in the tech
basically as long as I can remember and
the other thing is I have this memory of
like running around the house with a
camcorder this is a long time ago with
like a camcorder taking random videos of
things and then watching back the videos
that I made and just being like damn
that's cool that I could like see what I
just made even though it was a tape
recorder and I couldn't edit it or
anything but I've always been into video
for that reason too so video tech tech
video YouTube tech channel which is kind
of worked out do you miss having a face
you know I didn't think we were going to
talk about this man</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
