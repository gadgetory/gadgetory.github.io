season and I don't think there is a
better way to get into it then with a
giveaway hey what's up guys I'm KB HD
here and welcome to the $600
custom-built PC giveaway not this one
but we'll get to that in a second so for
this I'm partnering up with Austin from
Duncan 3 through 303 as you probably
already know him to give away a $600
Windows build that's built in a case not
like this but very cool looking you've
probably heard of it it's a case from
BitFenix and it's pretty awesome looking
and he's doing a series right now on how
to actually build this PC so he's picked
out all the parts the budget is laid
together and you can view the link down
below in the description he's doing the
whole series on how to build the whole
thing but we're giving one away all you
need to do to enter in order to win this
one PC here is to be subscribed to both
of our channels so that link will be
down below the like button on this video
or in these two annotations right here
and all you have to do to enter to get
an entry is to leave a comment down
below this video and if you want another
one
you can go leave a comment on his video
you can get a maximum of two entries it
doesn't really matter how many comments
you leave here because you're only gonna
get one you get your name into the pool
once and if you leave a comment on his
video you get your name into that pool
too this turns out to be a pretty nice
guy you Windows 8 build and I've
actually started getting some windows 8
experience myself and I kind of like it
from what I've tried I didn't I wasn't
really into the Metro thing at first but
it looks pretty nice so this would
definitely make a sweet holiday gift

a good sign and you're gonna want to
stay tuned because we're gonna
announcing that on Twitter so the links

random drawing for one winner of this PC

need to do to get entered I will be
building a build in this case right here

design r4 it's pretty much a boss and I
will be building a building this during
the winter break so the cupping coming

this if you guys are up to it so
