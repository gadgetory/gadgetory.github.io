season and I don't think there is a
better way to get into it then with a
giveaway hey what's up guys I'm KB HD
here and welcome to the $600
custom-built PC giveaway not this one
but we'll get to that in a second so for
this I'm partnering up with Austin from
Duncan 3 through 303 as you probably
already know him to give away a $600
Windows build that's built in a case not
like this but very cool looking you've
probably heard of it it's a case from
BitFenix and it's pretty awesome looking
and he's doing a series right now on how
to actually build this PC so he's picked
out all the parts the budget is laid
together and you can view the link down
below in the description he's doing the
whole series on how to build the whole
thing but we're giving one away all you
need to do to enter in order to win this
one PC here is to be subscribed to both
of our channels so that link will be
down below the like button on this video
or in these two annotations right here
and all you have to do to enter to get
an entry is to leave a comment down
below this video and if you want another
one
you can go leave a comment on his video
you can get a maximum of two entries it
doesn't really matter how many comments
you leave here because you're only gonna
get one you get your name into the pool
once and if you leave a comment on his
video you get your name into that pool
too this turns out to be a pretty nice
guy you Windows 8 build and I've
actually started getting some windows 8
experience myself and I kind of like it
from what I've tried I didn't I wasn't
really into the Metro thing at first but
it looks pretty nice so this would
definitely make a sweet holiday gift
speaking of holiday gifts this giveaway
ends in exactly two weeks from today
which is Christmas so that's definitely
a good sign and you're gonna want to
stay tuned because we're gonna
announcing that on Twitter so the links
down below the like button on this video
will also lead you to Twitter and you'll
be able to follow us there for updates
on this should be pretty simple just a
random drawing for one winner of this PC
other than that that's it that's all you
need to do to get entered I will be
building a build in this case right here
if you want to know this is the fractal
design r4 it's pretty much a boss and I
will be building a building this during
the winter break so the cupping coming
weeks I'll be picking out parts with you
guys on Twitter on Facebook on Google+
and we might make a hackintosh out of
this if you guys are up to it so
definitely let me know on Twitter and
we'll be building some stuff in here
very shortly either way that's basically
it thanks for watching just a quick
video get you guys something for the
holiday season giving back
and we'll talk to you guys in the next
one which should be yet another collab
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
