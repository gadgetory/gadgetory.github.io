this is the Google Nexus 4 and it's
finally here shipping out in waves from
the Google Play Store as the successor
to the Samsung Galaxy Nexus so Google
partnered with LG to make this device
and on the outside it's pretty easy to
see how the LG Nexus 4 came to be the
next Nexus it looks pretty similar on
the front to the last one both have
similar curvature similar sensor
placement up top and no ugly branding or
any logos elsewhere on the phone both
have little chins and they both seem to
embody the Nexus feel in fact the Nexus
4 is an almost perfect hybrid falling
right in between the lg optimus G and
the Galaxy Nexus and a lot of ways first
of all the Optimus G on the left is that
square shape the Galaxy Nexus on the
right is very curvy so the Nexus 4 here
in the middle is a nice hybrid between
those two looks the Nexus 4 also takes a
glass of the front and back of the
optimus G along with the sealed in
battery the slot speaker and the 8
megapixel camera it also takes its LTE
chip but we'll get to that in a second
from the Galaxy Nexus it takes that pure
Android 4.2 experience the beautiful
pulsating notification light we love so
much and that very clean Nexus look on
the front something it doesn't take from
either phone though is that backing
behind the glass is this textured almost
glittery pattern that no other phone has
and when it catches the light right
it looks awesome it's very bright very
vivid very very different from other
phones you can't actually feel the
texture when holding the phone but
underneath that glass there's some LG
handiwork
that makes it twinkle and catch a few
eyes so overall on the hardware front
the Nexus 4 is definitely a good premium
feeling phone its Gorilla Glass 2 on the
front and on the back but it has this
nice soft touch material on the beveled
sides which makes it really nice to hold
I think Google spent a lot of time
making this phone a pleasing one-handed
experience and I think they did a good
job and it's a little tiny bit heavier
than the Galaxy s3 but it's definitely a
light phone very much lighter than most
other phones out there oh and don't drop
this phone it does have Gorilla Glass 2
on the back and everything but if it
hits the right angle it
we'll crack anyway and Google does sell
a bumper and the Google Play Store for
those of you who may drop your phones a
lot but phones aren't meant to be
dropped so don't drop this guy now the
Nexus 4 is an awesome upgrade from the
unlocked Galaxy Nexus the price is super
low and you can just pop your SIM card
out of one and into the other literally
everything about the phone is an upgrade
so from the Snapdragon s4 pro quad-core
processor which is a boss to the two
gigabytes of ram to the new 8 megapixel
camera everything is an upgrade around
the Verizon Galaxy Nexus though it's a
tough choice to end your contract and
move to a new plan but I can still
recommend it for the true nexus
experience you can see comparing the
displays that there is also a huge
improvement here the Nexus 4 has a 1280
by 768 IPS display and it gets way
brighter and it's super easy to read in
broad daylight
unlike the dimmer AMOLED displays on
things like the Galaxy Nexus and this
display makes watching movies and even
HD YouTube videos a great experience but
the speaker kind of hinders that a bit
it's loud but it's super tinny and you
can accidentally cover the whole thing
with your finger and then you just can't
hear it at all but the screen makes a
video watching experience a definite
plus it's not like a terrible speaker or
anything but it's something you should
note and the new 8 megapixel camera on
the Nexus 4 is quite good it actually
surprised me I'd say it's about on par
with the galaxy s3 and the Galaxy Note 2
and the shots you can get out of it
especially with HDR mode on it can look
like they came out of something other
than a cell phone camera so that's great
and 1080p video out of this guy looks
nice too and you can take pictures while
you are recording video just by tapping
the screen while the video is recording
now to focus on the Snapdragon s4 pro
for a second this is a 1.5 gigahertz
quad-core processor running Android 4.2
jelly bean with project butter so by
that logic
everything should be buttery smooth and
snappy and almost everything is but
there are still a few problems with
Chrome sometimes and the occasional
dropped frame in certain pinch-to-zoom
animations but real world performance is
still noticeably snappier than any other
Android phone I've ever used this is a
ridiculously
device and what's interesting is that
there are still some apps that are
clearly not optimized for Android 4.2
and you'll be able to tell when you're
looking at them so that'll be up to
developers to fix and that's what leads
me to believe that benchmark scores were
unusually low I mean I got fifty three
hundred or so on quadrant while the
Optimus G with the same processor in RAM
broke seven thousand so yeah
optimization is an ongoing process but
definitely real-world performance
opening apps flying through multitasking
all the typical things that you do every
day on your phone when you're you're
navigating places and you have multiple
applications open at once that's all
going to be very very fast Gaming is
also excellent I can promise that Nexus
4 handles games like a boss I'm not a
huge gamer but I've played Need for
Speed on so many other platforms that I
had to get it here and it is super fun
frame rates are high everything looks
great on this display and it's all just
super responsive I haven't found any
games that look bad yet on the Nexus 4
it does however heat up a little bit on
the back sometimes and you can replicate
this by playing a game or two for
yourself and in just a few minutes it'll
be warm not a big deal to most people
but it's weird to actually feel the
processor working hard anyway of course
the biggest reason people buy this phone
is for pure Android 4.2 jelly bean and
all its awesome features and fast
updates straight from Google as the
stock Android experience is a buying
point by itself so lucky for you I have
an entire separate video link in the
description down below the like button
on this video detailing the new features
in Android 4.2 and they are all present
on this phone now you would think that
with no LTE and a sealed in 2100
milliamp hour battery that the Nexus 4
would last forever on a battery but to
be honest it has just average battery
life nothing spectacular it gets you
through the day don't get me wrong but
this is not a phone that's going to get
you crazy you know four hours of screen
on time or anything also there was an
issue reported with some Nexus fours
having staticky earpieces during calls
but I never had that problem with mine
so that's a good sign and also LTE yeah
it's it's based on the LTE Optimus G
I'll give you that so it still has the
LTE chip inside but there's no amplifier
and it
surely supports one band and you have to
do some interesting little hackery to
get it unlocked so it's not exactly true
LTE support natively but it's a great
coincidence for some lucky Canadians
though because their carriers do work
with this one band and there are a few
simple steps to unlock this LTE also
apparently t-mobile's LTE will use this
band so we'll see how far the hackers
and modders will take that so overall
what would make someone want to buy this
Nexus 4 well number one if you want
stock Android right out the box and the
fastest updates straight from Google and
support for Android 4.2 jelly bean right
out the box then this is your phone
right here no question if you want a
very inexpensive high bang for your buck
unlocked phone then this is also a great
choice if you won't settle for anything
less than that Snapdragon s4 pro chip
and this is definitely a great choice
too I wouldn't buy this phone
specifically for the camera or for the
battery life but they're certainly
acceptable as far as high-end
smartphones go I would even go to say
this is one of the best value
smartphones out there right now and it's
certainly the best Nexus to date it
seems to almost completely naturally
separate itself from the rest literally
so there you go guys that's the LG Nexus
4 like I've said it's definitely one of
the higher-end smartphones out there and
it competes with the highest end on the
market right now even at its lower price
point in the Google Play Store and at
the link down below the like button on
this video now there are a couple of
things you do need to know before buying
something like the Nexus 4 while it is
definitely a worthy upgrade from the GSM
Galaxy Nexus you are going to lose a few
things because of the lower budget
specifically like we addressed the lack
of LTE so you won't be able to get this
on Verizon and yes you can technically
get LTE on it on one band on a couple of
Canadian carriers and potentially
t-mobile in the future but that's not a
buying point for this phone right now
even if you do get it on t-mobile it's
just a bonus if it happens to work later
but honestly this is a really great
phone and I would have no problem
recommending it to anyone on AT&amp;amp;T or
t-mobile who has a SIM card that's ready
to throw this an unlock phone and get it
working other than that thank you for
watching this video if you have any
questions at all
the phone anything I miss anything you
would like to know more about feel free
to leave a comment down below and you
can see I'm answering them as many as I
can and definitely give a thumbs up if
you enjoy the video and subscribe for
the upcoming Nexus 10 review and much
much more content to come so again thank
you for watching and I'll talk to you
guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
