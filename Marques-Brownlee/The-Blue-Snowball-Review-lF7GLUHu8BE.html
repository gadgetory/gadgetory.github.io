here we have the blue snowball which I
like to call the snow baller because
it's easily the best USB microphone in
this budget as you might remember I've
said that in a previous video anyway
this video is actually a giveaway video
sponsored by blue so just give this
video a thumbs up and leave a comment of
the color blue snowball you'd like to
win there are three colors and one
random comment will we pick to win their
own blue snowball and their color of
choice directly from blue so if you
aren't already familiar with the
snowball here's the basic rundown it's a
plug and play USB microphone designed
for those who want affordable really
high quality audio this will blow just
about any built-in microphone and a
laptop right out the water around the
back of the mug you can see that you
have a switch between three built-in
patterns cardioid a 10 decibel padded
cardioid and omnidirectional now while
people getting this mic might not need
all these bells and whistles it's a
great place to start and start learning
how these things work this mic also
comes with a pretty sweet little plastic
tripod stand that's actually
surprisingly versatile pretty nimble I
didn't think it would be enough for me
but it actually works just fine on my
desk and lets me use it at a number of
angles to suit me best and the mic is
also light light enough that you don't
need to buy a better stand to use it
this one will seriously do just fine so
I think you get the point this mic is
definitely worth buying even if you
don't win one from your comment today
especially if you're looking for a
professional sounding audio on a tight
budget so what you're listening to you
right now is unedited audio from the
blue snowball right away this is just
straight from the USB microphone plug
and play no enhancements whatsoever as
you can hear for the price or even for
any USB microphone this sounds really
good so I have no problem with using
this for YouTube and you can probably
tell why I rated this is one of my
highest microphones available for any
sort of YouTube video producer someone
who's beginning so overall what would I
rate this microphone well definitely for
sound quality it could be better but
then again this is better than most
other USB microphones so I'm going to go
ahead and give this a 7 out of 10 for
audio quality both construction like I
mentioned in the video is mostly plastic
but it's fantastic plastic there's no
problems with it seven and a half out of
ten and for ease of use this this is
hands-down one of the easiest
microphones to use 10 out of 10
wonderful job from blue there and
overall I give this micro
and eight or an eight and a half is this
is a great mic for beginners on YouTube
and again if you want to win one make
sure you leave a thumbs up on this video
and leave a comment of one of the three
colors available that you can win
directly from blue that's basically it
guys
thanks for watching and I'll talk to you
guys in the next one peace
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
