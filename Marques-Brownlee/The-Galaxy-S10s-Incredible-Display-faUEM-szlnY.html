is the galaxy s 10 and this phone is
really hot right now obviously and one
of the main reasons for that is the
display some people love it some people
hate it but there's no really arguing
that there's not really a lot like it
out there so this is a closer look at
what makes the galaxy s10 so special
that's green so I've said in videos
before this is the best display on any
phone there are really three main
characteristics that make this such a
unique display number one the hole punch
camera cutout number two the ultrasonic
fingerprint reader and number three just
the quality of the panel itself so to
start with the hole punch cutout it's
pretty straightforward on our way to
bezel as displays we got notches we got
smaller notches and then eventually we
got things like the fingerprint reader
is moving behind the display glass so
the only thing left is the front-facing
camera so in galaxy s 10 it's a laser
cut hole in Samsung's AMOLED panel a
process that's not totally unique and we
saw the cutout in the honor of u-20 but
that was an LCD display this is of
course an OLED so this being the first
in an OLED and Samsung is really proud
of that and how precise it is and I can
vouch the hole punch is definitely a
little tighter around the actual camera
than honors also something interesting
so the galaxy s 10 has that single
cutout while the galaxy s 10 plus has a
dual cutout on the top corner I was told
that that second spot is for a depth
sensor and that this is not a second
camera but when you open the camera app
on the S 10 plus you get these two
buttons which looks like a normal and a
wide a normal one for one person and you
click it and the wide angle for multiple
people it seems to be two different
camera angles turns out this is
literally just cropping in on one
wide-angle sensor so if you cover the
right-hand side of the cutout and swap
between the cameras they both work and
if you cover the left-hand side its
blocking both angles so this button is
literally just cropping in and out of
one
camera fun fact the right hand side
cutout really is just for a depth sensor
for portrait mode anyway I'll have more
thoughts on how it looks with videos and
full-screen games and just generally
getting used to it and things like that
in the full review but so far it's
actually really not that bad at all I
mean despite it being basically a knotch
I find it a little less obtrusive than
an actual knotch also for those
wondering this is how screenshots look
on the s10 plus when it's drawing that
animation around the camera cutout
alright so the second distinguishing
feature here is the ultrasonic
fingerprint reader underneath the
display so you remember maybe if you're
here
the first durability test I did with one
of the earliest under glass fingerprint
sensors that was an optical sensor now
I'm not gonna go that far again with the
sand paper and everything because this
is my only galaxy s 10 but there are
still some unique questions now about
the ultrasonic fingerprint sensor versus
optical so number one just around the
same page about what ultrasonic is that
means it's using really high frequency
sound waves firing off of your finger to
map the depth of the ridges of your
fingerprint in 3d so when you hear it
like that that is way more advanced than
having the optical sensor which is
literally a tiny camera taking a little
2d snapshot of your finger when it
lights it up on your fingers on the
glass so this is more secure and more
difficult to duplicate is it faster
sometimes a little bit kinda so for my
experience if you just hold your finger
down like normal it won't seem that much
faster mostly because this is just how
we've gotten used to these fingerprint
sensors but what you'll really notice is
if you don't hold your finger down as
long or don't press it nearly as firmly
you can basically just touch the screen
for a split second and it unlocks this
would trigger an optical sensor to ask
you to hold it down for longer but with
the ultrasonic it really is much faster
if you just touch your finger just
lightly that is really impressive and of
course the fact that you don't have to
light up the display to read your finger
that is a real advantage and I love that
and it's supposed to be better at
reading your finger through dirt and
water so if your finger is wet or
something it'll work better so let's
find out
all right so I have here some water I
think in a typical situation where you
might need to unlock your fingerprint
but it has something on it is maybe
you're working out or something and
you're sweating so I'm gonna use galaxy
s 10 + 1 + 60 as 2 examples of
fingerprint readers that need to be
unlocked so let start with 1 + 60 under
the glass works perfectly so that's good
get some water on my hand unlock it or
try to unlock it I'm getting a good ol
not recognized and it's asking for that
swipe doesn't recognize me just with a
little bit of water on my thumb so I
guess let's go to the Galaxy S 10
straight off the bat if I dry my hand
dry hand works perfectly so I'll get
some water on my hand and it still
worked that works pretty flawlessly as
good add another girl no problem
no problem at all alright another thing
that was asked a lot in the community
forums when I asked you guys what you
wanted to know about galaxy s 10 was
screen protectors does the screen
protector work with the Galaxy S tens
old sonic fingerprint sensor more
importantly what types of screen
protectors work so I have a regular
screen protector and I have a glass
screen protector okay so the first will
try is this is a regular screen
protector it was made for a galaxy s 10
and you can already buy this in stores
but for right now while the screen
protector is not on it works it doesn't
even have to be a perfect install for
this demo so this may be the messiest
screen protector install of all time but
as long as I get the bubbles out around
the screen protector fingerprint reader
which I have then it should work so I'm
gonna go ahead and yep you can use a
fingerprint reader with a screen
protector on galaxy s 10 you can try the
glass one so a hint that this might not
work is you can go into an AT&amp;amp;T store or
any carrier store right now that's
carrying this phone and you can buy a
Galaxy S 10 you can buy a regular screen
protector for the Galaxy S ten but they
won't sell you a glass screen protector
the Galaxy S ten because they don't make
them so this is a glass screen protector
for the iPhone there's
different types but they're essentially
all the same thing they're supposed to
be shadow resistant you put this
tempered glass over your display to give
you that extra durability but the
ultrasonic fingerprint reader I'm gonna
guess right now probably won't be able
to read through this class so right now
no screen protector on unlocks just fine
so step one peel this layer of adhesive
off and I'm just gonna put it straight
across the bottom right there and now
there's a glass screen protector over
the bottom of the phone have you ever
seen an installation that's bad
hopefully not so let's see if this will
work through the glass it knows there's
a finger there and it's asking me to
cover the whole thing a print sensor but
it's not detecting if I take this off so
that's a no-go
on glass screen protector for Galaxy S
10 yes to a regular one but unless you
want to get one of those weird screen
protectors with a circular cutout around
the fingerprint reader I would say no to
glass all right so the last big bullet
point for this display and just the
panel itself is how good it is period so
resolution 3040 by 1440 3k the
brightness is 1200 nits at its peak
brightness which is brighter than most
TVs it's six point four inches from
corner to corner on the s10 plus it has
the curved edges like we talked about
the super thin top and bottom bezels
physically it's top notch well I guess
you can't say it's it's not actually top
notch because that notch is nothing you
know what I mean so there are two
display modes out the box it's on this
natural mode which actually to my eye
for the first time ever in a samsung
phone actually looks a bit muted out the
box and then there's vivid mode which is
very saturated the vivid is a great word
for it there's still that adjustable
color temperature and all that but
that's the Samsung look that you're used
to also out the box it's gonna be at its
20 to 80 by 1080 resolution instead of
max which is to preserve battery life
but if you want that extra bit of
crispness especially when watching video
you can go ahead and bump that up in the
display settings and enjoy all the
pixels in their 3k glory but as of right
now that's
pretty much everything you need to know
about the galaxy s tennis display it's
one of the reasons people like this
phone so much and many other Samsung
displays as I've said in the past that's
why their phones are popular but let me
know if you guys think of course this is
not the full review that videos in the
pipeline as well so feel free to
subscribe to see that when it comes out
and of course you can share this one
with those who are interested in the
Galaxy S 10 thanks for watching catching
I was the next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
