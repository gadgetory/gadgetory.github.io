and I have another hardware review video
for you guys this one being of the ice
fogs air pollution v33
noise isolating earbuds so like you
heard there this is from iFrogz so you
can check them out at the link in the
description I'll have a link to their
website as well as a link to this exact
product because there are actually two
versions of the d-33 earbuds so this is
a full-sized version of the d-33 earbuds
they come here in a nice carrying case
that actually says iFrogz
if you can see that on the zipper which
is a nice touch
I do like headphones that come with a
carrying case but here are the earbuds
themselves so yes these are not only
noise isolating earbuds you can see they
are full size they come with three
different sized three different size
plugs they go into your ears so this is
a medium sized ones you can have the
larger or smaller sized one so I love
the medium sized ones on just because
they fit my ear pretty well and the
sound was very very nice now you may or
may not be able to tell here that the
right side of this year but is a lot
longer than the left-hand side this is
because the right-hand side goes around
your neck if you've ever used these
types of earbuds before the right side
goes around your neck and it's kind of
like that uh it's very convenient so I
actually like your buds that do that and
the Sony earbuds that I was using before
use the same style I'm not sure if that
style was called but there we go on the
front here we see this is a 3.5
millimeter headphone jack which will
work with your cell phone if it does
have a 3.5 it'll work with any pretty
much any iPod model it'll work with the
iPhone 3G but not the original iPhone I
was able to use an adapter for my cell
phone which actually has a 2.5
millimeter headphone jack and that
actually did work quite well and the
sound there was no degrading in the
sound of any kind the what I liked about
these earbuds were that basically the 9
millimeter driver slide provides a
really really clear a really really
clear sound and if you can see the shape
of these earbuds it's just a little bit
slanted in the side here you can see
it's black in a yellow on the backside
so it's very
very nice angles and very nice looks the
way they designed these earbuds so
they're very well made
I like the crisp the Chris noses the
sounds that you hear with these earbuds
on is pretty much unparalleled for the
price of these earbuds they're available
for 1995 at the iFrogz website which
again is in the description but the only
con that I really had with these earbuds
was that the base was not the strongest
of any earbuds now these again granted
are not $200 and noise-canceling over
the ear headphones but they did lack a
little bit of bass on but I did like
that the sound that I actually heard out
of these these drivers and that of these
earbuds was very very clear and if you
can see if I take the earbud off here
it's a fairly it's a decent sized driver
you know it's it's they're just 1995
dollar earbuds and they are very very
well made for the price that you get so
I thank you if you're looking for a pair
of earbuds that are 1995 that are twenty
dollars or less you definitely want to
get you're going to want to take a look
at these earbuds they are very very nice
and I've gotten lots of great reviews
they are comfortable and they do like
they saying the title they are
noise-isolating so if you do go ahead
and plug these up you're not going to
need extra power or anything these are
noise-isolating earbuds so that's
basically the gist of these products I
say they are worth every cent and I'm
going to give these an 8.5 out of 10 for
the crispness of the noise the nice
design the colors which you can
definitely change on their website you
can customize which colors you do like
to suit your needs or your once you can
definitely change the colors of these
but overall eight and a half out of ten
very nice earbuds and if you're looking
for a pair of budget earbuds you're
going to want to look into these so
