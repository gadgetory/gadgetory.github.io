this one will be on how to revert to the
classic start menu if you're in Windows
Vista so this is a really quick tutorial
all you're gonna do is right-click your
taskbar and hit properties and you go
under the Start menu tab and that's it
right there you see the classic start
menu option you check it and I'll give
you the look and functionality of
previous versions of Windows so if I
were if I were to apply that right now
and if I click on the Start menu it'll
take a while actually for the first time
it loads but after that it's very very
quick you go just basically the Windows
Vista Start menu all the programs are
fanned out instead of actually being
within the Start menu so you guys can
just mess around with this and see if
you like it or not actually it puts a
few icons on your desktop that you you
can do it if you want to so what I'm
gonna do is delete these icons real
quick and now if I want to revert if I
want to go back to the regular Windows
Vista Start menu it's the same exact
process right click and hit properties
Start menu and classic the other Start
menu which gives you easy access to
folders and such the one Start menu now
open my Start menu again it'll have all
the recently youth programs that I had
in the original Windows Vista Start menu
including leaves which are videos I've
recently done and all of the programs
that I already had so it'll keep all
your regular Start menu settings the
size of it and everything so if you
actually had customized your Start menu
you would still have all these options
that you actually used three default
settings in your original when does this
start me so I hope it helps you guys if
you don't really like the Start menu or
it has to take too long to load that is
exactly how you change back so thanks
for watching Pete</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
