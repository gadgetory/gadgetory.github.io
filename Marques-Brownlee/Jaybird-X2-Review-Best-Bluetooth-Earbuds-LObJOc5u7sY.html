these are the j-bird X 2's there are
these Bluetooth earbuds there's a sequel
actually to the jaybird blue buds ex
that I liked so much last year so this
is the review of them it should be
pretty easy so the originals of these
guys the jaybird blue buds ex were some
of my favorite headphones like ever I
don't even use ear buds that much but I
would pretty much never leave the house
without these they're Bluetooth earbuds
that lasts like forever on battery they
have great sound they happen to be under
200 bucks so I included them on my top 5
headphones under $200 list and a lot of
people love them ever since now there's
a thing these came out like three years
ago so all the technology from the
inside and out has improved in the last
three years so the J Brut X 2's aren't
really like a design overhaul or
anything like that they're more of a
refresh of remaking the same product
with new technology for 2015 so here's
what's new with the jaybird x2 that
rhymed okay first of all they're not
blue buds anymore there's no blue buds
anywhere on the box actually they're
just the X twos now and they do come in
a few colors so the originals were just
black or white the X 2's come in a
variety of colors my personal favorite
of course being the red and black which
is called fire this is everything that
comes in the box the headphones the case
three different size rubber ear tips and
now new three different size foam ear
tips so the soft foam is actually used
to be an optional paid accessory so it's
nice that they actually include these
for free as a part of the package now
you also get the ear fins that help them
stay in your ears
and a tiny USB 2.0 cable all you really
need to do is get your Bluetooth device
to play music from and you're good to go
and you can pair with up to eight
devices to this just one pair of
headphones the biggest improvement or
actually I think the biggest change
mechanically speaking is actually the
carrying case so the original models
carrying case was this sort of a hard
clamshell design definitely protective
but super annoying to open the new case
is a hard shell on the bottom but then
more of a flexible soft rubber on the
side so you can just pop off the top put
your headphones or accessories in there
and then when you want to close that you
just pop the top right back on when
you're done it's a lot easier for me
than that clamshell and the other big
mechanical improvement for the j-bird
x2s
is the improved ear fins which are a bit
more comfort
a little bit softer to help these things
stay more securely in your ear when
moving or running you technically don't
have to use the fins but they help the
ear buds stay more firmly in my ear for
keeping the seal and keeping the dope
sound and speaking of dope sound yes
these do still sound awesome this is
again where new technology comes into
play you can fit better drivers into a
smaller place you can work on the sound
profile of such a small pair of
headphones the Bluetooth connection is
more reliable etc and they still have
this really rich warm punchy sound like
a last version super fun to listen to
especially for sports and stuff they
charge fully in about two hours and they
still have that really long eight hour
battery life and that might not sound
like an all-day thing but if you only
listen to music for two hours every
single day that's going to last you
almost a week and just the overall fit
and finish is better here there's
improved water resistance it feels like
the connection with the cable of the
earbuds is more solid and the soft touch
finish is way better looking and feeling
in the hand than the glossy casing of
last year so there's pretty much nothing
I don't like about this refresh even if
you've never used Bluetooth headphones
at all before these would be a great
first pair considering they're super
easy to use and pair and get started
with and then they're really durable so
if you do drop them or you play a rough
sport or have a long practice or get
them wet they will survive so when it
comes down to it there are no better
wireless earbuds for the price and I've
tried a lot of them I just can't get
past recommending these now here's the
bonus the originals the jaybird blue
buds ex which are still pretty good now
they dropped in price so it's like a new
smartphone coming out the older version
drops in price a lot I'll leave the link
right below if you want to check out the
original jaybird blue buds X and get it
for a steal I think they're now like way
under 150 bucks now so that's pretty
dope and I'll also be giving away a
second pair of the jailbird X twos so if
you want to check out a pair of those
stay tuned on Twitter
I'll leave my Twitter link below some
Twitter giveaway action will be
happening that's basically it if you
enjoy this video feel free to leave it a
thumbs up thank you for watching and
I'll talk to you guys in the next one
peace
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
