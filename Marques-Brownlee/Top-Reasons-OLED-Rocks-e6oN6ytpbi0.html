to be telling you guys why Oh le D
technology rocks don't you know so start
with how the technology works basically
instead of having one single backlight
for all the pixels each individual pixel
lights up so if you need green on this
one pixel the pixel can turn green and
if you need blue on this pixel that
pixel can turn blue if it needs to
display black instead of lighting up the
pixel it just doesn't light it up at all
and this means three awesome things
number one this saves energy that would
have been used to light two pixels which
means better battery life and that's why
LED displays are great for
battery-powered devices and we all just
love battery life number two this makes
the parts of the screen they're supposed
to look black completely pitch black so
if you have like a black notification
bar on an Android device that literally
looks like it's part of the bezel it is
completely black the contrast is
amazingly high on LED screens and colors
really pop which is awesome and three
the screen itself since it doesn't need
to have a backlight is much thinner I've
ever noticed that oh LED display devices
are much thinner than their LED
counterparts Samsung Galaxy s2 oh LED
displays and monitors the Nexus S the
Zune HD that I proposed every mobile
manufacturer switched over to oh LED
displays as soon as possible if that
like button if you agree you can also
hit up that link in the description for
all the info you could ever wish to know
about LED technology it'll blow your
mind basically it for this video again
give it a thumbs up that's great mkbhd
signing out peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
