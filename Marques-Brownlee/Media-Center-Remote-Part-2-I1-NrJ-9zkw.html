HTTP or HQ video I should say because
I'm using this new camera here and first
thing I want to tell you about is that
this is going to be a video response to
one of my much earlier videos in which I
went over the media center remote for my
new HP laptop this is the HP Pavilion
dv6 pected but I'm going to be go over
some of the features I couldn't actually
show you while using the webcam on the
laptop itself because I couldn't show
you what was going on on the screen as I
press certain buttons so here I'm going
to actually pick up the camera and I
don't have a tripod yet so they're with
me but I'm going to show you what
actually happens on the screen when you
press different buttons and as for the
different features in Windows Media
Player in Windows Vista okay here's the
setup and pardon number one the shaking
and number two the not-so-great quality
but I have the remote here in my hand
I'll be showing you how to control the
laptop with the remote so first of all
at the top you see this green button
right here I told you before is a meteor
center button now right here on the
laptop is actually the infrared receiver
you might not be able to see that but
that's where it receives the infrared
signal so I'm just going to press that
Media Center button in Windows Vista
Home Premium 64-bit should pick it up
and open up Windows Media Center here we
go here's the media center that's the
first thing that comes up and in fact
I'm going to go ahead and plug in my
headphones to give you guys a better
experience so you can hear the sounds
and everything that are associated with
every movement so here I'm going to plug
in these speakers here so here is it's
all zooming on my screen a little bit
this is the media center interface I
still have the remote in hand here and
you can see there's a lot of different
things we can do if I scroll up and down
using the remote or the arrow keys so
I'll use the the remote for this example
we have TV we have music we have all the
music a library all the photos and
videos there's also tasks which is
interesting I'll get to the
in a minute online media which I use a
lot quick play and sports so I'll start
with music what you have in music is
your music library okay you can play all
in music this will search your entire
hard drive for your music library so
keep in mind up is going to search all
of your music you can put you can listen
to internet radio and you can also
search your music which is a long and
tedious process without the keyboard but
I'll just go into my media library so
you can see when you select it with the
center button on the remote it actually
brings up the entire thing you can
obviously scroll to the right and it
kind of it's reminiscent of Cover Flow
it's very smooth animation animation
wise so it's very good graphics if you
don't like the graphics you can always
turn them off in the settings cuz also
if I go up here I can search by artist
album genre go down here and choose my
electronic and dance and it'll sort them
out for me so there we go
now if I ever want to go back I just
have to hit this back button right here
on the bottom left hand corner of the
remote just press it once twice three
times and we're back to our main menu I
want to scroll up here to picture n
video because I do have a little bit of
picture and video media on my hard drive
right now as you can see I have a few
pictures this is actually a picture
folder on my hard drive which is cool
because it knows that it's a folder I
click on it it's opening up right here
you can see this is all my pictures so
if I this is my logo and click on it
again I can scroll through my logos
folder how logos I've made okay I can
scroll down and through this pictures
folder and view any one picture
fullscreen that's a cute puppy but in
the click of a button so that's pretty
cool you can do that and again I like
the animation so that's pretty cool that
you can do that using this remote also
if you are in the middle of the song
hopefully this will focus a little bit
here but you have the rewind the play
pause and the fast-forward and also the
stop buttons so at any time you can use
those buttons to control your media your
movie whatever ABB's to be playing also
I'm going to go over HP quick play which
is a whole separate a whole separate
video review basically for you guys and
pardon the mic quality you might not be
able to understand it
in here but I'm just going to go back
and I'm going to scroll down now to show
you guys the sports section which is one
of the other sections I use now I do not
have a TV tuner so I'll just cancel
because I haven't got it built in but
you can actually check scores and a lot
more than just scores so I'll click on
this here you can check a lot more than
just scores using their remote alright
and pardon me not using Camtasia Studio
6 because I wanted to show you guys this
and its actual interaction with the
laptop so here you can see across the
top as I scroll across the basketball
baseball or I actually have to go up
first but you can see the different
scores this is a final after triple
overtime thing and even games that are
underway are still use are still
highlighted so I were to click on a game
that's still highlighted here we go the
bobcats and the Timberwolves that's the
score and we can go to Fox Sports and
just take a look at what they've
reported for us about the game and this
is all free built into Windows Vista
media center ok so I really like that
feature there you go that's that's one
of the matchups we've got going on right
now so I'm just going to hit back back
back and that is basically what I'm
going to show you guys for now but if I
were to show you more about Windows
Media Center remote that would basically
be it ok you don't have a whole lot of
extra features here it's the basic you
have a channel up and down sorry about
that you have the channel up and down up
and down right here you have the volume
buttons the the mute button is right
here the volume up and the blind down
obviously you have your navigation
controls in there
your skip song to the right or skip song
backwards again the media center the
media player controls also these left
and right arrows can be used when you're
sorting through pictures and this I
write here is the information button
again not that much else this is one is
to watch the DVD directly and that's the
split so I hope you enjoy again your
Windows Media Center laptop and if you
do get the media center remote with
again only HP laptops you will enjoy
this pretty sweet feature also you can
watch kind of a sort of news newscast
kind of thing like if I were to go in
here
to online media and I were to KITT
explore you'll actually take me to an
online guide of shows that I can watch
and different live casts that I can
actually tune into at anytime without a
TV tuner so that's pretty cool so anyway
thanks for watching this review and I
hope you like it if you have any other
tutorial requests or video requests or
comments please message me please ask me
I do the best I can
let's say quit so thanks for watching
this video thanks for tuning in thanks
