all right sup guys I'm Kim PhD here and
welcome to another guest a slightly
unusual video but so just to give a
little context on what's going on here
just shot a video with Startalk and it
went pretty well you should go and check
it out I'll probably have a link in the
description below but I figured while
I'm here with Neil and Chuck might as
well get a little interview in since
it's only fair since you did interview
me about two years ago we should reverse
roles a little bit I'll talk to you for
a little bit good to see we go yeah I
could see you again too by the way um
you're very nicely
you were like 14 or something I was I
was pretty young and I feel like that
was definitely a big part of what we
talked about but I've seen a lot since
then and in fact you were 12 years old I
played George basically an infant but
yeah so this is this is gonna be fun I
think the thing that was on my mind just
when I had the opportunity to ask you
anything is just from a an
astrophysicist perspective I mean we
look at the tech that we have on a palm
of our hands every day and it's it's
pretty sweet you know new phones new
tablets but a lot of that comes from the
higher end the the military technology
the space program technology a lot of
things eventually trickle their way down
into what we're able to hold in our
hands are the things that you guys have
seen or heard of that maybe we don't
know about that's on its way that might
end up and our phones or tablets or
handhelds someday I'm not authorized
[Laughter]
why don't I I have some ideas but I'm
not very good at predicting the future
sure and I have good evidence that I'm
not good at predicting the future and
I've told this many times Chuck when I'm
old enough to remember Star Trek in
first-run okay my past II can't what's
your past and so there's the warp drives
and the photon torpedoes and in this
machine we put in a card and then hot
food comes out instantly this was an
extraordinary view of the future and I
say yeah
yeah that's all going to happen and
there's one thing about Star Trek that I
could not imagine and it it took the
realism of Star Trek out of it for me
and that was the fact that they could
just walk up to a door and the door
would open how does the door know over
here and out of there and it opens and
for some reason the warp drives and the
photon torpedoes and the transporters
were all believable to me or not the
auto opening door automatic doors is
where you drew the line I had that I I
was I so this is all literally before
any automatic doors okay so that's why I
wouldn't trust my sense of the future
here but I do want to give you an acute
appreciation for how the past became the
future all right so let's go back a
hundred years the dawn of our
understanding of the atom
now how does the atom work I don't know
let's probe it we start probing it in
the 1920s through particle accelerators
and experiments out of this comes
quantum physics the quantum on top of
that Albert Einstein says mmm using what
we know about quantum physics and using
what we know about this kind of physics
I can put them together calculate I've
come up with a new thing that would
occur in atoms it's called the
stimulated emission of radiation okay no
one paid any attention to that paper it
was interesting it advanced quantum
physics but if you had lawmakers and
politicians and people saying why
doesn't that help me today why are you
doing research has nothing to do with
anything put him around back then they
would be criticized in quantum physics
from beginning to end what a waste of
resources you're so smart why are you
wasting it on atoms it would take 40
years 50 years before quantum physics
would become the very foundation of
information technology there is no
creation storage or retrieval of
information without an understanding of
the quantum not only that this obscure
research paper that Einstein wrote on
the stimulated emission of radiation it
would that would take 40 years 40 years
later the laser would be invented based
on that principle
oh what a three of those letters stand
for the light amplification by the
stimulated emission of radiation was
Einstein thinking barcodes that's why
what a laser cosmetic peel no no so all
I can tell you is I don't know what the
future will bring
but if you stop investing in basic
research today you won't have a future
so it's being worked on today we should
encourage it to be worked on today and
don't go up to a scientist and say how
does that relate to me today and how is
that the only right answer is I have no
idea but evidence of the history this
exercise tells us that one day it will
so there are things that are hugely
important to your life and your I mean
the collective view that no one knows
about yet correct correct
all that matters if you're curious is
that you're exploring something you do
not yet know I'll give it can I give
another example I would love it by you
my examples okay yeah yeah so far so
good
because I don't want to be like I'm just
kind of absorbing it so okay whatever
you usually you do all the talking a lot
of times I do but that's scripted that's
a lot easier oh well okay okay I'm not
scripted I'm just I'm just blathering it
works all right my physics professor in
college his name was Edward Purcell
sounds like a nice guy nice yeah it
turns out he was a really nice guy he
did calculations that gave us ways to
measure the existence and the depth and
the composition of gas clouds in space
did very important research he also
discovered a phenomena manaan where if
you put an electromagnetic field across
an atomic nucleus okay it will actually
change that field according to the mass
of the nucleus there's a resonance
between the light that passed
cross it and the nucleus itself yeah it
was called nuclear magnetic resonance
got the Nobel Prize for that afterwards
a clever medical engineer said wait a
minute if you could put this field of
course and know the mass of the nucleus
and I can differentiate this nucleus
from this nucleus I can make a machine
put you in the machine make images of
all your nuclei and thus was born the
magnetic resonance imaging which used to
have and but it's one of the n-words
that you're not supposed to use nuclear
you go into a machine that uses nuclear
magnetic resonance but the hospital's
figured nobody wants to go in a machine
that has nuclear honor so they dropped
the end yeah drop the n-word right kept
magnetic resonance imager and it's
arguably the most potent tool in the
arsenal of the medical doctor to
diagnose the condition of your body
without cutting you open that is based
upon a principle of physics discovered
by a physicist who had no interest in
medicine so quantum physics lasers
nuclear magnetic resonance the list goes
on
the unknown yeah let's do one mine okay
do you know the laser alignment that
connected the space shuttle to dock with
the space station used a certain laser
and programming technology that was then
adapted for LASIK surgery allowing the
laser to align with your eye even if
your eye moves so that the cut is always
in the right place so so then you might
say well why have an 18 billion dollar
agency just to invent grooves in a
pavement okay we should have the
Transportation Safety Board invent this
but they didn't yeah we should have
other people invented but they didn't
this is my point however complex are
however simple the germination of an
idea does not always come because you
legislated and in the agencies that you
set up make sure there are cross
pollinating pathways without which
people stay in their silos of thinking
and
no truly great discoveries would unfold
you can't necessarily decide to tell
someone to get an idea or to do
something better but when a better idea
or a really forward-thinking
organization comes along and happens to
do it really well spread it share it
enable it thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
