here from mkbhd and i have another
hardware video for you guys and i
actually have my phone here because this
is a rap soul unboxing i know the the
logo is quite obscure right there but
what we're going to do basically rats
flow what they're doing here I'll have
their website and their link in the
description they actually have a youtube
channel but if they're watching this now
basically rap cyl is a company that does
a bunch of those on those transparent
shields that go on your your iPod your
cell phone whatever electronic device
may or may not have so I know this this
is a have a lot of stuff on this is what
fedex did um they try to ship it to a
p.o box but they couldn't I guess ship
to be a p.o box so it was redirected to
my house and this is actually i did a
hardware overview of my phone already if
you want to watch that but basically
this is the invisible shield for the LG
voyager the LG VX 10,000 actually both
on their website and on this package
here it says VX 1000 i might email rap
so about that because it is in fact the
VX 10,000 so yeah here we go with the
unboxing video take this open here so
you rascal the only reason i'm doing an
unboxing videos because rap school
doesn't just give you one invisible
shield they actually give you a lot of
stuffed with the invisible shield i'm
probably not going to install the wraps
all in the video but you see the hard or
review your song yeah you've seen the
hardware review so you can definitely go
check that out so here's what comes in
the box or comes into little package
right here it says this is this handy
little meister for all sorts of things
sometime lotion to glass cleaner to
cooking blah blah where does close water
so this is i guess they're little
solution but you know use of spritz on
your LG voyager or your electronic
device that looks fine to me what we
have over here is application
instructions so i can
we just grab that right here here are
the shields themselves it looks like
right under the application instructions
so i'll put that there so that it says
once you've applied your rap cyl film
you can recycle the entire box it's
completely responsible if you can see
that logo down there on the right hand
side over here we have what looks like a
microfiber yes it says don't discard
this soft lint-free microfiber towel wet
with a little rap so logo on it very
soft I'm definitely going to take use of
this i have about six microfibers now
but this is looking good and up in the
top left hand side this is your squeegee
to use to apply the rap so it's like
this hard rubber it's basically yet it
reminds me of any other squeegee and use
it to get out your air bubbles as you're
applying the film to the cover of the
phone if I can get the phone here as
you're applying this film you kind of
push out the air bubbles from the middle
out so that makes sense that they give
you all these different things in the
box with your wraps well and it really
makes a lot of sense and I like
appreciate companies that do include
sorry that do include a lot in their
packages so on thanks for apps will for
sending this out to me and I would
definitely get you guys with a full
review video there won't be an
installation video and you might be
watching this after the gel skins
installation video and obviously that
wasn't have the most exciting video in
the world yeah that was that was what
came in the box with the wraps will i'll
get you guys with a full review video
after i've installed the rap CIL's and
that is basically it so thanks for
watching this video guys and I hope you
get you later in the next video thanks
for subscribing and thanks for rating if
you have already that is they split so
thanks for watching guys peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
