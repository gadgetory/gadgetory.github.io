streak I think we'll keep this going so
of course I asked you guys on Twitter
what you guys wanted to know from the
past month and of the thousands of
replies I can already say probably half
of them were again about the 1 plus 5
now I did publish the full review so if
anyone has any questions a lot of them
that you were asking could be answered
by watching the full review but there
were some small updates so there were a
few controversial things about the 1
plus 5 like camera performance old
screen benchmark cheats etc what am i
thougt so the camera performance in the
screen those things were covered in the
review but the benchmark sheets were
something that I found out about after I
published my review apparently one plus
is still putting code in their OS that
maxes out the CPU cores wanted to text
that a benchmark app is running that is
dumb
that who shouldn't have done that I
didn't use any benchmarks in my review
but people who did kind of got hit for
that my bottom line there is
yeah it's dumb they shouldn't have done
it and they should have stopped doing a
long time ago but also it's 2017 why do
people still care about benchmark if
you're still basing your smartphone
purchase decision off of how well a
phone does on benchmarks then I guess
this does have a big effect on you but I
don't think we should be doing that
anymore
performance is a really pretty damn good
off the board and you can take my
comments about the fluidity of it and
how well it actually works in real life
over benchmark scores so I wouldn't put
too much stock in that what are your
thoughts on the iPhone 8 concepts
vertical cameras and touch ID on the
screen etc okay so the vertical cameras
and all the renders we've seen pointing
to that being the way the next iPhone
camera looks looks a little bit weird in
the renders but I've always said this
phones always looks so much better in
real life than they do in the renders
the renders of some of the past couple
of my favorite phones including this
phone including a pixel and I think the
past Nexus is they've all looked way
worse and the renders and then the phone
actually comes out and you hold the
hardware in your hand and it's actually
kind of nice so I'm not so worried about
the cameras in the way they look on the
phone what I actually am concerned about
is the fingerprint reader location a lot
of the rumors are pointing to this big
full screen - iPhone with a fingerprint
sensor under the display and I want that
to be true so bad but I've also never
seen that implemented anywhere in any
product
that means Apple can't do it I mean
they've done revolutionary
first-of-its-kind stuff in their
products before but I've just never seen
a display with a fingerprint reader
underneath it under the glass ever so my
fingers across that Apple can do this
and do it well the first time around but
I'm also not super optimistic and I
wouldn't be surprised to see a
fingerprint reader around the back or up
at the front again of the next iPhone
what do you think about the upcoming
note Fe this is actually a really weird
thing to me Samsung is going to be
selling refurbished Galaxy Note sevens
before the note 8 comes out as the note
Fe why you would think with all the bad
press about the note 7 and all the
problems they had with it they would
just completely abandon that project put
it to rest
r.i.p tombstone and everything just like
let it go and we even have the note 8
like probably right around the corner
and maybe two months we'll see that
phone so a little bit confused about why
they're coming out with note FD a
refurbished note 7 doesn't sound like
the best idea to me if you became a CEO
of a tech company for a day which
company do you pick and what would you
do ok so hear me out I think this is
actually kind of a clever idea I would
be the CEO of Tesla for a day which
number one would let me like go into the
office and just look at all the plans
for model 3 and model Y and the
semi-truck and all the stuff to have
plan for the future that would be cool
but also that technically makes me the
CEO of a rocket company also and also
the tunnel-boring company I get to see
cool stuff about like the Hyperloop and
all the other stuff they're planning I
feel like it would be kind of like a win
win win win this is kind of a busy dude
when is the USB type-c going to take
over Apple definitely took the big major
steps towards making USB type-c much
more popular but I think once you see
those accessories it being a no-brainer
that they get USB type-c that's when you
know it's taken over is Apple iPhone 8
or X going to live up to the hype no
nothing nothing ever lives up to the
height and that's not to say hype should
die ok height is just marketing it
happens a lot with a lot of different
companies I'm just saying nothing ever
actually lives up to that height I don't
you do vlogs I'd love to watch mkbhd
vlogs ok so the honest answer to that is
I've actually thought about this
question in the past and the answer is
time so the thing about making vlogs in
addition to all the stuff I already make
is it means app so then have to edit all
that stuff in addition to what I'm
already editing which means it would
take more time and vlog
can be really cool I've seen some really
great ones obviously but I think if I
were to do blogs most of them would end
up just being behind the scenes of the
main videos that you guys watch so I
think if you want to see that kind of
stuff you should follow me on Twitter
first of all but also snapchat and
Instagram I think it's a definitely more
time efficient way of sharing up subsidy
guys trust me I've thought about
vlogging it's just there's only 24 hours
in a day you know next question is why
were you in France with Casey night's
debt
oh speaking of lager so if you saw
Casey's latest video the summer movie
thing if you saw the end of it then of
course you know it was shot entirely on
Galaxy S apes that I can verify is true
for there were lots of vlog shots and
car shots and things you can imagine
would be shot with a normal handheld
phone but there's also plenty of drone
shots and aerial shots and crazy angles
but those are also shot on a smartphone
as well it was with the help of a
company called drone works and they were
the ones that were responsible for
putting galaxy s aids in these custom
rigs with cine lenses and massive drones
and getting these incredible shots from
this technically a galaxy s 8 s camera
casing and Samsung invited me along to
check out the whole thing and I was
super impressed with it obviously it
takes the whole shot on a smartphone
thing to the next level I'm open to like
analyzing like really how far do these
pros go like you sure you've seen those
shot on iphone as that Apple makes how
far do they really take those iPhones to
be able to get those shots didn't be
curious about that but anyway that's why
I was in France would you believe your
eyes if ten million fireflies box on
vixy's beta one okay so I've talked a
lot about Bixby in the past so naturally
people were curious about if I was
impressed with the Bixby voice update
that's just coming out there's an early
access program Bixby voice is finally
becoming available to some of those
people and you can download and install
it and give it a shot and it's pretty
bad I'm going to like the Verge's video
below where they did some testing of it
they asked some questions to be fair it
does have some abilities that Siri and
Google assistant and Cortana don't have
meaning it can dig into an application
and do commands from inside app but you
can tell from the video it's super slow
it doesn't get all the questions right
it doesn't always understand you and
also this was part of the video
choose the president of the US hey when
we've got not much wrong so I'm sorry
sure Dixie has a long way to go surprise
surprise
good luck Samsung Tesla vs. Faraday
future okay so anytime you compare a
Tesla with anything else like Faraday
future or lucid err or any of the
companies that don't even really exist
yet or are selling electric cars I've
always said even if you make a car
that's incredible every bit as good as
the Tesla even better in every single
way it's still not really gonna sell
well because Tesla already has the
mindshare and already has the sex appeal
that these cars don't have yet just in
the way people think about car brands
and then they also have the
infrastructure they already have the
supercharging Network they make it
really easy to drive electric cars long
distances that those other companies
don't have yet so it's funny to see an
article labeling something as like a
Tesla killer there is not going to be a
Tesla killer for a very long time in the
same way that there's not going to be a
Ford killer because that's just part of
the industry now and it's also
definitely enough space for Tesla and
other companies to exist in the electric
car market
there's no Tesla Killers yet
demographically where do you have the
largest following okay so once we got
this question we actually looked into it
a lot and there's some really
interesting stats about the mkbhd
channel viewership all of you guys so if
I go into YouTube analytics I can check
out which countries have the most people
watching us a number one India number
two United Kingdom number three Canada
Australia Germany and on the list goes
on but then we actually sorted by
population size of that country at least
on the first page to the Cattell who
have the highest viewership per capita
in a way so shout out to Singapore and
Sweden for topping that list and then of
course there's a male female demographic
turns out we're at a study ninety-five
percent male five percent female
ladies and something I also have to sort
just to find out if you look at all
subscribers and unsubscribers from a
channel in the lifetime of it the mkbhd
Channel
I'm almost proud of this in its lifetime
has lost almost
1 million subscribers since its
inception we should get a plaque for
that that's that's kind of impressive 9
hundred thousand plus people have
decided yet that that's enough I don't
want to say anymore but also that means
that the four point seven million
subscribers the channel has now is just
the people who have stuck around there's
also a couple of hundred thousand more
who subscribed and unsubscribed it's
weird I've been curious if that's a
common ratio or number for youtubers in
tech or even in other genres or if
that's even weird to talk about that I
don't know either way I'm going to end
it there thanks for all your questions I
hope this is a fun Q&amp;amp;A and hopefully you
enjoyed seeing a little bit of a
different part of the studio Studio B
we're going to be right back on it with
tech videos very shortly because there's
a lot of stuff coming out a lot of stuff
you guys have to see thank you for
watching now it's off to get the next
one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
