tutorial and in this one I'll be showing
you how to get and install the Safari 4
beta on your Mac or your PC so right now
I'm going to open up Safari just to show
you guys that I currently have the
version of Safari you may be using so go
to help about Safari and it'll tell you
I have version 3.2.2 now you see I have
a lot of favorites right here and a lot
of bookmark pages that I actually want
to keep if I want to go back to these
for further reference so what I want to
do is to actually just upgrade my
version of Safari so I'm going to go to
WWF while calm go to the Downloads tab
of their website and down here you will
see safari 4.0 beta for Mac or PC is a
thirty one megabyte download if it is
not here just go to the search box and
type in Safari and the first one will be
Safari 4 so just go ahead and click on
the Safari icon and it'll come up with
the new Safari 4 beta so here on this
website we're going to say we're going
to click Safari for Windows XP or Vista
ok I'm going to uncheck this because I
don't want to put in my email just hit
that download and Now button and make
sure your PC meets the minimum
requirements are going to do is hit open
and it'll first start downloading the
new version of Safari for beta now it
says it's going it's a little bit of a
slow download right now but it's a 25
megabyte initial download and it'll take
approximately 30 megabytes on your hard
disk now I'm gonna show you while it's
downloading is that it's going to look a
lot more strikingly like Google Chrome
in that the tabs are on the top here
we're gonna have an RSS button the
refresh we're going to have browsing
using Cover Flow ok full full-page
previews of your bookmarks and getting
to know your top sites so you know I'm
just going to come back to you guys when
a safari for beta is done downloading
alright here I resume the video and we
see that the chemcam off sorry the
safari setup.exe have been finished
downloading so we're going to
the file that's all I did was go
downstairs and come back and resume the
video so just hit the Run button and
it'll bring us into the Installer which
I believe will ask us for the language
first hold on and while this is actually
starting I'm just going to eggs out of
the Safari 3 which is probably going to
be necessary for installing so forth
Safari 4 anyway so it's wait for Safari
3 Safari 4 here it says safari is a
fastest and most innovative web browser
for Mac and PC and we already saw but
there's going to be a ton of changes so
we're going to hit next we have to agree
to the service and license license
agreement and everything hit the accept
button and hit next and here I'm going
to install a desktop shortcut because
I'm going to eventually drag into my
rocket doctor place this Safari and
we're going to hit install now since we
did not change the actual location of
where it's going to install it's going
to detect by itself as we follow Apple's
instructions here that it's actually
detecting our previous version of Safari
in that folder it's going to remove that
but keep all of our favorites
preferences our autofill and all that
customizable stuff actually still in
Safari as we are we prepare for
installation here so sprees please wait
while Safari installs and this may take
several minutes so I'll come back to you
guys when this is finished finished with
this particular step
all right we're come back and we've come
back here to the final step and looking
the old favorites and applications and
replacing them with the same exact
information but in the newer file format
or Safari 4 so it's finishing the
installation of Safari and if we scroll
up here you'll see that it's already put
an icon on my desktop a little shortcut
for me to drag actually into my rocket
dock in the first place so now we see
it's validating the install so let's
just wait until Safari has finished
installing the application and then
we'll go into and show you a little bit
of the new things that have actually
been incorporated into Safari 4 so just
wait one second
alright when you've finished installing
it says congratulations Safari has been
in successfully installed and I'm going
to uncheck open Safari after it exits
and I'm just going to hit the finish
button here in that new window now in
order to do this to drag him to my
rocket dock I'm just going to right
click on the dock and
items here drag out the old Safari icon
and it just disappears
take the new Safari icon drag it in to
where I want it let go and then I'm
going to lock it again now you'll see
the old one is still here since this is
just a short clip it'll obviously tell
us this is just a shortcut and I'll say
yes or move it so now we have the new
Safari 4.0 beta and I'm just going to
click on it to open it let's see if it's
any faster or slower it's pretty fast
and right off the bat I'm noticing
that's a completely new theme here it's
using the windows Aero of course I made
it do that my old version of Safari but
the first boot of Safari is going to be
totally different first thing I want to
point out is that up here there's a
little bug button we can report the bugs
and here we have a little introduction
saying welcome to Safari 4 and here are
our top sites just like Google Chrome it
has the top sites we I visited almost
like and it seems to be loading the top
sites that I've already visited which is
pretty cool so this is on a lot
reminiscent of Google Chrome first of
all the fact that you can add a new tab
just by hitting that plus button second
of all the fact that it has all your top
sites here and it's actually pretty
accurate this is my home page this is
Apple comments gonna load and here's all
my old favorites which is very cool have
my website the project that I'm doing it
still has all of my bookmarks and that's
a pretty cool new theme and I think I
like that so now it's finishing and it
says it's going to be a lot like Cover
Flow here at Safari for incorporates
color flow so I'm just gonna hit that
button to open a new tab that's pretty
cool one more tab so it seems to just
load this exact page every time it opens
a new tab and there you go free that's
my head top sites if I just click on it
it'll like come to the front and it
loads extremely quick almost as if it's
in the cache a already so that's a
pretty cool graphic that they've shown
us so second in Safari in the new Safari
4 beta what you can actually do here is
if I hit this button we can browse in
Cover Flow mode so if I were to go to
google.com actually that didn't work I
didn't type that correctly so let's go
to google.com and what I'm going to do
is
as a favorite and it says are you sure
you want oh yes I do so instead of
rolling scrolling in from the top it
actually opens a new window which is
pretty interesting that I can obviously
choose where I want to save that
bookmark and it'll put it in up here so
I'm gonna hit cancel cuz I already have
my bookmarks and this it says show top
sites all I have to do is click that and
it automatically brings up this window
again that's pretty cool right the home
button yes it keeps my homepage it keeps
my Google homepage change a little bit
of the buttons but that's alright and if
I go to email here I can obviously Bob
not email if I go to bookmarks I can
scroll my bookmarks in color flow that's
a big change in Safari forth that the
Cover Flow integration into Windows as
well as PCs so that's very cool that you
can do that in Safari for just click it
again to get out of bookmarks and we're
back and that's basically it guys all
the options remain the same you still
have a lot of that on that reminiscent
of Winkle Google Chrome that you can you
have all your options over here and
stuff on the Left you don't actually
have a file new thing because if I want
to go to a new tab all I have to do is
hit that new tablet so you also have the
options you have show menu bar or hide
it show or hide bookmarks bar status bar
and also you may have noticed when I was
loading the page if I were to load a
larger page here and that's cool that it
has a top site and bookmarks so
youtube.com/ you'll see it doesn't load
it has a little swirly thingy here
instead of actually loading up here so
I'm gonna get back to you guys on more
add-ons and bookmarks let's see if I hit
sign in if it remembers yes it does
remember so it still has all the
autofill so yeah I'm gonna get back to
you guys on more plugins and add-ons for
Safari and more little bugs that I can
report to you guys but that's basically
it so thanks for watching this video and
I hope you found it helpful and good
luck with installing Safari 4 on your
brand-new computer or just on your
computer so thanks for watching this
video if you have any other tutorial
ideas or requests just go ahead and
subscribe and send me a message and I'll
get back to you in a response thanks for
