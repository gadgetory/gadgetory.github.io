tutorial and in this one I'll be showing
you how to get and install the safari
for beta on your Mac or your pc so right
now I'm going to open up safari just to
show you guys that I currently have the
version of Safari you may be using so go
to help about safari and it will tell
you I have version 3.2 point2 now you
see I have a lot of favorites right here
and a lot of bookmark pages that i
actually want to keep if i want to go
back to these for further reference so
what I want to do is to actually just
upgrade my version of Safari so I'm
going to go to ww apple com go to the
downloads tab of their website and down
here you will see safari four point oh
beta for mac or pc is a thirty one
megabyte download if it is not here just
go to their search box and type in
safari and the first one will be safari
4 so just go ahead and click on the
Safari icon and it will come up with the
new safari for beta so here on this
website we're going to say we're going
to click safari for windows XP or vista
okay I'm going to uncheck this because I
don't want to put in my email just hit
that download a now button and make sure
your pc meets the minimum requirements
are going to do is hit open and it will
first start downloading the new version
of supply for beta now it says it's
going it's a little bit of a slow
download right now but it's a 25
megabyte initial download and it will
take approximately 30 megabytes on your
hard disk now i'm going to show you all
its downloading is that it's going to
look a lot more strikingly like google
chrome and that the tabs are on the top
here we're going to have an RSS button
to refresh we're going to have browsing
using coverflow okay full full page
previews of your bookmarks and getting
to know your top sites so you know i'm
just going to come back to you guys when
a safari for beta is done downloading
all right here I've resume the video and
we see that the cam cam sorry the Safari
setup.exe have been finished downloading
so we're going to
the file that's all I did was go
downstairs and come back and resume the
video so just hit the Run button and it
will bring us into the installer which I
believe will ask us for the language
first hold on and while this is actually
starting i'm just going to eggs out of
the safari 3 which is probably going to
be necessary for installing so forth
safari for anyway so let's wait for
safari safari 4 here it says safari is a
fastest and most innovative web browser
for mac and pc and we already saw but
there's going to be a ton of changes so
we're going to hit next we have to agree
to the service and license license
agreement and everything hit the accept
button and hit next and here i'm going
to install a desktop shortcut because
i'm going to eventually dragged into my
rocket dr. replace this safari and we're
going to hit install now since we did
not change the actual location of where
it's going to install it's going to
detect by itself as we follow apples
instructions here that it's actually
detecting our previous version of safari
in that folder it's going to remove that
but keep all of our favorites
preferences are autofill and all about
customizable stuff actually still in
Safari as we are we prepare for
installation here so sprees please wait
while Safari installs and this may take
several minutes so come back to you guys
when this is finished finished with this
particular step alright we're coming
back and we've come back here to the
final step as looking the old favorites
and applications and replacing them with
the same exact information but in the
newer file format or safari for so it's
finishing the installation of Safari and
if we scroll up here you'll see that
it's already put an icon on my desktop a
little shortcut for me to drag actually
into my rocket dock in the first place
so now we see it's validating the
install so let's just wait until Safari
is finished installing the application
and then we'll go into and show you a
little bit of the the new things that
have actually been incorporated into
safari for so just wait one second
alright when you've finished installing
it says congratulations so far it has
been in Sussex successfully installed
and I'm going to uncheck open Safari
after exits and I'm just going to the
finish button here in that new window
now in order to do this to drag into my
rocket dock i'm just going to
right-click on the dock and on
items here drag out the old Safari icon
and it just disappears take the new
Safari icon drag it in to where I want
it let go and then I'm going to lock it
again now you'll see the old one is
still here since this is just a shortcut
it'll obviously tell us this is just a
shortcut and i'll say yes or move it so
now we have the new safari 4.0 beta and
i'm just going to click on it to open it
let's see if it's any faster or slower
less pretty fast and right off the bat
I'm noticing that's a completely new
theme here it's using the windows Aero
of course I i made it do that my old
version of safari but the first boot of
safari is going to be totally different
first thing i want to point out is that
up here there's a little bug button
where you can report the bugs and here
we have a little introduction saying
welcome to safari 4 and here are top
sites just like google chrome it has the
top sites we have visited almost like
and it seems to be loading the top sites
that i've already visited which is
pretty cool so this is on a lot
reminiscent of google chrome first of
all the fact that you can add a new tab
just by hanging that plus button second
of all the fact that it has all your top
sites here and it's actually pretty
accurate this is my home page this is
apple com it's going to load and here's
all my old favorites which is very cool
have my website the project that I'm
doing it still has all of my bookmarks
and that's a pretty cool new theme and I
think I like that so now it's finishing
and it says it's going to be a lot like
coverflow here as safari 4 incorporates
coverflow so i'm just going to hit that
button to open a new tab that's pretty
cool one more tab so it seems to just
load this exact page every time it opens
a new tab and there you go free that's
my head top sites if I just click on it
it'll like come to the front and it
loads extremely quick almost as if it's
in a cachet already so that's a pretty
cool graphic that they've shown us so
second in safari in the new safari for
beta what you can actually do here is if
I hit this button we can browse in cover
flow mode so if I were to go to google
com actually that didn't work I didn't
type that correctly so let's go to
google.com and what I'm going to do is
add
a favorite and it says are you sure you
want oh yes I do so instead of rolling
scrolling in from the top it actually
opens a new window which is pretty
interesting that I can obviously choose
where I want to save that bookmark and
we'll put it in up here so I'm going to
hit cancel because I already have my
bookmarks and this instead show top site
so i have to do is click that and it
automatically brings up this window
again that's pretty cool right the home
button yes it keeps my homepage it keeps
my google homepage change a little bit
of the buttons but that's all right and
if i go to email here i can obviously
bomb not email if i go to bookmarks I
can scroll my bookmarks in coverflow
that's a big change in safari for that
that cover flow on integration into
windows as well as pcs so that's very
cool that you can do that in safari for
just click it again to get out of
bookmarks and we're back and that's
basically it guys all the options remain
the same you still have a lot of that on
that reminiscent of what you call google
chrome that you can you have all your
options over here instead of on the
left's you don't actually have a file
new thing because if i want to go to New
tabulae have to do is hit that new
tablet so you also have the options you
have show menu bar or hide it show or
hide bookmarks bar status bar and also
you may have noticed when I was loading
the page if i were to load a larger page
here then let's cool that it has a top
site and bookmarks so youtube com you'll
see it doesn't load it has a little
swirly thingy here instead of actually
loading up here so i'm going to get back
to you guys on more add-ons and
bookmarks and see if i hit sign in if it
remembers yes it does remember so it
still has all the autofill so yeah i'm
going to get back to you guys on more
plugins and add-ons for safari and more
little bugs that i can report to you
guys but that's basically it so thanks

found it helpful and good luck with
installing safari for on your brand-new
computer or just on your computer so
