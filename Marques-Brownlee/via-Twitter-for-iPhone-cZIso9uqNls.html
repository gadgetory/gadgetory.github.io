here so okay you may have seen on
Twitter over the past couple months a
bit of a series unfolding for those of
you who don't follow there which is
should by the way but if you don't this
is the background so I think the gal
gadot story is probably the most
recognizable or familiar of them all so
gal gadot you already know probably an
actress Wonder Woman
super popular I'm sure a very nice
person she has a Twitter unless the
celebrities are on Twitter obviously in
this day and age part of her Twitter is
that she is a huawei brand ambassador so
you know she'll have tweets about how
much she loves her Huawei phone well as
you may know Twitter has always kept the
data about what client or what device
you use to tweet from you used to need
like a third-party app to show that data
but now it just shows up in the regular
Twitter for iPhone and Twitter for
Android apps so it's public so one day
I'm in an uber and I notice gal gadot is
constantly tweeting from an iPhone and
not only that she's tweeting those ads
those sponsored Huawei posts from an
iPhone so I don't know just like the
image of her tweeting about how much she
loves her while we mate 10 Pro but from
an iPhone I thought that was pretty
hilarious
so I screenshotted it I tweeted that and
it blew up there were articles I started
getting written about it a legit made
headlines I guess it was a slow news day
that day people from Huawei ended up
reaching out to me about it emailing me
how did you find this is this real could
this be a mistake but it was a real
screenshot and eventually a gal gadot or
whoever was running her Twitter account
at that time blocks me alright so this
whole thing goes by then a couple days
later people start sending me links to
her tweets saying hey look she's
tweeting the same stuff but from Android
sure enough I go back and I'm unblocked
and I can see all the tweets again and
all those twitter for iPhone tweets are
gone and are all placed by the same ads
but via Twitter for Android well done
now I get it these celebrities or at
least most of them don't tweet
themselves that when you get to a
certain level you have a team of people
that run your social channels and you
know those people can use whatever
phones I want but I don't know there's
something funny about an
ad for a phone being shared via a
directly competing phone I don't know
maybe I'm just immature but that's still
hilarious to me so I thought that would
be it for a while but very shortly after
it started to pick up again and we've
seen this before but it started to seem
to happen with a little more frequency
so Indian actress Anushka Sharma
she's a Google ambassador she's always
tweeting about how much she loves her
pixel she's been seen in public carrying
a pixel phone and she tweeted her latest
was an ad for a shot on pixel tweeted
via Twitter for iPhone and a little
later a real verified Samsung account
tweeted an official announcement for the
Galaxy Note 9 when that phone came out
from an iPhone and then razor razor is
official announcement tweet for the
razor phone too when the embargo dropped
and that phone first was revealed to the
public on their account that was tweeted
from an iPhone and there was another
Samsung account another regional account
tweeting an official ad for a Samsung
phone of I had Twitter for iPhone then
the official Huawei Twitter account
probably one of Apple's biggest
competitors in Asia tweeted a Happy New
Year post but via Twitter for iPhone so
at this point all these are just blowing
up because every single time it's like
how hard is it to just avoid using an
iPhone for your ad for your Android
phone you could use literally any
Android phone and it would say Twitter
for Android but these people still
getting caught using iPhone there was
even an article about whoever posted
that Huawei New Year's Post from an
iPhone they deleted it and then reposted
it from an Android phone but whoever
posted it got like their their pay
docked and that their position was
demoted or something weird like that
there was real articles about that Wow
so at this point toward police are
basically in full effect people
basically sending me these left and
right and I know people have been asking
hey do you have like a team of people
dedicated just defining these oopsies no
it's just a lot of you guys have a
penchant for sending them as soon as you
notice them but there's all kinds of
others Carl Pei CEO of oneplus has
tweeted from an iPad Linus fellow
youtuber he tweeted his video all about
why
Android is better than iPhone from an
iPhone there was even one instance of
Apple tweeting from an Android this was
a bit of a stretch it's not like it was
an ad for an iPhone or anything but it
was an official account from apple the
Apple music account replying to some
tweet by ariana grande but it came from
an Android phone I guess it's just hard
to imagine someone who works at Apple
and runs their social accounts choosing
to do it from an Android phone kind of
weird but like I just I I can't jump on
all these posts anymore I can't be full
enforcement police on every single
little infraction you know how many
times somebody who's supposed to be a
product ambassador for one thing tweets
from another thing I can't be on all
that Steph Curry for example he's been
multiple times in ads for the palm phone
he's an ambassador for that he tweets
constantly from an iPhone I'm not gonna
call him out every single time there's
no point anymore like there are hundreds
of examples of people who don't have
social team's who really do get paid to
act like they use one thing and then
days later go back to using their iPhone
I don't have time for all that the
Twitter police must maintain its
integrity
we got a stick to people who are who are
sharing ads for one product directly
from the competing product those those
are still gold so that's that's
basically the summary of the whole
Twitter police thing by the way this is
not a new phenomenon this is something
that's been happening for ages and ages
one of my favorites an old classic near
and dear to my heart is a long time ago
Oprah you know noted influencer was was
caught tweeting an ad for a Microsoft
Surface tablet from an iPad not even
another iPhone from a directly competing
tablet I thought that was amazing but
one of my favorite things to come out of
this someone has actually built a tool
that allows you to scrub through Twitter
accounts I'll link it below just cuz
someone shared it to me you can scrub
through Twitter accounts to see not only
like the dates of tweets and hashtags
used but the client that that person on
their Twitter account has been sharing
from the whole history of their account
so as you can imagine I've sort of taken
the liberty to go back through some of
the Twitter accounts of note and check
them out one thing of note gal gadot has
tweeted and has left aha
Plus tweets from an iPhone on her
account but I'll give her the benefit of
the doubt and maybe they came from pre
Huawei sponsorship days so my favorite
thing I found out from this that Samsung
mobile nigeria account when i originally
called them out with that one tweet from
an iphone turns out they had 300 plus
tweets from an iphone on that official
samsung account no one really cared but
i called them out shortly after they
deleted or suspended the entire account
then a couple hours later it reappeared
and when you submit that account in for
scrubbing again there are now zero
tweets from an iphone from that account
so they went back and deleted all of
those tweets which is actually really
impressive you didn't see anything right
so what have we learned from all this
aha
that celebrity endorsements shouldn't
mean much not that they already meant a
whole lot but the original point of the
mechanics of a celebrity endorsement are
hey look people want to be more like
this celebrity will pay him or her to
say that they use something that way
other people will buy that thing so
they'll feel closer to that celebrity
like they're doing what that person does
but celebrities don't really care so the
people managing their accounts they'll
take money to say they use something but
they don't really use it and in the
world of tech it's just too easy to get
caught bottom line it should be so easy
so easy to avoid this but until then
people are gonna keep doing it it can't
hide from the Twitter police that's been
it thanks for watching catch you guys in
the next one peace
by the way if you ever catch me tweeting
an ad for an Android from an iPhone I
give you full rein to reach out and slap
me through the internet but it'll never
happen because it's just too easy to not
do</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
