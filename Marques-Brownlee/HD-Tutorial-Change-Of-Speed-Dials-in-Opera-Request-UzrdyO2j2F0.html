tutorial and in this video I'll be
showing you how to add more speed dial
boxes to the opera web browser now I'm
just going to up open up opera right
here it is my slowest opening internet
browser for Windows but nevertheless
this is a request video so I will do
this tutorial so this is the current
opera homepage that i have in a few just
open up a new page here this is what the
opera speed dial actually looks like now
you can see it's a three by three array
of custom home pages that you can
obviously delete and add web pages and
you basically have an instant search so
that's what a lot of people are
complaining about while I'm with us
safari for beta which I did another
video about and how it's a little bit
similar but some people including the
requested the requested channel have
wanted to know how do i change the
number of speed dial boxes like i can in
safari for beta well here we go in order
to do this go to the help button and
click about opera because order to do
this we need to find the file path for
the Opera directory we have it right
here in the about opera section so we're
just going to highlight this and we're
going to right click and copy and then
exit the opera web browser you do not
want to have a poor running while you
perform this operation okay then we're
going to open up your Vista start menu
and ctrl-v to paste and hit enter if you
do have if you have not got the start or
the Vista start menu just if you're an
XP or 98 or something else you can
simply paste that into Windows Explorer
so then you have this window roaming
opera opera 10 preview and it's also
working other versions of opera by the
way and profile we're going to do here
now is scroll down into the button unto
down where it says speed dial double
click on speed dial and it will bring
this up in a notepad document this isn't
even going to tell you do not edit this
file while opera is running that is fine
we're going to do is go down two spaces
here and we're going to take what i put
in the description for you and copy and
paste that so i'm going to copy with
control
I'm going to paste that into this
notepad document for speed dial so now
as you can see there's a bracket sighs
and bracket rose equals and columns
equals go ahead and send back to
whatever you like i'm going to go is
five and have say nine columns there's
something ridiculous so you can see the
changes so before it was three by three
so we're just going to file save then
exit out of this notepad document and
Windows Explorer and we are done so now
whenever we open up opera such as opera
10 alpha which I also did a video on how
to get and it will obviously bring us to
our home page again now I'm going to
open up speed down and there you go 45
home pages and that is pretty much I
mean you can put as many as you want but
I wouldn't recommend much more than this
it'll get a little confusing but there
you go you have as many home pages as
you want they still work just as fast
all right and by the way happy happy pi
day it's March 14th but um yeah that is
how you add more speed dial boxes to the
opera web browser so thank you for the
request and I hope you enjoyed this
tutorial if you have any other tutorial
ideas or requests just go ahead and send
a Percy all you have to subscribe and
then go ahead and send a request and I
will try to get to it so thanks for
watching this one and peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
