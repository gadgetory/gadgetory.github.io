this is Nexus 5x didn't forget about it
I just started testing it after I was
done with Nexus 6p I'm gonna make this
one really short and sweet because
essentially this is the same exact
software as Nexus 6p but different
hardware so in name and in person the
Nexus 5x is actually a successor to the
beloved Nexus 5 from two years ago it's
made by LG again - and it keeps a lot of
the Stormtrooper panda looks from that
phone and then brings them into the
world of 2015 specs and this is what a
lot of people were looking for in a new
Nexus and I like it a lot it keeps those
flat sides for easy grip and soft touch
finish everywhere this time and just
overall a pretty clean design even with
the huge Nexus font on the back so when
comparing it to the Nexus 5 I actually
kind of like the new design a little bit
better though with the exception of the
slightly bigger camera hump which just
means a little rock a bit if you try to
text while it's on a table but yeah
overall this phone feels good to me it's
lightweight especially when compared to
some metal phones some have said like it
feels cheap without any metal and I do
tend to agree a bit but I've had no
problems with the actual build it's put
together very well and the smaller
design makes it easier to grip than the
bigger phones especially with that
fingerprint reader which I realize might
have been harder to reach on the back of
the 6p for people with bigger hands now
in this smaller body you got a smaller
display a 5-inch 1080p panel but more
importantly it's an LCD panel now
instead of an AMOLED which means colors
are a bit less saturated and definitely
pops less but this isn't something most
people will notice until I guess you
hold it side by side with a much better
screen and 1080p at this size is still
423 PPI so it's still plenty sharp the
one place I notice the LCD making a
difference is when ambient display turns
on especially at night when you can see
the whole display light up even though
it's supposed to be black interestingly
though I didn't see this have much of an
effect on battery life and speaking of
battery that's another thing that's
different in this phone so smaller phone
equals smaller battery and the Nexus 5x
is rocking a twenty seven hundred
million Bauer cell so it's actually not
that small but it's not thirty four
hundred million powers or anything so
it's a decent size for what's inside and
battery life is pretty average I have no
problems getting through a day of what I
consider normally use you know plenty of
Twitter
email and feedly stuff like that but I
pretty much never made it past a full
day what's nice though is Android 6.0 is
best new feature is doze and I've
noticed this with pretty much every
marshmallow phone I've tested standby
time is excellent actually while I was
testing Nexus 6p I had this 5x on my
desk for literally a week still signed
in and pulling notifications and
everything and it was fine so if you're
a lighter user and your phone spends
more time in standby mode you'll have no
problem with battery life here and this
is the USB type-c phone also as we
expected with new nexuses and thankfully
there is rapid charging here even faster
terms of percentage than the 6p since
the battery is smaller so we're talking
something like four hours of use from 10
minutes of being plugged in all right
the other largest difference between
Nexus 5x and 6p would just be what's
inside the specs and as a $400 phone
Nexus 5x kind of has what you would
expect in an upper mid tier device
Snapdragon 808 and 2 gigabytes of RAM
and the performance is pretty good with
stock Android now naturally there's some
concern that since it's not super
high-end there will be some lag or delay
but I really haven't found that and
graphics performance is just pushing
1080p so it's been just fine smooth all
around the gigabyte less of RAM might be
more of an important loss if you're
someone who multitasks a lot but even so
apps open quickly and switching back and
forth between them has been a breeze and
Nexus 5x handles heavy stuff like gaming
really well - again at 1080p in fact I
think the only place I saw lag more than
once or twice was the camera app and
this is actually the same with me on the
6p after a while you can double tap the
power button to open it quickly and
sometimes it load it up nice and quick
and you can take the shot
other times it hesitated big time and
actually miss the shot so this is
probably the one app in marshmallow that
I've had any sort of performance issues
with but once you get in a groove and
use this phone with normal use it's
pretty much fine oh and speaking of the
camera this phone is rocking the exact
same optics and sensor as the Nexus 6p
so no difference in image quality there
which is great because actually actually
a pretty good camera the only minor
difference is the processor is capable
with pushing 120 frames per second slow
motion instead of 240 but if you're
interested in image quality samples I'll
have a link below to that this is a
great camera for the price of the phone
and you also have the fingerprint sensor
on the back in the same place it's a
little bit easier to reach since the
phones of it
smaller and I'm not sure if it's the
same sensor as the one in the Huawei
made 6p but it doesn't really matter
because it's also really good setup was
a breeze took less than 20 seconds
probably and this fingerprint sensor is
super quick and accurate every time I'm
glad I have it set up and that's it past
all your hardware is just stock Android
6.0 marshmallow there aren't a whole lot
of surface bells and whistles it's just
pure clean functional experience like
that we use from previous nexuses and i
think that suits this phone really well
nice and clean Hardware nice and clean
software overall oh very well rounded
device and a really nice sequel to Nexus
5 so overall with Nexus 5x it isn't the
best phone at its budget or anything
like that but it is one of the best and
really you were looking forward to Nexus
or if you're a nexus guy if you wanted a
refresh over the Nexus 5 then this is
the phone you're looking forward to so
overall that's what I recommend the
phone to people who want the Nexus
device people who want an unlock device
people who want that pure stock Android
experience and people who want to be
first in line for updates not second not
third must be first so that's what this
device will get you for the price that's
