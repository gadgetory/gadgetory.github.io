here from mkbhd and welcome to another
HD tutorial and in this one I'll be
giving you a little video on a very
popular website and you've probably used
it sometime in your life and that is
google com so as you can see by the
title there's another way to use google
com so for this example I'm going to
give you a very basic tutorial on how to
use the new google interface and it is
actually really impressive and actually
has a noticeable speed difference so
right here on the regular google com
it's it's dark blue text it does have
the light buttons and you can go to more
and expand this and check this out in
the middle you can obviously make your
search so for my example i'm going to
search android and you can hit google
search as you can see it loaded all 63
million results for android in about
point 31 seconds the web images and
video filters all remain at the top so
if we want to have another way to use
google here is something you can go to
the description of this video and paste
this code that i have in the description
of javascript code hit enter then open
google com in a new video or a new
window or a new tab and you'll be
directed to the new google com interface
this is something that Google has been
testing for a little bit and it is
really cool so now you can see the
google search button is blue and i'm
feeling lucky is also blue and this up
here is a little bit lighter blue but
that's not the only cool thing watch as
i type in the middle android we get the
same suggestions i'll google search that
and notice on the left-hand side we have
a much much more extensive custom sort
of filter for our search content so we
can search everything images and video
all in the left-hand side and also see
also related topics and this is going to
be something very helpful also you might
have noticed it's quite a bit faster on
the right hand side the same amount of
results loaded in point 22 seconds so
you can click on advanced search here
and click on a number of different
things these options have always been
available with google com but i think
the
right here is going to be the most
impressive part of the new google
interface so go ahead and take a look
around in it you know tell me what your
thoughts are in the comments section if
you have any thoughts or questions about
how to use this or what to use it for
feel free to drop a line in the
description or in the comments section
of this video so thank you for watching
and I hope you enjoy the new google com
and leave your thoughts in the
description or in the comments section
them sorry so thank you for watching
guys peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
