here from mkbhd and welcome to an update
video 4.0 since I'm kind of starting and
new here however you wanted to find that
but yeah welcome to update video 4.0
let's just get right into this guys so
as you all know or at least I hope you
all know this channel was actually
suspended from YouTube for two long
weeks and all the videos were down a few
people noticed instantly because of
Twitter and then it kind of spread and
people realized that my channel was
suspended and it was wrongly suspended I
contacted YouTube
I got everything back and I'm really
happy to say that all my videos are back
all my subscribers are still here still
watching my videos and it means a lot to
me that you guys are still watching so
first of all thank you for that it means
a lot to me guys the second thing I want
to get into is um I really am NOT going
to be applying for a partnership again
not maybe not till I have maybe 10,000
subscribers I can do without a banner
really for much longer it's not really
my goal here on YouTube but I want to do
a the whole reason I'm making these
videos which are tutorials and unboxings
and reviews is to help people so people
can watch the video and know what they
need to know about the product that's
the point of views videos so the fact
that they're back up on YouTube means a
lot to me obviously and I mean a
partnership isn't going to do much
except allow me to have an awesome
banner and upload more than 10-minute
videos so I guess I'll just do the whole
part 1 part 2 thing for the intro
tutorial and all that so I'm not going
to be applying for that for a very long
time the third thing I want to say is um
the new YouTube mega widescreen which is
actually actually getting to be
annoyingly wide now do you guys really
want me to produce my videos in that
1920 by 960 which I'm realizing is a 2
to 1 aspect ratio I don't know it's just
it just seems really really wide and I'm
the way the YouTube works is if you
upload a video that is not the full
widescreen
the YouTube player with the play/pause
and the HQ and all that at the bottom
won't fill up the whole YouTube wide
screen so it kind of makes your video
look like it's fitting but it's really
not
anyway what
you guys want to see you want to see me
guys stretch the video just a little bit
to make it fit the YouTube wide screen
or just leave it in 1280 by 720 16 by 9
so that's the main question of this
video and I want you guys to answer that
last but not least um as the school year
moves on I'm going to be balancing a
varsity sport a couple of AP classes as
well as this YouTube channel and it's
the time is really limited for me to
make film script and edit these videos
so I'm thinking there's going to be a
mix of between three to five videos per
week which is still a lot I know a lot
of you guys don't get to log on to
YouTube that often but it's going to be
three to five videos per week
um don't add space to just going to be
it so that's the frequency I'm going to
aim to upload my videos I'm gonna spend
a lot of time with them obviously I'm
going to be editing them I'm going to be
writing the scripts I'm going to be
making sure everything is good and easy
to understand so that's why it'll takes
a lot to make a video last but not least
I was thinking of making a video or a
video series of Ken your Mac do this
sort of series of videos now I don't
know if it was going to be too
controversial or or if it was just going
to get in the way of my tutorials but
let me let me know what you guys think
of that but first of all what do you
think of you in your YouTube mega
widescreen because that's my first
priority with making videos but yeah can
your Mac do this kind of tutorial for
your your PC users out there I know I
know a lot of my users are Mac os10
users but hey might as well give it a
shot right in summation I will be
applying for YouTube partnership at a
very long time time in the future maybe
ten thousand subscribers this is up day
4.0
thinking of using the new YouTube make a
widescreen not sure yet and making a can
your Mac do this video playlists or
spreading it out during the upload of my
videos anyway thanks for watching this
update video and thank you for watching
all of my videos of course and I hope
you continue to rate comment and
subscribe and um just help me out
spreading the word about my products and
the reviews that I do so thank you very
much for watching and I'll talk to you
guys in the next video
it's
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
