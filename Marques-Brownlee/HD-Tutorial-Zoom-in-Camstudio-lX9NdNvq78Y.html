to be able to show you guys how to get
the zoom effect in camstudio screen
recorder so first of all you're going to
open a link provided in the description
I'm gonna just copy that so I can give
it back to you now and actually upload
the video it's the workers collection
comm and it's called the magnifying
glass there is improvers if you want to
buy it but then I demonstrate how to get
the free version it's a very very small
download it's the it's only half a
megabyte so I'm just gonna click on it
and hit open and it's already done
downloading so I'm going to hit open
again and it's going to open this
Explorer where I can extract all these
files so first of all I'm going to exit
our internet browser simply no longer
need this what I'm going to do is just
hit the extract all files button and
find a place that I want to expect it so
I'll go into my documents and I made a
file just for program documents that I'm
downloading so I hit OK and make sure
you have this button checked to show
extracted files when complete
hit drop it in wait for this to finish
copying just 5 items less than a
megabyte and that is done so we have
this then all the extracted files will
be in one folder
hopefully let's go ahead and look for
that folder right now and it should be
called set up set up Magne glass
magnifying glass setup so I'm just gonna
double click on setup and UNC pops up
which is obviously invisible camstudio
but if you have that disabled that won't
come out so this will install it on to
your computer
we're going to go through the typical
setup process hit next a ton of times
and it is launch the application when
this is actually done
the finish button and this is the
magnifying glass application so
basically what we're going to do is say
we're going to run it out windows
startup and we're going to show us after
the application startup
and I'm going to obviously it's only
available in English and Russian which
is interesting but I'm speaking English
and my hotkey is going to be ctrl shift
f3 just just actually now it's gonna be
ctrl shift
hue so it says if you're a hot key
combination resetting when you enter
suck the hot key combination well that's
basically unimportant what I'm gonna say
is those two go to basic options I'm
going to say full visible transparency
for this is for Windows 2000 or XP so it
won't really matter if you're in Vista
and zoom factor I'll go ahead and say
two and a half and then we're going to
we can set the size of the actual zoom
I'm going to mess around with this here
it's not going to be a big difference so
that's what I'm going to use and
Advanced Options issues it to being
contrast mode negative I'm sure you've
seen in all those picture effects and
also fixed game and broken to me also
use quite a bit of CPU so I'm gonna just
say no and offset from cursor we don't
want any offset from cursor I'm gonna
lower that actually I'm gonna leave it
at the default just to see what it's
like that's pretty good
next we want to do this is a pro version
so we really don't need to look into
that because we haven't actually paid
for the pro version so that is all the
options that we can fit so our hot keys
ctrl shift Q now anytime we want I'm
going to just go ahead and open any
random My Documents folder here
control shift Q and there you see it
it's a little bit offset for my cursor
which I might not actually like and so
I'm gonna change I'm gonna change a few
things I'm going to exit up and down
here in my system tray its magnifier so
I'm going to go to options again to
bring up this menu at any time I wanted
to erase any offset from my cursors what
is directly on top of my cursor and I'm
going to
decrease the zoom factor a little bit
and make it more widescreen so let's see
360 by 240 I'm gonna go working right
now on 360 by now I'm recording in 640
by 360 so I'm gonna go ahead and make it
a 100 100 by 200 for the sake of showing
you guys so now when I open up let's see
calculator and I want to show you what
button exactly I am pressing there you
go you see exactly what it is and in the
window so on that's just a quick way to
get zoom in camstudio you may have
already seen my tutorial about how to
use them your mouse to get a much larger
version is although that does make the
screen blink if you just run completely
wait turned completely black with your
microphone but then you can see quite
vividly what exactly I'm clicking on or
the again the built-in magnifying glass
feature into Windows Vista so yeah
that's another way that you can
customize your magnifier in windows in
camstudio so I hope you like this
tutorial thanks for watching and
subscribe peace
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
