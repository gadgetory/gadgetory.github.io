here from mkbhd and welcome to another
HD unboxing video and in this one I'm
going to be unboxing something that is
going to be become a very big part of my
youtube channel from here on out this is
something you're going to be seeing or
hearing from and all the rest of my
hardware related videos and if you
haven't guessed that our reddit already
yes this is the unboxing of my new age D
camcorder the Sanyo exactly C G 10 so
let's just get right on into this guys I
am using the microphone quality I
actually already dug into this because
my knife does take while open but I am
using the quality of the microphone of
gia the camera you're seeing right now
just for a comparison so that when I do
some test footage with this new
camcorder you guys be able to see and
hear the quality difference so here's
the actual packaging box as you can see
it is advertised highly as a dual camera
I will of course include the links to
everything you need to know about this
camera in the description so let's just
get right on into the actual packaging
so I can show you guys what's in the box
and we'll se what looks good from here
so here we go
so you'll notice right on top is a lot
of paper and I'll get this all out for
you guys this is all in one language I
believe actually this is not English so
here you go there's a whole lot of paper
really not much you need to read some
instruction manuals some safety
instructions and a really big booklet
about the software so let's get right
into the hardware so I'm talk everything
before the camera so right here we have
a little lanyard for the lens cap which
makes sense we have our AV cables to the
usb we have the USB to proprietary USB
for the Sanyo camera keep going we have
the battery charging so here we have
what we plug into the the cord which
plugs into the wall
I kind of would have preferred a little
flip out cord and just plug this
straight into the wall
something where I would have been able
to use the camcorder while it's charging
but I'd actually don't mind this this is
what I have with my current camera setup
keep going we'll find the actual battery
which is very similar to the battery
we're using on the camera you're
watching from which is by the way an
olympus Fe 370 here's the actual Sanyo
exacty lens clip little handy thing
definitely want to protect the most
important part of the camera the lens
and that looks like about it and here is
the camera itself so it is a handheld
camera the most important statistics
really are that it does shoot in 720p HD
at 30 frames a second and 60 frames a
second VGA resolution and takes 10
megapixel photos so here it is guys it's
a really nice size I really like this
here you see all the navigation buttons
I'll be getting into these in the review
video and there's your lens so of course
I'll be putting a lens cap on this very
soon there's the flash for the 10
megapixel photos and a big part of the
camera that I'll be looking at whenever
I shoot the 3-inch LCD and that's
actually a lot bigger than I thought it
was it's 16 by 9 and this of course will
be shooting in an mpeg-4 format inside
here is your power button and inside
over here is where you can throw in that
SD slot which is actually in the net
right now from Newegg so that stuff's
just a brief unboxing and I'll
definitely have some some sample footage
for you guys in one of the coming videos
and I'm really excited to get to use
this camera but anyway this has been our
unboxing of the Samuel exactly CG 10
hope you guys like it and I can't wait
to get start filming with this camera so
thank you for watching guys peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
