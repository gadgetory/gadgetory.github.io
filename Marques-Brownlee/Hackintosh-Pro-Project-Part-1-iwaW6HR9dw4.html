happy apocalypse since it is the 21st
today as I record this and welcome to
the hackintosh pro project so I've done
a couple of projects over the course of
2012 and this will be the first project
that begins around the beginning of 2013
the purpose of this project or this
series is to create a beast of a video
editing machine for the beginning of
2013 now a lot of people have already
done their own PC builds especially
Windows 8 builds for the beginning of
2013 that's pretty cool in fact we're
giving one away already on this channel
very soon so there is a link to enter to
win that one it's a $600 build but the
one that makes this one a little bit
different is objective number two of
this series which is this bill will be
able to dual boot windows and OS 10 body
you might not know but I've been using a
Mac Pro for the past couple of months
basically for my video production and
I've gotten very used to the OS 10
environment so I'm going to continue
using OS 10 now is using it hoping that
Apple would release you know a new Mac
Pro with actually very powerful chip
soon but they just slacked on that so
we're taking our own initiative here and
building our own hackintosh now when you
consider an OS 10 machine for video
editing a lot of things come to mind but
you kind of have to rule out the laptops
because they're not really quite as
powerful and aren't really a depth of
video editing at least fluidly anyway I
know the retina MacBook Pros are more
powerful but we're rolling in that also
because the fans are a little loud so
that leaves the Mac Mini which is
basically a glorified laptop so we're
going to put that aside then you have
the iMac which isn't very upgradable
except for the RAM which you can only
max out once you wipe that aside as well
you only have the Mac Pro and the
hackintosh hackintosh for those of you
who don't already know is essentially
taking your own parts and putting them
all together and installing OS 10 on it
this will work with a very specific
bunch of parts that work together and
you have to do your research to figure
out what parts work but in future videos
in this series I'll be documenting the
selection process and all that kind of
stuff to making this work with OS 10 and
the newest version of Windows I'm not
sure if I want to do Windows 7 or
Windows 8 because I'm so used to Windows
7 but you guys leave a comment below
we'll be able to pick now the reason I'm
going with the hackintosh besides
picking my own parts and besides taking
an issue over apples delayed new Mac Pro
is price you might have
known already that the Mac Pros are very
expensive for what they start at and an
equivalently specked out hackintosh
which is your own parts might cost half
of what the Mac Pro cost so we'll be
documenting like I said during this
video series
everything about this the parts that we
use to build process the install process
the how-to everything about it is going
to be covered in the video series and I
hope you guys are ready for that so this
is just a sort of a pile of video to
introduce you guys to the concept the
rest of the stuff is coming very soon
we're going to start to pick parts we're
going to start to build this thing and
then we're going to roll on with the
series and get to you know benchmark
testing gaming whatever else we do on
Windows or OS 10 and actual video
editing and we might see something
special at the end of the series so stay
tuned for that and leave a thumbs up if
you're excited or you like the idea of
this series and want to see it move
forward you can also leave parts
suggestions below if you have a specific
set of parts or if you have to see a
certain graphics card in it let me know
and I'll consider it but more
importantly I kind of want to know if
this should do a boot with Windows 8 and
mountain lion or Windows 7 and online
because I haven't even used Windows 8 on
a desktop yet I've been using it almost
entirely on a laptop so let me know
other than that that's basically it I
hope you guys liked the idea of the
project it will be moving forward soon
like I said but not without your
suggestions and your feedback so again
thumbs up and comments are definitely
appreciated and uh yeah it's almost
Christmas and whatever holidays you
celebrate are probably right around the
corner so Happy Holidays
I'm home for holidays as you can
probably already tell but uh I'll see
you guys in the next video
thanks for watching
peace
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
