this one I will be showing you how to
run a program in compatibility mode if
you're having issues with it in windows
vista first of all if you you're using
Windows XP and or Windows Vista and
using a program that was actually built
for the other operating system say I was
having problems with notepad you want to
first of all put that icon on your
desktop once this icon is on my desktop
I'm going to right click it and hit
properties will bring up a window as you
can see here what I'm going to click the
Pat ability tab it's just intuitive of
course and it'll say do you want to run
the program in compatibility mode and
I'm just going to if you are if this
program will allow you to this box won't
be grayed out and you can actually check
that box and select from the list which
one you want to running a pat ability
mode for so obviously notepad does not
have a compatibility mode let's say I
was having problems with Microsoft Word
maybe the microsoft works word processor
I don't actually have to open it i bet
i'll click inward dragon icon to the
desktop of it and say yes of course i
want to drive you to the desktop UI see
so from here i'm going to right click it
and properties just to see if i can
actually work it in compatibility mode
and there are no compatibility mode for
if you actually are having a problem
with a program and you need to try to
attempt to run it in compatibility mode
for an older operating system this is
completely fine it will it might look a
little bit different than I think some
slightly different user interface
changes there might be a little
different it might be just an older
version or I just have a different look
to it so oh no that is a quick way to
get your programs to work in
compatibility mode here we go this you
just check this box and you'll get a
little drop-down of all these older
operating systems say I want to pick 95
I will just click on it and hit apply
and it would always run in compatibility
mode you can also run it in a widow such
as a 640 by 480 window you can change to
run to disable visual themes to say have
it run faster
certain things like this run as an
administrator so that's how you run a
program in compatibility mode thanks for
watching guys hope this helps and for
more tutorials should subscribe and if
you have any ideas for a HT tutorial
just send me a personal message thanks
for watching peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
