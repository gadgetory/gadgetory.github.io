here from mkbhd and welcome to another
Age 2 tutorial in which I'll be showing
you a piece of freeware called desktube
which is actually a YouTube viewing
client in which you don't actually go
into your browser and view YouTube
videos but you can interact with
youtube.com through a piece of free Wix
so let's just get right into this guys
so like I said before desktube is the
name of the piece of software and I'll
provide a link in the description for
you guys to go ahead and download this
piece of software but I once you've
downloaded and installed it you will
actually have a number of shortcuts one
in your Start menu one in your quick
launch bar and one on your desktop so
for the purpose of this tutorial I've
left the one on my desktop and here's
what it looks like so I'm gonna double
click this so you guys can see how long
it takes to open and just like that
you've opened up desktube so it's
probably going to take about as long as
it does for youtube.com to open there's
actually a new release bug fix but I'm
going to cancel that so I can get on
with this tutorial and show you guys so
many things about desk dude so this is
best tube itself basically you have a
number of options along the top a number
of sub options as kind of a second layer
a search box over here on the left hand
side a YouTube player and some video
scanning you know privileges so up here
on the top obviously when you're signed
in you'll be able to view a number of
things you can hit the watch button to
simply watch videos hit playlists and
you'll go ahead and log in now I'll just
log into mkbhd 0 and hit the login
button and you'll be able to view all
your playlists I actually don't have any
playlists but when you open one it opens
in a separate window which is actually a
nice feature in some cases but in other
cases not so much I'll get into that so
you have playlists you have your
subscriptions which also opens up in a
second window you have the ability to
record videos directly in here and
upload it to YouTube so that's a great
feature something you would have
expected in a Mac os10 equivalent such
as QuickTime X you can upload videos
from this client you can also a video
chat and update your Twitter and
Facebook status in desktube
so one of the advantages of the desktube
desktop youtube video player is that you
can actually record and upload videos
directly from this client and it'll
actually be a pretty good speed and
quality too for example if you see the
record button up here on the right hand
side if you click this record button
it'll actually bring up this quick
capture widget in its own separate
window and you can go ahead and have
your preview right there so you can just
be dragging it to the top of the screen
where your webcam is and looking
directly at it and you'll be able to
record your video pressing that button
right there you can adjust volume grain
and video quality and then upload your
video straight from there once you're
done recording obviously you can upload
it using this upload button right here
you select a file and you go ahead and
upload it and it's pretty darn quick
guys so another thing that I like about
the desktube player is that you can
actually watch videos in a pop-out
window which is actually something
that's been available on YouTube as a
new feature for about a month now and I
kind of like that you're able to do this
say I'm watching this jumbo fun video
right here in the main YouTube player or
the desktube player all you have to do
up at the top right hand side is hit
that little arrow out button click it
and it will open up your video in
widescreen high quality in a new video
window so you don't have to worry about
any sort of distractions while watching
your YouTube video it's right there in
the middle your screen perfectly clean
desktop pop out player and it works very
nicely when you're done watching the
video just legs it out and it brings
back up the desk tube home page the last
notable feature of the desk tube player
are the subcategories underneath the
usual expected now as you guys know
YouTube can sort its videos by top rated
top favorited most viewed etcetera you
can actually view these categories in
the desktube player and it's quite
nicely integrated all you have to do is
select your category by clicking and it
will sort them in the left hand side by
most view now these are most viewed of
all time so we might want to change that
to most viewed of a certain time period
but you get the point most discussed
over here on the right hand side or
recently featured etc all of these
videos will show up in the left hand
side of the desk tube player the last
notable feature of the desktube widget
and also what I think is one of the most
interesting features is that you can
actually view a YouTube video before you
click it meaning a small 10 to 15 second
preview of the video before you actually
click on it to comment rate and interact
in other ways with the video so go ahead
and hover over the thumbnail and you
notice a red swipe across and an audio
and video playback follows that and ends
up being your video preview all you have
to do is move your mouse off of the
preview and your preview is pretty much
played now you know if you want to watch
the video or not
so overall guys I really like the
desktube player it's it's looking pretty
flashy I like the way that it runs it's
very nice clean almost a metallic sort
of look so I do like the way it looks
there are a few pros a few cons with
this player but overall I have to say if
I were to give this a hardware sort of
rating I know I don't do that often I
would give this an 8 out of 10 it's a
very solid player I'd give it a B so I'm
I'd like to thank you guys for watching
this hardware this software review I
apologize and I'm just going to exit out
desktube here but if you guys do want to
download the software your link will be
in the description and I hope you guys
enjoyed this tutorial and thank you for
supporting the mkbhd youtube channel and
thank you for watching this video so
again talk to you guys in the next video
