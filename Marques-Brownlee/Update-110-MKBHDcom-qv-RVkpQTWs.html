it's that time of year again with all
sorts of device stuff and reviews new
gadgets and of course dope tech right
around the corner but I wanted to take
this opportunity to quickly introduce
you to a new creation mkbhd comm so it's
all kinds of different ways to use a
website as a youtuber and also a whole
bunch of different reasons too as well
mkbhd comm is going to be sort of a
secondary hub for stuff that can't
otherwise go on the YouTube channel so
it should be able to host stuff like
photo samples from new smartphone
cameras that's something I have up there
now and other stuff like little written
tidbits every now and then infographics
little diagrams just stuff to accompany
the videos that I couldn't otherwise put
in the video itself so that's the kind
of stuff that's up there right now and
then it's also gonna be sort of a hub
for any sort of merch related stuff so
right now that means the one day left to
get an mkbhd
version to plugged in tea and also a
brand new store with dbrand so you know
I've said before I'm not really a big
cases on smartphones kind of guy and
nine times out of ten if a phone is
slippery or if I feel the need to change
the look or texture that'll just grab a
skin for so four different phones I have
different styles of skin that I'd
usually want to get usually carbon-fibre
usually red or black and in the D brand
mkbhd store you can actually for any
phone they support grab a skin in the
exact configuration that I would get it
so pick a phone any phone check out the
listing and that's the skin I would grab
for it it's a three pack and there's
cutouts where I would get them no
cutouts why I wouldn't
etc now of course the site is super
early this is day one so it has plenty
of room to grow and that's actually what
I want to focus on is branching out and
making it good at other things and I'll
eventually as stuff like I think a gear
list is something I want to add because
right now the gear list of things I use
is just the Amazon link that I have in
the description and half the stuff I use
isn't on Amazon anymore anyway
so that would kind of be a nice thing to
host on the site a much prettier much
more complete version of a gear list and
then maybe other stuff I want host like
for example you guys asked for like raw
video samples or 3ds from the weapon
camera I'm using that kind of thing or
maybe other files that I want to host
well yeah it's early so go over to check
it out definitely let me know what you
think and leave any feed
my way send it to me on Twitter hit me
up let me know now I say on Twitter
because the comments section below is
for a fun little giveaway these are two
Nexus 5 X's two of them I don't need to
so one of them I'm gonna be giving away
so if you live anywhere on earth it's an
international giveaway for the next one
week feel free to leave a comment below
about Nexus 5x and I'll pick one random
lucky winner and announce that winner on
Twitter so I definitely gonna want to
follow over there and yes the review of
this guy along with its bigger brother
and many other crispy things are coming
up very soon spoiler I like it a lot
anyway yeah that's it for the quick
update the site is now live for those of
you who've been waiting for it to check
out and give us feedback and it will
definitely be growing as we get ideas
anyway thanks for watching this one and
I'll talk to you as the next one days</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
