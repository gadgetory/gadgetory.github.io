everything you have great relationship
with your customers already you guys
have tons of money you know we got a
great system going on we give you money
you give us great stuff people love you
it's wonderful and it's obvious that
Lots people already know about you so
you're doing a good job that's obvious
but there are just a few things like
here's one question for example are you
guys patent troll steer Apple now your
computers are all white and shiny and
beautiful and silver aluminum kind of
style that's nice and everything but
watch you guys make some black computers
remember the black MacBook remember how
well that did remember how most people
like that imagine a black Mac Pro a
black iMac a new black Mac Mini that
would be really freaking cool people
would love that
dear Apple what's the deal with your
mice you guys over at Apple have a long
gruesome history of awful terrible
pathetic mice not ergonomic at all not
comfortable at all just bad mice and
they finish off the line up with the
Mighty Mouse and the Magic Mouse two of
the worst mice I've ever seen from such
a big company what's going on with that
dear Apple please refresh the Mac Pro
skier Apple when you guys going to take
a risk with iOS I mean I know that
people really like it the mantra is kind
of if it ain't broke don't fix it and
it's simple and it works and everything
but take a risk sometime now maybe it's
time for a little bit of an overhaul I
mean people have been using the iPhone
since the first generation three or four
years with the same boring OS it's
gotten stale even someone like me who's
been using iOS for about a month is
bored with it on certain devices so I
might be scared of breaking it
my motto is kind of if it ain't broke
don't break it but you can still make it
better improve upon it just something to
think about
dear Apple this is something not a lot
of people know about your customer
support isn't very good your technical
support isn't very technical
something that is published that
actually is the case on this one we
haven't published okay I also had one
other quick question just because of
what monitor I wanted to use with it do
you know what the maximum resolution I
could get out of it is if I could use a
30-inch 2560 by 1600 monitor
is there an adapter I could use because
I don't have a thunderbolt monitor this
is a dil 30-inch monitor sweet still I'm
still thinking about it I'm trying to
build actually the world's fastest Mac
Mini so if the bottom line is Apple
you're doing a great job
you're a great company people love you
and that's pretty obvious keep doing
what you're doing well but there are
something certain people are waiting for
like that Mac Pro come on now today go
if you guys agree with me about any of
the things you saw in this video feel
free to give it a thumbs up it really
does help out and if you have anything
else you'd like to see from Apple you
should probably leave then and comment
down below we can get maybe like a list
going of all the greatest stuff Apple
hasn't done yet either way thanks for
watching this video thanks for
subscribing to my channel if you have
already and I'll talk to you guys in the
next video thanks for watching
peace
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
