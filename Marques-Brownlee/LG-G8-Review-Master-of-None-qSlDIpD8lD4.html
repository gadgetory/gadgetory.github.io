okay so the title a little harsh
yes but it's true so you know the saying
jack of all trades but master of none
that is the LGG eight thin queue in a
nutshell it's pretty decent at pretty
much everything in fact you probably
wouldn't regret getting one but it
doesn't stand out in any major way for
820 bucks
above the competition to actually give
you a reason to go get one
so yeah a little harsh but it's true so
you can start with the design of this
phone it's nothing special it's familiar
to a lot of people who have seen other
LG or 2019 phones
it's a slab of glass with rounded
corners there's a power button in a good
place
volume rocker on the other side Google
assistant below those so there's
absolutely nothing wrong with it at all
it's just very plain you know like I
hate to encourage you know going crazy
or making weird choices just to be
different in design but I feel like
maybe they need a bit of a stronger
identity here like if I asked you to
describe an lg phone in a couple words
what even comes to mind really you know
so I'll say this red color definitely
pretty cool it is also still a
fingerprint magnet though like the other
colors which are grey and black but also
the cameras on the back are totally flat
so this is one of the few phones I can
actually say they really have no camera
bump at all so this is one of them which
is nice but I also think it makes it the
sneaky slipperiest phone of all time but
other than that nothing really stands
out to me you know it's a design it's a
smart phone so you get a 6.1 inch
display up front and it's quite good
it's super high resolution 1440p and
plenty bright not the brightest but it's
viewable outdoors and with a very
average notch up at the top and we'll
talk more about why the notch is so big
in a bit but the side bezels are a
little bit more than slim it's kind of
feeling like the galaxy s 10 II or the
iPhone 10 are as far as bezel size
anyway and then the normal stuff at the
bottom is which you'd seen any other LG
phone you still have your USB see still
your boombox speaker still your
headphone jack backed by a high-quality
DAC this phone is IP 68 water-resistant
and it still has wireless charging over
all the builders good it's not
really like missing anything although
there are two things to note one this
boombox speaker it still has at the
bottom for some reason sounds worse to
me I know it's worse than I remember
like it's pretty flat and hollow
sounding and of course it still comes
from the bottom corner of the phone so
it's easy to block by accident but
number two the other thing is if you
actually look up at the top of the phone
where the earpiece normally is this
phone doesn't have one instead they have
a speaker behind the glass called
crystal sound OLED which fires from sort
of the top third of the phone which to
my ear sounded just like a normal phone
call in terms of quality and volume but
I could also sort of hear this buzzing
like a thin rattling sound that you
don't normally hear in a normal speaker
so that's the first time I've actually
heard one of these replacement speakers
sound a bit weird but it's not a deal
breaker for me because I don't make that
many phone calls in the first place and
the bonus is it can sort of act like
bone conduction and it works in more
than just the top eighth of the phone
okay so the specs ready Snapdragon a
fifty-five six gigs of ram 128 3500
they're fine there's no upgraded version
with like eight gigs of ram or something
and if you want more storage you have to
go with microsd which is kind of a
bummer considering we have phones with
way more internal storage for people who
do lots of things on their phones and
the battery size it's fine it's not
pushing the limits or anything it's
bigger than the galaxy s tens battery
but it's not pushing the 4040 200
million towers we see on some other big
phones so the specs are fine and the
performance through LG software has been
pretty smooth and predictable except for
scrolling for some reason so overall I
think LG skin is fine again I've used
that word a lot it hasn't changed much
since last year so the Settings app is
still a little overwhelming it still
buries some things but for the most part
things flow pretty smoothly and you can
easily get used to it but for some
reason the scrolling physics especially
in the app drawer are super stuttery
and it's been a while now and really
weird for a new phone like this to
straight-up stutter so
almost feel like this is a bug since the
rest of the phone is fine but yeah
definitely got to mention that overall
though performance just using the phone
every day through LG's software it's
fine now I don't want to make this just
a list of reasons not to buy this phone
so some of the good stuff are my
favorite things about this phone are on
the back and it's the two cameras og was
one of the first to consistently do that
ultra wide over the years that we're
just now starting to see on the backs of
phones everywhere and they still do it
the sad thing for them is it was so easy
to copy that now everyone just added an
ultra wide and they're now all caught up
it's not like LG mastered the ultra wide
in a special way so the cameras here are
pretty fun but they're not incredibly
unique or anything but I like the
consistency of these cameras it's a
confident shooter it's fast the
colorscience is pretty good it doesn't
over expose that often and the
similarity in color between the 12
megapixel standard camera and the 16
megapixel ultra wide I think is actually
better than why ways and Samsung's
and even in the camera UI is the nice
little things like the zoom with the
shutter icon that are a nice touch the
camera is good in the g8 and again so
many others have gotten so good that you
just have to wonder about the ones who
don't get it right like the razors and
one pluses of the world but I guess
that's a rant for another video
now if you've noticed pretty much
everything so far about this phone's
been it's good it's fine you know
so you would think there's got to be
something about this phone that takes it
to the next level that really makes it
stand out above the rest to make it LG's
flagship so I guess for LG those things
are hand ID and air motion yeah so the
notch up here in the phone is so big
because LG has dropped a few extra
sensors up there including a
time-of-flight camera and at an infrared
blaster and a receiver to be able to
read and identify and track your hand
and its movements so with hand ID you're
supposed to be able to just hover it
over your phone to unlock it and with
air motion you're supposed to be able to
open apps and control media and things
like that without touching your phone
and I will say it is a cool idea
I kind of wish it works better than it
did but in practice as you can probably
understand from my tone and from the
first impressions video it's far from
ideal it's usable at best but it's not
good so with hand ID first
I mean it works but you have to hold
your hand in a very specific distance
and spot around in front of the phone
and the learning curve even for me was
just a bit too much and it just makes
you not want to use it plus straight up
the feedback on the screen to help you
correct yourself is blocked by your hand
that you're trying to unlock it with so
yeah I mean it has a fingerprint reader
on the back I just turned off hand ID
and use the regular fingerprint reader
like I think most people will and then
err motion to be fair it seems to be a
tiny bit more responsive than when I
first tried it in the impressions video
a little while ago specifically the
volume knob actually seems to be more
responsive now and easier to trigger
correctly and then the twisting motion
tracks really well which is awesome put
the rest of it like the waving to the
left or right to open apps or take your
screen shot it's not really better than
just using the buttons on the phone or
even better using the Google assistant
button that's already there on the side
of the phone to just ask it to open an
app for you it's probably faster also
this is how long it takes to pause
something that's playing so you have
music playing someone causey oh wait
hold on one second let me just let me
just pause the music give me a second
hold up pause what was that yeah you
might as well just just hit the button
and say yeah at the end of the day it
seems tough to even say the g8 is worth
buying even though it's a pretty good
phone like overall the g8 does have a
good build quality it has good software
and a good set of cameras all around but
that's just a testament to how good
phones have gotten around it over the
past couple years I think in my heart it
feels unfair to say oh the pixel has a
better camera and the p30 has a bigger
battery and the galaxy s10 has a
headphone jack like you're pulling from
all these different phones to try to
beat up on this little guy and say it's
not good so I'll make it simple for you
if you were thinking about buying an lg
g8 just buy a galaxy s10 II instead
because there isn't a single thing that
this phone does better than the s10 II
and the s10 is cheaper like the g8 has a
regular and an ultra-wide camera that
are pretty good the s10 II has those two
and they're just as good the display on
the g8 is pretty good it's very big and
it's high resolution but the display on
the s10 II is excellent
it has less of a notch as smaller bezels
better colors and better brightness the
g8 has a headphone jack bus so does the
s10 II the fingerprint reader on the
back is pretty standard and it's better
than hand ID but I'd argue the
fingerprint reader in the power button
of the s10 II is better the battery life
is fine here and it's fine there you
know the software Samsung software just
got a lot better
and I'll Jesus kind of saying the same
so there's no real reason that stands
out to buy an LG g8 over that phone and
vein ID isn't it sorry hand ID just not
the one now if this one was 700 bucks or
650 then the reason to buy it would be
that it's cheaper than the rest that
would be its main advantage but even
that's not true yet and I think with
LG's history and kind of knowing where
this phones at that may eventually be
the case with discounts but until that
happens don't buy an LG g8 jack of all
trades master of none thanks for
watching catch e has the next one bass</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
