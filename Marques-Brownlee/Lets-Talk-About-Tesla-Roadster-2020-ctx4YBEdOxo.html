that rooster - so last night as many of
you probably know if you're a tech fan
at all you've watched these before there
was a Tesla event and this one was for
the unveiling mostly as we all knew it
for the semi-truck so we finally got our
first look at it you know Elon rolled up
on stage driving one got out of the
thing looks like there's two versions of
it comes in a sort of a space gray dark
version one big one small
500 mile range the 0-60 in five seconds
when there's no payload or zero to 60 in
20 seconds with an 80,000 pound payload
a thing will recharge to 400 miles in
half an hour has a Center seated driving
console autopilot all these cool things
about it looks really cool but I know
I'm not a truck driver so I'm probably
never gonna actually even sit in one of
those that was the main story of the
event and then it kind of looked like it
was ending the lights dimmed and then
they came back on and there was music
and it became this sort of a one more
thing Tesla pulled one more thing and
out of the back of one of the trailers
attached to the Tesla truck they rolled
a Tesla Roadster 2.0 the new one the one
that we all knew was eventually coming
but didn't know we'd ever see see Tesla
didn't have much of a reputation when
the original roadster came out that was
this two-door car that was essentially
the body of a Lotus but with the
electrics of Tesla the motors and the
batteries and it was a sort of a weird
Frankenstein hybrid car not the most
practical thing not the most comfortable
but boy was that thing zippy and from
what I've heard very fun to drive but it
doesn't supercharge the way Model S's do
it's not one of their flagship cars they
had problems they didn't sell a lot
there's a couple hundred or a couple
thousand sold and that was it then there
were rumors there were rumors of maybe
they'll bring that back maybe there will
be a Roadster 2.0 there was some Elon
tweets here and there there's some Tesla
hinting but we never actually see
anything until last night so they roll
that thing off the truck and it looks in
my opinion absolutely incredible it
looks great it looks like a Tesla and a
lot of the ways and a lot of the curves
but it has cues from others cues from
Porsche a little bit from Aston Martin
it's got some some McLaren lines to it
so it's a really aggressive really
good-looking sports car it's
be clear immediately that he's about to
talk to us about the new roadster and he
is and then he gives us the specs and
I'm a spec person I like numbers but
there's not a lot of spec sheets that
can just make me kind of speechless
essentially especially coming from
someone who's driven and owned a P 100 D
for a while which has a silly spec sheet
by itself spec sheet of the new roadster
0 to 60 miles per hour in 1.9 seconds
1.9 seconds zero to a hundred miles an
hour in 4.2 seconds it'll run out a
quarter mile in eight point eight or
eight point nine seconds I've seen both
from their their website in their third
presentation but it's a sub nine second
quarter mile it'll have a top speed of
quote over 250 miles per hour and this
all will come from the floor mounted 200
kilowatt hour battery pack so twice the
size of the P 100 D it has three motors
two for the back wheels and one for the
front wheels and it'll do 620 miles of
621 miles rated for a charge so that
massive battery is actually getting you
not just awesome performance for motors
but a really long range it'll be the
first electric car to do over a thousand
kilometers on a charge so that spec
sheet just that list of things he said
just if you look at the car and you hear
those numbers
it's like hyper car territory basically
it doesn't sound street-legal it doesn't
make any sense when you look at every
other car that's ever been produced it's
nuts and I know we get caught up in the
numbers about like you know it's just a
straight line drag race like eventually
those other cars will catch it those
million dollar supercars that we
constantly compare these two will
eventually catch it with this one it
doesn't look like they'll catch it
nearly as fast as they could catch this
car like this is basically P 200 T in a
way like if Apollo is P 100 D
Performance 100 kilowatt hour battery
dual motors then this roadster is a
lighter body a 200 kilowatt hour battery
pack and triple motor speed 200 T so we
get to this point in the event my jaw is
just kind of on the ground where I was
watching this and obviously there's a
lot of comparisons naturally we just
love comparing Tesla's numbers to these
million dollar supercars actually looked
it up a lot of these cars
on the list of the fastest production
car is zero to 60 ever are doing like
2.5 seconds maybe two point four a lot
of them 2.7 so four Tesla Roadster to
come along and do 1.9 is disgusting and
there's actually some videos from the
event there were even some test rides
out i'll show you guys them but of
actual launches from inside the car
the reactions incredible the views
incredible I can't wait to see people
doing like that GoPro reaction test
we're just sitting with the passenger
and they have the GoPro up here and they
do that launch from zero to 60 to see
the reaction can't wait for those
me too honestly I didn't think I didn't
think I noticed a difference to my
people be one no I understood indigo
knows difference there's a reason this
one's called plaid oh my goodness
I kind of wonder if you can track this
car like I've talked to friends about
bringing like a Tesla to a track and
actually you know racing a P 100 D
against other cars this car is
electronically limited to 155 miles an
hour but you can only go that fast for
so long before the battery starts
heating up and it actually limits your
performance and doesn't want you to do
that for very long so even though it's
an insane performer even though this car
does 0 to 60 in 2.4 you wouldn't really
race it on a track for very long against
like a traditional supercar I mean it's
also a four-door sedan so that's another
reason but still I gotta wonder what the
cooling is gonna be like in this 200
kilowatt hour battery how long you able
to get this insane performance can you
actually go 200 miles an hour for some
time before it wears out could you
actually track this car and beat a lot
of the others I want to see what motor
trend does with it I don't know I have a
lot of questions but one thing I haven't
mentioned is this cars coming out in
2020 Tesla Roadster 2.0 will ship in
2020 there's gonna be a founder series
version and a regular base model
essentially as what he said I don't know
how the numbers will defer or what the
difference will be between the two but
that's what he said it'll be a $200,000
car which is I mean it's still a
fraction of the price of the
million-dollar car as we compare it to
but the founder Series will be 250
thousand and there will only be a
thousand of them made now there's a
reserve button on their site and trying
really hard not to press it but you can
reserve it right now to get it in 2020
but there's plenty of other questions I
still have plenty of reasons why you
might not get this car like the fact
that I've only seen the outside of it
for example they haven't they haven't
shown the trunk Elon said tons of
storage on stage but he didn't show the
front trunk or the back trunk you also
said it's a four-seater so there's the
two doors on the front and you see the
front two seats but there's also two
pretty small seats in the back kind of
the way some other sports cars are
four-seaters you probably don't want
people in the back all the time but then
it's also a convertible so the top glass
goes back into the trunk so how big
could the trunk really be I believe it
will have autopilot but that wasn't
really mentioned or talked about there's
a couple of other little things like I
still have questions about this car but
then again 2020 by then like this could
be sick something I don't talk about a
lot is this car P 100 D Apollo you
is a leased vehicle which means I'll be
giving it back and I kind of viewed
Tesla's as a piece of tech in that way
so the fact that they offered a lease
for a couple years where I could give
this piece of tech back to them and
they'll continue to develop other tech
that I can pick up later when I gave
this back was kind of part of my plan
and it turns out Apollo's lease is up at
the end of 2019 and the Roadster 2.0
2020 hmm but this roaster 2.0 man that's
something else that's a hypercar zero
just to see that fast 0-100 that fast
250 miles an hour you can't you can't
really argue with that
I think I'm done I think that's all I
had to say let me know what you guys
think should I Shay I think it probably
will</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
