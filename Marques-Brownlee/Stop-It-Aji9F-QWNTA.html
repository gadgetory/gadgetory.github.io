channel if someone sent you this video
it means they know you're a tech
enthusiast and that you can probably
relate to this stuff or you may have
done some of these things but hopefully
not there are a few things that can get
on the nerves of people like us so on
behalf of a lot of other youtubers and
the tech community I have a few requests
for the fanboys and the newbies out
there here we go
stop asking simple questions before you
try to google the answer you can stop
checking in to your own house now on
Foursquare stop asking for a
recommendation between blackberries
because we can't tell them apart stop
using Internet Explorer seriously
seriously it's free run good and stop
judging people based on what kind of
phone they carry on Facebook stop asking
people to like your profile picture it's
terrifying and stop talking about tumblr
outside of tumblr Oh woops you ever see
some guy on a bus or train some more
public just having a ridiculously loud
conversation on their bluetooth
headphone don't be that guy stop asking
if every tablet in existence is an iPad
this is not an iPad stop comparing every
thin laptop to the MacBook Air and Apple
stop suing every company that makes a
phone with a touchscreen please and if
you can please stop reporting on rumors
of the next iPhone every freaking day
and please please stop asking us to fix
everything that breaks just because
we're geeks and stop using MySpace
stop stop stop it if you enjoyed this
video give it a thumbs up below I really
do appreciate it now if you have any
more feedback or other things that you
hate you know you can leave then comment
below as well thanks for watching this
