welcome to 2016 so 2015 last year was
already like in terms of video easily
the crispiest year of all time no doubt
December alone by itself was awesome we
had we passed three million subscribers
which was awesome we had a little cameo
in YouTube rewind 2015 which was a lot
of fun we had the Kobe interview we had
the smartphone awards and we're pretty
much looking to pick up right where we
left off so kicking off 2016 per usual
like every year is CES so the Consumer
Electronics Show every January in Las
Vegas I'll be there and of course many
others will be and we'll have a lot of
fun making video but CES itself is sort
of its it's not a shrinking show but a
lot of the stuff that used to be like
really big announcements has sort of
outgrown CES so they move out and they
have their own announcement elsewhere so
what remains at CES is a lot of the more
interesting smaller stuff so I'm not
doing a video on every single thing I
see at CES there will be channels that
do that but I'm gonna be just focusing
on the coolest stuff I see at the show
like I do every year so of course let me
know what you guys see if you hit me up
on Twitter stuff you've seen the news
about CES that you want to see a video
on that's the stuff I'm gonna be sharing
and even if it doesn't make it into a
video I'll probably tweet about it and
share the cool stuff I find now this is
also your annual reminder to turn on
email notifications for new uploads so
your subscription box might get a little
bit crazy sometimes but you can always
count on email reminders of new uploads
to remind you not only on a very
reliable basis but pretty much
instantaneously like when I hit publish
the email goes out from YouTube like
within seconds so you can be among the
first to watch so that's definitely the
way to go and another little piece of
news this is one of the last videos that
you guys will see in this apartment so
yeah I've lived here for the last four
years while I was going to school up
here
I no longer go to school up here so I'm
sort of outgrowing this place so I guess
remember what you like about it remember
the scene I'm gonna miss some parts of
it like the heater making noise while
I'm trying to record I'll miss that
anyway I just wanted to make this video
to say Happy New Year welcome to 2016
and hopefully I my sincere goal is to
make
every video that I make this year better
than every video that I made last year
it's like my new year's resolution or is
my new year's resolution 4k or is it 8k
anyway I'll talk to you as the next one
peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
