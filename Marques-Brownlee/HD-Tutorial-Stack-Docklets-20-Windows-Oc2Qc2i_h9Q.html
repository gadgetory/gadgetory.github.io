here from mkbhd and welcome to another
HD tutorial and in this one I will be
showing you guys how to install on how
to use stack doclets in object dock now
if you guys I mean I did an object dock
tutorial not too long ago and a lot of
people seem to like the the idea of a
dock for windows and there is a rocket
dock and an object dock now if you
haven't already heard of stack doclets
it's basically if you haven't already
seen this in Mac OS 10 being able to
click on something and have it spread
and show what is underneath it so I'm
gonna show you how to install them and
create them so go ahead and open up a
web browser I'm gonna use Safari for
this tutorial just because of its
download speed and now you're going to
take the link in the description and
either click that or whatever you want
to do and just open up that link and
that will be the link to downloading the
file that I've uploaded so you guys can
ah so you guys can just download this
and install it straightaway so all you
have to do is hit that download button
right there I'm gonna click it and it's
going to hit us gonna say save or run
you're gonna hit run and omnes actually
even though I already have it I'm gonna
show you guys how to do this anyway
because there is another step so go
ahead and hit run again and if you AC or
a user account control does pop up just
go ahead and hit allow or accept or
continue for anything it asks so I'm
just going to exit out of this and it's
going to say this is the last part you
need to remember would you like to
install this manually and for what dock
so I decided to do this tutorial for
rocket dock for object dock excuse me
you could also click on rocket dock and
hit install and it would inject it right
into the dock for you so I'm hitting
canceled because I already have it so
once you already have this you can just
go up to your dock and right click on
any of the spaces you have hit add and
you will see new stack 2.0 doclet has
been added to your list of entries hips
just click it and write on the right
hand side here you'll see by default it
says my computer now I'm going to create
one for my documents so you guys can see
how this works so right here my
documents all you have to do is click on
this
My Documents folder opens up but what if
I want to click on it and have my
documents all just spread out like in a
fan well just go ahead and right-click
on it and go to doc entry properties and
this is the this is the customization
section basically if your stacks doclet
so we're going to change the folder this
is going to be the My Documents folder
so just go ahead and find that there's
documents hit OK
we're going to let stack doc let's
decide whether or not it wants to be a
fan or a grid it's basically choosing
that based on the number of entries
within the folder then when you choose
icon I do plan on using I'm going to use
you use icon as box overlay but I do
plan on uploading my my Mac os10 icons
to some sort of file sharing site and
making a video about it because a lot of
you guys have been really interested in
my icon so I'm just going to go ahead
and find these icons real quick Mancos
10 icons and I want to take a blue one
and it's going to be documents so that's
icon up we use up here when we're done
and in advanced I don't really mess
around with these kinds of things these
um these are settings I don't really
play with when you hit OK you will see
the object has changed you go ahead and
click it and there are all your
documents so pretty awesome that you get
to do that and if you want to click on
one just just click on it and it opens
up so now you'll notice this is actually
a blue icon on top of that regular
folder icon to fix that you can actually
go to doc and through properties icon
and just use icon as stack icon so
there's no overlay or overlap or
anything hit OK and that works out
perfectly so now you guys can pretty
much erase this My Documents folder
because you can always go through it
write this and if you always if you
actually do need to look into My
Documents folder you can always open
folder using this shortcut down here and
that is basically it guys so I hope you
enjoy your new object dock 2.0 stack
doclets if you have any questions about
this or how to do with rocketdock which
I also do have and use I feel free to
message me or leave a comment and that
is basically it thank you for watching
guys peace
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
