this is your first look at the Samsung
Galaxy s6 edge yes the rumors are true
so Samsung did announce two phones today
the normal galaxy s6 and the galaxy s6
edge and I've videos out right now about
both so definitely be sure to check out
the regular s6 video actually should
probably watch that one first it'll be
the first link below that like button so
this is the slightly crazier looking
brother to the galaxy s6 and I guess
that one sided Galaxy Note edge must
have worked out pretty well because
Samsung is up to it again bringing the
shape to their main flagship lineup so
the s6 edge is of course nearly
identical in a lot of ways to the
regular galaxy s6 brother it has all the
same internal specs same software same
camera same materials and everything
just a slightly larger 2600 milliamp
hour battery and of course now a bit of
the display hanging over the edge of
both sides so it's still technically a
5.1 inch display diagonally but now the
whole shape of the phone is different
and actually think it looks pretty cool
especially holding it up close and
actually using it these sloping edges
make it a real head-turner but not in
like an overly distracting way now
because with the display moving towards
the metal a bit closer to the edge with
the thin bezels you do get slightly
sharper edges on the sides but you're
still definitely holding metal but you
know you hear so often about the iPhone
curving the edge of the glass to make it
feel more smoother and transitioning
over the edge this kind of takes it to
the next level by curving the display
under the glass also so okay what are
the benefits of getting the edge over
the regular Galaxy s6 Samsung has got to
add a few features in there to the edge
display to make it worth it besides just
looking good so they have edge lighting
people edge information stream and night
clock so information stream and night
clock are things carried over from the
note edge where you can have information
scroll across the edge when it's sitting
face-up or at night you can dimly show
the time on that AMOLED display makes
sense obviously that's not new then the
people edge is a constantly available
swipe in from the upper right sort of
natural for the thumb to bring in your
most frequently contacted people for a
OneTouch phone call or email
and this is kind of cool but I really
wish Samsung would have let us put
anything there like our five favorite
apps or something that would have been a
legit useful feature but for now it's
just contacts can't really change that
and you'll notice the little circle your
rings around the contact names those are
actually connected with edge lighting so
when your phone is facing down and you
receive a call from one of those people
it lights up the edges of your phone
with the color of the person calling and
of course that lights up the table
that's on too it gives you a pretty good
idea of who's calling before you have to
turn it over
pretty neat look not one of those things
that blows my mind but at least it's
good looking but yeah other than that
the edge display is all about immersion
that's really what impressed me the most
I just couldn't stop looking at this Tam
display it got this weird not really
distortion to it but you know viewing
angles don't suffer but it has this
different look on the edges I don't know
it's weird
reflections look different also I don't
know if it was intentional or not but
with all these new Android apps that
swipe in from the left hand side this
display is kind of perfect for pulling
in those drawers again I don't know if
Samsung did that on purpose but it's a
really nice feeling and a sort of a dope
side effect from having these curved
over edges with the glass and I can
guarantee you you won't see any other
phone with this shape out there so it's
a unique form factor it's something
different and new I think now that it's
on both sides it's a little bit less
awkward a little more usable for lefties
of course and it just overall feels like
a slightly better design than the one
sided edge from before it's gone from
being a weird experiment to a
full-fledged flagship and honestly if I
was picking between the s6 and the s6
edge right now I think I would go for
the edge now obviously it's probably you
know a little bit harder to get it might
not sell in all the same places as the
regular s6 but I actually really like it
so let me know what you guys are
thinking in that comment section right
below also side note cases for this
phone are going to be pretty awkward too
thank you guys for watching this quick
first impressions of the s6 edge let me
know if you wouldn't see in the full
review video to when that comes out in a
little bit thanks for watching and I'll
talk to you guys the next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
