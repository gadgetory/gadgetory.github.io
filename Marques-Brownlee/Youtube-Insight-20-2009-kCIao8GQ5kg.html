here from mkbhd and welcome to another
HD tutorial and this one will be an
overview of YouTube insight 2.0 and I'll
go ahead and post this as a video
response to my original YouTube insight
video because this in fact has changed
actually in the past few hours a YouTube
had tweeted about it but anyway you guys
can now view a myriad of statistics for
an individual video as long as you allow
that so we're gonna go ahead and search
my uploads for Safari 4 and I'm going to
go ahead and go to my Safari for video
video which has a large number of views
and open that in a new tab and what
we're gonna do is view the statistics
for this video
now normally when you would go under to
statistics and data right here it would
show you know a small amount of
statistics it'll give you what sites
we're linking to it how many comments
favorites you got etc let's go ahead and
hit statistics and data in now and we
scroll down and we'll see this huge
amount of data very very nice so you'll
see first of all the honors of this
video I don't we scroll up cuz honors
you know they've been there for a while
you will see a whole lot of stuff now
you can share these statistics with the
video as long as you want or you could
make these private if you don't want
everyone to see this I'm going to let
this let all my videos have all these
you know open so this is this is really
cool first of all you have a graph up
here of the total video views' and this
is a something Google has thrown in
where each one of these little letters
here corresponds to a date and an event
which is really cool so right here you
can see there are 274 comments and has a
graph of how the comments have been
increasing it shows how the ferret's
have gone up how the ratings have slowly
climbed the number of ratings and the
average rating has stayed at about 4.4
now if you go down here this is what I
think is the coolest thing it shows
a number of use you get from certain
things some from certain events that are
happening on YouTube so this is right
here first
embedded on this website got 1182 views
from being embedded there some people
Google Search Safari for 4,400 people
clicked on my video from google
searching Safari for first referral from
YouTube and browsing 1000 and betta dat
video google.com referral from these
three Google Google and YouTube searches
so people search these different terms
and we're actually able to find my video
by searching these terms and people
searching Safari for got a large number
of views on this video and others /
viral which is just you know other ways
people found your video so I think this
is this is really awesome that by the
way that last sorry about that noise in
the background that last event that
happened got me a large number of views
so I really like this this tutorial in
this insight right here it really is a
deep insight in your video statistics
now you can go down here and see their
video is most popular with ages and
genders so males ages 13 to 17 most
popular and then 45 to 54 and 35 to 44
and you can also see its most popular in
these countries so you can definitely go
go to a ridiculously viewed video such
as I don't know Susan Boyle Susan Boyles
video was is pretty much everywhere look
at that 71 million views and you can go
down and as long as the user has not
disabled it if we go ahead to statistics
and data up know they have disabled it
but if you go down to the statistics and
data of someone's video you'll be able
to see all of that now if we go ahead
and want to delete if we want to hide
this and we don't want anyone to see it
go ahead and hit that account button on
the top right hand side go to sharing
and privacy and go do statistics and
data down here and just uncheck make
statistics and data for my videos
publicly visible by default and Save
Changes
you can also uncheck that for individual
videos if you don't like the statistics
that are being shown on individual
videos anyway thanks for watching guys I
hope you enjoyed this YouTube 2.0
or sorry about that background noise and
please rate this video five stars get it
get it spreaded around and go ahead and
check out the YouTube insight on this
video for yourself if it you know if
it's exciting enough for you anyway
thank you for watching and please
subscribe if you haven't already and
I'll see you in the next video peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
