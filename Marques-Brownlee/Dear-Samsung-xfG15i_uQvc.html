you might remember a couple of weeks ago
I did a dear Apple video
dear Apple please refresh the Mac Pro
please so then yesterday we got a rare
insight from Apple about a product that
they're working on but not revealing
just yet which turns out to be a new Mac
Pro that's coming um so I don't want to
say that Apple watched my video or
social or definitely saw it but you know
the message got echoed out there and
Apple is listening they've got an ear to
the ground so of course that being said
it can't be just Apple we have other
companies that we have things to say too
so Samsung in the past year so we've had
a bunch of questions about what's good
with Samsung you know obviously they had
the battery issues with the note 7 and
then recently a bunch of their flagship
stuff got leaked into oblivion but now
that it's finally out and released
Galaxy s8 is official still got some
stuff to say to him ear Samsung you
don't have to compete against Google
with every single little piece of
software that they handle already they
do it really well like Sammy you have
such a long reputation like a long
history of using Google software Android
but then also building a Samsung version
of like every single thing Google makes
already doesn't it seem like a really
big waste of resources and time I really
thought about this like Samsung has been
making phones for a long time they're
smart they've been doing it well there's
gotta be a good reason for why they keep
doing this but I really can't think of
it so now Galaxy s8 comes out and it's a
beautiful phone it's got an awesome
camera great-looking display phenomenal
design all kinds of awesome specs but
its biggest new software feature is a
new Samsung assistant called Dix V and
it has its own button on the side of the
phone let me know if any of this sounds
familiar
LEED Bixby it's a new intelligent
interface that reimagines the user
mobile user experience Bixby understands
context it knows what's happening on
your screen but Bixby also learns and
adapt to your routine to anticipate what
you need when you swipe to the right on
the home screen Bixby takes you to a
contextual personalized page that shows
you the information you use from the
apps you use on a one convenient place
you'll see
series of cards for native apps like
email and gallery and third-party apps
like Facebook and Eber and fixity will
organize these cards based on where you
are and what time it is in the morning
you might see and use and weather and at
night your alarm and step count and the
more you use it the more it learns
the third part of the new Android search
experience is called Google now Google
now gets you just the right information
at just the right time and all of it
happens automatically Google now uses
things like your search history your
location history and your calendar to
figure out what information you might
need and win you also see a beautiful
header that changes based on your time
and location you also see the Google now
cards beneath it your cards will get
smarter and more accurate as you use
them and we're just beginning ok so if
you haven't already put together Samsung
is now making a super smart bixby
assistant on a phone that runs Android
7.0 which means that phone already has
Google assistant which is we doing
pretty much all of these things for a
while for a couple years now and really
well but why again
like why are they making the same thing
that Google's been making for a while
now granted there's a couple unique
things that Google assistant doesn't do
right now like the photo recognition in
the camera you can hold the camera
pointing at something it'll give you a
link to buy it if you point it out a
banana it'll give you a link to buy a
banana whatever I guess that's kind of
cool but overall it just seems like an
unnecessary amount of effort basically
copying something that Google is already
done competition is good but not when
you're just copying something and the
products already free maybe maybe let us
remap the bixby button to the Google
assistant if we want or let us link it
to any app I'm not asking for a Google
Play edition or anything I know that's
not going to happen but like it would be
actually a legitimate feature if you had
a custom button on the side of the phone
kind of like you did on that galaxy s7
activewear we could link it to any app
we want that would be a legit awesome
feature your Samsung your first party
cases for your phones need work the
Galaxy s8 like I've said is a beautiful
phone but with that huge great display
and really thin bezels on the top and
bottom and sides we obviously know this
phone is going to be a bit more
breakable and susceptible to damage if
it drops they know that they've tested
the phone themselves kind of funny that
you can drop your phone in a pool and
it's cool but if you drop your phone
next to the pool not so good anyway when
there's people that get this phone
there's going to be two types of people
one is like me less common but I won't
put a case on it because it's too
beautiful I just got this really nice
fun I want to show it off but number two
is the people who won't use this phone
without a case because it's so delicate
at
don't want to risk breaking meat if they
drop it they sign up for a two-year
contract got to get a cake this is your
chance Samsung to compete with other
manufacturers and make all the products
better you have the dimensions first you
know where the weak points are on the
phone this is your chance to make the
case market really good and this is the
case you come up with what is that this
is terrible in every way I think every
single way that it could be bad the
color is shape it's not good oh my god
it looks like a bikini for your phone
but like made out of play-doh it looks
like you hired the guy who designed the
iPhone 5c case and like lock him in a
room for a month with like crayon it
looks like a fisher-price case for a
fisher-price phone but it's not really a
fisher-price phone if you know what I
mean you need work Samsung serious work
so that's pretty much it just a couple
pretty general requests things I figured
we should talk about things I think we
could get from a company that we like a
lot and who knows maybe someone from
Samsung will end up watching this video
in which case you guys should also keep
the headphone jack around so thank you
for watching talk to you guys the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
