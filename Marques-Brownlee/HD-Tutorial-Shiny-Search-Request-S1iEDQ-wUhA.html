tutorial and in this video I will
hopefully be able to show you and the
time allotted how to create your own
custom home page so now a lot of people
have actually noticed this but this is
actually a request by the first people
actually requested this a lot of people
have seen this as my home page and
actually wondered how I do it so this is
going to be the first part of the video
is going to be how to actually get the
home page in the second part is actually
setting it as your home page in a number
of different web browsers so what I'm
going to do first up here well you've
seen my own page in the first place so
I'm going to do is go to WWE search comm
and that's all you have to type in and
the easiest part here is just selecting
the style you want say I want a
harley-davidson one and select your name
or whatever you want
so I'm lionsearch Bob and this is Bob's
custom harley-davidson home page there
we go so now if he wants to set this as
his home page right there you see a set
us home page button however this does
not work with all our browsers so I'm
going to first show you how to do it in
Safari this will work on Windows or a
Mac os10 go to edit preferences and
stick under the generals tab and here
you will set current page as your
homepage just hit that set to current
page button and you're good so whenever
I hit that home button it'll go back to
my Google search and yes this is a
Google search engine by the way so also
over here you have a few little options
they didn't just have it that one google
page you can also have a couple of
numerous options here for connecting
feeding meeting your friends sorry on
facebook myspace etc and more and you
can obviously always exit out of this
with a little X button up here and if it
works I'm guessing it's not gonna work
in Safari but there you go so if I
wanted to set that as my home page for
Firefox I'm just going to copy this URL
which will work in any IP address and
anyone's anyone who happens to have an
internet connection and I want to open
up Firefox now I do actually like the
Firefox home page though it does tend to
make it crash a little bit something to
go up here and just ctrl V to paste it
hit enter and here is my new home page
now going to set this as my home page
I'm going pretty sure I go to edit and I
go to file
actually it would be easier fighters to
right-click on the homepage button hit
customize and this is how you change the
toolbar so that's obviously not it but
anyway if I'm going to set this as my
custom homepage for Firefox that means
whenever I would hit the home page
button it would change and it would load
Firefox and it would load I'm sorry this
web page right here so that and I'll
also show you I guess for eloquently
enough and Internet Explorer how to
change your home page now the URL is
still in my clipboard so I don't have to
copy and paste it again
so here's Internet Explorer and my
custom home page right now is just a
blank home page there was nothing
special so once this is done loading all
this to control thee and enter again to
get to this website and once it loads
you can see now you'll have these
artists work hopefully that was my home
page I would go to the tools button and
go to internet options which will pop up
a new window and this window you can
choose your home page now I will just go
ctrl V to paste my home page well if I
don't I'll just see you as blank as my
home page and that's it so that is how
you changing an Internet Explorer and
Safari and I'll get back to you on
Firefox but if you do know go ahead and
leave it in the comments and that is
just about it so that is now you guys
know exactly how I got my YouTube or my
my custom home page whenever I open up
Safari to be this little cool
Lamborghini icon or Ferrari icon so
that's basically it if you have any
other tutorials for me just send me a
