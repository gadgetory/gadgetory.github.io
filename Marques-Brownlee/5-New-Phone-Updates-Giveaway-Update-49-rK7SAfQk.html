starting
well looks like it's live I got a
notification on my phone which means yep
we are live it works okay so I need to
get a link copy URL paste tweet what's
up guys we clearly have a lot to talk
about but like we can talk about
whatever it's cool it's just a title no
big deal what's up hey hello hi bro hi
hi hello volume is too low
should I bring us closer let me know how
I sound let me know how I sound cuz I
see video looks pretty ok gonna get a
sound check what do you guys think
volume up
increase the volume please speak loud
should i boost it a little bit this this
mic volume I can turn up right here did
that get louder
yeah the chat is flying
how does this house now is it louder
than I I turned up yeah I turned it up
about 25% still low really loud let me
hear it on the oh that's great that's
there it is yeah there you go
alright see this mic it's good it's got
a little volume volume knob that's why I
linked it below it's cuz it's good
alright this one this live stream is
titled phone updates
hence the phones and plus a little
giveaway updates so I guess natural
place to start would be the giveaway
stuff because that was that was pretty
recent
so the giveaway is pretty awesome there
is obviously plenty of people commenting
on oh god that's a lot of phones why
would you give all those away and it's
because I wanted like I said to give as
many prizes away as possible there is a
pretty hilarious reddit post actually
about actually I'm gonna see if I can
find it again about like here's why I
think it's giveaways fake which is why I
have these boxes here um first of all
it's not fake
fYI I would never do that I found it I'm
not gonna link to it but I'll like read
some of it which is pretty they okay so
they're super analyzing the video
obviously there's a lot of boxes in the
video none of them have shrink-wrap on
those that's because as I mentioned
dbrand
skinned every single one of those phones
so they took the shrink-wrap off open
the box take the phone out skinned it
put it back put the thing back together
close it that's why there's no shrink
wrap on the boxes and yes every single
one of those boxes did have a phone in
it which is why I had all the boxes he
mentions the boxes sound hollow as if
there's no phone inside
I don't really know how to quantify that
but all the boxes have phones in them
and we took them all out and I actually
have a picture if you want to switch to
this camera I have a picture of some of
when we were shooting all of the 25
phones I don't know if that's glared
well if it's even visible but yeah
there's there's 25 phones all equally
numbered red and black so that's a thing
that happened and I'll share more of
those photos probably later on Twitter
but the other funny thing is they're
talking about what do you say oh the I
am me that I am the I stickers which if
you've seen on the bottom of these these
boxes is always on the bottom here like
that but the way this Note 8 that
they're talking about the note eighths
the way the note 8 boxes it has a sleeve
on it so they were curious about why all
the boxes looked blank is because we hid
all of the imei stickers because we
didn't want everyone to steal that
information or getting in the heads of
the people who end up winning these
things you don't want to give out these
public IMEI numbers so we oriented all
the boxes so that they were all blank
you can do that by just taking the
sleeve off and switching it around and
putting the IMEI wherever you want so we
made them all blank on the top just by
switching them and that was that I think
that's a brick that's about it people
are also freaking out about the fact
that that much money was spent upon on
phones for a giveaway that's just how we
do that's just the way it is out here so
that's pretty much it for that but what
I really want to say for the giveaway is
this is a Twitter and Instagram giveaway
so what we were talking about is there's
gonna be people who try to scam you into
thinking you've won it's gonna happen
and because this is you know it's a it's
a randomization from Twitter and
Instagram D brand has their they're
handling the entire logistics process
essentially so randomizing the
cross-section of followers on each
social network and actually shipping
them out and handling all the import
fees wherever you live all that stuff so
they have all the phones right now for
that but people it's also really
easy to just try to mass message that
group of people
let me just message everyone who follows
Marquez and debrand
saying I'm Marquez and asking for their
shipping in their bank information for
import fees it's not happening like that
first of all this number 25th is the day
all the winners get picked so if someone
messages you claiming to be me or
claiming to be dbrand
some time between now and December 25th
clearly it's not
but then on that day of that's when
you'll see all the winners get picked
it's a just literally a random
cross-section generated by code and
that's that's how it happens yeah that
is a read 1 plus 5 2 you will get to
these is there's a whole bunch of a
updates again for the whole title of
strain but that's that's the giveaway
update there's anything I missed there
they just haters you did this last year
that is true if you are curious about
giveaways I've ever done I don't do them
very often but last year I gave away a
hundred one plus three teas and pretty
much the same format cross section of
social posts and whoever's following the
two accounts is entered to win same idea
they all got those phones they all were
given proof on social it was awesome
actually giving away that many phones so
yeah where is the smartphone award 2017
so Nast
that's a december thing so that'll
happen right around the end of the year
when I'm pretty sure all the phones have
come out you've probably noticed one of
these phones on a desk is not like the
others this one you guys did tweet about
this one there's a sad story this I
mentioned in the review it's actually
sharp at this point it's literally this
it's not the slipperiest phone ever but
it's a slipperiest iPhone ever it's got
these rounded sides and it's definitely
you can tell this was my daily driver I
use this one every day um it slid off a
counter or not a counter like a dresser
and I left the room for like 10 minutes
so this is what happens yesterday
I had my phone up on this counter it was
like face down like that just like a
normal surface like this I think it was
like plastic left the room and a couple
minutes later I'm in the other room and
I hear like this thud and I was like
what was that sound and I literally left
the room and I went downstairs because I
thought the sound came from downstairs
like in the kitchen I'm looking around
like what fell did a salt shaker fall
like what is the deal I couldn't find it
went back upstairs one in the other room
that I left the phone in and I find this
phone on the ground that clearly
committed suicide and people were saying
put a skin over it which actually
sometimes works but in this case because
the glass is so wrecked it's a little
depressed on this side and it's kind of
sharp right here and not even a skin can
save that one so yeah that one's over
slice I put my sim in another iPhone
because I actually have another iPhone
which is pretty awesome but this would
normally cost $550 at an Apple store to
fix it's the most expensive iPhone to
fix ever obviously that's a lot and it's
the most expensive iPhone ever this one
I think it's just gonna remain like this
in posterity there's chunks of glass
missing from around the camera it's bad
alright I'll put it away I don't you
guys don't want to see that there now
it's now there's a clean iPhone on this
table hey Mark is the question is I had
are you how are you going to weed out
inactive accounts and body counts that
is a challenge and ideally none of those
accounts win but that's gonna be up to
dbrand to like truly randomize the
process and pick the winners are the
phones of the highest capacity
I don't think so this particular one I
think all the iPhones will be the 999
based model so what does that 64 gigs or
yeah 64 gigs and all the notes are the
64 gig as well I think what is this I'm
pretty sure the base for both is 64 gigs
so that's what's up hi hello hi did it
fall how did it fall anyway it just slid
I said maybe it got a notification and
like
my phone like buzzed and like slid off
the table but I couldn't I can't confirm
because I didn't put it near the edge I
would never do that that means it slid
gradually over the course of like
several minutes while I was in another
room until it fell which is that's
pretty rough
yup
all right so this is the Android daily
driver I think that's the other thing
people were asking about I usually carry
two phones that's something that's been
a case for at least like two years now I
usually carry one Android phone and I
carry one iPhone so for a while ago for
me that was Galaxy Note 8 and iPhone 7
plus and then iPhone 8 came out and I
switched iphone 8 so the Android
rotation is much faster because I'm
testing a bunch of different phones
lately it was the razor phone that's
this guy
the suite hundred twenty Hertz display
the massive amazing front-facing
speakers and it's a it's kind of a rock
in terms of build quality but long story
short like I mentioned in the full
review the camera is so bad that it's an
actual deal-breaker for me and I had to
switch back to the pixel because the
camera is that good and the thing is I
think Danny I think Danny tweeted this
with Danny widgets super-scientific
tweeted this recently but it's something
I think the same about which is camera
comparisons for a while are not really
ruined but will be a little less
interesting because the pixel tube
crushes everything in the camera
department and it's not that close like
iPhone 10 has a pretty great camera and
then pixel 2 is still clearly better
it's like when you have a clear 1/2 in
the world in a sport it's crazy I don't
know anyway so that's that's razor phone
but that's what I've switched to so my
daily right now is the iPhone 10 256
silver and the pixel to 128 panda I know
some of you call this the penguin it's
not it's a panda although I get why you
call it the penguin I'm just saying it's
a little late to switch what's good let
me look at these check
the chat is oh my god that shadows fly
oh wow that would explain why it's
flying what is good what's good all
right here's another fun we can move on
to one plus 5t this is a ok so again
these are all phones and this is in the
description besides these two these are
all phones that I haven't reviewed yet
one plus 5t I did a top five features on
and I really like this phone a lot it's
a well built it's kind of like a blade
they didn't make the battery any bigger
so it's still a pretty thin phone and
it's got this red D brand skin on it so
it looks pretty slick right now but this
is a really good phone for under 500
bucks it's 479 I want to say the killer
feature of this phone and I want to
stress the difference between this in
the iPhone 10 the killer feature on this
phone turns out to be that face unlock
which I don't know if I can demonstrate
it here it's kind of hard to see I don't
know if you can you see that is that on
the screen right now if I turn this off
pointing towards me it's hard to point
towards me and unlock it it's the
fastest face unlock I've ever used on a
phone which has a lot of people talking
about like well this is way better than
face ID it's that much faster here's the
thing those are two very different
although they seem the same very
different technologies so here's the
difference face ID on the iPhone 10 is
an entire replacement to touch ID it is
a secure thing it does your phone
unlocked but it also does your bank
transactions your Apple ID your
purchasing of apps everything it uses
the true depth sensor it uses the front
facing information bounces all these
lasers off your face or is it it's uh
it's infrared so I don't know if I can
call it lasers bounces all the infrared
dots off your face creates a depth map
recognizes you in multiple scenarios if
you grow a mustache or your face ages
slightly it recognizes you because of a
learning algorithm all this stuff face
ID is really smart so that's why it does
all those things but it also takes a
second
you take your phone in your pocket and
then it unlocks like it's a second to
actually get into your phone where
everyone looks at now this new face
front-facing camera on the oneplus looks
at you instantly unlocks seems like it
must be better right it seems like it
must be better but it's not it only uses
the front-facing camera face idea isn't
use the front-facing camera at all it
uses all the invisible sensors that you
don't see this uses only the
front-facing camera meaning it's
susceptible to potentially some of the
same security risks
that would come from not getting that
extra information number one doesn't use
as much most much depth information
I couldn't fool it with a photo I
actually printed a photo of myself and
tried to unlock it and like may give
some depth and everything that didn't
work but oneplus already acknowledges I
think internally that it's not quite to
the same level of security so they have
a finger parameter on the back still
first of all so they kept that so keep
using that for the more secure things
that's what it's good for but it also
won't work in low light it won't work if
you're super backlit these are all
things that you can shine infrared light
on yourself with and true in face ID and
it'll still work this won't work at
night face ID facial recognition won't
work at night it's using a low-light
camera it won't work
when you're backlit because these
cameras struggle in your backlit so
certain things like that separate these
two experiences and what they're good at
overall though 1 + 5 t is turned out to
be pretty freakin sweet for this amount
of money what other questions you guys
have about this 1 + 5 t or any of the
stuff on the desk so when I was giveaway
question if I don't use my if I don't
use my Twitter and Instagram well my
account be considered a bot and
disqualified no as long as you're
following the rules which there are only
two followed both the counseling a win
Steve Jobs dropped that iPhone what
which phone here has the longest battery
life during regular operation I would
give that award to razor phone which
right now is edging out pixel - and
iPhone 10 probably pixel - in second
place iPhone 10 and third place iPhone
10 battery life isn't quite as good as
iPhone 8 + which has that smaller screen
and bigger cell so I'd put that a little
bit below of pixel but right now your
best battery life that is actually the
razor phone what's up what product you
looking forward to most camera or phones
or other cool tech honestly I have to
say Tesla Roadster which is probably not
the most common answer but I have to say
it and I'm looking forward to that tech
electric motors massive batteries and
cars what's up fam marques thanks for
all you do thanks for watching I hope
one day my channel will be even half
this size this is what I love to do
thanks for inspiring again thanks for
watching and I'm I'm glad to be in a
position where the videos I make get
seen by people who are also encouraged
to make videos themselves is it worth
upgrading from pixel excel to pixel to
excel oh I've been having a few minor
issues and it's very tempting so if you
have been having issues it seems like
you're looking for an upgrade in which
case I'd say yeah this is a great phone
to upgrade to but a lot of people are
considering either they have like an
even older phone and they're considering
do I buy pixel to excel or pixel excel
right now both of them are new in which
case you could probably save your money
and still get a great phone with future
off software updates and a great camera
and great performance and stock Android
in the pixel XL the og but if you're
having issues you will not be
disappointed in this phone pretty sure
I'd be curious what issues you have with
the pixel though how's the battery of
the 5 T compared to the 5 it's been
alright I mean it's not notably better
or worse people have been complaining
about the fact that battery is not
bigger even though it's a bigger phone
and a bigger screen and that's because
they didn't make the phone any thicker
so it's still I think 3,000 million
power cell
but it's a pretty good battery life
still no complaints from me have you
updated the pixel to the latest beta and
have you noticed a visual difference
oh man that has been fun okay yeah I do
want to show you guys this I didn't even
put this in the notes but okay the pixel
got an update you know how there is all
the complaints about the display of the
pixel - it's almost funny to me how
massive of a change they made of like
all the colors look muted it looks
really dull srgb doesn't really pop for
me and this AMOLED display has so much
more range why don't you guys use it so
they pushed an update to make the
saturated mode a little bit more crazy I
wonder if I can show this alright here's
my home screen right now am i off with
the glare is this good like that so
that's the way I hope this comes through
in the live stream it might not but
that's the way the phone looks in the
boosted mode now if I go into our
display settings here so I'm making a
lot of noise you have your colors this
is the boosted mode and in a normal mode
again I go home this is the the original
srgb everyone's complaining about you
know it's still pretty dull not too bad
but boosted is what I've been using and
people are complaining this doesn't
really change much it's not really
boosted enough I want that I want that
Samsung full saturated look so what they
did with the software update was they
added this saturated mode and when you
click it everything gets blasted in
saturation
oh man it's really hard to to show the
colors here but like it's gone to the
next level of like over saturation I
almost think they like wanted to make
people regret asking for it because it's
so much more saturated in this mode than
it is in natural or boosted so that's
what I wanted to show you but it's I'll
just leave it on boosted it looks lit
religious - saturated
you put it in a that saturated mode so I
just leave it and boost it it's crazy
though
why no pixel to XL giveaway oh that's
because this phone is even harder to get
the henna iPhone 10 trying to get 25
pixel to excels that'll be pretty tough
and also because the fact that I kind of
wanted it to be that thousand dollar
phone giveaway where iPhone 10 is a
thousand dollars do you want to buy it
maybe maybe not but if it's free I'll do
it and then androids version of that
pixel too isn't a thousand dollars but
Note 8 is so that's the same thing on
Android side thousand dollars do I
really want to spend that much maybe not
but if you win it it's great that's why
we went with note over pixel obviously
I'm sure people would be happy getting a
free one either way what are your
thoughts about a 5 inch screen with no
bezels for a smaller phone I have a
large hand but I find the iPhone 10 and
s 8 or too tall yet I'll be nice I
actually so iPhone 10 is a 5.8 inch
display I would actually want a and
that's corner to corner I believe when
you measure it even though it's a little
bit narrower I would want a bigger
iPhone 10 display I think I would be
cool with like a 6.2 inch iPhone 10 so
that would be like an iPhone 10 plus and
we've seen these rumors of it start to
pop up now it's never too early for
iPhone rumors but this is that 5.8 inch
corner to corner and I think a 5 inch
corner to corner like a smaller version
like that would also be pretty nice the
thing is Apple never really makes three
of the same form factor iPhone it's
always one or two so I don't think
that's gonna happen but I'm interested
to see how the handling next year how
does the second camera on the 5 t work
what is intelligent pixel technology
that is a great question I don't know I
would love to find out that shad is
flying but that's my ok so here's here's
the way they describe it to me and all
of their logic makes sense except for
the fact that I don't know how they do
it their logic with the dual cameras on
the back of this phone is you know we
don't need a telephoto cam
to do portrait mode we can do it with AI
which okay great other phones are doing
that too they still have portrait mode
that's cool
so what is the second camera for the
second camera is a special low-light
camera it has an F 1.7 aperture
okay well the primary camera also has an
F 1.7 aperture so that's a little
confusing why is this second camera
better at low-light besides that it
isn't optically stabilized as far as I
know so it's the same aperture different
sensors are sorry yes same aperture
different sensor both no I know oh is
what's better about it they call it
intelligent pixel technology and here's
what they say it does is it combines
it's also a higher megapixel count
it's a twenty-something megapixel camera
21 versus a smaller megapixel count so
the pixels are smaller worse for
low-light this technology combines four
pixels into one don't know what that
means physically speaking but that gives
you a four times larger pixel for better
low-light performance and better high
ISO sensitivity that's intelligent pixel
technology and that's why it'll take
that sensor in the lowest of low light
scenarios here's the thing when I think
about physics and like the physical
sensors and what they do a pixel is a
pixel no matter what if you take this 21
megapixel sensor and spread it out over
this this area each physical pixel is a
certain size and you don't just dissolve
the border between pixels to make bigger
ones like I'm not sure what they mean by
combines four pixels into one so that's
my challenge with understanding that and
the fact that it doesn't work that well
leads me to believe it's not doing the
sort of magic it implies it does it's
pretty okay sometimes but oftentimes the
main camera does just as well if not
better in low light so they probably
could have just gone with one camera
like the pixel two and and just focus
that focused on that entirely that's
just me though
haha I haven't use any Android till now
is it worth upgrading the iPhone 8 if
yes 8 or 8 + oh you've only used Android
well yeah if you watch my iPhone 8
review that's a pretty good phone -
iPhone 8 and 8 plus are great
I prefer big phones what about these
other phones on the table since we kind
of have them there I might as well
steamroll through these real quick oh if
your stream is lagging refresh the
browser like if stuff is getting choppy
or if your internet connections being
weird or stuff's dropping off or if you
didn't get that audio update just
refresh it once it'll probably all be
good alright the rest of these phones
right okay so I have pixel - this is the
daily iPhone 10 as a daily that's the
thing we have 1 + 5 T which I talked
about we have this phone here this is a
kind of an oddball this is blackberry
motion this is a not your typical phone
is this in the matte frame right there
not your typical for him because
blackberry usually puts keyboards on
their phones they didn't put one on this
phone jeez you didn't put one on this
phone they just put a full touchscreen
and a virtual keyboard which looks like
that or if you don't want to put it in
the browser no thanks
virtual keyboard looks like that that's
the BlackBerry keyboard it's kind of a
weird thing because blackberry are used
to you know you people buy BlackBerry's
to get either the keyboard or the
business apps and everything BlackBerry
does well it still has that still it's
blackberry hub in there it still has all
these blackberry features that you saw
on the Prive and previous BlackBerry's
but it's all touchscreen now and I
haven't really even gotten oh if it has
an activity button I've gotten the
chance to use this full time but I'm
just kind of observing it for now and
what it does well it kind of stands up
flat by itself so that's a good plus
it's always good when a phone does that
case in point oh god now the pressure is
mounting I have to be able to do this
yeah okay maybe not but flat-bottomed
USBC speaker headphone jack big deal for
some people there's a headphone jack the
buttons are pretty solid clicky it's
it's a lot of metal to be honest and the
carbon fiber isn't actually carbon fiber
it's this coated plastic material but it
looks pretty cool so it's a blackberry
again the fingerprint reader here is
underneath this like logoed button and
you have those those big buttons on the
bottom yeah man it's it's still got big
bezels can you see that still got big
bezels top bezel bottom bezels pretty
big so I'm not convinced this is going
to save blackberry I feel like I've said
that sentence maybe 12 times in videos
but this is this is a thing that exists
now blackberry motion good luck
blackberry okay do G mix to literally
just got this haven't even booted it up
yet but remember the original do G mix I
made a video about in the smartphone's
vs. no 2017 versus bezels video with
smartphones dang that was some weird
span you guys are just blasting emojis
don't do that
don't be that guy this is the sequel to
it I guess it says do G on the bottom
again it has dual cameras and this
orientation now it has a fingerprint
reader on the back in the middle which
is the right place good job there and
put a lot of other weird this is a heavy
phone and I believe it's ceramic which
is why it feels like this it's a big
heavy build has metal all the way around
it has a premium look now so instead of
what about red hydrogen damn I don't
know man that's you guys were asking
about red hydrogen like weeks ago like
do you have any updates to that I don't
know I all I got from red was what they
told me when I made that video and that
video that I made about the red hydrogen
has everything I'm allowed to say about
it so I don't have any updates
nothing news coming from them but to
people like me have put down money for
it
can't be about that time so looking out
for that but yeah no that's that's
definitely something what if that comes
out right around the smartphone Awards
that could be a weird one
we'll see we'll keep that updated that's
the do G mix I haven't even really used
it yet it's just like here's your first
look bezels are a little bigger actually
it goes back to the traditional top
bottom bezels looks like it has an extra
sensor that I've I should really boot it
up and use it but there it is
mkbhd seems electric cars will be the
first to experience solid-state
batteries when do you expect to see SSDs
in OSS bees and cell phones and other
smaller tech solid-state batteries and
cell phones I don't know exactly what
that means yet so I'm gonna have to look
that up is it in electric cars already
because I don't think that's any
different from the way it already is
electric cars use these lithium-ion
batteries we already see out there
Panasonic's been making them for years
so I don't know how long we'll see it in
cars or in phones with all this tech in
your life do you feel like you need
digital detox if you mean unplugging
then sometimes yes I just do unplug like
on a weekend for Ultimate Frisbee or
whatever I'm doing but highly recommend
it okay this last phone then I'm just
gonna blaze through a quick because it's
kind of neat is what's called what is it
here the box is pretty sweet and it's
maybe one of the coolest boxes of any
phone this year I wish I did an unboxing
but look look at this how about that
unboxing experience it all just kind of
unfolds this is meizu pro 7 plus this is
what the actual phone looks like and the
one thing you may notice about it that's
kind of weird is it has a screen on the
back it has a two inch color screen on
the back of the phone and it works by
cycling between these various displays
now it's still a full on screen and
phone on the front which it has this
impressing impressionable home button
right now you unlock it by swiping up
you go to multitasking just like an
iPhone by swiping up there you go it's
definitely got a heavy skin on it so if
you're not into skins this is not gonna
make you happy but this is a mazy phone
so you kind of know you're getting into
but the thing about it is people been
talking about that screen on the back
you have the settings for it right here
secondary display you can set a
different wallpaper for the secondary
display right now it's the camera you go
back and you can decide to show
pedometer whether maybe it's kind of
motivating to see how many steps you've
taken every time you look around at the
back of the phone I just wish it was
more consistent with activating bam bam
bam bam bam bam bam bam there it is
your weather if I had taken five hundred
steps today it would show me every time
there so that's kind of neat I guess
it's not a life changer it's not gonna
make me want to never use a phone
without this again but it's maybe kind
of cool so says why didn't you do a v3
review it's a good phone that's a great
question because we've had so many other
reviews and so many other things we've
done in the last couple of weeks and
months that by the time like it would be
around now that I'm getting to reviewing
the v30 it's almost like too late I did
the top features video of it and none of
that's different so that's kind of why
I'm talking about it now
whereas might be thirty they're still
charging over there I meant to have it
here but um okay do you think galaxy s
nine will be launched soon keep up the
good work
Thanks no I think Galaxy S nine is gonna
be April that tends to be when that
comes out there we go V thirty so here's
your V thirty this would be the most
expensive phone that's not a flagship
over here so it's not the pixel it's not
the iPhone but it is more expensive than
all of these it's about an $800 phone
right now
yeah it's still a great phone it's still
great phone v30 in case you're wondering
has the dual cameras has a super wide
angle camera on the back instead of the
telephoto but this might be the most
impressive video camera in a phone well
obviously of this year so likely ever
has all the manual controls it has an s
log modes so LG ready has great camera
tech and now they're using it to capture
extra dynamic range and extra
information if you're a video person
this might be one of the best phones to
get to fill around with that obviously
most people when they record video they
just go straight to auto mode and they
just hit the record button and go but if
you're not that guy then this is a
really interesting look so the 30 is
quite unique has a headphone jack there
you go right up the top note 8 iphone 10
yes that's a thing which of these phones
will survive the long run PS I got the
one plus 5 that's always the golden
question I tend to give my nod to the
flagships as far as surviving I've used
one plus phones also for multiple years
so I would give it a nod to one plus
five for probably surviving the long run
one plus 5t will probably also survive
LGB 30 people have had the weirdest
issue I've ever seen with LG phones is
their boot looping which has happened as
recently as did g5 I've seen but I think
LG is pretty much certified pixel 2 and
iPhone 10 definitely gonna last the long
run Apple tends to update their phones
for the longest out of anyone and pixel
being in line for I think two three four
years of updates is probably also gonna
survive the long run so I give the nod
to probably these two first for
surviving the longest these two on the
second tier for surviving the longest
and then blackberry who knows do G the
question mark and then meizu has their
own rom so razor phone that's also a
toss-up does razor even make another
phone next year we're getting a razor
phone too who knows hopefully I want to
see it I want to see 120 Hertz Ola
that's what I want to see
do you have a problem with edge lighting
not working well the screen is off on
the note 8 no it's usually been fine for
me it's pretty good for the alarm clock
actually because I have the alarm clock
set on my note 8 it would be set to like
gradually increase volume and so it
would start off the volume really low
and then the edge lighting would kind of
light up the table that it's on it's
pretty soothing to be honest
we're learning a lot about our a 6300
and livestreaming
turns out a 6300 sometimes overheats
when it's in a live stream for too long
when it's on and the censors cooking so
that's why we're talking to this angle
for a little bit can we expect holy
smokes that is exactly what I am working
on can I confirm it someone said can we
expect a portrait mode explaining video
that's the exact title of the video I'm
working on so yeah sure you can you can
expect that yeah I deal with that all
the time but yeah that's pretty much the
gamut of what I wanted to talk through
as far as this live stream goes anyone
else have any questions people are
talking to the super chat but not really
a asking questions so there's plenty of
fast moving giveaway update please I
gave you the giveaway update at the
beginning so if you want to scroll back
to that feel free to look at that audio
is behind a bit that may happen if again
if any lag happens you can just refresh
and no audio is out of sync now all
right maybe that's queue to end it that
makes sense so when it comes back to
this one we're good got it well yeah no
that's pretty much all I had to say for
the live stream so you got your giveaway
update you got your smartphone updates
talk through a bunch of stuff any
questions you may have this is
definitely the time to ask we can answer
a couple like a fast fast-moving what do
you call it speed round or whatever
lightning round
lightning questions Bitcoin oh man
Bitcoin Bitcoin see I took a class I've
taken classes in college where we talked
about Bitcoin and this was years ago and
we were shocked years ago at how fast
and how consistent it was moving and
this is like I'm now two years out of
college and Bitcoin just yesterday
passed $10,000 for one unit for one
Bitcoin and then this morning passed
11,000 in that time I signed up for
coinbase
and bought
my first Bitcoin so I I'm in at around
$11,000 for a Bitcoin I don't want to
put a ton into it I think it'll be
interesting to see if it keeps going if
it starts to become okay but for the
reason it's so hyped in the u.s. at
least right now is because you're
starting to be able to pay for things
with Bitcoin a little bit more it
trickles a little bit more down payments
for cars in Bitcoin down payments for
major purchases in Bitcoin large
electronics expenses using Bitcoin to
pay for it and because one Bitcoin is
$11,000 you often pay for something in
like zero point zero seven seven four
eight one two three Bitcoin and that's
cool you can do that but then Bitcoin is
also convertible back and forth between
cash between US dollars and it's pretty
liquid so in a short matter of time you
can buy ten thousand dollars in Bitcoin
wait for it to go up to twelve thousand
dollars sell it and then use that money
to go do whatever so that's what a lot
of people are doing are just buying
Bitcoin over and over again and a price
as people keep buying it just keeps
going up as the demand keeps going up
price keeps going up and it just keeps
rising so let me check what it is right
now I just installed coinbase this
morning when I want to go do that how
much is a Bitcoin let me refresh Bitcoin
eleven thousand eighty dollars it's up
one thousand one hundred forty five
dollars which is twelve percent today so
long story short really interesting
again I haven't been investing in
Bitcoin at all I just got in obviously
it's not the ideal point to invest in
Bitcoin but I'm just kind of curious so
this will give me a reason to keep track
of it a little more but yeah that is a
that is a weird one anyway okay that's
been it for this livestream shout out to
the twenty thousand of you still
watching I think that's pretty awesome
I'm gonna leave this stream up probably
too for people to catch up on all these
updates and to know about the giveaway
but that's pretty much it
we're gonna cut it if you have any
questions about the livestream equipment
we used I'll link that below any of the
video I talked about I'll link
at below the giveaways below that's been
it thank you for watching talk to you
