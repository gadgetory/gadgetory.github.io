and this is the Xiaomi me mix 3 may have
heard of it it's not really like
anything else I've seen in a while why
you may ask I mean it's really addicting
like anyway let's get into it so the me
mix you may remember that name from the
first me mix video I did two years ago
that kind of blew up it was one of the
first bezels phones or he may have
picked up that this one my runner-up for
the best design award in 2018 now I want
to be perfectly clear this isn't a
review of the whole phone this is just a
deeper look in another notch avoidance
technique that's become one of my
favorite so on this race 2 bezels phones
we have the standard notch everyone
knows it we have the teardrop notch we
have the infamous bathtub we have the
selfie pop-up we have the motorized
chassis and now we have this the manual
slider and I got to be honest this is
one of my favorite ways to do it so the
slide motion is spring-loaded as you'd
expect so it kind of snaps into place
and that's what makes it click and
that's what makes it this super
addicting motion and also every time you
do it with the volume on you get this
sound effect and a lighting effect along
the sides of the display where
automatically opens the front-facing
camera and then when you close it as you
can see it closes the camera and that
makes perfect sense because that's
really the only thing housed in this
particular slider the back facing camera
is already around the back available
anytime and there's no face unlock on
this phone so no IR blaster it has a
fingerprint reader on the back already
so basically the only thing you need the
slider for that you can't fit in this
already tiny top bezel is the dual
front-facing cameras and yes that is an
LED flash for your love light selfies
and actually the only thing I can get
the second front-facing camera to work
with is selfie portrait mode so it's not
like a second wide-angle front-facing
camera or anything crazy or useful like
that but basically just another sensor
for better depth detection so like I
said this this race for the apparently
ideal bezel a smartphone of the future
has spawned some of those interesting
stuff doing it this way has its own set
of
and cons the upside of being a manual
slider of course instead of a motorized
one means no motors so a lesser chance
of failure
it's just Springs and I'm pretty sure
this motion back and forth is guaranteed
for hundreds of thousands of repetitions
whereas a tiny motor activated by
software I can't be quite so sure and
I'll also say the satisfaction of this
click enos this addicting feel it's not
the only phone that slides like this but
this is definitely the most 2019 a
slider can get the downside though is it
still is a moving part most smartphones
have zero moving parts so the chance of
failure is greater than zero and
obviously it will increase with any sort
of debris or anything that might get
into this mechanism you got to be
careful about that although I guess with
this one it's not the end of the world
because if it fails you're just losing
your front-facing cameras and some
people might not really take that many
selfies anyway so if you're that person
maybe it doesn't matter as much to you
also another doubts that would be cases
for this phone is probably not gonna get
that many and not just because it's a
slider but more because it's just not as
popular of a line of phones but there is
one that Xiaomi makes that comes in the
box which is cool and it works perfectly
the bottom is opened up so the slider
mechanism works perfect and it's more
grippy than glass so if that's your
style then you're in luck and actually
that brings up one of the more under
echinus things about this phone this is
a really slick phone it's really
slippery and there are other really
slippery phones but that matter is more
with this one see there was another
slider phone a couple years ago this is
called the BlackBerry Prive yes I still
have mine and this was also a vertical
slider same mechanism with the thin
display at the front and then the rest
of the components in the back still
spring-loaded
and of course it had a full on physical
keyboard so then what they did with the
back of this phone is they made it super
grippy it's this tacky rubberized finish
like this is literally the grippy astone
I own and I made a lot of sense to do
because slide the phone open and close
need a lot of moving around the phone in
your hands so to have a grippy phone to
be able to do that just felt more secure
that way but this me mix three is
basically all mirror glass and it's not
as dramatic of a slide as the full
physical keyboard but that's a little
more dangerous in the hand if you have
such a slippery back and then
course it's double dangerous because
glass breaks so the slippery back is a
legit downside it's a con here but maybe
other phones that do this in the future
will use different materials or
different finishes o than that though
it's just a fascinating idea that you
can buy into right now if you want again
it's a moving part and I'm pretty sure a
single grain of sand or just enough
debris getting in here would eventually
become a problem it's hard to show on
camera but if you look at the right
angle you can actually see light passing
through the inside of this phone which
is kind of scary
oh and also another thing I found
interesting about me mix 3 obviously you
don't need two ear pieces but it kind of
looks like this phone does have that it
looks like the bottom one in the thicker
part of the phone is the real ear piece
and the top part is just this grill
that's just a hollow pass through so
when you slide it up it passes right
through which is clever and it makes
sense Xiaomi doesn't use the earpiece as
a second speaker anyway so it's not used
that much it's also six point four inch
OLED display 3200 milliamp-hour battery
Snapdragon 845 six SIG's of ram dual
front-facing and dual rear facing
cameras I mean it's a solid phone again
it's not a review but if you do want to
buy into this idea now it's not a
horrible idea you can do it but what do
you think of the whole slider thing
should more phones be doing this but
with better materials maybe I don't hate
it let me know what you think also let
me know if you think of these shorter
but more like regular topical videos I
think they're a lot of fun either way
thanks for watching Doxey guys the next
