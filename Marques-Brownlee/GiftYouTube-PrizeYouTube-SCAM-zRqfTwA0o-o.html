a quick video I know this isn't my usual
type or style of video but something is
really going around on YouTube that I
want to get word out to you guys about
that's really bothering me there's a
scam or a very popular comment on some
of the most popular youtubers pages like
John for Lakers or soldier knows best or
people who put out videos I've got a lot
of comments that says to go to gift
before the word YouTube and just don't
click on these links I'm advising you
now these this is a scam quite obviously
and it's a very alluring scam because
everyone wants a free gift but the thing
is I wanted to get this out to you guys
this video will probably go down by the
time this whole thing settles down but I
just want to warn you guys because I
really value you guys as subscribers so
don't click on those links if you
already have I'm assuming this is
something that they can use to hijack or
to get into your Google account which
has a lot of valuable information or
your YouTube account which allows them
to post comments from your YouTube
account onto other people's videos so if
you've clicked on this link already I'd
say to try try to change your Google
password as that's the best thing you
can probably do and if you haven't
already good for you do not click on
these links that's it I just wanted to
get this video out to you guys really
quickly and hopefully you guys are safe
and sound
have a nice afternoon Bass</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
