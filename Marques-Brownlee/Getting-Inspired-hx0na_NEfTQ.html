at Stephens Tech and I'm studying
Business and Technology information
systems and marketing and as many of you
guys already know me I'm a YouTube video
producer so if you want to check out
some of that work then BAM it'll be
right there you can check out some of
the rest of my videos so basically what
I like about studying business is that
you actually learn a lot about the world
around you outside of college and what I
mean by that is basically everything
that you work hard to do or everything
that you work towards or that you
surround yourself with if you think
about it it's all financially inspired
if you know to me 99% of the products
you see on the store shelves around you
of the websites that you visit and the
hard work that goes on around you
ultimately has some sort of financial
background and chances are is it's
really interesting to study majoring in
a business field should you choose to do
so can be one of the most eye-opening
things you learn a lot about people and
social and and how they spend their
money the psychology of it and why they
spend it and where and how often it's
really cool stuff one of the coolest
things I've learned about so far is
what's called consumer behavior it's how
marketing affects the choices that
people make and it affects millions of
people all around the world like
literally every day so honestly if you
want to get into something that is is
inspired by a lot of people that a lot
of people get into is definitely a field
to take note of so if you're not in
college yet or if you're just watching
this video I have a tiny bit of advice
for you what's your dream job what is
your dream job shoot for that through
what interests you honestly if you're
passionate about something then you have
a much better chance of success in a
field against someone who's not really
as passionate about it so when you're
passionate you put in extra work and
that's what gets you the advantage to
really make an impact in that field even
leave your own little dent in the
universe that's what I got for you guys
just so you know this is a video for a
contest so I would really appreciate if
you click the first link in the
description and hit that green vote
button to vote for this entry now excuse
me while I go study for finals thanks
for watching guys peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
