Brownlee here from mkbhd and welcome to
another HD review video and this is
actually going to be a sort of a tour of
my youtube insight which is basically
the statistics of the viewers of my
youtube channel so before I begin this
video I'm gonna go to my channel page
real quick before I begin this video I
want to let you guys know that you can
post a video response to this one of
your own tour of your YouTube insight I
really want to see what your YouTube
insight looks like what your popular
videos are where your viewers are from
stuff like that that's cool stuff to see
so basically the YouTube insight if you
if you didn't know already is basically
the statistics of the viewers of your
channel and the viewers of your videos
you can be the YouTube insight for an
individual video if it has a lot of
views and comments and ratings or you
can view the insight for your entire
channel and that's actually what I
prefer so to do that when you're signed
in just go up to the right-hand side and
hit the account' button and that will
bring up this account page youtube.com
slash account and from here you can go
hit that inside button on the right hand
side or just hover over account on the
left hand side and hit insight
statistics and data and this will bring
your YouTube insight which it does take
a tiny bit of time to load but it'll
bring up your YouTube inside right here
and this is the summary page for your
YouTube inside it will tell you a very
general overview of the demographics of
your audience so if you were thinking
about emailing a company telling them
you know I have a lot of viewers from
this part of the world or I have a lot
of subscribers who like these types of
videos you can definitely check this
part out so here's a summary and it'll
tell you right here views how many views
on my videos getting and how the
interesting thing is it goes from 600 to
1 K 2 1 K but I guess it's like 1 point
something thousand so right now I'm
hovering about one and a half thousand
views per day and it's - it's going
pretty well it's doing pretty steadily
and I'll get more into that in a second
over on the right hand
so I will have my videos and the percent
of total views and the attention and
down here is your demographics which can
be actually quite interesting to look at
and on the right hand side your
popularity in certain countries so all
up here in the left hand side is
basically how you navigate through the
different parts of the YouTube insight
if I scroll down here to views by
clicking on it
it'll give you a number of things
including a graph of your YouTube views
if you've ever gone to Google and
watched a stock you'll know that this is
a very similar graph down here you can
click this and drag to a longer period
of time and you'll see my views have
changed a lot sense and in the past six
months in the past about four months
I've been on YouTube I've done a pretty
steady number of views now on the right
hand side you'll see a map and this is
kind of like a density map with the
density of your viewership you'll be
able to see that a whole lot of my
viewers are in the United States and a
lot of them are in Canada and a lot in
the UK and a few more in Brazil and
Australia etc in order to view that
viewership for a certain country you can
click on the country Canada for example
and it'll switch the graph to see
exactly how many views have been from
that country
I've been hovering around 100-150 so
let's go back to all countries just by
clicking that I'm going to scroll down a
little bit here and show you my top
videos because this is really my
favorite part I did a tutorial on
downloading and installing Safari 4.0
beta when it first came out and that was
the first video on youtube about Safari
for beta and I got about sixteen
seventeen thousand views and since then
the final version of Safari four has
come out but the instructions for
installation have remained the same so I
just changed the title and added an
annotation letting you know the same
instructions applied and it's hit it's
become one of my most viewed video
spewed video as 25 percent of my total
video views' in the last six months so
now if we scroll up here to the
demographics section if we click on that
that is basically the the age and gender
of your viewers so most of my viewers
are under the age of 65 a little creepy
but yeah most
yours are between 13 and 24 I'd say and
the vast majority of my viewers are male
so I guess a shout-out to my female
viewers woo and over on the left hand
side there is a community button and
this is a pretty cool this is a pretty
cool feature of YouTube it'll let you
know the community engagement in your
videos so if I scroll down to the past
month
you can view total community engagement
in terms of ratings as a lot of good
ratings and in terms of comments and a
lot more comments and ratings and in
terms of favorites people who have
favorited my videos which goes up and
down also you can choose ratings per
view by just hitting that ratings per
view button and you can choose average
ratings and see your average ratings
over here so my average rating has been
hovering just over a 4.0 which which
rocks it's really awesome that you guys
rate my videos so highly and by the way
right this video 5 stars
so we can always go down and find
another statistic like comments and find
out how many comments per view if it's
close to 1 I'd be surprised but if you
go ahead and click comments review it
will let you know that and the graph
obviously has to refresh every time so I
think that's views per comment and then
we have to scroll down to favorites and
see our favorites per view and that'll
be of course a lower number but my
tutorials again they get a certain
amount of views depending on what time I
upload them now down here you'll see
what countries are most active in rating
commenting and subscribing to your
channel so if I go to ratings I'm just
gonna go to ratings most of the people
who rate my videos are from the United
States and from the UK and then here are
a list of the smaller countries the
smaller number of viewers and raters of
my videos and then we'll go over to the
left hand side and see percent of
community engagement now so it's pretty
cool that YouTube does give you this
feature if we go back to the summary
here it's really cool that they let you
see all those types of stuff about your
YouTube account and you really get a
good a good grasp of what you want to
send to a company when letting them know
of your viewership so thanks for
watching guys please post a video
response of your your YouTube insight I
want to see you know what's our most
popular video what's your demographic
look like maybe you can get a little
information about how to improve your
videos from that anyway this has been
Marcus Brownlee from mkbhd thanks for
watching thanks for rating and
commenting and most of all thanks for
subscribing to my videos it really means
a lot thanks for watching guys peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
