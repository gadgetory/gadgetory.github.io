and my challenge for this video is to
talk about USB and to keep it someone
interesting and also to get a point
across so USB is Universal Serial bus
key word being Universal this full-size
USB a has been around for years but our
devices are now getting too small and
too powerful honestly to keep using this
huge legacy port so it's time to USB see
all the things we're slowly closing in
on a day where we can go to work or go
on vacation and just bring one cable and
one charger just one thing to charge our
laptop our tablets our phones everything
but we're just not quite there yet so
knowing that we're on our way towards
USB type-c for everything and actually
ever since the MacBook Pro review people
have been asking well if we want to stay
ahead of the curve if we don't want to
get left behind we got to get stuff
that's good now so what are the best USB
type-c accessories available right now
this video is for those so a normal
thing you've probably use at some point
is a flash drive a full-size USB flash
drive obviously but if devices in the
future are all going to use USB type-c
instead you're going to want a USB
type-c flash drive actually Santa takes
this a step further and has made this
which is a regular USB C flash drive on
one end and a full-size USB on the other
end and is two different connectors but
it's the same Drive so same files same
storage same everything just expands
compatibility so that should help bridge
the gap for someone living in like say
2017 I'll leave a link to this and
everything else I talked about right
below that like bus so we all have
regular headphones and we've all
probably seen wireless headphones and
even lightning headphones I made a video
all about those but what we haven't seen
that much of is USB type-c headphones
mostly because there haven't been that
many devices to drop the headphone jack
and just have USB type-c
no dizzy so until then I wouldn't expect
to see that many but one that keeps
happening in 2017 I'm telling you it's
going to happen now we're going to start
to see more USB type-c headphones so
until then this is the one and only
pair of USBC headphones I've found
obviously they're earbuds so if you
don't like earbuds you're not going to
like these but hopefully there should be
way more in the next year I'm also
hoping that wireless charging becomes
much more popular than it has been
because you kind of want to still be
able to charge and listen to music at
the same time anyway one of the bigger
downsides of moving to USB type-c was
actually the loss of MagSafe charging in
the new MacBook Pros they all use USB
type-c to charge so there's no more
MagSafe luckily Griffin has come to the
rescue and they've made this USB type-c
MagSafe replacement that accomplishes
the same effect if you don't mind always
having this little nub always sticking
out of your computer it works the same
way it's not perfect and sometimes if
you yank it straight off it takes both
parts out of your computer but it's
still better than having that cable drag
your laptop off your desk and there's
also car charges right so right now
they're all full-size USB but again the
move to the future will have way more
USB type-c so you can get your hands on
something like this Nomad makes this USB
type-c car charger and as a bonus it has
a 3000 milliamp hour battery built in so
even when the car is off you can charge
up so that is really convenient and I
expect to see more stuff like that and
then battery banks are also slowly
starting to migrate to so Ankur is a
pretty popular manufacturer they've made
one of my favorite already this is a
twenty thousand milliamp hour battery
plenty of power that you can just slip
in your backpack or a bag and it can
easily charge up a couple tablets or
smartphones or even your USB type-c
laptop several times over so all these
battery and power accessories are
actually doing pretty well all they have
to do is just switch to USB type-c to
keep pushing power through that cable
but the things that have to get a little
more complex to push data through that
cable as well that's where it starts to
get a little tricky so there's a couple
USB type-c mobile SSDs that I've found
and these are a pretty big deal if
you're a video editor if you're on the
go working with really big files then
you'll start to use these a lot and the
glyph was pretty promising but it
started to have some issues for multiple
people including me on the new MacBook
Pro so right now the best one I found is
the Samsung t3 I've got a pair of them
they go up to a terabyte and speeds are
pretty great the cables nice and short
so for mobile editing this makes a great
addition to the set up and then at the
desktop I was waiting for this one for a
while but this is the promised Pegasus
3r8
it's a desktop raid array this happens
to be the one with eight hard drives in
it and each hard drive is six terabytes
in rates so this is a 48 terabyte tower
of storage so as of three videos ago I'm
now keeping all of the raw video now fun
fact for years I was not doing that I
was just keeping the final video file
and throwing away all of the raw video
footage because 8k raw is just a lot now
I'm just going to start keeping it all
but even as good as USB type-c is at the
end of the day sometimes you're just
going to need another port you know you
might need HDMI or you might need
Ethernet and so port expanders like this
Dell one are going to be good for you or
even from Kickstarter the hyper drive
which you've probably seen it takes one
or two USB type-c ports but then adds
them back and gives you a bunch of
others this one gives you HDMI and SD
card slot and a micro SD card slot etc
if it's the MacBook Pro aesthetic pretty
well it comes in the right color so
silver or gold or Space Gray and if you
don't mind again having a little
something sticking out of your computer
this can likely solve the biggest
problems we have with the MacBook Pro
port situation this is not one of those
fading trends like USB type-c is gaining
momentum and is going to be everywhere
to stay it's not like 3d TVs which kind
of rose and then fell or even like the
sort of modular thing that we're seeing
sort of spark in and out this is
definitely here to stay and you're going
to want to be on board when this becomes
the true Universal again USB type-c
should be everywhere so that's been it
hope this helps
hope you enjoyed a video about USB and
feel free to share it for others who you
think should know about the feature
that's coming thanks for watching talk
to you guys in the next one basis</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
