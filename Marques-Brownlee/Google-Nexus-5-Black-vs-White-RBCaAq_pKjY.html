welcome to the 600th video I've ever
uploaded to YouTube and it's a quick one
it's a pretty simple one too as I spend
more quality time with the Nexus 5 and
I'm going to be giving you guys my full
review quite soon so make sure you're
subscribed if you haven't already if you
want to see that I was playing with a
black Nexus 5 before this and a lot of
people's personal Nexus 5's are now
shipping and I ordered a 32 gig white
Nexus 5 and that's what I'm holding now
but as I have them both now in hand
turns out there are a lot of physical
differences between the two so it's more
than just a gut decision in terms of
which color you want to get when you
look at black Nexus 5 or white Nexus 5
so let's go ahead and check out the
differences it actually starts with the
box then you'll probably see a lot of
these differences when you watch
people's unboxing videos of the phone if
you haven't go back and watch them again
people who unbox the Black Nexus 5 will
show just one phone on the box while the
white Nexus 5 actually has two phones on
it has a side angle view of the phone on
the box basically letting you know that
this is in fact the white one but
everything else about the contents of
the box are the same no fancy color of
headphones or anything now when you look
at the phones themselves head on there's
only one difference and it's not
immediately obvious unless you've seen
them compared already but the inside of
the earpiece is white on the white phone
and black on the black phone the front
of the devices are otherwise identical
and that's the only way to tell them
apart I kind of like that accent it kind
of spices up the design of an otherwise
understated phone but I think it would
have been even cooler if they had a
multicolor LED notification light in
there but that'll be detailed more in
the full review now another thing when
you look at these unboxings is you're
going to notice two kinds of unboxings
unboxings of the black Nexus 5 will have
protected plastic on the front and the
back and unboxings of the white Nexus 5
will have protective plastic on the
front the back and the sides and the top
and the bottom since LG wrapped up all
the glossy plastic on this phone with
plastic and that's the thing the black
Nexus 5 is not glossy on the sides while
the white Nexus 5 is it's a subtle
difference at first but you might not
even notice it at all while you're
holding it in the hand but there is
definitely a difference in material just
for the band around the black versus the
white phone having used both phones like
say it makes a legitimate difference in
build quality worth knowing about and if
you're stuck choosing between black
versus white consider this difference
now both phones also have the same exact
ceramic button material so the buttons
are you know they're supposed to feel
tactile and they actually do so they
feel the same on both but with little
things like the SIM card tray the
hardened rubberized feel of the matte
black Nexus 5 feel more sturdy there's
also little differences in how they
fingerprint obviously the black nexus is
the same material on the sides and on
the back but they it basically behaves
exactly the same way as the Nexus 7 from
2013 the white model hides fingerprints
pretty well on the back but it shows
them way more on the sides because of
that gloss so it's an interesting
trade-off for an interesting design also
having the soft touch white Nexus 5 in
my pocket is so far I'm not dirtying up
the phone at all or causing it to stain
which is good because usually you know
this can be a legitimate concern for
soft touch back phones that are white
that's the same reason why the Galaxy
Note 3 is a different material for the
black one and the white one so basically
the takeaway here is that there is more
than just a color difference between the
black and the white Nexus 5 there's a
more interesting design up for grabs in
exchange for a different finishing
material that may change the way you see
the device people reviewing the white
Nexus 5 are going to talk about that
plastic band just a heads up worth
sharing so you guys can see there is
actually a couple of little minor other
things to consider when you're picking
one or the other color personally I'm
going to be sticking with the black and
white I think this in my opinion is a
little more interesting
I like the understated very simple
design of the all-black Nexus 5 but I
also like the Stormtrooper look a little
bit more how with the white on black
Nexus 5 so that's going to be checking
out like I said this is just a quick
video going over the black versus white
differences but make sure you are
subscribed to get the full review video
in your sub box when that comes out very
very soon so either way thank you for
watching and I will talk to you guys in
the very next one peace
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
