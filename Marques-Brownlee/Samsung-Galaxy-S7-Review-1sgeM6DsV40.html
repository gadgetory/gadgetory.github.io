this is a full view of the Samsung
Galaxy s7 so this is a phone that's
similar in a lot of ways to its
predecessor the one that came before it
which would be the galaxy s6 so the
easiest way to talk about this phone and
to completely understand it is to look
at all the differences between it and
the one that came before it so this is
everything you need to know that's new
and different about the galaxy s7 so
first of all the body is slightly
different it's slightly upgraded and
most people hear that to mean it got
thinner but this phone is actually
slightly thicker and I'm calling that
the upgrade because it's allowing one a
much smaller camera bump on the back and
to a much smaller home button / the
fingerprint reader bump on the front
actually had a lot less accidental home
button presses with this phone so that's
nice and the phone is still pretty thin
but the extra space inside is packing a
much larger 3000 milliamp hour battery
so that's pretty important and then they
focused on the shape in the hand a
little bit more so the edges are left
sharp the phone is easier to pick up and
hold and the back glass is more rounded
on the sides like the galaxy note 5 and
then the rest is all the same premium
materials from last year so Gorilla
Glass 4 on the front and back and then
metal rails on the sides and really nice
buttons I don't think Samsung gets
enough credit for how nice the buttons
are they pretty much have the power
button and volume buttons on point so
overall you get the idea the build is
slightly improved but still very
familiar in fact this is definitely
still the slipperiest phone I've ever
held or used alongside the note 5 like
this has slipped out of my pocket while
sitting in a car multiple times so yeah
overall the shape and build of this
phone is definitely one of those
incremental improvements from last year
ok the next difference is ip68 this
phone is now totally dust sealed and
water-resistant so you can use it in the
rain or near a pool or at a beach or get
splashed or whatever it's fine and it
does it all internally so there's no
like weird flaps or anything over the
USB ports or the headphone jack I love
that the design stays the hit as it gets
waterproofed here the one downside is
definitely the speakers the speakers
suffer massively here pretty sure the
galaxy s7 just got the biggest downgrade
of any speakers on a smartphone they're
now way tenure and
were distorted sounding and he can blame
that fully on the waterproofing so the
Galaxy s7
also got the micro SD card slot back I
did not expect that to actually happen I
threw that out there in an older like
predictions video as a sort of a oddball
feature that might happen but you do
actually have it now you do have
expandable storage in the galaxy s7 and
of course you can't have a new flagship
phone without all your new flagship
specs and you get all of that here so in
the US that's the Snapdragon 820 chip
Adreno 430 and 4 gigabytes of ram and
performance is definitely up to snuff to
match this is a really quick and snappy
phone again like the galaxy s6 was and
we're getting much improved Ram
management as well that's big here I'm
glad to see this phone handle
multitasking that much better than its
predecessor which kind of occasionally
had issues holding apps and RAM with
metal and glass it still does get a bit
warm even with the new internal cooling
but nothing too severe just a little
warm to the touch when you're gaming for
a while or doing some heavy browsing but
just with everyday use it's fine
wireless charging heats up a bit but
I'll talk about that later so yeah this
phone is fast again that's one of its
biggest strengths and definitely one of
the biggest reasons to get it so the
last but not least actually the biggest
difference with the new s7 is the new
camera this new 12 megapixel camera this
is my favorite camera on any smartphone
right now and that's putting it on top
of a very good heap of other smartphone
cameras out there and I got to say there
is no shooter that consistently makes me
feel as confident as a photo and video
taker as the galaxy s7 and that's what
really makes a good photo experience for
me so the camera app opens with that
double top of the home button really
quick from anywhere again super fast and
it's immediately ready for a shot
there's no shutter lag or anything it's
very quick to just grab a photo and a
lot of people look at the new 12
megapixel photo number and think oh wait
that's less megapixels than last year
it's not a big deal 12 megapixels is
still plenty and these pixels are now
larger which along with the optical
image stabilization and the huge F 1.7
aperture should help a lot with
low-light
should the photo quality in auto mode is
again very typical Samsung so very
bright punchy colors lots of saturation
and contrast and sharpening they've been
doing this forever so I get it one thing
that's more notable is that F 1.7
aperture
it's so easy to blow backgrounds
out-of-focus even in broad daylight with
normal subjects if you get close enough
to the subject you can get that blurry
background which is pretty crazy and the
new dual pixel autofocus handles the
shallow depth of field really well
pretty much always nails it
so photos pretty much always looks solid
coming off this phone I'd say the
biggest weakness is it tends to
overexpose a bit in daylight conditions
there are definitely more blown
highlights than crushed shadows although
throughout the pictures I've taken it's
actually not the best in low-light
here's an example of the exact same
picture I took on the galaxy s7 versus
my Nexus 6p now Nexus is haven't even
always had the best image processing but
it clearly beats the s7 here so I would
have liked to have seen
I guess less grain from the s7 camera
and low-light and a little bit more
controlled exposure during the day
here's the thing though that autofocus
is the best part of this new camera and
it's crazy fast also in video mode it's
just as fast making this pretty much the
ideal for high quality video if you want
to shoot 4k video in the easiest
possible way guarantee usable footage
this phone is the one to have over all
the fast autofocus combined with the
fast aperture and the fast camera app
make this the fastest smartphone camera
alongside the iPhone and it's a pleasure
to use for that reason
oh and that front-facing camera is not
bad also five megapixels and also an F
1.7 aperture and an even wider angle
than the back camera it's not quite as
sharpened or oversaturated but it takes
a pretty good selfie if you're into that
so there you have it a couple of
incremental but important changes that
make the galaxy s7 a different beast
plus I guess all the things about the
galaxy s6 that were already pretty great
the best display in any smartphone the
5.1 inch quad HD Super AMOLED that gets
super bright the premium materials the
fast home button fingerprint reader
that's I think second only to touch ID
and some quick charging and wireless
charging of a new larger battery and the
actual life for me with a larger battery
was really impressive too I would give
myself like a B+ or a minus four as far
as how long this lasts during the day
pretty much never had to charge it
before the end of the day and I was
getting somewhere between five to five
and a half hours of screen on time
typically which is a big improvement
over the notably bad battery life of the
galaxy s6 so
something I was really excited to see
and you also still have fast-charging
you still have wireless charging you
still have fast wireless charging it
does get a little bit warm to the touch
when your wireless charging but other
than that pretty much no complaints
about the new battery now it's
definitely not perfect it still has its
flaws I made an entire video about that
and if you want to watch that it'll be
linked in this corner or below that like
button and it's missing a couple things
you know it doesn't have an IR blaster
some people were confused about the
dropping of that it's also like I
mentioned the slipperiest phone ever and
definitely looks and feels better with a
case or even better a nice skin on it
plus you kind of hide the fingerprints
and make it easier to hold I'll link the
D brand skin below I think that mat
looks clean and it's definitely still
not everyone's favorite software so this
Samsung scan on top of Android obviously
since it's Android you can still go to
town with the skins and custom launchers
and really make it your own but someone
like me will do that within minutes of
setting it up someone who's not really
into it might take a while and might not
like it out the box but overall I really
like this phone some of the little stuff
that used to be third-party apps Samsung
is picking up on it and building it into
their own software so stuff like the
always-on display is a nice touch so for
example since it's always an AMOLED
display you can choose to always have a
clock calendar or still image when the
phone is sleeping and it avoids burnin
by moving around the display
periodically doesn't burn too much
battery I think it's cool if you use a
calendar a lot it would be cool to have
that always on I'm not sure why you want
a still image but hey there's always
that option but yeah it's taken a lot of
stuff like this and adding it into their
own software so if you don't find it on
day one then you'll probably find it a
little while down the road after using
this phone for a while but at the end of
the day the big question is is this
galaxy s7 worth the upgrade over
whatever phone you have now if you have
something like a galaxy s6 or even a
high-end phone from last year it might
not be worth all the changes the couple
of things you do get if you're really
really into video this is the best video
camera on a smartphone now and if you're
really into having a better battery life
this is definitely a better battery life
than the galaxy s6 but if you're going
to upgrade if you have to and you're not
really sure I would at least opt for the
galaxy s7 edge which is a little bit
bigger but you also get those edge
features and you get an even larger
battery for even better battery life
overall a pretty well-rounded experience
nope
that was totally intended so that's been
it thanks for watching this review video
hopefully enjoyed it feel free to give
it a thumbs up if you do and I'll talk
to you guys in the next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
