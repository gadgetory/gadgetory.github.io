and this is the Google pixel slate this
tablet it was announced alongside the
pixel 3 back in October I ordered one
then it didn't ship for a couple weeks
it was a little bit delayed but now I've
got my and this thing has made me so sad
and confused and curious but mostly sad
like if I was doing a tablet award show
also for 2018 this one would most likely
end up getting the toilet bowl trophy
bust of the year here's why so whenever
a new tech product comes out and it's a
letdown
obviously that's a disappointment for
everyone but it's an even bigger
disappointment when the expectations and
the potential were sky-high so that's
like something what happened with the
phone bust of the year the red hydrogen
I'm someone who likes a lot of red
products I respect what they do they
announce they're coming out with a new
product that's a phone my expectations
are way up here the phone comes out it's
really bad then that Delta between what
I expected and what we got was just
drastic that's what's happening again
here with the pixel slate so when the
iPad pro came out earlier this year I
thought like wow this is gonna be really
hard for anything to beat this the iPad
already had this huge lead over every
other tablet and I just took another
huge step forward with this build and
this incredible performance like how can
anything else measure up there are other
tablets of course that do other things
well but none of them really touch the
iPad as far as usability but then pixels
sleep just kind of loomed on the horizon
so when I finally got mine I was really
pumped and I want to give it a shot at
possibly taking over all of my tablet
use like maybe this will be just as fun
to use as the iPad pro maybe even more
fun because it has a few key advantages
like right off the bat any first
impression of a device starts out the
box with the aesthetics and this is a
solid looking tablet
it's almost matte black it's this sort
of dark matte blue all the way around
there's almost no logos which is took a
subtle classic G in the corner and it's
a pretty symmetrical and balanced no
camera bump at all that's a good start
and the more I looked into this the more
I remember all these reasons that Google
is telling me back in October why this
is going to be the dopest laptop tablet
convertible
and to me I don't know possibly better
than the iPad pro so it has a pair of
stereo front-facing speakers just like
back in the Nexus 10 days so audio is
actually facing towards me and I can
pretty much never accidentally block
them and the sound turns out is pretty
good it's got volume it's full it's
great for a tablet and then the display
is by far the flagship piece of this
hardware it's not a hundred twenty Hertz
but everything else about it is super
high-end it's a three thousand by two
thousand twelve point three inch display
so a little taller than sixteen by nine
and plenty sharp it's called a molecular
display I don't know what I have to name
everything but they do the point is its
super crisp this is the max brightness
it's not very bright but it's still
indoors plenty fine and really good
looking for watching shows and videos
and things like that and then there were
even smaller things like the i/o there
are two USB C ports one on each side
either one can be used to plug into
charge and you can plug in both at the
same time if you want to one for
charging and one for some accessory and
even the power button on the side
doubles as a fingerprint reader so no
need for face unlock but basically every
time you hit the button you're already
securely unlocked and then it has these
smart pins at the bottom that work
perfectly with this incredible pixel
slate accessory that I think is
objectively better than Apple's the
keyboard so the slate sort of slaps into
this keyboard at the connector and then
there are enough magnets in both the
tablet and the folio the case itself
that you can connect it to prop up the
back and once they're connected it's
literally any angle instead of just some
set number of fixed angles and on top of
that it has Chrome OS which on paper is
a nice combo of Chrome for all your web
stuff plus the Play Store for all these
Android apps all in one place and the
USB C ports that can actually read
accessories like SD cards and storage
drives so proper power users paradise so
I was pumped about all of this like my
expectations are really high there's a
lot of great hardware maybe this will
unhook me from the iPad pro and be just
as good then I used it and pretty much
all of that went directly out the window
welcome to lag city population pixel
slate
you might remember I I
didn't show my first impressions of the
pixel slate in my video where I went to
Google before then build a pixel 3 and
that was because I literally thought
there's no way it's this bad and it's
pre-production software and I'll give
him the benefit of the doubt and I
didn't show it on camera and I just did
a pixel 3 first impressions but I did
see this in pre-production mode but now
that they're shipping it like this it's
this is it it's almost unbelievable this
is real-time the animation for
multitasking legitimately takes several
seconds and it's everywhere scrolling is
not fast loading pretty much anything is
slow I feel like this whole UI runs at
like 12 to maybe 20 frames per second
usually pinch-to-zoom and pretty much
anything but especially in web browsing
is usually lag city it's just not fun
and like no matter how many features you
throw in here no matter how powerful
Chrome OS can be I'll never be able to
use this tablet long enough to even
discover half of that stuff because it's
just really not fun I've been trying to
force myself to use this tablet for the
past couple days on and off messing with
apps flipping back and forth between web
apps and native apps and doing some
writing and watching videos etc but I
never really got very far because within
minutes I'm just sitting there and noted
how much lag and choppiness there is
everywhere and of course that is a stark
contrast basically the opposite of what
makes the iPad pro so fun to use which
is the excessive effortless and smooth
performance thanks to that a 12x Bionic
it's massively powerful so I'm thinking
a lot of that has to do with the spec I
bought this is the baseline model so 600
bucks so it is cheaper than the iPad pro
and for that money you get four gigs of
ram 32 gigs of internal storage and an
internal Intel Celeron processor which
you know that's probably a bottleneck so
if I give them that benefit of the doubt
I'd have to spend about 800 bucks which
is the same as iPad pro money just to
get out of Celoron world or maybe I
should have gone with the i-5 but for
Chrome OS I like really they shouldn't
either way they shouldn't ship this one
this is so sad honestly and I had a lot
of hope but I literally haven't been
able to force myself to use it long
enough to dive into the more niche
features or really test the battery life
or any of that because none of that
stuff
even matters if at the surface it's
borderline unusable the good news if you
want any is this is all software and in
theory it can all be fixed in the blink
of an eye with a software update and
I've seen good products get better but
not a lot of terrible things get to be
great
so the chances of this tablet becoming
incredible are pretty low but let me
just say this isn't a completely useless
tablet it does have some upsides that I
survived long enough to notice Chrome OS
for example lets you connect straight to
your Android phones so when I'm
connected to my pixel it can tether
automatically and use my phone's data
when there's no Wi-Fi and it has a
messages app so they sync up and I can
get texts on the tablet and reply it
without picking up my phone it's
basically just like apples sweet the AI
at the top trying to predict what you'll
do next or what app you'll open next is
actually pretty good unlike some others
and with Chrome since it's straight up a
web browser you can go split screen with
multiple tabs in multiple windows it's
still extremely slow and annoying but if
you know that the features are here you
can take advantage of this and honestly
this thing does much better as a laptop
than it does as a free-standing tablet
that now that requires buying the
optional 200 dollar keyboard accessory
which is not cheap but it is really good
this thing first of all is made of much
more premium materials I've hated the
fingerprinting rubber Apple uses for a
while this one's soft touch it's fabric
on the outside and the magnet is
stronger and once you connect it the
magnets stay stuck to the metal so you
have your infinite angles for adjustment
instead of just two or three literally
just by sliding it up and down it has
more specialized function keys that work
specifically in Chrome OS so brightness
media multitasking there's a Google
assistant button and the keys themselves
have way more travel so they're better
for people who like to type for a little
while the keys are freaking backlit so
you can see them in the dark and there's
a trackpad and mouse so it's basically a
whole laptop action happening there's
two fingers scrolling the whole deal
obviously something I really missed on
the iPad I could even go so far as to
say the pixel slate with this really
good keyboard accessory is closer to
replacing an actual everyday laptop then
the iPad pro is with its keyboard
accessory
there'll be a bold thing to say but I
could say it but without this keyboard
if you were planning on using this as
your daily tablet this ain't it chief
this is not the move
do not spend $600 on this my advice
would be give a shot for the the i5 or
i7 versions of it maybe performance will
be better and you can use it more often
as a laptop or if you only have that six
hundred bucks to spend just get an iPad
so that's pretty much it a sad story but
that's the truth
thanks for watching catch you guys in
the next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
