alright so there is something that got
cut from my Samsung Galaxy fold unboxing
video the last video from the other day
but you've probably already seen it by
now all over mostly twitter it all sort
of unfolded unfolded at the same time
several galaxy folds all broke in the
hands of reviewers all around the same
time four separate but very related
reasons mine was one of them so this is
the galaxy fold breaks explained so
three days ago when I shot that unboxing
I noticed what appeared to be a screen
protector on the Galaxy fold and you
guys already known this anytime there's
a film on the screen out the box whether
I'm on camera or not I take the plastic
off if it's an Apple phone a Samsung
phone whatever I take off the
pre-installed screen protector you guys
have seen this before so on this phone
there was what looked like this thin lip
all the way around the inside screen
just like your typical pre-installed
screen protector in fact just for a
visual
since galaxy s 10 sort of had a similar
experience also from Samsung this is a
brand new Galaxy S ten fresh out the box
and it has this pre-installed plastic
that basically looks exactly the same it
has a lip basically all the way around
and it's got a cutout around the hole
punch display similar look I would
immediately take that off so want to
solve the same lip on the Galaxy fold I
was like alright let me add that to the
unboxing video or move that and I'll
just take it off so I pointed a camera
at it and I started peeling from that
bottom where it's easiest to take a
fingernail under the screen protector so
I start peeling it up and within a
couple seconds you start to realize like
it's a little it's more well glued than
a normal screen protector and then by
the time I get to an area the size of
like a dime in like five seconds those
screen just goes black and then like
this little area there's like a stripe
and then the top-left corner starts
flickering that's definitely not good
I'm like I really just broke it like I
feel like such an idiot and I kind of
regret that I didn't get to keep that
footage because it's on camera literally
as I'm peeling it the screen goes black
yeah that was
not just a regular screen protector so I
emailed Samsung they seemed totally
understanding of it which is interesting
but then they replace the phone so this
is my replacement Galaxy fold that I'm
definitely not trying to peel the screen
protector off of so I set the new phone
up it's all good been using it since but
then sure enough yesterday I see a tweet
from dieter from the verge my galaxy
folds screen broke after just a day and
this whole article explaining it and I'm
like whoa really and then I see sure
enough on my timeline like all next to
each other in a row within minutes our
other reviewers with the galaxy fold
saying hey my screen broke too
oh yeah my screen broke too mine too all
next to each other so I'm reading is all
thinking oh I didn't realize that I
wasn't the only one but now we have all
the information about the couple galaxy
falls that had problems so of the four
galaxy folds that broke in the last two
days these are the reasons why they
broke so the first one deters he never
messed with the film on the display but
it did start to develop this bulge for
some unknown reason like something got
under the film somehow and that bulge
eventually a day later killed the screen
giving it these stuck pixels and number
2 Steve Kovac he also didn't mess with
the film but I look at the photos that
he sent before he's sending the phone
back to Samsung and it doesn't look
fully intact so it might have taken some
damage somehow but either way it clearly
did not survive and it looks like half
the display is going completely insane
then number three mark durman's he
actually tweeted the phone comes with
this layer that he thought was a
protective film he peeled the entire
thing off so it must have survived that
peeling but that did pretty quickly
caused the death of the screen which
slowly over the next 12 hours went from
half black to two-thirds black to
completely busted and then mine
I got a few seconds into peeling off
what I thought was that screen protector
and then very decisively that is exactly
what broke the screen so that's two of
different types of breaks the way I see
it the first two from actually peeling
at the film and the other two from just
damaging the screen or the film somehow
through regular use which it's those
second two that are much more concerning
but just as far as the film goes like
that's that's gonna happen people PSA if
you are one of the few thousand people
however many pre-ordered the Galaxy fold
do not remove that protective film
it might as well be basically part of
the screen matter-of-fact des from
t-mobile tweeted this photo that started
making the rounds which is clearly a
warning where it says on the plastic of
the fold that says the main screen
includes a special protective layer
peeling that protective layer or using
any adhesives on the main screen such as
a screen protector or stickers may cause
damage I mean it should say will
definitely cause a lot of damage and may
possibly break the whole thing but
anyway the only problem with this
warning is it must be a t-mobile or
carrier related late edition because
this text is not on the packaging of any
of the review units I went around asking
other people who would unbox the fold if
they'd had any sort of warning in their
box you can go back and look at my
unboxing video there's definitely no
text on that film you can also watch
Lou's video he did an unboxing there's
no text on that film
Joanna also confirmed she didn't have
any mark so she knows best didn't have
any either
this is actually my Galaxy fold wrapper
no text at all on mine which means some
time between them giving these review
units and them arriving in carrier
stores someone must have realized that
they should probably put a warning
somewhere and I think now they're
realizing that warning should probably
be even bigger because nobody really
reads that fine print but here's the
thing even if I never tried to peel it
off a film with a lip like this is
eventually gonna start to collect a
little bit of dust and may even start to
peel matter of fact Joanna's as she's
tweeted a photo of has already started
to this is how a galaxy fold that she
somehow managed to resist the urge to
peel but the scariest part is even if
you don't mess with that film at all
there is still a potential for it to get
damaged somehow through regular use
so Samsung seeing all this in the last
like 48 hours put out a statement we
don't really learn much from it but they
did anyway they said we received a few
reports regarding the main display on
the samples provided we will thoroughly
inspect those units in person to
determine the cause of the matter that's
definitely for the ones that weren't
obviously because of the peeling of the
film but then separately a few reviewers
reported having removed the top layer of
the display causing damage to the screen
the main display on the Galaxy fold
features a top protective layer which is
part of the display structure designed
to protect the screen from unintentional
scratches removing a protective layer or
adding adhesive to the main display may
cause damage so we will ensure this
information is clearly delivered to our
customers so essentially that's it a
folding phone requires a plastic display
instead of glass
and that soft plastic is a culprit here
like I'm gonna guess like scratches at a
level three with deeper grooves at level
four if you know what I'm saying but
this is brutal as far as PR goes not
just for Samsung but for folding phones
in general like even I am now way more
skeptical about huawei mate X which I
thought looked incredible
but now I'm kind of concerned about that
folding display being on the outside how
is that gonna hold up in the hands of
normal people so it is pretty sad that
it's it's gonna take a ding out of how
people think about these phones not to
be super clear I was never really going
to go out and recommend people buy the
$2,000 galaxy full I don't think most
people would but there is still always
lots of room to be optimistic like if
you're a fan of tech you root for this
stuff like you want to see things these
crazy new ideas actually succeed and
gain traction so that we can see a
second generation and a third generation
and then it can actually improve one of
the more common comments I've seen
actually is people saying Samsung they
should have waited and worked on this
more until it was done and ready instead
of rushing to try to be the first
foldable phone but the reality is
Samsung's been working on this for a
long time they've said eight years of
development so you can only imagine how
crazy this was before in prototype form
so this is the point that they got to
where they felt like alright it is ready
but failures happen in all kinds of ways
and all kinds of scales with all sorts
of tech products I mean everything from
butterfly keys to wireless chargers to
exploding phones and everything in
between it's just brutal when it happens
to a product that you're really excited
about though it I guess you don't have
to say this is a failure yet because as
far as I know they're not delaying this
at all they're still gonna ship galaxy
fold in this first generation very much
feels like this like public beta test as
we learned so much from it but that's
our job as reviewers is to give this
feedback and when it's in the public
hands we're gonna learn even more things
from it but I think the main takeaway
right now is we have foldable phones
this one it's a delicate phone the
200,000 folds from a robot don't
necessarily translate to a lifetime of
use by a human there's a thing called
user error and it's gonna happen there's
moving parts there's a hinge there's a
no water resistance like there's all
sorts of new things to consider with a
new form factor and this is definitely a
hurdle on the
towards them getting good like a pretty
big hurdle but that's the thing is I
still can't wait to genuinely say like
in a future video in some like 2023
video where I can say hey folding phones
are getting really good like that's the
thing you root for in tech is for things
to get good and I still think I'm
rooting for folding phones to eventually
get good but with where Tech's at now we
got some hurdles but that's pretty much
it that's where we're at that's all the
information about the couple of broken
galaxy folds that existed in the world
in the first couple days and what it
means but let me know what you guys
still think I'm gonna keep using this
phone as my daily driver and the next
couple of days for a full review and
it's still gonna be a pretty interesting
experience but let me know what you
think maybe you'd still be interested in
a galaxy fold drop it in the comment
section below
either way thanks for watching catch you
guys the next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
