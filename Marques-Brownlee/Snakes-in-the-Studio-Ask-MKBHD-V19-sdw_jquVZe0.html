in 144p
Oh
you
when can we get some mkbhd merch well
okay so you may have noticed this custom
mkbhd edition circuit design shirt that
i've worn in the past couple videos this
you can now get on sale right now it is
a limited edition for two weeks so if
you want to get it you should hop on
that the link is of course below it's
soft comfortable wear as well there's
actually a couple different colors
available and it ships internationally a
lot of people forget I actually have
done two shirts on auntie spring in the
past I think the goal with these is to
make something that you can wear and
people don't ask like what is that you
know you can wear it anywhere and it's
just kind of a cool design that happens
to have the logo incorporated somewhere
and I think we pulled that off
so yeah this design with the white
circuits now available in a couple
different dark colored shirts and this
design actually has its roots and
something else you'll see very soon but
until then it's available right now let
me know what you think how do you feel
after winning love day so if that was
really fun so for those of you don't
know that 90 second video i did with the
tesla and that sort of an ad the contest
entry that we made that ended up winning
and i was really cool it got shown on
stage at the event all the employees got
to watch it live i saw the reaction
because i was there too it was just
really cool I think we're shooting that
video a lot was learned like obviously
you can make a gadget review of a phone
or something like that with one person
because it's just me and my camera but
with a car video it's physically
impossible to make that with one person
so it ended up being a four person team
of us you know one person's driving one
person's driving another car in front
one person hanging out the back with the
camera on a gimbal there was a lot going
on and that's the first time we actually
did those sort of moving car shots at
different angle it took us two days of
shooting and then the rest of it was
just editing and condensing it to 90
seconds which is yes why the weather
changed between different scenes in the
video and yes that's also why many of
you noticed the colors of the bags in
the front trunk also changed its cuz
they're not the same bags but I would
definitely say the amount we learned
both in the editing trying to cut
something down into really short and in
the shooting trying to shoot car videos
you know getting roads and getting all
the different angles and stuff will
definitely be helpful as a foray into
future car videos because there's more
car tech out there
and we'll be covering more of that the
other video is that one second and third
place were extremely well produced I
thought the second place one the
spaceships for earth one can literally
be a TV ad it was really well done I'll
link those below also if you want to
watch them because they're really good
also fun fact this is the first time
Elon Musk ever tweeted at me ever
mentioned my handle he had to go out of
his way to find it because it wasn't I
wasn't in the conversation so thanks did
you ever get offers from media companies
to work for them if yes named them okay
well yeah I'm I'm not going to name them
but yes I have if I remember
specifically one when I was in college
where I was invited to a certain media
companies HQ you've probably heard of
them they needed a TV tech correspondent
to be on TV all the time talking about
tech they needed someone kind of young
someone pretty knowledgeable someone who
is about to graduate and that kind of
fit that role and I was a hundred
percent not interested I mean it was an
honor that they considered me and that
they brought me in to talk about it but
the whole like scripted TV story after
story the hope the whole live thing is
is not really what I'm into obviously
I'm doing this on YouTube for reasons
because this format suits the way I want
to talk about things and the whole other
thing about like who's paying you versus
what you can and can't talk about that's
also weird too so bottom line I really
do like being independent and just using
this YouTube platform to talk about
whatever I want why does Samsung have
serious issues concealing their future
products than its competitors and why
does it have too many leaks too okay so
basically its 2017 everything leaks I
kind of said this before and the reason
behind that a lot of people don't really
realize why things leak or how they leak
but supply chains from these companies
like Samsung or like Apple or like any
of these companies who you see their
products before they get announced it's
because they're huge there are so many
different steps in the chain between the
time it gets designed and then it gets
manufactured and then it gets approved
and then it gets made all these
different steps with thousands of people
it's just one of them releases or leaked
something a little bit it can be really
hard to track and really hard to punish
and also really hard to stop there's all
these really interesting articles and
posts about how like people will try to
pay Foxconn factory workers who are
working on iPhones
massive amounts of money for that
information because they don't make that
much money it can be super tempting if
you work in that factory and someone
offers you a year's wage to show them
what the front panel of the iPhone looks
like and then you get fired but so what
you have a year's wages a battle -
companies are really big and they try to
make sure people don't get the
information about their phone and it's
all secretive and obviously you're not
allowed to talk about it but stuff seems
to slip through the cracks every now and
then and census 2017
it just gets amplified second what's on
video when okay so the first what's on
video for those of you are new was the
studio tour of Casey nice that was shot
that in the city that was a really fun
episode number one my intention for the
series is for it to be roughly three or
four times a year which means if it's a
really really big well thought-out
production it's once every three or four
months so that's kind of the rate we're
looking at so we're looking at the next
episode now and we're trying to make it
as awesome as possible but yeah that's
why you don't really see one every week
because that would be really hard let's
talk about the snake snake what I don't
I don't know it sure I don't really know
what you're talking about actually I
just get any snakes so these guys these
are little ball pythons I see bees
because there's another one back there
but our neighbors to the studio have a
couple of them and so you may see them
make random appearances and videos
sometimes also this guy is an Instagram
just follow on I'll link it below what
do you think about Apple making
self-driving cars
okay so I've actually seen and heard
this rumor a bit but what's interesting
is in the past couple weeks I've seen
these sorts of cars floating around the
New York City New Jersey area I've taken
pictures of them myself so I know
they're like out there I see em in New
York and I've seen them like on the
Jersey Turnpike and it says Apple Maps
on the side of the car like I get that
but it's very clearly not just Apple
Maps or way too many sensors on the back
and on the top and all those measurement
tools it just kind of seems to me like a
self-driving car project if I'm looking
at it from afar and it doesn't say maps
on it but they might just kind of be
disguising it as maps but the real
question here is is Apple actually going
to make a car I don't think they have to
make a car to make a self-driving car
project if you look at what Tesla is
doing a lot of that actually half of
that is the software behind making a car
drive itself that's half a car company
and half a software company between like
making all the camera
talk to each other and all the radar and
all the sonar making all those sensors
make the car self-aware enough to drive
itself and avoid obstacles Apple they're
also a software company so I feel like
they'll do a ton of research and a ton
of measurement and whatever also doing
with those cars undercover to try to
make their best possible self driving
car software safety is number one
convenience also very important but yet
Apple could make a self-driving car
project and never actually make a car as
a fellow Model S owner I'm curious about
the features you'd like to see in future
software / hardware update well contrary
to popular belief the software on the
Tesla is not perfect in fact one of the
most popular things or most common
things I want to see is Spotify in the
music player it's been like a long time
coming still isn't there you think the
pixel two without a three and a half
millimeter jack is the right way to go
after the pixel teased Apple during its
debut okay so that is going to be a
pretty funny thing in the next like year
or so when all those phones that came
out last year with a headphone jack that
teased Apple because oh we still have a
headphone jack and you don't when all
those come out in this next year and
don't have a headphone jack I mean it's
not like Apple is going to tease back
it's more of an i-told-you-so oh yeah
I'm definitely not looking forward to
that way it looks right now pixel -
probably won't have a headphone jack
that's the way it is have you noticed in
your videos that you move your eyes on
the camera monitors sometimes well yes
actually I have I'm actually impressed
that you have - a lot of times so the
camera monitors right above the camera
obviously sometimes I'm just like
checking framing or making sure I'm
still in the middle I try not to look
away I'm trying to look here or maybe
I'll hold something up and I want to
make sure it doesn't reflect too much so
I'm looking just to make sure it doesn't
like that that could happen but I don't
think it's too bad is it I try to look
at the camera mostly at we're good with
all time and this one chatter and I are
going to go edit this video
he actually edits like everything now
which is pretty awesome so I thought
together the next month okay
come on untie yourself you can do this
boy is he so upset
good morning perfect
you're definitely oh she's going hard
around the neck hey what are you doing
Mary Lazarus but that is definitely
tight
now she's tightening my neck give me
that I'm not a tree</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
