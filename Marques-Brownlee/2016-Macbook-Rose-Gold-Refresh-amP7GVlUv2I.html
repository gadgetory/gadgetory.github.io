this is the 2016 MacBook you can tell
because it's pink so this one should be
pretty quick there's not a whole lot of
difference between this guy and last
year's first-generation in fact I'd
hardly call this a second-generation
product at all it's essentially just a
speck bump inside it's like a version
1.2 of the 12-inch MacBook but almost
everything else you'll find about this
guy is the same as last year
so you have the same exact paper-thin
dimensions the 13 millimeter thin
superlight two-pound body the same low
travel butterfly key backlit keyboard
the same really large really nice force
touch trackpad the same incredible
sounding speaker with the full-width
grille still don't know how they made it
sound that good but it's still here and
the same 12 inch Retina display the only
difference on the outside is the new
color available the rose gold yeah 2016
you're the pink tech anyway what's
different is on the inside this year
it's basically just getting a speck
bumped to the new skylake Intel Core M
chips it's actually a pretty significant
upgrade in the performance Department if
you take a look at it you can now pick
between a 1.1 gigahertz core m3 or go
all the way up to a 1.3 gigahertz m7
that turbos all the way to 3.1 gigahertz
so much faster CPU and GPU performance
is nice plus faster storage as well the
internal SSD is now getting you around
400 plus megabytes per second writes and
800 plus megabytes per second reads
which is great so it's faster there and
for the record there's also a very
slightly larger battery inside it's
about a 5 percent more dense so not a
huge deal but better performance and
better battery life with the new chips
without getting thicker or heavier
that's a win win and that is exactly it
that's everything that's changed
honestly like I said it's a pretty quiet
refresh I would have loved to have seen
at least a tiny little change on the
outside because here my two biggest pet
peeves with this laptop are still here
of course there's just one port and
there's still that 480p webcam so you
would think that they could at least
throw in one more USB type-c port now
that it's later in the
year and it's becoming more mainstream
there's more accessories starting to use
USBC now I saw a pair of USBC headphones
the other day so I think the Chromebook
pixel a whole year ago actually had it
right with a USB C port on each side
just two ports but it makes a big deal
when you want to use an accessory while
charging or just plug in two things at
once
with the MacBook you'll still need to
carry adapters and that in a way kind of
defeats the purpose of having such a
thin and light and beautiful computer
and then yes the 480p webcam is also
still here I think you could have
upgraded this to Apple it's 2016 so if
the smartphone in my pocket can have
this huge 4k sensor with optical image
stabilization in this thin body you
could have fit a 720p sensor in the new
MacBook just saying anyway so this
little refresh it isn't going to change
your mind about the MacBook if you
weren't already going to get one it's
not that big of a change obviously it's
more like if you were on the fence about
getting the last one well this one is
better for sure so I'd recommend it
obviously over last year I think I would
still recommend the 13-inch MacBook Pro
to people still looking for a bit more
performance but for a thin and light it
doesn't get much better it doesn't get
much thinner or much lighter so the
baseline 12-inch MacBook is a neat
little machine and a lot of fun so
that's basically it thanks for watching
this one and I'll talk to you guys the
next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
