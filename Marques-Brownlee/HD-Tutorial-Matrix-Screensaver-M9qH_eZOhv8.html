here from mkbhd with a long awaited
tutorial and the first of 2010 with a
fresh start of the new year today I'm
going to be showing you guys how to get
a screensaver I showed off a bit in a
good portion of my late 2009 videos it's
called the Kelly's matrix screensaver
hopefully it looks familiar to you it's
one of the more popular screen savers in
the tech community you might have seen
me or Chris Parrillo or a number of
other youtubers rocking this one today
I'll be showing you not only how to get
it but I'll be giving you a full
walkthrough of the feature set of this
program so if you're interested stay
tuned we've got a lot to cover here we
go so to make finding this as quick and
easy as possible you can find the
screensaver by visiting any major search
engine maybe Google and typing in matrix
screensaver with an X it'll be the first
link this will take you to the Kelly
software website the hub of all things
centered around the screensaver and to
get and download the Installer scroll
about halfway down and pass all the
information on the page until you find
your OS versions installer the
installation process is surprisingly
really really simple it'll install
everything into your registry go ahead
and give you all the options for the
screen saver without you doing a thing
so this is what it's going to look like
once you finish downloading that
screensaver once you've run through the
installer all you have to do is get to
your screen savers menu somewhere in
whatever operating system you're using
and you should find the matrix
screensaver waiting for you there from
here I'm just going to show you guys all
the options and things that you can do
with this screen saver so across the top
you can obviously see all the awesome
things that you can do with this screen
saver you know you can change the color
you can have it up tree a little logo
with the matrix effect now I haven't
actually used all these features in the
background of my videos but I do plan on
doing that more often I guess to to you
know get attention but you know it does
look really cool adding in I guess a
logo if you have a red logo and the red
effect on the screensaver it does look
real
good so once you guys have finished
around with playing playing around with
the settings in the screen saver go
ahead and hit Save Changes and it will
save everything you've made changes to
in the screen saver program and once you
save that you can go back to the windows
manager hit apply and hit OK and you
should be all good with that so that is
basically it for the matrix screensaver
I hope you guys enjoyed this HD tutorial
and there will be a lot more where that
came from a lot of tutorials coming up
and I'll definitely be showing you guys
as much as I can in the tech world in HD
so thanks for watching and I'll talk to
you guys later peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
