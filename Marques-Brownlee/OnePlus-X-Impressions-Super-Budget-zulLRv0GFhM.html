getting good and good phones are getting
cheap think about it
case in point this is the brand new one
plus X it's going to cost two hundred
and forty nine dollars two forty nine
off contract brand-new in-the-box
everything three years ago two hundred
fifty bucks wouldn't get much of a
smartphone at all but even if you did it
would be inferior in pretty much every
way while the company who makes it
focuses on bigger and better things but
that has changed a lot over the last
year and a half or so and this phone
well this is the latest and greatest of
that trend oneplus is already pretty
much known for cost-cutting and for your
250 bucks you are getting a lot in this
little guy so you get a 5-inch 1080p
AMOLED display that's a pretty good you
know 441 pixels per inch nice and crisp
a quad-core Snapdragon 801 chip Adreno
330 GPU 3u bytes of RAM a 13 megapixel
camera with F 2.2 aperture on the back
and a surprisingly big 2525 milliamp
hour battery now it is a baseline 16
gigabyte model for the price but the SIM
card tray actually has two slots for
either dual SIM or you can go one nano
SIM and one micro SD card slot so
expandable storage up to 128 more
gigabytes so the specs are definitely
nice for the price but equally important
is industrial design and how it feels in
the hand and that's really where the
oneplus X actually stands out from the
rest in its budget there's no plastic
here the front and back are panels of
Gorilla Glass and it has all grooved
metal rail all the way around the
outside of the phone has some nice
weight to it it keeps the alert slider
on the left side from the oneplus 2 that
we love so much has some champers and it
curves the glass right at the edges and
overall it feels like a really tight
well-constructed
almost familiar nearly high-end looking
smartphone it did feel a little bit
slippery to me with so much glass
obviously on the front and the back and
it's definitely a fingerprint magnet but
I think it kind of reminds me of the
Sony Xperia Series mixed with a little
bit of Nexus for a little bit of iPhone
5s with that completely flat back but
all those phones were much more
expensive than this one when they came
out so the specs and the build
a build of oxygen OS that's optimized
for the hardware and you're looking at a
pretty sweet little package and oneplus
throws in some black wallpapers and a
dark theme in the OS with true blacks to
kind of help you save a little bit of
battery life here and there
toss in ambient display and throw in
some other features like SwiftKey built
in and screen off gestures and home
screen features from the oneplus 2 like
shelf and you're looking at an
absolutely stacked smartphone for a
minimal price now this is just the first
impressions but you can imagine you know
with a smaller 1080p OLED display and
the relatively huge battery it should
last a while on a charge even better I
guess when Android 6.0 comes to it with
those and the camera was promising to me
in person all of course have to test
that further but I'm already thinking
it'll be right up there with smartphones
way over its $250 price point so the
value the focus on value and getting a
premium experience at a low price
continues now it's been a serious trend
for 2015 cheap phones are getting good
and good phones are getting cheap thanks
for watching I'll talk to you guys in
the next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
