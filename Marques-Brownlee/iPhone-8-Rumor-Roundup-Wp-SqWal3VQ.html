and if there's one thing that's
consistent in tech throughout the years
its iPhone hype in fact I'd say that's
probably the number one question that I
get in real life most often I mean
there's obviously you know what do you
do with the extra tech and what phone
should I get and do you play basketball
but I'd say the number one thing people
really want to know is what do you know
about the next iPhone there's been
plenty of stuff floating around and I've
even prodded at it a little bit in past
videos but this is all everything in one
place this is everything we know or are
hoping for as far as the next iPhone is
concerned so we have the iPhone 7 and 7
plus in 2017 right now and we expect a
new iPhone announcement in the fall
probably be September again like usual
and this is actually the 10th
anniversary iPhone announcement so this
is the 10th year of a new iPhone so
we're kind of expecting something a
little bit special now whether it's
called iPhone 7s or iPhone 8 or iPhone
10 or 10th anniversary or iPhone X
there's plenty of rumors about what that
may be we're kind of expecting possibly
one premium iPhone and then two normal
new iPhones but whatever that may be
we're kind of slotting this all into the
bucket of new iPhone so first of all the
design and this is the thing that most
people get the most excited about
because it's the sort of most refreshing
new change with the phone and through a
couple months of leaked parts and design
speculation the rumors we have so far
are pretty consistent through all the
mock-ups it's a familiar back with the
vertically oriented camera housing and a
full-screen edge to edge display on the
front now on the back that's cool that's
fine
pretty much still standard I think we've
all realized at this point that the
actual phone when it comes out tends to
look a lot better than the mock-ups so
the early mock-up so the vertical camera
looked a little bit odd in the way it
was oriented but now it just seems like
that's probably the way it will go so
that's fine but the rumors about the
display on the front are of course much
more exciting and interesting first
thing is the display panel type we're
actually really expecting to see an OLED
display in the next iPhone finally it
would be the first one all the previous
iPhones have had LCD displays which are
fine but an OLED display has plenty of
benefits including pitch black deep
blacks higher contrast ratios we have
awesome displays from Samsung with
really high brightness any of course
have battery Ben
it's OLED displays are great and of
course also being edge to edge you have
the advantage of fitting a much bigger
display in the same exact body size so
you can see a display as big as 5 point
8 inches corner to corner in the same
body size as the iPhone 7 plus as far as
resolution goes I would love to see quad
HD but knowing Apple I kind of expect to
see 1080p again on the larger display
just as far as how thin they tend to
make the phone how small the battery
usually is and what their bias seems to
be so I'd expect 1080p again but then of
course that brings us to the home button
because you of course have to do
something different with the home button
if you want to have an edge to edge
display obviously you look at all these
rumors and mock-ups there's no home
button or fingerprint reader on them at
least visibly that's the question so
there's three options here and the
rumors and the past couple months have
been flip-flopping between these three
options even in the past couple days
because no one really knows yet and
Apple may even have recently been making
that decision but option one is home
button and fingerprint reader underneath
the display glass option two is home
button underneath the display glass turn
your front reader somewhere else on the
back side may be an option three is home
button underneath the display glass and
no fingerprint reader we'll talk about
all these and I would also say that
these are in the order of what I think
Apple would prefer to do but not
necessarily the likelihood of them
happen so option number one of the home
button and fingerprint reader underneath
the display glass would be awesome that
would be a seamless transition from the
familiar iPhone design you know ten
years of predictable iPhone designs to
something new and modern that doesn't
lose any functionality that would be
great but the technology to make this
happen
specifically the fingerprint reader
behind the display glass is something
that's brand new and just getting demoed
and showed at this point right now and
knowing Apple Apple tends to sort of lay
back a little bit and let brand new
technologies get tested and see how the
market responds and then implement
things hopefully better than they have
been and this isn't really something
they have time to do if they want to
implement this fingerprint reader right
now welcome is the latest one I've seen
they've done a demo of a fingerprint
reader underneath display glass it can
apparently read through the entire
display it can read through metal it can
work underwater and in all types of
different scenarios it's ideal and it's
all
some but it's a little bit slower than
touch ID which is blazing fast obviously
and it does have the highest success
rate and also it's not mass-produced in
millions of phones right now it's still
a demo so it would be awesome it's what
I want to see happen it's the ideal
scenario but I have my doubts about it
happening so option 2 is home button
underneath the display fingerprint
reader elsewhere you might have recalled
seeing this on a different phone this
year the Galaxy S II the samsung got to
put the full edge to edge display in the
Galaxy S 8 and it looks awesome and I've
raved about that in the review and they
also put the pressure sensitive home
button underneath the glass on the front
for all we know they may have wanted to
also do the fingerprint reader there but
didn't have that technology available to
them it was a couple months ago so they
put the fingerprint reader up here on
the back of the phone now Apple pulling
that move would obviously mean now you
need to put that fingerprint reader on
the back which means a different design
and a little bit of a different
schematic that we haven't seen yet
doesn't look quite as good in my opinion
but obviously that has to remain an
option if you don't get that technology
and the other way to do it is option
number three if you don't want an
awkward place back fingerprint reader or
if you just can't stand having it in the
middle where it is on the pixel then you
do know fingerprint reader at all you
still have the home button at the front
but then you have other biometric ways
of scanning a face recognition or iris
scanner or some other way to log into
the phone would kind of suck though
because touch ID is already a big part
of iOS so those are the three main
options for the fingerprint reader home
button combo again it's not really sure
what exactly is going to happen at this
point I kind of wish I knew you already
know what I want to happen the ideal is
the option number one but that will say
so those are the major big hitters but
there's a couple other little things to
consider that are really exciting to
number one to think about is wireless
charging no iPhone has ever had wireless
charging a couple other phones have
which are really nice and there's been
some code found in iOS 11 that's buried
some some new sounds
you're obviously familiar with the sound
of when you plug in an iPhone to charge
that's one sound there's now a new sound
file in iOS 11 and I'll link to the
video below so you can listen to them
over and over again that sounds way more
futuristic sounds like this
that that sounds that's not that's got a
wireless charging glad to me so
obviously wireless charging doesn't work
through metal so if you have wireless
charging on the next iPhone that also
confirms that it will not be a fully
metal backed phone it could be partially
metal or it could be no metal at all it
could be glass like the back of the
galaxy si but I think as far as Apple's
mission of reducing and removing ports
on the new iPhone if you're going to get
rid of that last port on the bottom
wireless charging has to be a thing
obviously the specs will be new it's
usually the most boring part but also
most powerful part of the new iPhone we
can probably expect Apple a 11 chip
three maybe even four gigs of RAM it'll
be the fastest iPhone ever obviously and
it turns out fast charging through USB
type-c is also very likely which doesn't
mean that the next iPhone will be USB
type-c it actually just means that the
brick that you plug into the wall
similar to the MacBook Pro charger will
have USB type-c and in the box you get a
USB C to lightning cable to plug it in
and then the new cameras could do a lot
more with depth some depth depth sensing
depth sensing abilities this time around
which would be helpful for number one
portrait mode could improve that a lot
significantly and also number two helped
out with a our kit and all the augmented
reality applications which have been
blowing mine so far and then colors
there was so much hype and actually
surprisingly a lot of people buying the
red iPhone not just because it was
product red and awesome but the fact
that it's a new color iPhone we've never
had a red iPhone and actually from one
of the shops in my video about this
phone someone made a mock-up of about
six seven more colors of the iPhone that
all looked awesome I think it'll be
awesome for a 10th anniversary edition
to pass the torch from the iPod to the
iPhone and offer a bunch of colors and
I'll be really sweet that I don't
actually expect that to happen at all
that's like the lowest thing on my list
but it would pretty sweet so that's
pretty much it for right now
a lot of the rumors are going to be
seeing over the next couple weeks and
months until that September announcement
and date are just going to be
flip-flopping back and forth on a lot of
the things we talked about especially if
Apple can put the fingerprint reader
under the glass or not but let me know
what you're most excited for that's
specifically what I want to see that new
design but feel free to share this video
with anyone who wants all the new iPhone
information
in one place before it comes out of
course you can expect a video on the
phone when it gets released right here
on the channel so subscribe for that but
that's pretty much it thanks for
watching talk to you guys in the next
one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
