over the past couple of days I've been
asked a lot about the Nvidia shield
tablet now if you've seen any of the ads
or if you know anything about this it's
basically a gaming tablet a lot of
people are buying this specifically for
the gaming features and it's really good
at that but if you know me I'm really
not much of a gamer at all I don't play
that many games on my phone or tablet
but I didn't want to ignore this just
because I don't game so I decided to
check it out I picked it up anyway and
I've been using it a lot and turns out
when you take away a lot of the gaming
features and a lot of the stuff that
it's really good at for gaming it just
becomes an 8 inch pure Android sort of a
Nexus 8 kind of tablet so this is a
short video just going over the stuff
that you'll get on this tablet
if you don't game kind of proving that
it's a good tablet even without those
awesome features let's take a look so
first of all this shield tablet is made
by Nvidia and besides all the awesome
accessories it works with and all the
other cool gaming tricks it has it has
some pretty beastly specs so it's
packing Nvidia's latest and greatest k1
chip inside so a 2.2 gigahertz quad-core
processor 192 core GPU 2 gigabytes of
RAM 16 gigs of storage and all the rest
of the hardware is geared towards
showcasing that new k1 chip in fact
that's really what this whole tablet is
all about so nothing too flashy going on
with the design it's pretty compact it's
got a pretty solid weight to it a bit
heavier than the Nexus 7 and just small
enough that I can hold it with one hand
although I guess most people will
two-handed since it is bigger than the
Nexus 7 but I gotta say the build
quality is pretty decent again it's not
the best build in the world but you can
see it's it's solid it's got a pretty
standard array of ports headphone jack
USB and HDMI on one side with a speaker
port and the other speaker port on the
other side and speaking of speakers yes
this is one of a few tablets just a few
with front-facing speakers I probably
said this when talking about just about
every device with this but it really
should be standard especially in tablets
where you have all this space to work
with I mean this isn't even a premium
price tablet it's pretty mid-range and
these speaker drivers really aren't even
that good but there's still miles better
sounding than
anything else with back facing speakers
and you got to love that for media and
of course you can see inside that left
speaker grill is the front-facing camera
it has a 5 megapixel front facing camera
and a 5 megapixel rear facing camera
both of which are actually pretty good
quality but I don't think you should be
using them much anyway so really my only
complaint well with the shield hardware
is just the buttons the power and volume
buttons they're pretty awful they're
really stiff and have almost zero travel
so they're a pain to use and I've been
using this tablet for weeks and I still
can't even change the volume without
picking up the tablet and looking at it
so the buttons are my only gripe so
anyway this tablet is clearly meant for
gaming and I almost feel bad not talking
about all these gaming features because
they're totally badass there's a
wireless controller there's dedicated
software hub and everything but like I
said I'm not a gamer and I wouldn't know
best about that so I'm actually going to
leave a link or two repla the like
button to videos that do a good job of
showcasing these gaming features but for
me this is an Android 4.4 tablet running
almost pure stock Android with a few
Nvidia improvements and I really like
that I put the Google experience
launcher on here and not only does it
feel really familiar and comfortable but
because it's stock Android with no skin
and that beastly NVIDIA k1 everything is
fast fluid and smooth and the k1 really
shows off your even when you're just
doing regular multitasking or web
browsing it's not a super high
resolution display so you're not pushing
a ton of pixels it's a 1080p eight inch
display so it's pretty sharp but again
the panel is just mid-range it's a
little on the warm side it's just it's
really about showing off the Nvidia k1
and it's just killing it and just to
make sure it wasn't just me giving stock
Android too much credit I fired up an
application that honestly on any other
Android tablet lags and stutters and
drop streams like crazy and that's
Google Earth a very old app but you've
probably experienced yourself I opened
it up here on the shield tablet and the
k1 handled it like a boss almost zero
dropped frames beautiful fluid movement
might actually finally be the first
Android tablet that I can showcase this
app on and it doesn't lag and stutter
and crash so I guess it's kind of crazy
that Google or
has remained a benchmark for so long so
yeah with this awesome graphical
performance since Nvidia is doing such a
good job with that of course using a
tablet with general everyday use is very
smooth you get fast performance it's
kind of kind of what you look for when
you're buying a tablet and this
basically nails it now there are a few
additions and Vidya has thrown in again
mostly for gaming but some of the stuff
is pretty cool one of them and I guess
this is the most major is the stylus yes
they added a stylus to the back of this
tablet something you won't find on a
nexus but it is a pretty advanced stylus
so when you remove it you get a couple
of stylus ready apps you can choose to
launch and the really impressive one
here is an Nvidia dabbler it's made just
for the shield I guess Nvidia just made
this for this new device and it uses and
recognizes the shape of the stylus it's
like a felt-tip pen and it kind of rocks
it's awesome it has this really detailed
precise watercolor effect if you choose
to use that brush a whole bunch of
different brush effects I mean I felt
like I can mess with this thing all day
until I legitimately create works of art
like this alright I'm kidding that one
came pre-loaded but this stylus
recognition is definitely advanced as
anything you'll find on any you know
iPad or any other tablet okay another
thing NVIDIA has added to the stock
Android experience was some performance
modes and I really couldn't even tell
the difference I didn't look behind the
scenes at what it was doing to the CPU
but again the main purpose to show off
to the NVIDIA k1 so they added those
modes to be able to change how that
throttles they also added HDMI settings
since there's a mini HDMI port and of
course settings for any controller you
might have added but again probably an
videos dedicated shield wireless
controller for gaming because all these
features are for gaming and all the
stuff is built right into Android
settings so very conveniently tucked
away where you know you can find them
when you want to look for them there's
also in the quick settings a toggle for
full screen mode which is basically
Android 4.4 is immersion mode but
full-time for the entire operating
system like on demand so I guess if you
just hate seeing the notifications or
you just need a force the full screen
game to happen you can do that so yeah
really this tablet is full-featured it's
packed it's legit I've enjoyed using it
over the Nexus 7
mostly for the front-facing speakers
because again I love hearing a sound to
move across your face as the image moves
across the screen that kind of stuff you
just can't get with rear-facing speakers
and it makes media so much better and
tablets are really all about media if
you're gaming or watching a video or
whatever you're doing and you know if
you're going to look for the software
updates over in Nexus I have faith
because the Nvidia shield the og shield
actually got quite a few updates on the
software department so that's a good
sign for this new tablet I think they'll
also get a few software updates maybe
see Android L soon you know what those
rumors of an 8-inch volantis Nexus
tablet with front-facing speakers we've
all been dreaming about you know even if
that doesn't happen this will always be
an option and it's a pretty good one
props Nvidia keep it up thanks for
watching guys and I'll talk to you in
the next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
