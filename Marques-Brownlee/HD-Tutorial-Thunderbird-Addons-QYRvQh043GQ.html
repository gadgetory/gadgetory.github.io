a tutorial on how to add add-ons into
Mozilla Thunderbird the email client so
first thing you want to do is open up a
web browser
I recommend Firefox for this particular
operation
I found an add-on for Thunderbird that I
like so what I'm going to do it has
these instructions here right click it
and hit save I guess so
Save Link As and pick anywhere
I guess this downloads and I'll just say
no G there it is it's done decoding scan
for viruses it's done so once that is
done you can can exit your web browser
and go ahead and open your email client
Thunderbird first thing you're going to
do is go to tools and add-ons it's not
going to be there instantly
and you're gonna hit the install button
from here you can search Marcus and
downloads where'd it go and find exactly
what you just downloaded this one and
hit open and you can install straight in
there I actually don't like installing
saw like cancelled but it'll install it
right into Thunderbird it'll integrate
the whole thing and soon enough you will
have you'll just restart Thunderbird
once at the most twice and Thunderbird
will be back up and working and it will
have all you add-ons I even have this
calendar add-on here right my pencil
I've already used it quite a bit
tasks up in here so I got a lot going on
I've got I'll show you what add-ons I do
have lightning which is the integrated
calendar tasks that I showed you the
minimize tray which is works when I just
minimize thunderbird if not down here is
here and i double click it to bring it
back up
I have talkback with sense information
about well that came with it so it's not
important browse which adds the
web browsing feature to Thunderbird and
I'll show you that real quick here it is
Google Thunderbird
it's relatively fast so those are how
you basically that's how you add add-ons
to Thunderbird and nothing but thanks
