new month new Q&amp;amp;A asked you guys on
twitter again like i usually do which
wanted to know maybe i'll do it in a new
place next time but twitter seems to be
working pretty well so these were your
questions one of the most popular ones
will you ever start vlogging I doubt it
I don't think that's I think it'd be
pretty boring because most of my
vlogging would just be behind the scenes
of making the videos that you guys
already see we may be one or two
behind-the-scenes videos is kind of fun
and neat and gives you a idea of the
behind the scenes process but vlogging
wouldn't be all that exciting thoughts
on the new Mac Pro okay so technically
there is a new updated refreshed version
of the current trashcan Mac Pro which if
Apple just released that by itself and
didn't say a word about the new upcoming
Mac Pro we think they were insane I'm
assuming you're talking about the new
upcoming 2018 modular Mac Pro which
there's a lot of hype about now which I
am very excited for it's really it's
weird that you see that from Apple they
usually never admit that they have ever
done anything wrong but they look at the
old Mac Pro and they say we didn't get
to update that enough and we really
wanted to we did that wrong the next one
will be better so that's exciting for me
plus seeing all the drivers for the new
Nvidia cards coming out available for
Mac OS 10 the hype is very real all your
studio tour is going to be limited to
certain youtubers or does anyone with
the doke setup have a shot at being
featured so that's a great question
Frank and I can expand so the what song
series is brand new and in general the
first episode was a studio tour with
Casey nice that but the general idea is
it would be a tour of the tech that
creative people and creative things used
to make what they do happen so it's not
just studio tours it's not necessarily
just the studio sometimes it'll just be
like a person who does creative stuff
and their workspace or what they have on
their computer or their phone so to
answer the question no it won't just be
youtubers studio tours in fact the next
episode that we're planning is not a
youtuber at all but there will be
youtubers involved of course
collaborations are always fun with other
creators but obviously there's tons of
creative people that are outside the
world of YouTube that will be fun to
showcase their tech here - pixel - wish
list
so this first Google pixel of the past
year was one of the phones that I've
used for the longest time because it's a
really complete experience that nails
pretty much all the pillars
great smartphone but my biggest problem
with it is actually it's not that big of
a problem but it's the design it's just
not that pretty and now there's all
these films coming out like Galaxy s8
and g6 and all plenty of others that
just have these gorgeous designs and
awesome displays as well so in theory
for pixel two I'd like to see it nail
all the same great pillars of a
smartphone with performance and stock
Android and great camera but make it a
lot prettier are you excited for the
Samsung Note 8 and do you think the
brand can recover from the note 7
problem it's something I've thought
about a lot like people have been saying
and there's two sides of this equation
where people have been saying maybe
they're just going to cancel the whole
note thing maybe they're done with it
but then the other half is saying people
will just forget like there will come
out with a note 8 and the whole fiery
explosion thing with note 7 will be
forgotten I tend to lean closer to that
side I definitely think Note 8 is going
to happen and I think as they get better
and better and come out with more phones
you'll continue to forget the things
that Samsung did that you didn't like in
the past including they're exploding
phones well yeah I don't think it'll be
that big of a problem for Samsung it's
funny because most of the lot of people
I know actually who had a note 7 were
not really that concerned because
they're like oh my phone didn't blow up
it's fine I know the people who did have
a note 7 who did have their phone blow
up those people probably won't buy a
note 8 but everyone else I think will be
pretty much ok with it iPhone 8 wish
list
how good can a phone camera get like
what is the ultimate stage where OMS are
just like yeah this is the best we got
I let the first supply ask Samsung
because they didn't upgrade to camera in
the FAA I don't think there's ever going
to be like a maximum level where we
reach where we say alright we don't have
to make the cameras better anymore
that's kind of the beauty of technology
is it's just going to keep getting
better and better you might have thought
like if you saw today's best smartphones
and look back in 2011 and showed them
the phone they'd be like all right yes
probably as good as we need to get but
tech keeps getting better and better and
more and more efficient I think the
interesting fun answer to that question
is if you look at what we had in the
Nokia Lumia what was that thing Nokia Oh
Google at 10 20 if you look at the Lumia
1020 that was a phone that went all-in
on the camera it kind of did pretty well
in other areas of the phone it was a
window song whoever not a lot of people
bought it but it had a 41 megapixel
camera xenon flash this was the phone
you buy if you want to take lots of
pictures so every once in a while it'll
be cool to see a phone like that go all
in on a spec there's other phones that
go all in on certain other specs and
they kind of make you wonder are we
pushing that limit too but there will
never ever be a point where we say yeah
we're done innovating here have you ever
critiqued yourself or watched your older
videos to improve your style as a
youtuber okay so you're probably
thinking of like me watching like three
four year old videos and then thinking
oh I can't believe I did that that's so
bad I'll get better at that no I I
watched videos that are like two or
three weeks old and feel the same way
you got to look at every video you make
as an opportunity to make something
better and as a youtuber I think my best
tip is to be your own biggest critic how
far do you see the Clippers going this
year I think they'll lose in seven to
Utah you think we're losing the first
round I'll bet you right now through
YouTube we're not losing the first round
I see the Clippers going at least into
the second round and our ceiling would
be Western Conference Finals again I
feel like I said that last year well
brands continue to give review units if
you make videos similar to the HTC u
ultra video those who didn't see it you
should watch it the HTC u ultra review
was not a very nice one not a very
positive one but that's the whole point
of a review if there's something that
you shouldn't get then you should know
about how bad it is so a negative review
like that actually is a
and for everyone around it's a win for
you guys because you now know what not
to buy it might not seem like a win for
HTC on the surface because people don't
buy that phone but when their next phone
can use improvements that they learn
from the reviews and when their next
phone is way better that also looks good
for them and on top of all that you now
know for sure that I'm not unlike some
shill side with HTC I'll clearly say
when something's wrong with the phone so
when a phone does come out and I
appraise it you know it's good
I'm not saying make a bad phone so that
you can do better than next year that's
not a good strategy at all just make the
best thing you can but bottom line is I
think reviews are really helpful in that
way and that's kind of the whole point
you could spend some marketing dollars
on putting an ad on TV with some
superhero who's done ads for other
companies and it might get seen by a lot
of people but that guy does ads for
everything is it really that effective
or you could put the phone in the hands
of a person who has an honest reputation
and let them decide for themselves if
it's good or not and if it turns out to
be a good phone then that's the easiest
free good PR you can get the best
positive PR you can get is just making a
good product how about that either way
that's it for now
thank you for your questions I hope you
enjoyed the answers and feel free to let
me know in the comments below what else
you guys are thinking about we'll chat
about it I'll be down there lurking talk
to you guys the next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
