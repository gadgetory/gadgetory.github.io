here from mkbhd and welcome to another
HD tutorial and in this one I'll be
showing you guys how to create a
professional email address that you can
use for emailing companies and for me to
increase etc so let's get started
so a lot of people might be wondering
why exactly would you do to toriel on
creating an email address it's well
known that you can created comcast email
or a gmail email but I think a lot of
companies find it appealing when someone
emails them requesting a product to
review from an email that's just really
simple and clean and professional so
here's a website that I found I'm
obviously not the first to discover this
but it's mkbhd at mail com that is the
email address that I've used the site is
mail comm very simply so all I got to do
is sign up for a free email account and
you can create one of a number of email
accounts first you have to put in a
little bit of information about yourself
so your first name your last name choose
your username and there are actually a
lot of usernames available so I was
obviously able to get mkbhd very simple
very clean and obviously very appealing
for a company just to not see something
you know large and jumbled that
comcast.net or something and then you
get to go ahead and choose your domain
so you can choose something like at mail
calm at email calm at usa.com @dr calm
and a bunch of others there are a lot to
choose from and when I say a lot I mean
a lot you can choose from hobbies for
your location so you might be in the UK
and you can choose that or you can
choose rom-com usa.com swiss mail as we
scroll down here you can also choose fun
miscellaneous at Karis comm activist
calm things like this and as we keep
scrolling down there are as you can tell
a ton of names once you've selected
exactly what you want I just chose at
mail com you can check to see whether
your user name is available so users
stuff I don't know I'll hit check and
you'll see that it is available and you
can in fact use it and a lot of these
usernames are available so go ahead and
snag whatever email address you'd like
confirm all this information and agree
to the Terms of Service and you are in
and you have that email address to use
now the thing is this actually is it's
really difficult to use an email clients
such as Mozilla Thunderbird to use your
just to recount for mail.com for this
reason they actually provide an
application or a desktop application
that allows you to check for any new
messages constantly for your mail comm
email address you can right click go to
account go to preferences log in and log
out of your email account for mail comm
so it's really simple desktop
application sits in your system tray and
it works just perfectly and starts that
startup with Windows so thanks for
watching this H tutorial I hope you
enjoy your professional email address I
will leave mine in the description for
business and media inquiries as well as
different questions and various
questions you guys can't exactly phrase
any YouTube message anyway thank you for
watching this HD tutorial and I hope it
was helpful and I'll talk to you guys in
the next video peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
