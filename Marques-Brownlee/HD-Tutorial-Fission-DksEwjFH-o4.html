Brownlee here from mkbhd and welcome to
another tutorial and before I get into
this tutorial I just have a small
announcement one thing is that the link
is in the description for this
background and number two I was denied
for a youtube partnership for a lack of
insufficient amount of original content
which was you know kind of so-so with me
i'm going to try to get back to them on
that but anyway this is going to be
tutorial on the the firefox addon that i
found one of my favorite Firefox add-ons
actually called phishing and it
basically makes your firefox loading bar
if i can open up a new tab here makes
this part up here load and look like
safari three point 0 or 3.2 so let's go
ahead and open up youtube and you'll be
able to see it go ahead and move across
the screen there you go it was actually
very quick but i'm just going to go
ahead and show you this add-on i have
the link right here to the actual add to
Firefox add-on the actual link to this
page right here in the description so if
you go ahead and click on that in
Firefox and hit add to Firefox there's
not a whole lot of steps after that to
get the add-on so basically it's a it's
a progress bar that you can use for
Firefox and once you add it like I said
it'll look like almost exactly like
Safari three-point Oh now if we go to
tools and go to add-ons here and go to
the extensions filter and fish in one
point 0 point 9 which is the latest
version we can actually customize a few
things about efficient and this is
actually my favorite part about it so
you can see the description progress bar
and address bar go ahead and hit the
options button and you go ahead and
choose the progress bars appearance here
so you can use this color palette right
here to select from a a medium variety
of colors which is quite nice the one
thing that I found really nice was that
if I if I go ahead and show you this
link right here I will have this tinypic
PNG link in the description this is
almost exactly like the Safari 3.2
point2 loading bar with a few exceptions
so
if you want to go ahead and use that as
your loading bar for Firefox as you can
see i have a safari theme going on here
go ahead and hit that browse button and
actually not before you go that you're
going to have to go to this this tiny
pic link in the description and open
this up in Firefox and once you've done
so right click on it and save image as
and we're going to go ahead and name
that Safari loading bar and hit save so
that has been saved to our desktop and
it'll just go ahead and scan that PNG
for anything malicious and once we've
saved that to our desktop we can go
ahead and use that as our loading bar as
long as it's on our computer somewhere
so go ahead back into that add-ons
window and hit the Browse button and
find where you just save that I happen
to save it on my desktop and I named it
so it'll be easy to find there it is
right there double-click the PNG image
and there you go it's right there you
can you get a little preview of it right
there in the preview you hit enter and
you go ahead and exit out and that is
what it will look like from now on when
you load a page so let's go ahead and
open up one of my websites the website
i'm writing for and you saw that right
at the top it looked exactly like the
safari three point two point two loading
bar so this is definitely one of my
favorite add-ons for firefox right now
i'm using firefox version 3.5 very nice
very smooth and i really do recommend
this add-on for you guys who are looking
for a nice slick stylee very stylish but
a very cool add on that on that I really
I really do recommend so anyway thanks
for watching this tutorial on fish in
the Firefox add-on every link that you
will need is in the description and
please rate this video as high as you
feel like it try to help me get another
run at becoming a YouTube partner and
that is basically it thank you for
watching peace out</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
