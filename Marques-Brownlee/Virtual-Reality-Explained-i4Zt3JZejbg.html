and this is a virtual reality headset
it's a pretty simple one obviously but
that's what it is and the idea of
virtual reality is just that it's to
replace your reality with something some
new virtual computer-generated
environment and it could be some game or
some environment you walk around or some
video that's playing all around you when
you look around but the idea is to trick
your brain into thinking that that's
your new reality so VR started with the
airforce actually as part of their
flight training program and it's flight
sim now obviously that's much easier and
cheaper to have new pilots practicing
stuff like fighting maneuvers and
shooting things and ejecting and
crashing all without shooting and
ejecting and crashing actual million
dollar planes so that's where VR makes
perfect sense now in 2015 companies are
making these personal VR experiences
that you can just buy and use for your
own entertainment all you have to do is
just put it on your face so they do this
by taking over your site so just like we
use headphones to completely take over
our sense of sound this headset totally
takes over your vision inside this one
Google cardboard is a pair of lenses and
a place to hold your smartphone which
becomes your screen and your VR engine
now there are actually two kinds of VR
headsets type one is the accessory that
you plug your smartphone into that
becomes the screen so something like
Google cardboard or Samsung's gear VR
and then type 2 is the standalone unit
that does everything it has a gyroscope
and the screen and everything built-in
so that would be something like oculus
rift or HTC vive both types of course
have these lenses that help your eyes
focus on the stereoscopic image that's
right up against your face which isn't
great for your eyes by the way but
whatever and they all have this
gyroscope and accelerometer that help
track your head movement and that's what
helps put you in your own little world
so I got to take a closer look at one of
the second type at Mobile World Congress
this year the new HTC vive and this is
something people were getting really
pumped about it's a prototype for now
and the final version might not look
exactly like this but it's an entirely
self-contained VR headset that you can
just pick up and put on your face and be
immersed of course it's a little more
complicated than that but you have all
these little dots around it for sensors
so you actually need to set up little
sensors around you to track your head in
3d space oculus rift also has some
similar looking sensors for the same
reason it's tracking your head so on one
hand that's going to be awesome for
immersion the more accurate these
sensors can be the more closely it'll
mirror your head movement so since
you're in 3d space you can literally
move your head forward and peek around a
corner which is pretty awesome but on
the downside but does require having a
little bit more space to actually set up
your VR experience which sounds kind of
like a pain and also the thing people
forget is you also need a set of cables
to connect this VR headset to your
computer so plenty of people did demos
without plugging it in but you're not
exactly untethered when you're really
using it now that first type of VR
headset that uses your phone as the VR
engine and the screen is actually a
little bit more simple your phone
already has a gyroscope and an
accelerometer built in so all of your
movements around that 3d world will come
from that but these don't have the
advantage of sculpting the optimal VR
experience I mean it's kind of like an
accessory and it's a little bit weird to
like clip your smartphone into some
crazy basically oversized case and then
strap it on your head but the experience
can often be almost as good as one of
the dedicated headsets at least to a VR
noob like me but look making a VR
headset right now at least a good one is
really hard and there are so many things
you have to consider the the pixels per
inch of the display since it's right up
against your face and it's magnified and
then there's the field of view since you
want it to be as immersive as possible
and the pixels per degree since
everything's magnified and so close to
your face there is good hope though I've
never seen an industry go so fast from
zero like almost nothing to five or six
major players so fast you've got oculus
rift you have Samsung gear VR you have
Google cardboard now for a year HTC vive
is on its way it's coming sony project
Morpheus is also coming I would actually
even say that microsoft hololens
although that headset for Microsoft that
everyone's talking about the experience
of is not
to reality that's actually augment
a'dreea so virtual reality and augmented
reality are two slightly different
things so to clarify virtual reality is
replacing your entire reality so you're
immersed in this new world with nothing
left from the real world
augmented reality is just that it's
augmenting your reality a little bit
it's adding some things and combining it
with the real world and oftentimes
that'll be in the form of an overlay or
seeing something on top of a real world
object Google glass also does the same
thing so you can have useful information
sort of in the corner of your vision not
totally virtual reality but some neat
augmented reality tricks but what really
separates the VR and what makes it so
impressive is the immersion factor the
fact that you're totally in this world
so just like with headphones on when you
can't really hear anything else other
than the music you're listening to with
a VR headset you're essentially
blindfolded and put into this entire new
world with whatever the artist makes
virtual reality content will take off
when there is a lot of virtual reality
stuff to look at like 3d TV would have
only made it if people everywhere
started making 3d videos now obviously
that didn't happen and there's a risk
that virtual reality might not ever
happen to because of that but I think
there's at least something special here
that 3d TV might not have had I think
the first time someone sees a 3d TV that
works really well the reaction might be
oh wow but the first time someone sees
like oculus rift or gets a really good
virtual reality demo they're like wow
this is impressive
that's what makes it so cool so uh yeah
and the next time you're considering
whether or not virtual reality will
become a thing or not
think about what would you do with it so
thanks for watching I'll talk to you
guys the next one peace
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
