from mkbhd and welcome to another
unboxing video and in this one we'll be
taking a look at the DSS international
power saving power strip so let's get
right on into this guy's
alright guys so the Deus international
power strip is actually a product that's
gonna help you save a lot of money first
of all for your power costs this is a
power strip obviously you know is
something that has numerous outlets and
one plug and this is something that's
gonna help you save about $100 per
workstation per year so that's about
sixteen percent on electricity in this
box so I'm just gonna show you guys my
unboxing and first impressions of what
is what comes in the box the Deus
international product and they were kind
enough to send this out to me so pardon
for being in the way of the camera here
but it is a pretty big box so let's just
get right into this there we go it's a
bit of paper on top so just remove the
paper and here is a much smaller radius
international energy saver power strip
box so as you can tell by the box of
course there are going to be one two
three four for secondary outlets in one
primary outlet now I'll get to that
obviously in the review as this is a
really easy to use product that's gonna
definitely be worth your money and save
you guys a lot of money in the long run
so here's the back of the box and just
give you guys a brief demonstration of a
little system workstation there and I'll
let's go ahead and open it from this end
and see what we get inside the box pull
this out here this is obviously the
white model and inside the box you get
actually a little manual here this is
the instruction manual gives you all the
information about you know the important
things and the features of the product
of course I'm going to cover these
things in the review of the power strip
and actually give you guys a rundown of
how it's worked for me and whether or
not it's actually saved me electricity
so we'll see about that
well yeah here it is it is white and it
is the American version of the outlet as
you can see over here it says
intelligent socket primary and for
secondary so this has the American
socket version right here this is white
and that's pretty much it for the
unboxing and first impressions guys so
just a very quick video shaking
as what comes in the box and the box
itself and I'm going to show you guys
all the features you need to know about
this power ship and I'll include a link
in the description to the right with all
the information just in case you just
can't wait to watch the review video so
thank you for watching this unboxing
video of the DS International green
energy saving power strip and I will
talk to you guys in the next video peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
