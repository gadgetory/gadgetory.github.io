other people's computers Firefox the
internet browser right here takes a
little longer than you'd like to load
simple solution for that is called
Firefox preloader and you can uninstall
it unload it reload it basically what it
does is loads a bunch of components of
our Fox beforehand and now when you
click on Firefox it's it's extremely
fast with that exiting out of it it's
not in that it's not in my tray but if I
click on it here Firefox is very fast
it's very very quick so I really really
really recommend it if you have enough
RAM right now I have three gigs of RAM
on this laptop and I'm using one point
eight gigs so I'm using a lot because of
this codec I'm using we're gonna see
camstudio lossless codec I get a decent
FPS but look at that processor so if you
have enough RAM then I would really
suggest Firefox preloader it opens
quickly it opens almost as fast as
Safari Safari is a little little quicker
but I would recommend using this Firefox
preloader so good luck oh I should show
you where to get it so uh open up your
internet browser whatever that may be
and type in oh just go to Google I've
been Firefox freeloader I hope you can
see this the first one that comes up is
sourceforge.net it says it is a Firefox
preliterate utility that's designed to
load parts of Firefox into the memory to
improve startup time so I'm clicking on
it sourceforge.net course right at the
top is your big green download arrow
click it installation is really simple
and if you have Windows Vista apart menu
just type in Firefox and preloader is
one of your
programs of course if I click on it
it'll say it's already running so that's
what it is that's how you get it yeah so
I hope you like</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
