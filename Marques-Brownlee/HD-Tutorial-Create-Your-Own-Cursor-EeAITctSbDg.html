Brownlee's from mkbhd here and welcome
to another HD tutorial now you may or
may not have noticed but in my actually
I don't think it wasn't my last tutorial
but I changed my mouse to look like just
a little diamond do you see there in the
light of my background so I'm going to
show you now is how you can actually
change your back or change your cursor
to be whatever you can draw so what
we're gonna do is just open up our
internet browser here and you can go to
any popular search engine and we're
gonna type in icon art and the first
result be Conway org and icon R if we
just scroll down real quick we can
download and install the free version of
icon art and there is a ten dollar paid
version but um you know it's not not
really a not really that much of a
difference over the free version so
anyway we're gonna do here now that we
have it's not really a it's not really
worth doing a video on the installation
but uh once we do the installation
process we will come up with icon art up
here so here's icon art and we'll just
close this so basically here an icon art
we can make like whatever we want we can
draw what cursor we want to make and
I'll show you how to create a cursor and
set it as your cursor so you can see
right now mine's a dot if we just want
to make ours a circle and with a plus
sign in it and this will be our that
will be it it'll be a basketball with a
little pointer thing I don't know
whatever you want to make it so once
you've made your cursor and you want to
actually set that as your cursor we're
going to go to well first of all we have
to save it as a hot spot so I'm like in
a regular arrow cursor the tip of the
arrow is what you use to click so to set
that hot spot we're just going to go to
this little this little set hot spot
button right here tap it and just drag
the hot spot to where you want to be so
if you want the middle of the ball to be
the hot spot or the tip of the the tip
of the pointer to be the hot spot use
that then hit accept and then we're
going to go to file and save frame as
cursor just click that and we're just
going to name it and I'm going to send
it to my desktop real quick and we're
gonna say
basketball cursor so we've named it and
we stated to the desktop there goes and
now that we've done that we can exit out
and we're going to go ahead and set it
as our actual cursor so let's go to
start and control panel and this will
work for obviously Vista and XP so yeah
we go to our control panel and we go
over to the mouse button double click
Mouse and you're a mouse window will pop
up another way you can access this menu
is just open up your Start menu and type
in Mouse in the search box and the first
thing is Microsoft Mouse so then we're
going to click pointers and for your
normal select pointer or whatever
pointer you want this to be just hit the
Browse button and choose your file the
desktop find the cursor basketball
cursor hit apply and hit OK and look at
that my cursor is now basketball it's
pretty cool it so yeah it works 100% no
spyware and no adware nothing it's just
perfect perfectly fine so yeah I will
use this
I changed my cursor I always wanted a
dot cursor and I was looking up ways to
actually use a dot cursor or create one
and that what that works for me so I
