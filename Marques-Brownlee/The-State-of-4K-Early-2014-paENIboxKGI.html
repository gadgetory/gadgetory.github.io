back at CES 2014 this January not only
did I catch a Tesla Model S at the
Panasonic booth but I also found this so
this is a 4k Toughpad tablet from
Panasonic and I you know it's absolutely
ridiculous for a normal person I mean
this is a 20 plus inch tablet it's heavy
it's got a ton of graphics power behind
it it's very expensive but of course the
display was absolutely ridiculously
good-looking it had an amazing pixel
density and a ton of sharpness and
detail as you would expect from
something that's 4k and so that got me
thinking where is all the 4k so this is
the state of 4k as of February 2014 so
below this video if YouTube process 2
right you will see the 240p option the
480p option the 720p option the 1080p
option the 1440p option and if all went
well
a 2160p option and that is for the 3840
by 2160 version of this video will call
4k so we're off the bat 4k video is four
times the resolution of 1080p video or
if you look at it on the same sized
screen it's four times as pixel dense or
four times as detailed that is amazing
that's going to look great on pretty
much any size so the question is why
isn't everything already 4k and the
short answer is it's difficult it's
difficult to shoot 4k it's difficult to
process 4k output for K and display and
playback for K so when we say it's
difficult to shoot 4k video that
literally means that the cameras that
we're using that will all shoot 1080p
just fine don't quite have the
processing power or the sensors capable
of shooting 4k video such a high
resolution video a perfect example of
that is the GoPro Hero 3 plus Black
Edition that will shoot 4k video but
only at 15 frames per second it can't
quite muster the processing power to go
beyond that and then something like the
Samsung Galaxy Note 3 it is a pretty
powerful phone but it'll only shoot at a
relatively low bitrate long story short
if you're going
get high quality high frame rate high
bitrate high resolution video you're
going to need a very expensive very
powerful camera and those are coming
down in price now but I did a video on
all the 4k camera options I saw at CES
last month so I'll leave that link right
below the like button but if you get
anything out of watching that video it's
that it can be quite expensive to shoot
a high quality 4k video all right so
this is a 4k TV legitimately it's a 3840
by 2160 panel I'll have the link and the
model number right below that like
button and so this is is fully able to
display 4k content at any time but it
has never actually displayed 4k anything
ever
so what's plucked up to this is you can
probably tell by the NBA right now is
the PlayStation 4 and Xbox one and an
Apple TV and none of which will actually
output 4k through HDMI and there's also
a chromecast plugged into this TV
that won't do 4k either so as far as
we're concerned this is all still 1080p
stuff and as much as I'd love to you
know play NBA or Forte's a-- in 4k with
the insane detail of that high
resolution or watch Netflix in 4k or
chromecast TV shows in 4k nothing will
do that right now and that's actually
the case for a lot of people so really
no reason to go buy a 4k TV because as
far as we're concerned this is still
acting exactly like a 1080p TV alright
so this is a 4k desktop display it's one
of the few monitors you can put on your
desk that will have that 3840 by 2160
resolution this is the Asus PQ 3 2 1 Q
and right now it's hooked up to a Mac
Pro via Thunderbolt which is one of the
few ports that will actually output 4k
at an acceptable frame rate 60 Hertz is
really what I mean by that but here's
the thing about that go ahead and full
screen this video hit it full screen you
got this you got it you got it full
screen for a second alright check this
out boom this is what the desktop looks
like in 4k and it looks all super tiny
because in Mac OS 10 there's very
limited high DPI scaling support so
unfortunately every
looks super duper small coming from a
high-resolution monitor but this is what
your display would look like if it was
4k without any sort of scaling really
small I know so I'm hoping when Apple
finally releases their own 4k display
they'll update Mac OS 10 with more high
DPI options so that things don't have to
look quite this tiny but then again my
eyes have already kind of gotten used to
anyway but at the end of the day when it
comes down to it when you get a set up
that can show 4k video on a 4k display
without taking up all your bandwidth and
without dropping frames it's an amazing
experience it looks beautiful it's
incredibly detailed but the problem is
the number of people with setups that
check all those boxes is very very small
in fact most laptops if you guys are
watching this on a laptop most laptops
won't really playback 4k video a hundred
percent without dropping any frames and
most of them don't even have a 4k
displays anyway and neither do our
phones and neither do most of our
tablets except for I guess that brings
us back to that ridiculous panasonic 4k
tablet from the beginning most people
are totally fine with 1080p and they'll
say that like that's great 1080p looks
fine but once you see 4k video or a
super high resolution video playback
natively without any of those problems
that is typically associated with it is
amazing and then you can't really go
back I call it the retina display effect
once you see such high resolution stuff
everything else starts to look fuzzy so
as much as we love 4k and all its
sharpness and all its pixels here in the
tech community is still a long way from
being widely adopted but it's definitely
starting in fact this is the year that I
think we're going to see the biggest
shift from people seeing 1080p as a
standard to people seeing 4k as a
standard and you're going to see a lot
more 4k TVs in stores and a lot more of
that 4k talk in those ads in the future
so right now if I had to put the state
of 4k in a single word it would be
momentum
I started off a little while ago that
word was potential but now it has a lot
of momentum moving forward if you went
to CES basically everyone there was
showing some sort of 4k TV and that made
me really happy because I loved pixels
and eventually we're going to see a
whole lot more 4k stuff all around so
that's been it hopefully you enjoyed
this video and if you did feel free to
that's about it I guess I've said that's
it several times already now thank you
for watching and I'll talk to you guys
in the next video peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
