welcome back to the first dope tech
episode in a little while but i'm glad
it's back so the last one was actually
on this crazy high end ridiculous piece
of video gear the camera robots this one
is also returning to another insane
really high-end piece of video gear this
this is the Venus optics LA WA macro
probe lens as you can tell it's super
worthy of the name so I've actually had
this lens for a couple weeks now started
messing with it it's definitely not the
type of lens that you use very often
it's super specialty but it's already
responsible for one absolutely crazy
shot in the last video the one plus
seven Pro review definitely check it out
if you haven't already I'll go ahead and
drop a link below that like button okay
let's rewind for a second so the company
Venus optics makes a bunch of other
weird specialty lenses like this one
this super ultra wide tilt shift macro
lens that I've used for a couple videos
especially car ones but why did this one
specifically I mean it probably would
catch your eye - but why this one why
the probe well you might be like me and
you might have seen a couple clips of
this lens floating around the internet
there's even one really well done viral
video of someone literally shooting this
lens through various subjects and
getting all these crazy shots and then
most recently it appeared in this
behind-the-scenes video on Twitter from
Philippa Zito of The Verge as the
critical tool for getting that crazy
intro shot from their galaxy fold review
once I saw that that sort of piqued my
curiosity I looked it up turns out it
was on B and H with like expedited
shipping and that was sort of all I
needed to see so within a couple days
that was here at the studio so what's
the deal if you're a video shooter or a
creator or youtuber or anything why on
earth would you want a crazy lens like
this if you think about it this is a
lens that's made specifically for video
and it's kind of all in the name the
probe lens and there are a lot of crazy
things about this lens so this is what a
normal camera lens looks like you've
probably seen one before this is what a
cine
looks like made specifically for video
and this is the probe lens
it looks pretty wild it's about almost a
foot and a half long just a few
centimetres wide for most of the barrel
and the specs its full-frame fully
manual 24 millimeter macro lens f-14 to
f40 f-14 to f40 what yeah now that's
weird let's break this down so first of
all the fact that it covers full-frame
is pretty amazing
it's a fully manual lens which means the
aperture ring and the focus ring are
both d clicked and fully hand operated
instead of electronic there also happens
to be seven aperture blades by the way
and 27 different optical elements in the
whole tube and it's a macro lens meaning
the minimum focus distance is really
close one and a half feet but when you
measure a minimum focus distance from
the flange or from the sensor basically
that one and a half feet puts it just
inches away from the end of the barrel
of the lens which is also pretty crazy
and then the 24 millimeters is also odd
most macro lenses are around a hundred
millimeters in focal length which is
great that gets you really close to the
subject but also really isolates it with
the super shallow depth of field a 24
millimeter macro it still lets you get
super close but it keeps this wide-angle
field of view and more is in focus and
on f-14 to f40 is kind of a blessing and
a curse on one hand if you could go all
the way wide open to F 2.8 or f/4
something you'd probably get almost
nothing in focus so it kind of saves you
from that but on the other hand at f-14
wide open it means you need a lot of
light for this lens like a lot of light
and then keeping up with the probe theme
the front end of this lens is actually
waterproof so you can not only probe you
know small spaces but you can submerge
it even get underwater shots if you want
to and then you can see up front there's
actually this ring of that is right
LEDs because this lens has lights
built-in to the lens it's a lot so if
you're shooting in a very small space or
a dark space you can use the light to
illuminate your subject there's
literally a micro USB port on the barrel
of this lens that plugs into it and it
comes with a micro USB cable in the box
so if you attach it to some sort of
power brick like I did
and then plug it in and turn it on you
end up with this sort of a magic wand of
an experience it's pretty bright -
that's all the LEDs lit up at once a
ring light at the end of your probe lens
it's crazy but of course when it all
comes down to it of course the shape of
this lens is what makes it such a unique
tool obviously being so narrow you can
get right up like super close to things
you can be in small spaces and then of
course you're sort of really close to
something while being far away from it
at the same time and there's also a
bunch of YouTube videos detailing a
bunch of examples of this even that
viral video depicting kind of shooting
it the shooting part is fake there's
nothing detaching from the lens here
that's definitely edited but the shots
it got that they included those shots
are actually real and they're super well
done and there's so many other good ones
so that of course got the gears turning
about how to possibly use the probe lens
for a tech video there are a shot and a
tech video or just to shoot tech in some
way and of course we saw Phil's video
with the Galaxy fold so the story goes
as you know I got the oneplus 7 pro a
couple weeks beforehand and had this
lens in hand the entire time
so I knew I had to try something so of
course to maximize how dramatic it is
you want to get as close to the phone as
possible and like I said even at f-14
wide open you need a ton of light to get
even see anything usable even in broad
daylight or super strong studio lights
you got to crank the ISO at f-14 the
thing is phone screens are actually
really not that bright and if you shine
lights at them they get less bright so
it turns out that's actually why the
Verge's video was shot in this dark
setting with a dark background because
it's the only way to really see the
phone's display with this lens so that's
why I ended up having to do basically
the same thing for the 1 plus 7 Pro
phone screens just aren't bright enough
to compete against other lights so the
only way to really see it vividly is to
turn the rest of the lights off kind of
like how your phone screen looks the
brightest at night but we had some other
practicals and some other lights in the
scene and then even after we set
everything up with a shot like this the
work isn't done until a little bit of
coloring a little bit of editing to
brighten up the phone denoising effects
adding and potential
even sound design etc but the final shot
is so worth it so really as it's turning
out the best way to maximize this lens
when shooting objects with it is number
one to get really really close to your
subject usually a small subject and then
you know play with movement a bit and
specifically things around the barrel to
really get that perspective that it
creates of being like a tiny person on
like a small surface with things going
past you so that's what we tried to do
so here are some other examples of some
shots we've done with the probe lens
all right so this was a fun one yes in
the studio we do have CD racks that have
never held a CD in their life instead
they hold the smartphone's
don't worry it's perfect so I was
literally just wondering what it would
look like to move through the phones as
if you were like a bug flying through
them so the red is on a slider we
pointed lights at it like lots of lights
and there's almost no other point to
this shot other than really just seeing
how cool it would look from that crazy
inside perspective we had a couple
different versions you know pull versus
push moves but other than that there's
no subject in the middle we literally
just got the shot to see if you could
get it and you couldn't with any other
traditional lens even a GoPro wouldn't
fit in the opening this lens is fitting
through
all right so this was just fun and I
think a lot of that's just cuz it's
really colorful and I was hungry but I
think it would be even more awesome with
maybe the robot or with possibly a true
slow motion camera like a phantom or
something crazy but the setup is similar
it's got a lot of light and then just
timing the MMS falling over and spilling
basically over the lens and that was the
challenge is to time it right so this
was shot in slow motion the red does
handle 120 FPS at 4k so that was not a
problem but we had plenty of other
versions and other bloopers with this
shot with the mm spilling everywhere and
weird timing because it's human error
you know you're not gonna get it perfect
every time
but the final version it couldn't have
worked out any better with the mm
bouncing pretty much right over the lens
just like a transition
all right shout out to Andy so this one
actually is inspired by that viral video
where it looks like it goes through this
brush with all the bristles this one
just fake plants so for this one I was
thinking we were gonna use the light on
the front of the lens for this one but
after a few test shots it turned out to
definitely still be too harsh like a
spotlight so we turn that off and
basically double down on lighting the
environment a lot better so there's
still a ton of light here and the
original shot was actually pulling the
move on the slider backwards so the fake
grass would sort of naturally move over
to cover up the lens as it goes past so
the final shot you see is just playing
it back reversed and then the lighting
on the Android at the end as it dims out
that was just timed by hand just by
moving the light I was holding 100%
practical effects hundred-percent Pro
blends so this was a horizontal slide of
course as you could tell similar
lighting setups the last one but just
moving the lights higher up so they
didn't glare off this matte black
keyboard so much and then you can
actually see the RGB lights better I'm
actually honestly surprised they showed
up on video so well and then just
getting super close to the keyboard kind
of like you really couldn't with any
other lens so that was a fun one the
perspective we imagined when we were
dreaming up this shot is like the zipper
sort of opening past you like you're
this tiny like a bug again and this
giant zipper is sort of chasing you away
the tough part is obviously sense of the
depth of field is so shallow it's super
easy to go in or out of focus if the
timing which is by hand isn't absolutely
perfect so there's plenty of takes of
that where my hand goes in and out of
focus so I didn't worry about that too
much
instead the more interesting part is
making it feel like the zipper is
closing around you and being so low to
the ground like only the probe lens can
definitely help with that
so this is the last and I'll say the
most difficult one just because it's
entirely handheld and free-flowing and
it is not a lightweight camera but the
perspective is basically as if you're
you know attached to the marker like
you're a bug holding on to the marker
for dear life as I write something and
it kind of turned out pretty well and
you could probably do this with another
24 millimeter lens if the minimum focus
distance was close enough but you know
that was fun to shoot anyway but yeah
that is the probe lens it's it's clearly
not a conventional lens and there's
almost no reason to actually go get one
you kind of have to invent ways to use
it but those couple times where you do
actually find a good use for it and it
turns out to work really well it's so
worth it so that that's what makes this
dope tech so of course now that you've
seen it on video you'll be the first to
recognize it when you see a shot
occasionally from it in a future video
kind of like the robot shots you guys
recognize I promise not to overuse it
but I'm super glad we have it thanks for
watching catch you guys in the next one
