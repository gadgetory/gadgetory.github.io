December 2011 the Samsung Galaxy Nexus
was launched on Verizon a 4G LTE phone
with hardware by Samsung and software by
Google so it's been my primary handset
since then and this is the 100% honest
review of the Android phone that I
waited so long for starting with the
hardware the only real concern that
critics of this phone had at launch and
also the Android haters with Samsung's
plastic back and I'm happy to report
that it's still really durable it's not
a problem none of the glass on the back
is cracked it's still in excellent
condition and one other thing to note
was that shortly after I got the Nexus I
picked up the 2100 milliamp hour
extended battery which is just ever so
slightly thicker than the stock eighteen
hundred million power battery but the
difference is definitely worth it and
it's still a very thin phone but I get
to battery life in a second but onto the
front of the phone which I can tell you
has proved to be the best feature of the
whole device is the four point six five
inch 1280 by 720 Super AMOLED HD display
absolutely astounding it's that
beautiful having to display this big and
amazingly crisp pretty much a Retina
display makes it a pleasure to use for
everything that smartphones should be
good at it's comfortable for me I have
big hands
I think anything over four point eight
inches might be a little too big
I've enjoyed as small as four inches on
the incredible two and as large as 4.7
inches on the Titan but four point six
five is comfortable and all of that is
exactly what she said but seriously this
is still one of the best displays in the
business and there's no denying that so
let me fill you in on the software side
of things this is a Nexus device which
makes it exceptionally easy to unlock
route and customize the daylights out of
and that's exactly what I've done here I
realized it was downright silly for me
someone who likes to take advantage of
the customization of Android to stay
with stock for so long so I'm running
Android 4.0 point four with the a-ok
peer um a franko kernel that likes me
overclocked to 1.3 gigahertz and let me
tell you this thing belies the rom is
what allows me to get if
you notable UI changes like the
convenient toggles up here in the
notification bar and the customized
bottom navigation bar with the
persistent menu button and the kernel is
what makes it so stupid fast I mean it
feels brand new but like I said this
device is past 15 weeks old the
dual-core processor is more than capable
of everything stock but the kernel
really takes it to the next level and
everything just feels liquid smooth like
I just got it out the box
it opens apps quickly it closes them
quickly even crashes quicker honestly
this isn't a stable signage and mod or
anything but you will notice the
occasional force close and very discrete
actions somewhere deep in the OS but
you'll be out of it in no time flat so
it just feels really great I actually
tried to get this thing to lag and as
you can see here no chance I think I
think you get the point
this phone handles Ice Cream Sandwich
like a boss
now Ice Cream Sandwich itself is pretty
sweet if you're already an Android user
it's really easy to fall in love with
the new UI but if you're coming from
something silly simple like Windows
Phone or iOS then yeah you might think
this is a little bit confusing sometimes
so give it a few days and you'll get
through the learning curve just fine the
built-in apps are great they've proved
to be very reliable especially I love
Google Maps which is really helpful for
me someone who goes a lot of places on
foot and Google Maps walking directions
navigation is pure awesome and let's not
forget the Play Store which is full of
great apps great third-party apps
constantly growing with notable
additions recently like Instagram and
Temple Run and speaking of Temple Run
I'm not a huge phone gamer at all I'm
over productivity and utility person but
it's safe to say looking at this that
gaming will go just fine on this beauty
of the screen I think I've made that
point already and so will movie watching
and YouTube video watching when it's
full screen 1280 by 720 it's just hard
to get over how rich that AMOLED display
is it amazes me literally every day some
days I found myself using the Nexus to
catch up on my YouTube subscriptions
more than I do on my tablet or on my
computer also a major buying point for
some people on a smartphone is a
camera's picture quality and I have an
entire video dedicated to this and
that'll be in the description right
below that like
help with the summit up it's pretty
decent the instant shutter is really
nice convenient and the front-facing
camera is great for Google+ Hangouts or
Skype or even face unlock yeah face
unlock you catch that unlocking it
within the face and there are just some
things that Android does really really
well like notifications for example it
just doesn't get any better than that
it's an amazing system battery life all
day every day and did I mention that
screen so overall the Samsung Galaxy
Nexus easily one of the best phones I've
ever used and I'm really glad it's my
own contract phone I'm not saying I'm
not looking forward to stuff like the
Samsung Galaxy s3 but just little things
about Android like for example the
ability to go and look at how much
mobile data you're using on your device
little things maybe like the ability to
sync bookmarks from Google Chrome the
Galaxy Nexus is absolutely a very nice
device even if you were to buy one today
unlocked for somewhere around $450
absolutely recommended like I said in
the video one of the biggest reasons you
buy a nexus is because it's so easy to
unlock and customize and to use a custom
ROM and that's definitely what I've done
using a okp here on Android 4.0.4 oh
that a brief summary would be awesome
display really really really really fast
and pretty much an awesome all-around
device thanks for watching this review
video guys of the Samsung Galaxy Nexus

I'll talk to you guys in the next video
thanks for watching
