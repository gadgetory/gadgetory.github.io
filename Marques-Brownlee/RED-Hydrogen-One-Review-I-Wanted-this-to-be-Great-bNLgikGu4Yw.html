what's up guys mkbhd here and this is
the red hydrogen one and it's this is a
really weird phone and a lot of ways
there have been so many questions about
this thing is a really a $1,295 device i
new red cameras are expensive but why is
the phone so expensive what's so good
about it
is it like a red camera in your pocket
who is it for what makes it special what
is a holographic media machine and why
does this exist you got questions I got
answers and I've actually been in the
unique position of not only using the
phone for the past couple months but
actually seeing and following along with
the development of it behind the scenes
for almost as long you guys might
remember the video I did on the early
prototype of the hydrogen back and it
was still somewhat of an idea I was into
it I shared it red wanted to share with
you what they were working on with the
world but since then a lot has changed
and it's all landed on this the final
retail shipping version of the red
hydrogen one and as it exists it is the
most frustrating phone that I've bought
this year
so as a smartphone this thing is pretty
scattered it definitely doesn't resemble
any other phone in pretty much any way
on the outside like it clearly doesn't
fit in with the 2018 glass sandwich
design and notches and actually think
it's perfectly fine being different I
would describe this as more of a modern
industrial look it's a huge phone first
of all it has only a 5.7 inch display
which we'll talk a lot more about in a
bit but it's not the biggest screen out
there but it has the huge bezels around
it there's a giant forehead and a chin
with big speakers in them and we'll also
talk a lot about those and a pretty
serious looking array of front-facing
cameras and sensors and an LED
notification light and then the back is
this two-tone look with exposed carbon
fiber and aluminum and just open seams
and ridges and textures and there's also
a lot of text all around this phone so
it looks and feels industrial and then
you have this whole rubberized side grip
which with my hands is fine the way I
hold the phone but yeah it's basically
the opposite of an iPhone as far as
build and slipperiness goes
matter of fact here's my little anti
plug don't put Adi brand skin on it
don't put a case on it it feels like it
already has a case on it it's built like
an absolute tank it turns out that's a
big reason why this phone cost $1,300
these materials the carbon fiber and
metal but beyond that there's pretty
much no other reason why someone would
spend that much on this phone let's get
into all the other things it's a big
phone like I said and it makes a pretty
good use of that space keeping a
headphone jack up at the top the microSD
card slot USB see at the bottom and it's
packed in a 4500 milliamp hour battery
so the biggest in any phone I've tested
so far no IP rating yet though but they
say they're working on it probably
because of those exposed pins on the
back I'll tweet or share an update if
they do get approved for IB 68 or 67 or
something like that but then on the
inside since this phone's been in
development for a year now it's using
specs from a year ago
so Snapdragon 835 six gigs of ram 128
gigs of storage and expandable and that
huge battery so yes you did hear that
right I said Snapdragon 835 not
Snapdragon a 45 and to be honest if you
just handed me a phone and asked me if I
could tell if it was the eight
five or 8:45 I probably wouldn't but
when you're spending $1,295 minimum for
this phone
you kind of expect the latest and
greatest highest end hardware and that's
not what you're getting here but to be
real the performance is actually fine as
it should be because there's pretty much
no skin or any sort of heavy
customization happening here I've always
said staying near stock Android is great
for both performance and hopefully quick
updates so I can confirm on performance
but there's no word on Android P for
this phone but I've gotten maybe seven
or eight software updates since I
started testing pretty much all of them
have been camera related though but yeah
basically the only customization we'll
find in the hydrogen software is this
red launcher which is actually pretty
good it feels like Nova Launcher and has
a lot of options and then some ugly
custom icons and some pre-installed apps
for holographic content but yeah that's
why the performance and battery life are
actually good the software is simple
enough and you've got six years of RAM
okay so this is the part where we should
address the frustrating part of this
phone what is a holographic media
machine why is that the tagline for this
phone well it's because of three things
the display the speakers and the cameras
on this phone they're all specialized
for something called four views so let's
start with the display it's a 5.7 inch
panel like I said LCD 2560 by 1440 so
pretty high pixel density and through
normal use in 2d mode normal mode it
seems pretty good colors and contrasts
are on point at first glance the viewing
angles are good but I'll get back to
that in a second what's unique is this
special mode a glasses list 3d that
works in portrait or landscape with
specially formatted content for view
content holographic content so don't let
the word holographic fool you that's
just like one of their marketing terms
it's not like there's stuff like
floating out over the display like a
hologram and then in a no it's it's
still a very much what you'd expect out
of a glasses list 3d experience it's all
on the display but it's more about depth
and it's sometimes pretty good
now obviously cameras don't show it
pretty much at all
so sadly I can't give you this
experience this is kind of the best I
can do but my best attempt at describing
what you should be seeing is
it's like this sort of shimmery trippy
3d depth effect that you can see when
you look at it head-on
I actually think when it's used well and
content is shot for for view it's
actually pretty good I've showed this to
a couple people and their reactions have
been more or less impressed when there's
content specifically like I said made
for this format things will sort of pop
out of the screen and appear to fly at
you like a 3d movie it's a good 3d
effect it's fun some content doesn't
look good though especially when it's
more flat or there's less separation
between a foreground and a background or
if it's just poorly converted it just
looks like a sort of a lame pixelated
version of normal footage so it's hit or
miss in this way but like any 3d effect
also you don't really want to look at it
for too long I fatigue is real hologram
me.how holographic is the word they use
but it's it's hard to explain and it's
kind of trippy whoa dude this is weird
and there's there's different like so
there's a movie trailer version of it
where there's like things coming towards
you and I think that's maybe the best
use of it I've seen it's impossible to
show on camera I've tried many different
times no this will never show up on
camera this yeah this is odd yeah okay
so it has this cool mode but now as a
result you also have some other
downsides of the display a couple
actually the fact that it works in
portrait or landscape is pretty cool
most 3d effects only work with the
display one orientation but because of
the hardware layer that makes this
possible the brightness specifically
suffers quite a bit so the hydrogen-1
screen just does not get very bright and
then in 2d or regular mode you'll notice
it looks I would describe it as kind of
pixelated and I don't even have to pixel
peep very hard to notice it especially
on white backgrounds that again is
because of that hardware layer this
display tech so the 513 pixels per inch
kind of doesn't mean that much if I'm
constantly seeing what looks like these
dots on the screen all the time look at
this side-by-side with the pixel 3
display that's a big difference now the
interesting news here is I asked Jim
from read about this and he says that
it's a combination
of part hardware part software and that
it can technically be improved with
software updates and that it used to be
worse and that it's gotten better to the
point that it exists now I want to
believe I want to believe that it can
keep getting better to the point where
it's almost totally gone but I don't
know but what I'm gonna do is actually
I'll post the entire little mini
interview I did with Jim founder of red
and you can hear exactly what he has to
say for it
his very PR answers or whatever but I'll
link it right below the like button if
you're interested in hearing that but
yeah it's it's just I I can trust my eye
about what I observe and then you can
listen to what he says so that's the
display and then you have these speakers
flanking it they are also optimized for
for view now in a big phone like this
like maybe a razor phone or a pixel
three I'm bracing myself for amazing
speakers right like they they have these
these huge spaces for big drivers
they're not going to be easy to block
I'm ready to be really happy with these
speakers pull up some audio anything
music games video whatever and the
speaker on the hydrogen one isn't even
louder than average
this speaker doesn't sound that great I
put the volume all the way up to max and
to be fair it doesn't distort much so
that's an upside but it's also really
lacking and a little bit tinny kind of
sounds like a big weak laptop speaker in
the first place it's a pretty big
letdown to me there is one setting you
can tweak though and it's called 3d
audio and when you toggle it on it gets
even worse now the 3d effect it creates
is actually noticeable so then you start
to hear the left and right stereo
separation the sort of pseudo surround
sound effect that you'd be similar to
hearing on an iPhone but it's not that
good and it's even more tinny now and
still not very loud and then on the back
there are those cameras this was one of
the original reasons I was so excited
when I heard red was making a smart
phone like the space was getting
interesting we had the pixel - that was
kind of the king of cameras for a while
that iPhone 10's step their game up and
then pixel three sort of expanded their
lead we have all these other cameras
with these multiple lenses and multiple
cameras on the front and the back and
then we heard red a specialty camera
maker that I obviously love was gonna
step in and make a smart phone which
would have cameras on it this should be
amazing I'm ready for this and well it
turns out these cameras are just they're
okay they're just okay it is dual 12
megapixel cameras in the hump of the
back dual LED flash and the cameras are
spaced out far enough apart for death
detection and I've been sharing actually
photos from hydrogen camera here and
there for the better part of a couple
months now among multiple software
updates and are rapidly evolving color
science and camera app but here's the
thing to understand red doesn't make
this camera this is a like an
off-the-shelf camera probably a Sony IMX
sensor or something like that the same
kind you see in a bunch of other
smartphones so the best that red can do
is what they can get out of this sensor
and their improvements in color science
and HDR and software but Red's cameras
like the one I'm using for this video
are so incredible because red is so good
and making the silicon the actual sensor
that's used to shoot and then they
control the entire image processing
pipeline and they make the camera and
the software and everything
so they control the entire end-to-end
but here with the hydrogen like I said
they don't make these sensors they're
just doing the best they can with
off-the-shelf parts and software so if
you were expecting some sort of extreme
read quality camera built into the
smartphone that's not what you're
getting here hold that thought until the
end so yeah photos from the hydrogen's
built-in camera are all right there
they're solid with color and dynamic
range
I left HDR turned on the whole time
often Reds became a little bit muddy
sharpness was pretty much always good
but photos in general we're just hit or
miss basically you have to give it a lot
of light and it'll do fine but things
start to fall apart in less than ideal
conditions
this isn't drastically better or worse
than something I'd expect out of like a
1 plus 60 and obviously software updates
will continue to make tweaks and
adjustments over time but that's just
where we're at now of course red is
mostly known for their video cameras so
how good is the 4k video here again with
the built-in stuff pretty good but
nothing exceptional or unbelievable
again think 1 + 6 level or even LGV 40
level on a good day nothing to write
home about at this point so the camera
can also as you imagine capture more for
view content both on the back with the
dual cameras or even a for view selfie
with the front-facing array so really
read cares a lot about this for view
maybe to a fault there is a whole solid
inventory of content shot for for view
some trailers and some cinematic footage
and stuff like that it's great for demos
and that's what I've been showing people
and there's also an entire app store
filled with apps and games that support
the holographic display mode but if I'm
looking at this right it looks like
there's only about 20 apps in the whole
store and while that probably is
necessary for delivering for view
content with the special mode - hydrogen
buyers I guess you can't do through the
Play Store I guess it's fine it just it
just looks weird that you need a whole
separate app store and a whole separate
content store just for supporting for
view like YouTube doesn't support for
view for example and as far as photos no
other phone out there can view for view
photos either but to see what other
people with hydrogens are shooting
there's this app that actually like
called hollow pix
it's kind of like an Instagram but just
for the 3d
for view photos there's a lot of cool
stuff on here that people are shooting
but there's basically just a couple
hundred users at this point just people
with hydrogen's I have four followers on
here so I check me out but also I've
gone down through the list now you've
probably noticed there aren't really a
whole lot of overwhelmingly positive
things to say about this $1,295 phone as
it exists right now the one and only
upside that I could possibly think of to
save this phone and actually what makes
it so frustrating is red what I didn't
talk about her mentioned even at all in
this video is the pins down here at the
bottom of the back of the phone these
exposed pin arrays similar to what we've
seen on like moto phones as they've
experimented with modularity are a sort
of an unlockable key that hasn't been
turned yet at the bottom of red site
they have a whole section about modules
expandable storage camera module and
power pack modules all coming in 2019 so
you can see you know a power pack module
for extra battery life on the already
huge battery or an expandable storage
module for adding even more storage
again pretty simple or the camera module
the cinema module which would be adding
a custom read made sensor and an
interchangeable lens mount which would
turn this via that that's what we want
that would make this the red camera in
your pocket that we were originally
excited about from top to bottom read
silicon interchangeable lens mount
smartphone form factor that would
totally level up this device but as of
right now that's just a complete fantasy
that just exists in the text on that
page for now I even asked Jim about this
as well and he just confirmed what it
already says on the site which is just
2019 sometime in 2019 I think I think
there's really basically just two ways
to think about this phone depending on
how you feel about red this one is
either an overpriced total flop with
last year's specs and some gimmicky 3d
or this is some revolutionary upcoming
modular device somewhere between a
smartphone and a portable cinema camera
with this virtual reality moe
- it all wrapped in one thing you
probably already know which side to
stand on as of right now there's
honestly no way to recommend this phone
for $1,300 like imagine this phone
without red attached to it at all
without the red label or the red name on
it this is at that point just some
hopeless like random Android phone
probably a $400 device with no hope of
ever getting modules but with red behind
it if you trust red if you respect red
and you think they're gonna stay behind
this then this could be a really
interesting device in the next year the
only redeeming quality is the potential
for future improvement if you trust red
and I wanted this phone to be so good
and parts of it are pretty good but as a
complete package there's only a tiny
sliver of people I could say should
actually buy it as is and even those
people should probably wait and save
your money so I'll be waiting for the
modules or hydrogen - whichever comes
first either way that's been it thanks
for watching talk to guys the next one
