and welcome to some of the first
impressions of one of the first flagship
smartphones of 2017
that's the LG G 6 successor to the g5
pretty much just in the name because
everything else is completely different
there is a bunch of new stuff with this
phone I mean you can see that just by
looking at it but this is going to be my
top 5 so top 5 best new features of the
g6 I'm going to put them in order so
enough of this order doesn't matter
stuff I'm going to tell you exactly
where I think things ranked as the best
new features of this phone we have
started so number 5 is the software the
g6 is still rocking an LG software skin
but it is a much improved way less
in-your-face version of it so it's still
very LG with no app drawer and skinned
apps and icons and things in a very
colourful look but it's not too crazy
and I'd say it's an improvement over
what we had on the g5 and g4 and
previous phones built on top of Android
7.1 nougat which means first of all you
do get Google Assistant baked in now as
you do with any nougat phone and it
means you get a couple other features
that are built into LG's skin that you
wouldn't get into pure stock Android
that you'd have on the pixel phone
there's always a balance of shoving new
features in your face which is kind of
like what Samsung might do versus sort
of tucking the features away in the
Settings app and letting you find them
later and I think this skin does a
pretty good job of balancing those two
things but of course it's not perfect as
a skin phone you kind of have inherently
a little bit of a delay as far as
software updates go of course we hope it
gets lots of software updates very
quickly but there's no guarantees
also of course you kind of have to deal
with LG's reputation lately it's been a
little bit shaky as far as stability
goes but we'll say number four is the
specs this is a part where I stood a
bunch of numbers and letters at you that
are both higher and better than the
numbers and letters from last year so
2.3 gigahertz Snapdragon 820 one chip
with the audrina 530 GPU four gigabytes
of RAM 32 gigs of storage is great you
have the twin 13 megapixel cameras on
the back and a 3300 milliamp hour
battery and it's ip68 water-resistant
that on top of Qi enabled wireless
charging and it still has a micro SD
card slot so up to 2 terabytes of
expandable storage so the numbers in the
specs on paper of course look great as
you'd expect from a flagship Android
phone in 2017 we don't have a price
so it's kind of hard to place this in
the banks of the buck category but
obviously it looks really good there's
no real flaws here but of course again
it's not quite perfect in a US version
you're actually not getting a quad dak
you're getting a pretty average dak
instead you're getting a couple extra
radios which I again it's a different
consumer in a different region but
you're also not getting a snapdragon 835
chip obviously in this phone that's
another bleeding edge high-end chip that
you'll probably see in phones as soon as
a month from now like the Galaxy s8 in
March now that's not to say that the
Snapdragon 820 one is way worse or that
it can't hang it's just that's what you
get for putting out a phone a little bit
early in the year if you don't get the
brand new silicon that sort of comes out
after you put your phone out so later
phones will have the Snapdragon 835 821
is still really good but you know not
perfect so number three is the dual
cameras on the back last year the g5 had
a very obviously primary 16 megapixel
portrait camera and a very obviously
secondary low resolution super wide
angle camera just for fun this year the
g6 gets twin 13 megapixel sensors behind
your standard and 120 degree wide angle
lenses so now when you're pushing back
and forth between the portrait lens and
the super wide angle lens it's not as
big as a glaring difference in quality
before you could really tell when a
photo is with the other camera now
you'll just sort of be able to go eye
between the two and not get a huge
drop-off and I think that's the kind of
thing that will encourage people to use
this super wide angle camera a lot more
it was pretty cool feature to see in the
g5 they're carrying it over to the g6
and I'm happy it's there but it's not
it's not perfect because obviously okay
no camera is perfect but also because
I've had some stability issues in this
first bit is used but I can't look too
far into that because this is a
pre-production unit with pre-production
software I can pretty much guarantee
that this and any other problem I come
across in the software will be fixed by
the time this goes on sale so the number
two best feature in the g6 is the design
the design of the g6 is completely new
it's ditched the modular nature of the
g5 for a much more you could say
traditional premium smartphone design so
just metal and glass everywhere still
has the volume buttons on the side which
I really like and it keeps the trademark
and loved LG power button and
fingerprint reader on the back which
also happens to complete this space that
you can see in making I mean you do see
it right and honestly the robot based
kind of matte
just because this phone has a very
robotic squared up look like there's no
unnecessary tapers to try to make it
feel thinner or look thinner there's no
fancy edge display bleeding over the
edge with curved glass none of that
crazy fancy stuff it's just very
businesslike and all the way around and
I kind of like that or maybe it's
because I've been using the tick's with
too much I don't know it's gorilla glass
on the front and back and this thing is
obviously waterproof like we mentioned
earlier so ip68 means it can survive if
you get caught in the rain or you drop
your phone in a puddle or shower or
something it does all this while keeping
USB type-c it keeps the headphone jack
it keeps the expandable storage with a
micro SD card slot so with all that I
don't mind it being a little bit thicker
in the hand because the footprint is
definitely manageable but as you could
probably guess it's not perfect you
could say that you would have liked to
have had a removable battery like we had
with the g5 you don't get that it's not
a huge deal but that's something to note
and also the single downward facing
speaker is not the best part of this
phone at all and that's something that
I've noted with a lot of previous
flagships but obviously the ones that
focus on the speaker get to do it a lot
better than this so not perfect so that
brings us to number one the best feature
of the g6 which is right up here at the
front
that's the display the screen is
obviously the main attraction here it's
a 5.7 inch IPS LCD display with an 18 by
9 aspect ratio which is you know 2 by 1
I know my fractions so if it displays a
little taller
or a little wider sideways than your
normal 16 by 9 display it's a 28 80 by
1440 resolution now apps and wallpapers
and icons and everything still work
perfectly normally but you do get a
couple software features to take
advantage of the larger display at
multitasking for example works a bit
better now that you have that extra bit
of room I mean it's essentially two
square windows now top to bottom or side
by side and more apps are compatible
with it thanks to Android nougat and on
top of just being a little bit longer
it's obviously still a great display as
you can tell it gets super-bright up to
600 myths so very viewable outdoors
supports HDR and it's very proud of it
giving very deep blacks for an LCD and
great saturation and the curved corners
are just icing on the Krispies g6 cake
I could go either way on curved corners
versus square but I think they look kind
of cool so I don't mind it and the
thinness of the bezels is really what LG
has been hyping up and what people
looking at this phone will hype up
because it's not just the side bezels
which are obviously tiny but it's the
forehead and the chin the top and bottom
bezels they get super compact - so these
thin bezels all the way around the
display let a phone with a 5.7 inch
screen fit in the footprint of a much
smaller phone which is legitimately
useful again but then again you can say
with me again it's not perfect anytime
you're watching a 16 by 9 video becomes
obvious you're going to see these bars
along the side and people get used to
seeing these bars along watching most
videos but if you watch an 18 by 9 or
2x1 video the bars go away and it looks
way better and also obviously smaller
bezels make this phone a lot less
protected and more prone to cracking or
breaking if you were to drop it
especially if you don't have a case on
it which like me is how I roll with
every phone so that's just something I'm
willing to deal with so that's the g6 in
a first impressions nutshell things like
performance and battery life and the
camera these will all be thoroughly
tested and that's the kind of stuff I'll
go over with you in the full review of
this phone when the thing finally comes
out with a price and a release date but
until then that's a that's what to know
about it you can look at the g6 as
pretty much a super safe bet but in a
good way like it seems to stack up well
against what we're expecting from things
like the Galaxy s8 and phones coming out
later this year but again those will
have to come out we'll look at that
comparison when we get to it
so either way please think of this phone
would you grab a g6 let me know thanks
for watching
Totti as the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
