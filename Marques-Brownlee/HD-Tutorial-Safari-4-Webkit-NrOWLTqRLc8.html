get the Safari or WebKit on any
operating system this will work on
anything that I know of except for Linux
so here we go first we're gonna open any
web browser I'm gonna use Safari just
for the purpose of this video ok and you
see as Google and I'm gonna search in
Safari WebKit and the first link will be
WebKit Goerge
the open source project click on that
link it'll start to load and soon enough
we have a download link right here this
is where we download the nightly builds
basically the surprise for WebKit is
just tiny bug fixes that give Safari the
boost it needs to be just that
almost perfect web browser it's
extremely fast already click download
nightly builds and it'll bring you to a
page where you can choose your operating
system Mac O's 10 or windows whether
it's vista XP 95 98 whatever you might
have and click on this is a 22 megabyte
download for Windows 20 makes for Vista
or OS 10 and once you have it you will
in your Start menu if you search WebKit
hopefully you can see this in HD if you
search WebKit it'll search it and you
will see all these things what you want
to do is hit run nightly WebKit right
click it and run it as an administrator
and I already have this saved right here
I changed the icon and everything and I
named it whooping so when I click it it
goes through this hole and crop prompt
dialog lasts about 5 seconds but I think
it's worth the wait
the original Safari every time you ran
the acid3 test every single time he ran
the browser acid3 test you got a 75 out
of 100 which is really bad and the leaf
test would always fail and that was a
problem with one of safaris little bugs
so now if I were to type in acid 3 and
click on after 3 tests
yeah Safari for webkit passes the acid 3
test with a 100 out of 100 so I highly
recommend you go ahead to Google and
search WebKit and WebKit org open up the
page and download that nightly build it
makes Safari that much faster see how
fast it takes soak up YouTube and
another thing if you have icons for your
favorites look as I roll down here it'll
open up what the icon was next to it so
that's pretty cool and I had there so I
think it's pretty cool it's just a sweet
sweet web browser right now and it's
extremely fast it how low fast it
buffers let's see Google Maps done how
fast was that it's crazy so I really
really recommend this to anyone who's
looking for the fastest browser on
Windows I already showed you tutorial on
how to make Firefox faster well that
that I guess will be my tutorial on how
to make Safari faster how I got this
icon will go right by first I downloaded
this image I like the image I downloaded
it then I right-click what it was before
hey icon setting and just find where you
saved the image click on that and that
will be what icon is and it's just a PNG
image X high-resolution image like it
hit OK and I read it WebKit by typing it
in right here so that's how you get the
Safari WebKit guys look open up the
original Safari and type master 3 and
you will get this big red icon here link
test failed and 75 out of 100 every
single time without fail but should you
open Safari for WebKit you'll get decent
long dialogue but I think it's worth it
mm-hmm
copy of our files open a bunch of
resources and things then it'll actually
buffer the browser itself type in acid 3
and just to show you I'm not joking one
more time 100
honey baby I love this so go ahead and
download that to make your internet
browsing experience that much faster
subscribe peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
