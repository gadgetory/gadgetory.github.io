here from mkbhd and welcome to another
HD tutorial and in this video I'll be
showing all of you guys a new windows
Twitter client that I've actually come
across thanks to the folks at the comp
you geeks and that their YouTube channel
link will be in the description they
actually showed me blue which is
actually a sort of arrival to tweet deck
which I've shut down for this tutorial a
tutorial of this is available at 13 23
calm and I actually do a lot of things
there at that website so I'll go ahead
and throw that link in the description
as well where you can go ahead and check
out blue now the description does say
the Vista Twitter client however this
will wor work with windows XP Windows
Vista and Windows 7 so if you're willing
to try this out and I'm probably going
to do a comparison between this and
maybe tweetdeck and maybe one other
twitter client depending on what I find
and you know we'll see how that turns
out so go ahead and hit the download now
button and this is just going to be my
first impressions and first looks to
show you guys who are interested in the
new Twitter client what it'll look like
so it's only 10.7 kilobytes to start
very very light just go ahead and hit
open and wanting to exit Safari behind
that and once the blue dot application
has actually opened up you can exit the
Downloads window so there it is it's
launching the application and verifying
all the requirements which are you know
a small bit of RAM you know enough hard
drive space the appropriate operating
system etc so let's just go ahead and
wait for this to finish and it says do
you want to install this from 1323 calm
go ahead and hit the install button and
it'll begin downloading so I'll exit out
the safari window so here it is it's an
overall very small download quite light
a little bit lighter than tweetdeck at
ten point four megabytes so it weighs in
pretty lightly and once it opens up you
guys will be able to see you know what
it first looks like when you open it up
how to login etc so let's just wait for
that to pull up alright so once you
finish downloading and blue everything
has gone through the installation
process if it doesn't open up
automatically
go to your Start menu type in BL you
which is how you spell it and go ahead
and click blue under programs and it'll
go ahead and open up and obviously it
won't be signed in the first time so
I'll just go ahead and sign in for you
on my mkbhd Twitter account there you go
that was a nice little animation there
they have on the first boot so mkbhd and
go ahead and put my password and go
ahead and say remember me just so you
don't have to do this every time you
login hit go and all these cool little
animations that it does as it's working
just to keep you entertained it's a very
smooth application as you'll notice on
it kind of flows in with the windows 7
background if you haven't noticed that
also very very nice so also if these is
these legs if these sort of a animations
blur a little bitter if they are a
little bit choppy I don't worry about
that because they're not so bad in real
life so I'm basically i'll probably be
comparing this to tweetdeck you guys can
see there is a faves button a home
button you can go ahead and check your
at replies there they are you can check
your direct messages and once you click
them there will be removed from here and
you can go ahead and check all the
updates and a few if you want to update
you can see this little bubble right
here and the 140 in the background
that's how many characters your have
left so I'm just going to go ahead and
send out a sample tweet testing out blue
hit enter or go ahead and hit the check
and it'll show up on the home screen see
that little one just popped up go back
to the home screen there it is testing
out blue so I mean this is a really
smooth tutor client guys you can just
grab hold of an update and drag it and
they all kind of slide down I mean it
seems almost like an iphone application
if you think about it and I'll obviously
go over the the options and everything
like that in the review video if you
guys want to see it so thank you for
checking out this installation video of
blue a pretty nice-looking twitter
client for windows XP Vista and Windows
7 and shout out to I guess all the
people who are on the screen right now a
comp helper kid 10 96 tech tech man I
belux and of course myself thank you for
watching guys peace
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
