this is a MacBook Air now if I didn't
tell you what year or model it was you
wouldn't really exactly know because on
the outside this is pretty much exactly
the same as the previous year's model
but they dropped a lot of changes on the
inside that make it a lot better now
Apple's not the only one to do this a
lot of other manufacturers have dropped
as well chips in the latest generation
of existing laptops and made them about
a thousand times better by doing so but
this is it this is Apple's new machine
so if had any further ado it's time to
give the full review treatment to the
2013 MacBook Air and the first thing you
notice is that literally everything on
the outside of this laptop is exactly
the same as the outside of the 2012
MacBook Air it's the same design same
display same thinness same ports same
hinge same backlit keyboard even
everything's the same the one thing that
changed to be able to identify the new
air over the old one is that microphone
so now there is a dual microphone port
on the left hand side all the other
ports however on this MacBook Air are
the same the design has basically
remained unchanged now that's not
necessarily a bad thing considering the
2012 macbook air design isn't exactly
bad a lot of people love it but a lot of
people were hoping like me that the
Retina display would come to this new
machine a really high resolution display
unfortunately Apple just refuses to make
a retina MacBook Air anytime soon
they're basically too busy protecting
their retina macbook pro lineup which
sucks but that's just Apple so here we
are with a 1440 by 900 panel which isn't
bad at all but if you're coming from
using a device with a really high pixel
density you're absolutely going to
notice pixels but outside of that this
is still a pretty great laptop display
pretty standard with decent brightness
and colors and viewing angles and the
whole nine I just wish it was at least
1080p whatever so the outside of this
machine is the same as the old one so
what's changed
well the story here is has well this
machine you're looking at here comes
with carrying Intel's
fourth generation Core i7 Haswell CPU
clocked at 1.7 gigahertz with the Intel
HD 5000 graphics inside and this is
really the only reason to buy this
machine over any other one now Haswell
CPUs have a seriously impressive
power and heat management system that
essentially double battery life now the
MacBook Air was already mostly battery
on the inside it's got a battery
slightly larger than a lot of other
ultrabooks measuring in at 7,000 150
milliamp hours it's pretty much the
entire bottom of the machine these days
but with the new Haswell CPUs they're
estimated to last 12 hours of use on a
single charge straight through that is
actual all-day battery life computing
with this 30 inch model with heavy
gaming or graphics work or even some
video editing which this machine can
actually handle you'll see that life
shift down to about five or six hours on
his charge straight through but lighter
not so intensive stuff this machine will
just keep going it's estimated sometimes
past 14 hours of battery remaining for
me
so that's freaking awesome for a laptop
now there's also the 11 inch Haswell
MacBook Air that my buddy Austin overide
Duncan 3 303 is reviewing so I'll link
his review down below that like button
if you want to check it out but that 11
inch air is supposed to get 9 hours on a
charge as well so you can thank Haswell
for literally changing the way we use
laptops because of that massive heat
improvement so thanks Intel now you
would think with all these power
conservation this performance would drop
through the floor well not so again
Intel to the rescue these clock speeds
are already pretty solid like we said
this is the 1.7 gigahertz model and it
benchmarks pretty well somewhere between
the latest Mac Mini and the latest iMac
which is nice so every day performance
is still snappy quick and efficient
which you would expect out of a laptop
of this price and there are also some
other internal improvements that make
that possible first of all a NATO 2.11
AC Wi-Fi receiver is now in there for
faster available wireless speeds and a
PCI based SSD delivering significantly
faster read and write speeds from the
disk when compared to a SATA based SSDs
of the older model so you're going to
get silly fast opening and closing of
apps and reading and writing them data
all that's going to happen at blazing
fast speeds thanks that pci base SSD so
all in all it just made too much sense
for Apple Apple is known for incremental
improvements and this is just the
perfect incremental improvement for the
MacBook Air for them keep the same
design the same body same materials same
manufacturing process but drop some
Intel innovation in there with some you
know PCI based SSD
and some other minor improvements and
reap the profits because everyone loves
12 hours of battery that is the main
headliner for this machine and I love it
too so it's almost as if Apple has
delivered an extended version of the
2012 MacBook Air where you get almost
the same user experience but it just
lasts for much much longer on this new
machine you're going to get a very
friendly machine as well with again that
big glass trackpad the all-metal
construction the solid build quality all
the things you would expect out of a
premium notebook over $1000 you pretty
much get it with the macbook air you can
put windows on it if you want you won't
get the same performance and you won't
get quite the same battery life but
it'll still last pretty long time like a
boss overall it's a very friendly
machine I am a fan of the PC I based
SSDs it's something I've always really
wanted in a mobile machine and now we've
got it so yeah at the end of the day
this is basically in classic Apple style
the same machine as the previous
generation with some minor tweaks inside
but that one minor tweak being the chip
ends up making a huge difference now in
terms of who would buy this machine and
who shouldn't I personally can't quite
stay with this machine because of one
thing and that's the display the display
is 1440 by 900 on a 13-inch display
which is fine that's ordinarily great
for most people
but coming from using a 2560 by 1600
display in the retina MacBook Air I
can't do it I can't switch to being able
to see pixels where I usually couldn't
so I'm going to keep sticking with the
Retina display MacBooks and I'm probably
going to be upgrading to the Haswell
retina MacBook Pro the 13-inch when that
comes out because that seems like a
logical upgrade for me because my eyes
are so used to a Retina display but
either way let me know what would you
pick would you pick a retina MacBook Pro
or would you rather have seen a retina
MacBook Air or maybe would you get this
regular MacBook Air let me know down in
the comments section right below that
like button either way thank you for
watching and I'll talk to you guys in
the neck
Aysen
