rallies from mkbhd and welcome to
another HD video this was going to be a
hardware video about the actual The
Stand I'm using right now you may or may
not have noticed it it is quite a bit
different than my old stand which was
the NZXT cryo LX
I did do an unboxing video best to check
it out this is from Han Stan's calm and
right now at the moment I do not have a
tripod so you're gonna excuse the shaky
camera work here so first of all here we
go so first of all a little branding on
the front it does say this is the eye
desk alright um there's not a whole lot
that is ridiculously unique about this
although it does have a couple of very
nice features so I'm just going to do a
rundown with you guys because I know
you've probably been waiting for this so
here we go first of all we go to the
side here you can see that this does
raise your desk
raise your laptop off the ground you get
a nice little typing angle here if you
do like typing like that value suggest
an external keyboard because this is as
low as it will go this is a 17 inch
laptop so there's a little bit of an
overhang if I pick up the camera once
again I apologize I don't have a tripod
yet but there's a little bit of an
overhang the cool thing about this is I
think the best feature about this is
that it has a USB hub in the back and
the 4 port USB hub 2.0 and powered on we
spin out to the other side it can play
around in there so that you can see
there's a little light right there
letting us know that it is powered a
green and a red light I don't want a
cord school on my kid because I have my
ipod cable I have my phone adapter I
have a whole lot of cables going on but
I did use the NZXT try OLX and that was
managed quite fun another cool feature
about this is pretty much the the whole
adjustable feature so I'm going to
change the camera angle so you guys can
see exactly how to adjust the stand
height okay so just same stand is really
easy there's a knob down here in the
bottom and actually there's a little
cord in the way but you can see that
knob right there
that knob is what we use to pull outward
and then tilt the stand up now the stand
has six vertical positions so it does go
up up up six times until it goes all the
way almost completely vertical and your
laptop will obviously be your screen
will be way far off the ground but that
is a cool feature that you can change
the laptop the height and this is you
know it's sturdy plastic you can see
this this stand is base right here that
is made of plastic but it is very sturdy
plastic so I do like the build it's very
good material so I'm just going to go
back to a head-on view of the sauce and
a throw back to the front here and I
just got to point out a few other things
the first part is you do have a little
lip on the front here now you may or may
have noticed already this does block the
touchpad so if you if you don't have an
external mouse like that ever you don't
have a pullout keyboard down here then
you're going to have problems because
you won't be able to use the quick wheel
or the quick buttons that are actually
there's me underneath via that cleats
the keyboard so do know that there's a
lip which is it is use for us dirtying
your laptop and it's not going to go
anywhere there are foam pads underneath
here so you're not your laptops not
scratched but I'm this is one thing
about this HP Pavilion is that number
one the same front reader is right here
and number two the microphone and two
headphone jacks are right under that lip
so it is a little bit an inconvenience
for people who have an HP laptop but
overall this laptop I think it's quite
nice I'm not the laptop the mastic case
or the stand from ham stands comm again
link in the description check it out
very very nice products offered at this
company's website you should definitely
go check this out but on this case again
I like I said is available for 39.99 I
should say encase this is a stand
available for $40.00 at ham stands comm
and I basically it is a very cool case
if you're looking to get something to
improve your typing angle or if you're
not planning on typing on an angle like
this then you can have your laptop
monitor actually way off the ground
quite a bit so far four miles from here
that's basically all I have to say this
is you know it's very convenient the USB
hub is obviously quite nice
I'm glad I have the USB hub and the
thing is I didn't even mention its be
catchable yes the USB hub is detachable
able to remove it from the back and you
get a little bit of more mobility and
that also is cool because there's only
one cable connecting you to the USB hub
so all you have to do if you want to go
mobile is just unplug that one USB cord
and you're completely free to go so this
