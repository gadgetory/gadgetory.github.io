welcome back to a very busy tech Tober
nearing the end but nowhere near done
this time we're coming at you with the
brand new iPhone 10 are you didn't
forget about this one did you so the
iPhone 10s and 10's max came out a
couple weeks ago and now they're in
coming slightly cheaper $750 iPhone 10
are is starting to ship this is the 256
gig red version but here's the thing the
unboxing experience is mostly the same
as the iPhone 10s so if you dig in to
get your paperwork at the top as you
expect a little red tab reveals the
Apple stickers and your Quick Start
Guide and everything and since this is a
product red phone that is donating to
AIDS research and supporting the product
red program you do get a little red
pamphlet as far as I know the other
colored iPhones don't have a colored
pamphlet and then underneath that the
rest of the accessories so the slow
charging brick the lightning cable and
the lightning headphones and the missing
dongle all of that the same as the
iPhone 10 s which means really the only
different thing is the phone in the box
and yet this thing is so red it's as far
as I can tell the same red as that last
year product red iPhone 8 that I was
raving over so the Ferrari red at the
rich red that Tesla surfboard red it's
so bright I love it
so things I will be testing for my full
review that are definitely different
from iPhone 10's as far as I know the
new screen so the sub 720p LCD that's
made all the news the RAM technically
iPhone 10 R has one gig less of RAM than
a 10 s so three gigs here that's
slightly different material choices so
this 10 R has coloured aluminum rails
instead of the stainless steel so it's
matte instead of glossy and it feels a
little bit lighter the single camera and
the color I don't even have to test the
color really but officially it is
different so you got to mention it but
the main difference really being the
screen and I'll be digging into that
pretty deep seeing if this panel is as
good as Apple says or as bad as some
YouTube videos would have you believe
and if anything else comes up during a
full review process that will be
mentioned too but that's what we know
for sure is different anyway that's
pretty much it I guess since this is a
pretty short video and there's not a
whole lot else to it I guess we might as
well toss in a little giveaway shall we
so officially here's what we'll do I'm
going to give away one iPhone 10 R to
someone one of you watching this video
right now all you have to do is be a
subscriber and leave a comment below of
which color you'd want remember there's
six of them right so black white red
coral blue or yellow one of those
naturally this video might bias you a
little bit since the red is just so
gorgeous even in video but that's up to
you you can pick the color and I'll
announce the winner on Twitter in one
week so 7 days from now to the hour you
guys will know exactly who's gonna win

same page it's international anyone with
a shipping address on planet earth that
I can get to is eligible to win that's
pretty much it best of luck and that's
it for this quick one thanks for
