with video and it's Super Bowl weekend
thumbs up either way let's go ahead and
get right start with this one so there's
been a lot of talk especially recently
in the Android community and the
smartphone community in general about
the frequency of which Android phones
are released especially here in the
United States people are actually
complaining that there are too many
Android phones being released you know
just thrown out there from all sorts of
carriers and manufacturers all over the
place there are just too many it's even
been said that and I quote there is no
right time to buy an Android phone so of
course I dived into this and I dug
really deep into this issue and I found
that people mostly have pretty good
reasons so you bought the Motorola Droid
Razr
on launch day on day one well a couple
months later CES in January in Vegas and
the Droid RAZR MAXX comes out with a
much much larger battery as an upgrade
to the Droid Razr maybe you were like me
and you bought the transformer prime TF
201 when it came out well again at CES
in January the transformer prime TF 700
T came out with an updated design higher
resolution front facing camera and a
1080p display ATM team Samsung just went
completely insane and had a samsung
galaxy s2 a samsung galaxy s2 skyrocket
and a samsung galaxy s2 skyrocket HD all
within a couple of months Wow
so yeah there are a lot of Android
phones out there and that's gotten
people to describing maybe
three-month-old amazing Android phones
we using almost vague or meaningless
words like outdated or just as old
phones so what does this actually mean
so here's the thing your phone doesn't
just stop working when a new phone comes
out it's your phone's not going to just
explode or turn into a brick or just
leave you because a newer version of it
has been released your current phone
loses no functionality it's still the
awesome phone it was when you bought it
and nothing's changed nothing's actually
becoming obsolete here and if you look
up the definition of the word obsolete
you'll probably agree with me nothing is
actually becoming obsolete
even when newer devices and technologies
are released everything that was good
about the phone that made you buy it is
still good about that phone now I think
this becomes a little bit clearer to
understand
when you shift and look at it like cars
let's say you bought a brand new Ferrari
f430 the day it came out like a boss
couple months later Ferrari puts out the
Ferrari f430 skit area and you see a
skit area driving down the street as
you're in your Ferrari and you're like
wow this makes this feel so outdated it
just feels so old now but you're still
driving a brand new Ferrari
same thing with dare I say it ladies say
this is my girlfriend she's really hot
just imagine and she's really good at
everything and she's awesome
Wow now I think you can see what I mean
the real issue with phones being
released so quickly is development and
support and a word that's tossed around
a lot
fragmentation the development issue is
the fact that yeah these phones are
really really different and while they
do defer on the outside they also differ
on the inside and that means that apps
that are available on certain phones are
not available on certain others which
means that there are going to be app
developers out there not to call anyone
lazy but yeah they're going to say screw
that screw developing six different
versions of my app just to work on the
phones out there I'll just develop one
version of my app for the iPhone for
support this has been said before it's
often said that when you buy a first
generation device you're really beta
testing your device will inevitably get
a few updates maybe even get an OS
upgrade and maybe get some behind the
scenes changes like a firmware update
but in the end it'll settle down to
being the cool stable awesome device
that you just bought and fragmentation
is a word that people like to throw
around a lot to describe Android but it
really ties back to the development
issue where there are yes different
devices would say different screen
resolutions different OS versions
different skins on top of them and
that's really what differentiates them
all but the bottom line is phone
manufacturers are not going to stop
making so many phones sure some random
marketing rep from HTC you may say oh
yeah
yeah we're gonna slow down phones this
year for 2012 less releases really truth
is these companies
by the quarterly report and they are
never going to slow down so much that
they make less money than they do now
because in the end yeah
finance is the main goal of these
manufacturers they're going to take the
open source OS that is Android and
they're going to manufacture their
hardware that is their smartphones and
they're going to shove it in cram it in
and throw it out the window and keep
producing those over and over and over
and over and over again the more
different options they can offer they
figure the more money in their pocket
and that's not going to change anytime
soon if manufacturers did suddenly
magically slow down these devices buy a
lot maybe one device per year think
about it first of all that'd be a lot
less money for them second of all you'd
stop getting those incremental upgrades
so remember how the Droid RAZR MAXX was
a much larger battery for the Droid Razr
you wouldn't see those if they only
release one device per year they put out
the Droid Razr and for some reason it
pisses people off that Motorola listened
to you guys and you wanted a longer
battery life in a phone and they said
alright well we'll have this Droid Razr
come out and there you go
but that would sort of cease if you only
had one device per year and second
companies would be less likely to take
risks if they're putting all their eggs
into one basket once a year
so you'd less likely to see phones like
the razor that are so crazy in their
design and so revolutionary you wouldn't
even get a razor max or a razor at all
so yeah it seems kind of silly but the
adjustment isn't going to go unhappen on
the manufacturer side it's going to have
to come from us on the consumer side but
it seems kind of silly to complain
though doesn't it like unless you have
some sort of inferiority complex or if
you you absolutely must have the best
phone out to feel good about yourself as
a person or if your phone is some sign
of some sort of status symbol yeah that
might get some heat but is that why
people get mad at new releases like
screw evolution right if if I buy a
phone then manufacturers should just
stop making new phones until my contract
is up and I can afford a new one yeah no
sorry No so here's my advice because
because I get a lot of people asking me
what Android phone should I get pick the
set of features that you actually want
in a phone so if you describe your dream
phone you want a phone with a big screen
look at the big screen phones if you
want a phone running Android look at the
egg screened Android phones say you want
a phone with a big battery life look at
that - if you want to play a certain
game use a certain app have certain
features put that together match it up
and look at the phones
that will match your criteria watch some
reviews play with it in a store borrow
it from your friend that might already
have it you know and once you've
narrowed it down pick your favorite and
that should probably be the best device
for you so if I had to say what device
is for you if I don't know anything
about you that is a process I would
suggest you get the device that fits you
best and you'll be happy with it because
you made that correct choice I
personally really liked all the choices
that I get with the multitude of Android
devices available for me to pick from
but I know a lot of you guys feel
differently you don't really like that
so in the end what do you think is there
never a right time to buy an Android
device or is there never a wrong time to
buy an Android device it's been mkbhd
thanks for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
