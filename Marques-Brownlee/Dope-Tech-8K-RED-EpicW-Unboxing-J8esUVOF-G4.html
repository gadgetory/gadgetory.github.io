alright quick breakdown on the timeline
of red cameras every year or so they
come out with an upgrade and they seem
to swap back and forth between a new
body and then a new sensor inside so new
body new sensor inside new body new
sensor so the latest from the bleeding
edge of high-end cine cameras is Reds
new helium sensor you may have heard
about it I may have teased it in a
previous video but this is a super 35 8k
sensor so right off the bat it's super
overkill for YouTube but I've been
shooting red for a while and this stuff
gets me excited so the helium sensor
will come in two different red bodies in
the weapon which I've showed you did a
whole video on it check it out and the
epic W the epic W is a brand new
addition to Red's lineup so yes this is
the first time you're seeing it anywhere
this is your exclusive first look and
for those who have seen my weapon video
it'll look very familiar
it sits pretty comfortably between the
lower-end raven and scarlet w and the
highest end weapon but still has most of
the benefits of a helium weapon just add
a bit of a lower price so you still get
the modular system that's such a big
part of the read experience
you still get compatibility with every
single one of the accessories that works
with the weapon and any other read and
you're getting the exact same helium
sensor that's in any other helium camera
so the 8k resolution the awesome dynamic
range the red code raw and Reds
incredible color science but in a
different body and like I said in the
weapon video the cameras at this level
are like computers attached to sensors
at this point so the different body of
the epic W actually has different
internals different processing power
it's a different computer and so that's
where it's different from the weapons so
this epic W maxes out at 30 frames per
second at 8 K while the weapon will go
up to 75 frames per second and it's not
quite able to shoot at the lowest
compression ratios the way that weapon
can and the body the body is actually
made of this aluminium alloy so it's all
metal all around as you can see where
the weapon is made of carbon fiber so
the weight is actually different that's
a big draw for a lot of people and if
you're wondering what footage from the
new helium sensor will look like well to
start
if you're looking at it now I'm actually
shooting this video on a freshly
upgraded helium weapon
so the maxed out carbon-fiber beast I've
showed you guys in previous videos is
now rocking the new 8k sensor and so far
it is awesome
now if you're wondering why you can't
tell the difference right away from
previous videos it's because number one
this is YouTube every clip from these
cameras looks ten times better on your
computer before it's uploaded and
compressed for streaming on the Internet
that's true with any camera and number
two this is published in 4k not 8k
what's funny is the sensor and these
cameras are so new that most video
editing programs don't even support 8k
edits and exports Final Cut Pro is not
really fully ready for it yet adobe has
a beta of premiere just to handle the
footage from this camera and youtube
itself doesn't even let you publish 8k
for the most part 4k is the maximum
resolution for an h.264 video file so
the footage you're seeing was shot in 6
K turns out Final Cut Pro can handle
that and all edited and exported into a
4k video file so you're watching the 4k
final result if that I mean most people
don't watch in 4k anyway so you can only
kind of get the full benefits on your
end to this point but in theory there
are a couple more benefits to helium
that I'll notice as I stood shooting
with it more the biggest one besides
just resolution is the much better
performance in low-light and that's
always been the thing about these red
cameras is they're really not made for
low-light I mean they'll perform well as
far as cinema and TV standards but if
you're looking to constantly be shooting
in really dark environments then you can
do better helium is supposed to
dramatically improve that which you
wouldn't think with the pixels actually
being so much smaller but hey the video
you're watching now is not super well
lit but it's mostly kind of spotlights
in a storefront and it turned out pretty
good and I'm already comfortable with
much higher ISO footage like 2000 and
4000 and higher where I wasn't with
older red so that's a good sign and
there's also likely the updated colour
science still the incredible dynamic
range so yeah I'm psyched to get out and
start shooting the world and the tech in
it on helium in 8k I probably won't
publish an 8k for a long while I mean no
one has an 8k display right now let
alone a 4k display but we can shoot 8k
now for the same reason that people shot
4k Cup
years ago to publish in 1080p for the
extra sharpness for the ability to crop
and zoom without losing detail for more
data points for stuff like motion
tracking graphics stabilization things
like that geeky stuff you don't have to
worry about that for the most part only
thing you have to worry about is that
these new sensors will continue helping
in the quest to shoot the most realistic
looking videos possible to help you
choose what tech to buy then I think we
can all appreciate that thanks for
watching I'll talk to you guys the next
one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
