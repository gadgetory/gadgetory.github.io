hey what's up guys I'm QB HD here and in
my last video and that WWDC recap we
talked a little bit about the brand new
announced iMac pro and I kind of
mentioned it possibly being a little bit
of a trap and I want to elaborate on
that a little bit so keep in mind this
is a brand new product and it was
announced but we're not actually going
to see it until about six months down
the road it's going to be in December of
this year
pretty rare move from Apple but this is
until then everything we know is
definitely true about the new iMac Pro
so first off it's going to look from the
outside like any other iMac but space
gray so this behind me is the brand new
2017 KB Lake 27-inch iMac and it's a
pretty high-end machine in a lot of ways
by itself the iMac pro takes this shell
this exact same body paints it matte
black or Space Gray if you want to call
it that and completely redoes all the
inside so for the iMac pro CPU you'll be
able to pick between an 8 core 10 core
or 18 core workstation grade Intel Xeon
CPU this will have turbo speeds up to
four point five gigahertz out the box
absolute monster chips it'll also have a
choice between AMD Radeon Vega
workstation GPUs which aren't even
announced yet this event was basically
an announcement for these graphics cards
because you can't find them anywhere
else it'll start at 32 gigs of ECC
memory and will go up to 128 gigs of ram
and it's all flash storage SSB only so
it'll start at one terabyte of flash
storage and go up to four terabytes of
flash storage and it's fast flash
storage at about three gigabytes per
second throughput so awesome there and
what's really interesting is the iMac
Pro will have this new completely
redesigned thermal architecture to make
this all possible sounds a lot like the
trashcan Mac Pro lots of workstation
parts crammed into a small space with a
completely new thermal architecture and
new fans to make it all possible and
then of course up front it'll also have
this updated 5k display it's updated
meaning it's a little bit brighter up to
500 nits it supports the entire p3 color
gamut it's already a great display it's
a little glossy for my tastes and we'll
get to that in a little bit but it's
already a pretty great 5k panel and then
the ports on the back of the iMac are
updated as well so you get your
headphone jack you get an SD card slot 4
USB 3 ports 4 Thunderbolt 3 USB see
ports and a 10 gig Ethernet port and
back there you can also see the new
events on the back that aren't on the
backs of normal IMAX so some serious
ventilation to go along with this new
cooling system and then of the nice
little touch the iMac Pro comes with
some exclusive Space Gray accessories a
matte grade trackpad a matte gray magic
keyboard with a number-pad and a grey
magic mouse to top it all off so should
you buy it who is going to buy an iMac
prep well first off this iMac this
highest-end regular 2017 iMac is already
a pretty high-end machine in a lot of
ways like we've said and it's probably
more power than most enthusiasts or
casual users just buying an iMac ever
really need the iMac pro leapfrogs all
of this and it actually even leapfrogs
the current trashcan Mac Pro in terms of
power but then you have to expect a new
modular Mac Pro coming next year to even
leapfrog that and it's going to be
modular so it's going to be way more
upgradable down the line better
expandability upgrade ability
customization etc and the iMac pro isn't
coming out till December like we said so
by the time that comes out and you're
getting your hands on it the new modular
Mac Pro will be right around the corner
and then second off Apple's made it
pretty clear that the vast majority of
people that are buying Apple desktops
Apple Mac desktops or buying iMacs and
that makes perfect sense to me what
other choices do you have they have the
Mac Mini pretty small not that powerful
and not very popular you might have
forgotten it existed and then you have
Mac Pro a little more niche a little
more expensive not a lot of people
buying it so of course if you're buying
a Mac for your desktop you're buying an
iMac so with that logic Apple said
alright you know what we want to make an
even more powerful desktop for all these
people who are pushing iMac to its
limits you want an even more powerful
workstation machine that's where the
idea of I Mac Pro was born but the thing
is those aren't the actual professionals
most of the time and the people who
chose the Mac Pro over the iMac chose it
for a certain reason and those same
people are most likely going to choose
the new Mac Pro over the iMac Pro again
so basically the question is what buyer
is there is there a buyer that's going
to want a more high-end machine a
workstation grade Mac that's more
powerful than the current iMac but can't
wait for the new Mac Pro to come out a
pretty impatient one basically and
that's
kind of why it seems like a trap
basically I Mac Pro is in this really
specific narrow target demographic
then it's awkward space above the
current iMac but where people are not
getting the future Mac Pro they're kind
of still okay with the all-in-one design
I'm sure this thing will be great for
all sorts of content creators for
youtubers or for like photographers and
people who like the current iMac and
we're getting away with using that for
all their editing that's still a great
machine it's still a great display all
that still remains but you have to know
if you're in that target demographic or
if you're just too impatient to wait for
the new Mac Pro this thing will be an
absolute beast I have no doubts about
that that's supported by everything we
see on paper the specs are awesome but
the biggest downside for me with this
thing is of course that it's not really
upgradable just like the current IMAX it
doesn't appear to have a Ram hatch like
previous IMAX have so that's not
upgradable and iFixit says that you can
technically get to the CPU and change it
if you want but most people won't be
doing that
so you're expected to live with the
specs that you buy for the entire life
of the machine and that's what separates
it from the new modular Mac Pro that
we're still expecting the 5k display is
great you know but what if I want to
upgrade to a not glossy display or maybe
an 8k display a year or two down the
road you know the GPUs are great but
what if in a year or two GPUs I've
gotten way better and I want to upgrade
it to a newer better compatible one it's
just that all in ones like the iMac have
to be replaced all in one and it's kind
of hard to get rid of an iMac Pro that
starts at five thousand bucks when a
couple new GPUs come out and that's just
the starting price at $49.99 but with
anyone guess what the highest end fully
loaded iMac Pro will cost my guess will
be it or be around $9,000 that's my
guess maybe you can leave your guesses
in the comments section below but that's
pretty much it that's the iMac pro
explained in a nutshell we have six
months to see what it actually looks
like until then thank you for watching
talk to guys the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
