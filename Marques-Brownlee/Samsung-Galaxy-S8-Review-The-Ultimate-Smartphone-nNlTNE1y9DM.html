couple years ago in 2014 Samsung made a
surprise product announcement called the
Galaxy Note edge with this crazy display
hanging off one side and for a random
unexpected phone it got a lot of
attention since then that product has
evolved again and again into Samsung's
entire flagship lineup which brings us
to the galaxy s 8 so this new phone
looks awesome and that's a hallmark
headlining feature is how good it looks
and how well it's designed and then of
course being a flagship it has all the
bleeding-edge specs inside and the
hardware you'd expect from a premium
Android phone so is this the complete
package like the ultimate smartphone
almost it's almost it's almost there so
let me start by saying I love this
phone's build like pretty much
everything about the outside of this
phone is premium and well built and
awesome the display up front sort of
melts over both sides and it does so
smoothly into the back frame while last
year's phone did it more sharply and if
you want to talk about modern or about
the future of smart phone design this
year has been a shift to these really
tall displays making these slightly
taller candy bar shaped phones now the
best part of these super thin bezels on
all sides is that the footprint of the
phone shrinks a lot so the five point
eight inch and 6.2 inch displays
respectively on the s8 and si plus don't
feel like huge phones even though they
have huge screen in fact the SI I think
is a great size because it's so narrow
I might have big hands but I think even
anyone with regular hands can reach
across to the other side of this display
just maybe not all the way up to the top
I think the best indicator for this is
the fingerprint sensor obviously there's
no more room to put it up at the front
of the phones so they moved it around to
the back but instead of putting it
somewhere in the middle of the back they
put it right up there next to the camera
now with most backs fingerprint sensors
they're a little lower on the phone for
reach ability just the way you hold the
phone makes it easier now I think the
top fingerprint sensor might look a
little bit better in some cases but it
is definitely harder to reach even with
my larger hand i legit dislike this
location i hold the phone with my right
hand so i'm reaching the max
them distance up and over across the
phone over across the camera with my
finger and often I don't quite make it
or I touch the camera glass instead or I
only partially cover the fingerprint
sensor and the reader doesn't unlock it
doesn't work so this is through a week
of using the phone I'm sure I could get
used to it eventually but for most
people this just makes it a two-handed
phone and then you can end up just using
the phone with two hands all the time
now to be fair the glass over the camera
actually does a good job deflecting
smudges that come from
Aaron fingerprint unlocks but honestly a
clever way to get past this is with a
case or better yet a skin actually so
this is the skin from dbrand
and not only is it better for gripping
this all glass zone but the tiny depth
difference actually lets you better
distinguish the singer print sensor from
the camera on the back so fun fact
highly recommended
either way Samsung's word on this is now
they provide you with a bunch of other
ways to unlock your phone biometrically
that don't use a fingerprint sensor
mainly being the iris scanner and the
face unlock now I didn't expect to like
this answer mainly because the face
unlock can literally be tricked with a
picture of you so that's no good and the
iris scanner usually requires you
holding it up at a weird angle that you
don't normally hold your phone
which is a little awkward but this iris
scanner I think it might have a wider
angle lens or the sensor has improved
something about it is better because I
don't quite have to hold it up that
awkward angle anymore and it does a
pretty good job of unlocking my phone
when I'm not like trying to I set it up
I didn't expect to use it but a lot of
times I just hold the phone up and start
using it and it would unlock for me so
that actually turned out to be a
pleasant surprise
either way aside from the awkward
tallness of the phone and a fingerprint
sensor the galaxy estate is the best
industrial design of any smartphone and
a long time in my opinion even though
there are other phones out now and
coming soon that do the tall display
thin bezels thing you still got to add
on all metal and glass still has
expandable storage through a micro SD
card slot still fully water and dust
resistant ip68 certified so you can
spill water on it and it's cool it still
has USB type-c with quick charge still
has wireless charging still keeps the
headphone jack and the speaker is below
average and downward facing it might be
the worst part of the phones build but
that comes with the territory when
there's no room on the front and you
kind of want to water sale your phone so
back to the screen it's incredible it is
I would say the best display on any
small
phone again it gets extremely bright so
it's visible outdoors or whenever and
it's an OLED so of course it has
fantastic color and contrast ratios and
dynamic range and it's super high
resolution too we're talking 29 60 by
1440 on both phones actually so all that
makes for an awesome media experience a
great web browsing experience and great
scrolling through Twitter and Instagram
and seeing a lot of stuff at once
experience and all of Samsung's software
obviously supports it perfectly now not
every app in the App Store fills the
display right now right out the box like
a lot of games especially will have to
be updated or may just never fully
support that so you'll either have the
black bars on either side or you can
punch in and of course most videos also
are an in this aspect ratio' either so
when watching a video you'll get the
black bars as well unless you hit the
button in the software to punch in a
little bit but then you lose some of the
frame so it's kind of your call it's
give a little take a little for the
slightly taller display but overall I'll
take it I think the screen is awesome
and with its curved edges and curved
corners I'm a fan and then there is the
inside of the phone and since this is a
flagship Samsung is again pushing things
to the highest end of what's available
except for one particular area but
there's some pretty high-end specs in
here Snapdragon 835 a dream of 540 GPU 4
gigabytes of RAM at least 64 gigs of
storage which like we said is expandable
and this is the first phone to ship with
Bluetooth 5.0 which I made an entire
separate video about that just dropped
highly recommend that so the performance
aspect is pretty much taken care of the
same way it always is great specs great
speed and animations out the box but
nobody has used this phone for a year or
two yet so we'll have to see how the
Samsung software ages and that's just
what it is it's Samsung software on top
of Android 7.0 and it has its pros and
cons actually like that it's adapted to
be more like nougat with the swiping app
drawer and the cleaner overall look
especially of the Settings app but it's
really obviously still Samsung eyes with
all the colors and some interesting
quirks here and there with the paginate
adapt drawer and a couple extra
animations nothing too crazy or extra
but it's not necessarily better than not
having it the edge screen has gotten
better there's now a couple features
like from the note with smart select and
the jiff maker where you can select part
of your screen to make an animation
or even take round screenshots all kinds
of stuff that we didn't have before so
you know those interesting stuff you can
put in there I really like the extended
screenshot feature where you can take a
screenshot but then it gives you the
option to scroll down and extend that as
much as you want so I'm really glad that
made its way back into this zone but
yeah overall it's familiar to anyone
who's used a samsung phone in the last
two or three years both aesthetically
and functionally now one of the biggest
new features in the software Department
of the Galaxy s8 is called Bixby you may
have heard of it it's the virtual
assistant that's built for this phone
that just does a lot of what Google
assistant does now the circumstances
surrounding it are interesting because
Samsung put a dedicated button on the
side of the phone just for launching it
a big speed button now a lot of people
didn't like this for fair reason whether
they didn't like Bixby or didn't want it
so they found a way to use an app to
remap the Dixie button to do whatever
they want robably should have been in
the Samsung settings in the first place
you can make it the default for the
button sure but in in regions where
people don't use Bixby or Bixby's not
supported or language supports not there
yet or it's incomplete let them go on
the settings and remap it to whatever
they want it could be a legitimate
useful separate feature well yesterday
Samsung actually patched that up and
blocked any remapping of that button at
all on the Galaxy S 8 so it's definitely
now just a bixby button so
understandably again people got kind of
angry about that nobody wants accidental
triggers of the app they want to never
use but a couple of people were asking
well hey what if what if Bixby is
actually really great what if Vic's T is
amazing what if it's better than Google
so I gave it that chance
I didn't remap my Bixi button and I was
using Bixby alongside this phone for the
past week and I'll give you that so
first of all the voice feature is not
activated yet and it won't get added
till later this year so that's a pretty
rough start but aside from that it does
show you some cards your gallery your
upcoming calendar events maybe some
weather some frequent contacts but then
that pretty quickly devolved into a
bunch of samsung apps like themes and
wallpapers and Flipboard and a bunch of
stuff I don't use so really it's working
in catch-up mode to be able to do all
that Google does with Gmail and
navigation cards and flight status and
all that now the one place that did you
some interesting stuff is in the camera
app in the viewfinder there's a big C
button that if you press it it can
recognize images in the viewfinder and
search for them whether it's images or
if it's a product it will get you Amazon
search to maybe buy it I think Google
Goggles try this a couple years ago and
with Bixby it was about the same pretty
hit or miss sometimes they would get it
and will be pretty useful especially
when there's a lot of text to it that it
can recognize it just searches that text
so it makes sense that it would work
there other times when I thought it
might get it nothing came up or it got
it wrong with this Bluetooth speaker for
example sometimes I got nothing
sometimes it thought it was a baseball
hat I don't know not sure how to get it
to work better but no dice so aside from
this biggest new software feature being
kind of a swing and a Miss on this phone
I'm totally fine with the software on
the s8 it's cleaner it's much more fine
it's out of the way I like it now the
camera on the back is has also been a
bit of a source of discussion at first
it wasn't really talked about and we
kind of assumed it was literally the
exact same camera as last year I has the
same specs no dual cameras like some of
its rivals it's a 12 megapixel F 1.7
aperture dual pixel autofocus optical
image stabilization top-notch stuff
again
but yes same as we've already seen but
turns out this is a slightly updated
sensor with newer optics so the images
will look slightly different from the
galaxy s7 honestly most of the
difference will come from better image
processing but the photos and 4k videos
from galaxy s 8 look fantastic as you
would expect maybe leave a comment if
you want a direct comparison to its
predecessor but you can imagine you can
see the samples great detail great
contrast color and sharpness are
excellent and pretty aggressive auto HDR
modes so dynamic range is also pretty
wide rarely blows out the highlights
like a lot of other phones would so of
course it's a pleasure to take photos
and videos with such a nice screen as a
viewfinder
we often say the best camera is the one
you have with you I think this is no
exception with this phone it'll be one
of the best cameras you can put in your
pocket again this year now battery life
is one area where I would have wanted
just a little bit more now this is
Samsung we're talking about here and
they just had one of their phones last
year literally start exploding when they
tried to push the battery to the limit
so I almost can't blame them for playing
it safe this year but yeah the 3000
milliamp hour battery on the Galaxy s8 I
was testing pretty much barely got me
through the end of the day maybe 10%
left when I'm done and to be fair I'm
pretty heavy on it I use it a lot bright
screen lots of video watching taking
pictures etc for the review but there
are phones with definitely better
battery life as I suspected the upside
though is that it charges ridiculous
we fast I had a night where I went to
sleep with 22% and I woke up in the
morning with 8% so that's pretty
terrible standby time I was going to
start the day with the battery dead but
I threw it on the charger for about an
hour left with a hundred percent battery
no problem so you kind of pick your
battles there Samsung just played it
safe with the battery so at the end of
the day the Galaxy s8 is awesome and
it's so Samsung that this this project
was born from the crazy like backburner
pet project that was the Galaxy Note
edge and now every phone like this has
this crazy edge display and I'm glad
they keep doing that though and you got
to give Samsung credit for making a
phone that can stand out for how good it
looks
in an era well this little mini era
where so many phones are accused of all
looking the same this one actually does
stand out in a pretty awesome way and I
like that a lot of that there may be
little things you don't like about it
little unmapped abou buttons little
software quirks here and there maybe the
speaker is not the best but as a
complete package this is an awesome
phone I recommend it I've said the word
awesome so many times you probably can
understand that I like this already and
I recommend it I've links below for
other stuff you want to check out but
that's pretty much it
thank you for watching talk to guys the
next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
