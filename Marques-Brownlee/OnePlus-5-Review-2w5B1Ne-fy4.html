this is the one plus five and just like
every smartphone in the past three years
there's been leaks there's been rumors
there's been renders there's been
speculation but now it's real it's here
in the flesh and this is everything you
need to know so one plus is history is
actually pretty limited and they're a
young small company and because they're
a small company they actually don't have
the access to all this super high-end
tech that the apples and Samsung's and
Motorola's and HTC is of the world do
that's a disadvantage but the advantage
to being a small company is you can
actually listen to what your core fan
base and what your core customers
actually want and try to give them that
exact product so one plus 5 is another
incremental improvement over 1 plus 3t
with a few big bullet point changes and
a couple minor touch-ups so first thing
you'll notice is the insane specs you
can tell it's an enthusiast brand here
snapdragon 835 Adreno 546 or 8 gigabytes
of ram at 64 or 128 gigabytes of storage
a dual camera system on the back 16 and
20 megapixel cameras bluetooth 5.0 a
3300 milliamp hour battery and a 5.5
inch 1080p AMOLED display and of course
an updated unibody metal design okay so
not bad let's break it all down the
all-new design is what's turning heads
this time you saw the renders and then
you saw all the replies you probably saw
all the YouTube comments
Oh from the back it looks like an iPhone
they're copying Apple they've become a
copycat company I don't see I only agree
with some of this I mean obviously the
render is when we saw them from that one
angle that obviously looks like an
iPhone because it's got the dual camera
system up in the top left corner okay I
get that but honestly if you look at the
whole entire body of the phone it does
resemble some other phones even more so
than this one seriously how are these
not the same phone if they've kept a lot
of the design cues from previous one
cell phones from the three and the three
T with you know the alert slider of
course
and the ports on the bottom and USB
type-c it's kind of like a Frankenstein
smartphone design pulling parts from a
bunch of different places but then again
how much do you actually look at the
back of your phone I mean honestly it
actually has to feel good more than has
to look good and this one does it's
seven and a half millimeters thin it's
got all these rounded sides it's all
metal but you don't have to look at it
as much as you have to feel it and the
one plus five is a good feeling phone
they kept that alert slider which I like
and always got used to pretty quickly
and of course they kept the fingerprint
reader up at the front the same like
last year in the year before same size
same position also the design is kind of
limited because the only colors you can
actually get this phone in are literally
black and almost black which I love
matte black that's great but obviously
if you want some variety you can grab a
skin I'll link to these below it's a D
brand skin and that's easily my favorite
way to add color to it without adding
the bulk of a case I highly recommend
them so this does mean you're not
getting the big bezel if display is that
a lot of phones have been moving to this
year and that we expected of the new
iPhone and the new pixel etc we still
have some pretty thin side bezels here
but it's definitely not quite the same
effect actually found it interesting
that in the Verge's exclusive video of
like the making of this phone that they
dropped yesterday they actually admitted
like they would have liked to have done
something like an infinity display or a
bezel the screen but they just don't
have the tech to do it that's another
disadvantage of being a small company
now the dual camera system on the back
before we even get to photo quality is
already pretty interesting first of all
it's it's the headlining new feature
it's on the box right twice so it's
clearly what they want you to focus on
no pun intended but it is a 16 megapixel
F 1.7 primary camera with electronic
image stabilization and then a 20
megapixel F 2.6 telephoto camera as a
secondary on a paper that looks pretty
good and then when you open up the new
camera app you'll notice it is a blatant
copy of the iPhone camera app no doubt
about that the 1 X 2 2 X button for
switching between the lenses is their
settings in the strip on the Left
shutter button on the right it's pretty
basic and then the slider of course
between the One X and the 2 X I'm
zooming in it's definitely a copy here
and no one can really deny that here's
the thing I've always said I don't
really mind if you copy stuff but if
you're going to copy something copy the
good stuff so if you're going to copy
the iPhone one
best and most popular phones out there
then yeah sure copied the camera copy
the fingerprint reader don't copy the
bad stuff don't copy like Siri or
something takes B so this one X 2 2 X
button and the slider and everything in
the camera it's kind of the best way to
do it so I don't mind not being a copy
at all so how are the photos well
they're pretty good there's no doubt
that the sensor is capable of some
pretty great clean photos again I wish
it had optical image stabilization but
essentially this camera is a hit or miss
experience I've been taking photos with
this camera for more than a week now and
in just like everyday scenarios and a
lot of them turn out really nice some of
them though you'll notice turn out a
little weird dynamic range is pretty
much always great snapdragon 835 can
handle taking multiple exposures at the
same time so you'd expect it to be great
and detail is pretty much always on
point the center of the frame and
whatever's in focus is always sharp
colors and image processing were pretty
average I feel like nothing was pushed
too far in contrast of saturation except
maybe the Reds a little bit because
sometimes they got oversaturated but
otherwise it's pretty subjective whether
you like the look of a photo or not I
think objectively it'll score high on
camera benchmark tests because it's very
fast very sharp and has huge dynamic
range but side-by-side with the same
shot from pixel or an iPhone it could be
a toss-up which is quite good for a
phone at this price and then there's the
portrait mode from the secondary
telephoto camera
honestly overall this wasn't any better
than the same attempts from the iPhone 7
plus but also not worse kind of
struggles with complex edges but for the
most part it does a good job blurring
background obviously it does a much
better job on humans than it does on
less predictable less portrait subjects
and it still has some weird halo effects
near the edges but just overall doesn't
quite match having a naturally shallow
depth-of-field obviously so if you're
into it you can use it
I think it'll get better with time with
software updates like apples has you
know apples was awful when it first came
out and was in beta but it's learned and
it's gotten better over time with
portraits and I think this one will too
but right now it's right in line with
what we've already seen so nothing's
super new here also you might be
wondering why the secondary telephoto
sensor with the worst aperture gets the
20 megapixel sensor while the primary
gets the 16 megapixel but their logic to
that is pretty simple it's that when
you're doing all that zooming and you go
way zoomed in you're using all the data
from the telephoto sensor so
you want it to be a higher resolution so
make sense so beyond the design and the
camera and the specs a couple more minor
things are new and a lot of the rest is
the same stuff we've seen from previous
one plus phones it's great stuff but the
same stuff so battery here is 3300
milliamp hours so not bigger it's
actually 100 million powers smaller than
the 3t but the battery life is about the
same alas comfortably all day thanks to
the chip and the display and that
display that 1080p AMOLED display this
is probably the thing that's going to
get looked at as the biggest downside of
a phone when you compare it to the more
expensive flagships but those are all
the phones that enthusiasts are also
considering buying so you kind of have
to note those all have 1440p displays or
higher so it's really easy to say oh
this is 1080p - must be awful but I'd
always challenge those people to really
look at the display and tell if it
really does look that much worse I mean
when I first got it first took out the
Box when it was brand new didn't even
look at the spec sheet and try to just
look at it and tell if I could see if
it's a 1080p display or did they finally
move to 1440p and it took me more than
just a glance so it's a pretty good
display gets bright enough has
pitch-black blacks from being AMOLED etc
it's good and then of course that 1080p
display also means performance is a plus
a Snapdragon 835 with the audrina 540
and eight gigs of ram of course all
pushing near stock Android on a 1080p
display it better not hiccup this thing
flies through Android and that's its
biggest asset I think super smooth
performance tons of apps stay in memory
for a long time haven't had any memory
leak issues and that's credit to oneplus
keeping the same software philosophy
again near stock Android with a couple
of improvements no skin really no big
overlay just a couple tweaks thrown in
here and there in the settings that they
believe will improve the experience so
you can do things like switch between
the off screen or on-screen buttons
again with one plus five you can still
mess with the shelf to the left of the
home screen by adding widgets to it or
messing with the built-in widgets that
one plus includes or you can disable it
completely your call there's also now a
gaming do not disturb mode which halts
all banner notifications from popping up
when certain apps like games are open
the camera app now has a pro mode which
lets you go full-on with manual mode for
every
thing you know aperture focus distance
white balance ISO etc and it shoots raw
and it even has the level and a live
histogram for exposure
the extended screenshot mode is pretty
cool you start the extended screenshot
mode and it literally starts scrolling
infinitely until you tell it to stop and
then that's where the screenshot ends
it's pretty intuitive and it's just kind
of fun to watch so well done - charging
still awesome so if you're a super heavy
user and you get through this whole
thing in a day it recharges as fast as
any other smartphone out there bluetooth
5.0 is onboard NFC is not skipped this
time the vibration motor is a lot
stronger and louder and more noticeable
so if you're into that that's important
and the microphones are also improved
now - so for recording video and super
loud environments these will do better
so it was the oneplus 5 worth your money
well if you can get over the design if
you're not one of those people who just
wants to say looks like an iPhone if you
can get over that then yeah this is
definitely a great phone there's not a
whole lot that you can get with a
snapdragon 835 and eight gigs of ram and
near stock android so if you can get
over the design and not having an
infinity display I think this is going
to be a great phone for the money and
I'll give it a thumbs up don't get one
if you can I think you'll enjoy it
that's pretty much it thank you for
watching that's not the as the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
