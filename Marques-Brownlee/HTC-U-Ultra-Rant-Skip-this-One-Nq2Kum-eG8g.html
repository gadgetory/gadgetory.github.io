this is the brand new HTC u ultra and it
is definitely the shiniest phone of all
time and the tablets also be HTC's first
big smartphone of 2017 and coming to the
US with a price tag of $749 so this is
definitely a high-end supply ship
smartphone and people who buy seven
hundred dollar Android smartphones
these are the pickiest of the bunch that
is the biggest enthusiast people who
want the biggest baddest phone they can
possibly get so this seems to be what
HTC is setting the tone with those
people with so it's rockin pretty
high-end specs the Snapdragon 820 won
three Juno 530 GPU four gigs of RAM and
quality materials all around I mean you
haven't seen many phones like this that
are basically a mirror finish on the
back it's glass and metal it's got the
HTC skin over Android 7.0 some sweet
colors are available and the cherry on
top is of course how great this thing
looks so this thing might be a sleeper
of a great phone but the more I look
into it the more I use this thing the
more I understand the u ultra the more I
realize this seems to be a really poor
use of space this is a big phone I mean
you look at its footprint compared to
things like the iPhone 7 plus the Galaxy
Note 7 and even the pixel XL which
stands for extra large and it's bigger
than all of those and even others with
even smaller displays it's bigger than
all of them and it's still eight
millimeters thick so it's also
definitely not trying to be a super thin
phone in any way either so it seems like
there should be all the room in the
world to throw in every possible
flagship feature and perk right we've
probably already realized this even if
it's in your head without me saying it
the back of this phone definitely
resembles another certain rivals
flagship not the galaxy s7 the galaxy s6
back when there is a big ol hump on the
back for the camera on the galaxy s6
that's when it looked the most likely
you ultra but of course the next year
Samsung made the phone a little bit
thicker with all its new upgrades and
bigger battery etc and ended up with a
much smaller camera hump on the back
there should be no need for such a big
hump on an even bigger phone of the U
ultra so the
bump in an already huge phone to me
seems like a poor use of space and for
the record just having a camera bump
isn't always a big deal but on the you
ultra it is and then there's a headphone
jack or the lack of a headphone jack
ya know headphone jack at all in this
huge phone now I understand USB type-c
is great and it's the future and
everything but Apple's main reason for
getting rid of the headphone jack in the
iPhone besides courage was to save
precious space in such a compact
interior of a phone other manufacturers
have sense continued putting headphone
jacks on their phones because they don't
need that space and the Portland quite
here yet an HTC you definitely could
have also but you didn't for some reason
seems like a poor user space and then
the battery the HTC u ultra has a 3000
milliamp hour battery which doesn't seem
that bad but for context yes something's
a little bit off here you would think
that a phone this huge and this thick
with this much internal space would have
all the room in the world for maybe a
two day battery life maybe the biggest
non removable battery they could
possibly sit but that was a missed
opportunity here and this phone is stuck
with average battery life at best seems
like a poor use of space and even if I
get a little picky these these buttons
down here at the bottom of the phone
have some pretty small touch targets and
I can't help but think that something
just looks a little bit off about them a
bit out of place to the point where it
took me a little bit of time to actually
get used to pressing in the right spot
with a screen and a phone this huge HTC
could have easily gone with on-screen
customizable software buttons or at
least given that option somewhere in the
menu is 2017 but they didn't instead
they went with the small permanent
capacitive buttons way down at the
bottom now they could if they wanted to
drop that in a software update so I
won't rag too hard on that if they want
to enable it but maybe they just wanted
to have buttons on the side flanking a
fingerprint reader because they just
really wanted a fingerprint reader which
is cool you can put one there but they
managed to put one of the smaller ones
on any flagship phone even on one of the
biggest phones out there seems like a
poor use of space this $750 phone is
also not water-resistant and with a body
and all the internal spaces big you
would think they would be able to find
the space to put the seams and the seals
to make sure that it's water-resistant
just like a lot of smaller fly ships out
there but they didn't seems like a poor
use of space and if you look in the
sides and the corners of this display
especially up at the top-left corner
right underneath the webcam you get some
serious light bleed
I hardly ever notice actual light bleed
in any flagship smartphone I don't know
if it's because in this phone the
backlighting is too close to the display
panel or if the insides are too clumped
up there next to the webcam to get that
space evenly lit I don't know what the
problem is but it is actually noticeable
and that rarely is a problem for me on
smartphones so seems like a poor use of
space again
it's also a huge phone with tiny
speakers at the bottom sure it's a
stereo pair but it's definitely not the
loudest and it's definitely tinny at
high volumes for we have space you see
what I'm getting at also most glass back
phones like this have wireless charging
that's why they do it if you have a
metal phone you can't do while I was
charging because
wireless charging doesn't work through
metal but if you have this sort of a big
glass back and a huge amount of internal
space you would think you could at least
have wireless charging but it doesn't
pour you space now even all that isn't
the end of the world I mean there's
phones that are also lacking all of
those things I just talked about but
they're also less than this price so I
think at $750 in the u.s. it's pretty
hard sell I mean people who are buying
phones at that price are looking for
something really special and I don't
think you're getting that here I mean
there are definitely some good promising
things about this phone that have me
psyched for HTC's next phone the camera
in this guy is really good it's a 12
megapixel ultra pixel camera and has
phase detection autofocus that's really
fast and photos look very good they can
almost go toe-to-toe with the Google
pixel so I'm really impressed with that
it also has expandable storage which is
definitely rare in most smartphones and
appreciated a high-end flagship and the
second display up at the top while it is
a shameless rip of the LG v 20 it's also
kind of useful sometimes like the one in
the LGB 20 you get some app shortcuts up
there if you want I kind of like it when
the display is off and I raise to wake
and I just get that little bit of
notifications and the time and the date
that's my favorite feature of the second
display but you know if you don't want
to use it you can turn it off as well so
there is good stuff here but aside from
new HTC software there's almost nothing
for 750 bucks that this phone does that
you can't get somewhere else better or
cheaper so with that I'll say skip this
one and you can pretty easily wait for
the HTC 11 to come out pretty soon or
just grab a Galaxy s8 when that comes
out or an LG g6
or pretty much any other $700 smartphone
which will be a better use of space than
this one so
Bennett hope you enjoyed configured with
a comment if you agree or if you have
some other stuff to share thanks for
watching talk to you guys the next one
