guys love then go I've recently switched
from Windows XP Windows Vista you may
have noticed that in windows explorer
for example they have gotten rid of the
file edit view all those buttons in
windows explorer in order to get those
back there's an extremely almost
ridiculously simple solution the alt
button and there they are it'll pull up
the exact same the exact same buttons
that you had before now they only last
for one click so if I go file and I hit
file again it'll disappear so if I hit
alt it'll bring up anything you want to
do if you want to select all that's all
you have to do you don't have to control
click constantly the entire thing or try
to drag and try not to mess up but it'll
disappear a sec you're done so that that
is a very useful tip that I found if you
just Hicks if you just hit the alt
button rope pull up i'll be helping the
tools file edit view all these menus
that we were used to in windows XP and
just dispose of them that quickly now a
lot of people are probably going to ask
if this works in microsoft word so i'm
going to open for you word 2007 just to
give this a shot and i found out the
hitting alt actually does not it brings
up a number of keyboards brooklyn so you
can follow which is really not um the
same as the ribbon will stay for now but
i'll try to find you guys a way to
change or to just add those menus to
word 2007 or just office 07 in general
but it's really need that you can
actually just hit the old button once
and it'll break it'll come up with the
file and edit and view and all these
menus in Windows Vista along I hope that
was helpful to you guys if you liked it
to subscribe more videos to come and
thanks for watching this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
