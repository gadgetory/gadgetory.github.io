every year picking a top-of-the-line
manufacturer in the smartphone industry
to work with them to help produce the
once per year flagship Nexus model for
the latest version of Android and this
month / next month is the timeframe for
the next Nexus to be released so we've
been sort of compiling the rumors about
who will be making the next one would it
be Samsung would it be HTC again perhaps
a sous or Motorola or LG well yeah a ton
of details are emerging that are
suggesting that the next Nexus will be
made by LG in the form of a pure vanilla
Android version of the lg optimus G so a
little bit about the Optimus G it's a
pretty good-looking phone I'm not gonna
lie it has some nice hardware on the
outside it's a relatively clean looking
device some pretty relatively square
edges it has capacitive home back and
multitasking buttons on the front but of
course those would disappear in favour
of a larger screen and if it's a nexus
that should have those on-screen buttons
like the previous Nexus did people don't
really notice this but LG has actually
consistently put really good hardware in
the devices it's just kind of held back
by their so-so software people like
TouchWiz and people like Sense UI and
Motorola skin but LG's skin has been
clunky and a little bit unintuitive for
a while not exactly the greatest skin
out there so that's held back their
devices so combining that excellent LG
hardware at least internally with some
amazing stock Android which is naturally
great software that should produce a
pretty sweet Nexus inside the new LG
Nexus is rumored to have the beast the
Qualcomm Snapdragon s4 pro which is
pretty much hands-down the best mobile
chip out there right now and it also
packs 2 gigabytes of RAM a 4.7 inch 1280
by 768 IPS display which would be pretty
bright in sunlight an 8 megapixel camera
and possibly maxing out at 16 or 32 gigs
of internal storage sealed batteries so
no external SD card support also NFC
support is included and wireless
charging out the box is on the spec list
this is on a lot of rumoured spec lists
so this is sort of a back of the thing
for me but it's possible and on top of
all this great hardware the LG Nexus
would be running Android 4.2 which is on
the rumored spec list now Android 4.1 is
jelly bean so 4.2 is key lime pie maybe
and what would they call it would be the
is not the Galaxy Nexus 2 because galaxy
is a Samsung thing but lg optimus G
Nexus sounds a little too much maybe LG
Optimus Nexus they're just just Optimus
Nexus that's it there it is right there
boom patent it so curling all these
ideas together and with a little bit of
Photoshop ability BAM that's what it
could look like not bad huh
not bad at all either way the rumors are
pegging a late October announcement and
a mid November actual launch so we won't
have to wait that long to see all this
stuff in action anyway I'm excited to
see the first Snapdragon s4 pro phones
in the first place even thumbs up on
this video if you're cited to see just
whatever Google has up their sleeves to
release next this doesn't count out any
of the rumors of multiple Nexus devices
we already have I've done a video on my
wish list for the next Nexus so do you
want to check out that video BAM there
it is and that should be just clickable
if you're on YouTube desktop that's an
annotations not on mobile yeah I should
rant about that either way I'm excited
for the next Nexus and the future of
Android and I hope you guys are too
thanks for watching this video and I
will talk to you guys in the neck
Aysen
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
