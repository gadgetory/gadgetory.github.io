here from mkbhd and welcome to another
tech channel of the week number 11 the
original mkbhd video series and this
tech channel of the week like I said
number 11 and also you can get this
background at the link in the
description I think it's pretty flashy
or could follow me on Twitter where I
always let you guys know when I changed
my background anyway let's get right
into the tech channel of the week which
is I'm Matt Carly and this is a I guess
a relatively new channel actually the
channel was created or started making
tech videos right around the same time
that I did and since it's the tech
channel of the week number 11 I'm just
gonna give you guys a quick tour of the
YouTube channel so first thing you'll
notice is it's running
Karlie's running a youtube 2.0 layout
right now got a nice little Apple logo
on the right-hand side and I'm just
gonna scroll down and show you guys
basically what I like to call I guess
what hits you like right when you when
you visit the channel you know there's
the specs of the channel so go ahead and
see there's approaching 20,000 channel
views join January 3rd 2009 so again
about 6 months making tech videos on
YouTube and has 804 subscribers right
now and the three links that I'm going
to throw you guys in the description are
number one the link to her YouTube
channel which is I'm Matt Carly and
number two the link to our website which
is I'm at Carly TK and number three
which is actually kind of hidden down
here if you didn't if you guys didn't
see this is twitter.com slash I'm at
Carly so if she does have a Twitter so
basically what this channel is is a
combination of hardware and software
which is kind of like what I do and on
this channel the most recent video is a
direct upload test from the NV act
actually the NV touch and there was an
NV touch unboxing on this channel which
was actually really a coincidental
because someone I know was considering
getting an NV touch and it was like
really like spot-on with the timing and
everything so I was able to show them
that unboxing video so I'm gonna go
ahead and grid this here now you can see
there's a combination of accessorizing
and more that'll be software and the
Richard still 1800 of you or the 40
things around the room
video which is very popular these days
is a hardware video on the rocket fish
Mouse versus the Mighty Mouse that whole
kind of stuff so there's definitely a
mix of hardware and software on this
channel so if you guys want to check it
out I'm just gonna go ahead and go to
the most viewed section here which is
generally where you see the kind of
videos that catch on that get the
channel more popular if you go to my
most viewed videos you'll see two
tutorial videos which are the safari 4.0
and the windows themes video which both
passed 20,000 views so this is uh I'm
iCarly's most viewed videos hardware
hardware hardware software software
software which is pretty pretty awesome
that there's such a great variety on
this channel so if you guys you know you
guys don't necessarily have to have a
Mac to relate to this channel you know a
lot of a lot of Mac related channels
like you think the name I'm Matt Carly
if you ever heard of the show iCarly
and her name is Carly and she has an
iMac so it makes sense
but anyway a lot of the the Mac related
channels kind of require you to have a
Mac to do the things on the channel but
this having some hardware stuff on here
actually spices it up and people who
don't have a Mac and still use the
things that are on this channel like
that the headphone reviews and the
richer so low 1800 etcetera so yeah I'm
just gonna go back to the main channel
here this is basically basically the
overall rundown of this channel if you
guys want to check it out the like I
said the links will be in the
description
she's a subscriber I believe I mean I
should kind of check I guess but I'm a
subscriber of I'm Matt Carly and that is
basically it so help us help her get to
a thousand subscribers we can probably
do that guys and check out this channel
and watch a few of the videos on this
channel see what you like anyway thanks
for watching this tech channel of the
week number eleven and if you like that
wallpaper again I tweet out every time I
change my wallpaper from those HD
wallpaper sites and that is it guys
thanks for watching peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
