to be taking an unbiased look at
technology in 2010 a year in review and
yes a lot good and bad happened this
year but let's take a look more of the
pros and the cons shall we I can hardly
talk about tech this year without
talking about the iPad which was
launched by Apple computers in 2010
early followed by a ton of other tablets
trying to capitalize on this
revolutionary new market these tablets
included Samsung Toshiba sharp rim asus
NEC and a lot more in 2010 apple also
released their iPhone 4 which featured a
new Retina display and iOS 4 this is one
of their killer products this year and
probably one of their best selling of
all time it's one of the thinnest
fastest phones on the market and also
one of the first to have a front-facing
video camera to really integrate video
chat so good work Apple Apple's iPhones
seem to take a big lead in the super
phone era where a whole bunch of phones
were released afterwards that really
took a name at its throne Microsoft's
Windows Phone 7 platform was hoping to
be more successful than the Kin 1 and
kin 2 which were actually pulled after
two months of crappy sales and also
Android by Google was released and has
made major strides this year the Nexus
One was the first pure Google phone to
run Android 2.2 and really offer a
pretty awesome experience for Google
users and this was followed pretty
quickly by other Android 2.2 phones that
took advantage of a 1 gigahertz
processor Android also pulled some
impressive numbers and past iOS as the
most popular mobile operating system in
the United States the latest iteration
of Android available in 2010 was 2.3
Gingerbread available only on the Nexus
S the best Android phones of the year
I'd say the Samsung Galaxy S the Droid X
and that Nexus 1 and Nexus S good where
Google next up on our list is the social
networking explosion of 2010 which
included massive growth of Twitter
probably the most popular social network
and you can follow me at mkbhd and also
the milestone of 500 million users using
Facebook around the world
Aarthi oma social network so Google Buzz
made its debut integrating with users
gmail accounts yet for people who
already have Facebook and Twitter
however it seemed like just another
social network now you may have noticed
at the beginning of the year at CES 2010
2010 really pushed 3d technology and TVs
but it's still pretty much a novelty
because of the lack of content and the
cumbersome glasses Google TV also
emerged and combines web and video but
it's still really ahead of its time
hopefully this will be big in 2011 I
like it and speaking of web video
YouTube is still the number one video
platform in 2010 sweet not a gaming the
Xbox 360 slim and the Kinect looked to
revolutionize gaming and the PlayStation
3 and PlayStation Move also joined the
party to take down Nintendo in motion
controlled gaming I don't really have a
preference yet but you might later in
this year Apple also released their
finally long-awaited MacBook Air refresh
and you'll notice something it just
keeps getting thinner and thinner trying
to imagine the 20/20 MacBook Air holy
crap it's not really the specs of that
notebook that are really impressive it's
the form factor and that's what Apple
does best and onto Google cr-48 the
netbooks hardware isn't anything special
but yes Chrome OS is revolutionary so
Google keeps getting better and better I
hope to become part of the pilot program
so I can test one of these bad boys
overall no matter which way you look at
it Google and Apple really dominated the
tech scene in 2010 this year the mkbhd
channel also saw more than 250 new
uploads with a combination of hardware
and software on tutorials
I'd say 2011 has a tough act to follow
either way there's been mkbhd with a
look at technology in 2010 happy new
year and I will see you guys in 2011
case
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
