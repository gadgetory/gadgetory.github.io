high frequencies up that's where it
really that goes it's just going back
and forth between these well hey what is
up guys I'm cabby HD here and welcome
back oh what number is this welcome to
ask mkbhd version 16 this is a once a
month thing you've done to May so almost
halfway through the year and we've kept
up with doing this once a month so I
asked you guys questions on Twitter what
you guys wanted to know and this is what
you ask wallpaper on a K monitor you use
in the video about the 8k monitor where
can I find it so it's actually believe
it or not really hard to find an actual
genuine 8k wallpaper so the one that you
saw in the video was a rendered out
vector file for my buddy Justin malar
who's made tons of art that showed up in
my videos before it's called ghosts too
it showed up in previous videos that is
an actual 8k 7680 by 4320 version of
that art because we're even when you
look on Google for things that are that
exact file size they're sometimes just
like up scaled versions of smaller files
really weird sketchy stuff from
wallpaper sites so that's what I would
came from how much difference in image
quality between the 1 plus 5 and the
galaxy f8 should be expected now that 1
plus is collaborating with DxO mark
alright so if you haven't already heard
the hype is now real for the next
version of the 1 plus flagship killer
the 1 plus 5 I don't know why they
skipped 4 but that's the name of the
next song and they came out and said
that they're working with the XO mark to
collaborate to make a better version of
a camera for that phone as you know DxO
mark is pretty well known for just
ranking objectively the smartphone
cameras that come out year after year
they gave him a number the highest one
we've seen recently was a 90 from the
HTC u 11 we've seen 89 and 88 but here's
my take on that you saw recently I've
done a video just on a blind test of the
5 best smartphone cameras and the
difference between those five cameras in
actual image quality was completely
random and subjective depending on what
photo you're taking obviously some
people could take a consistent clear
favorite throughout the entire image set
but the difference in number of points
on the DxO mark scale is not that high
between the basic what I'm saying is I
think the 1 plus 5 will have a pretty
great camera but the
Prince back and the essay it's not like
you can measure it it's just also going
to be pretty good what changes should
the Clippers do to be relevant in the
NBA they should sign a good small
forward why are AI assistants being
pushed so hard I still find looking up
information with my fingers faster and
easier well jason curry that is actually
the reason why a AI assistants are being
worked on so hard because they're still
not quite better than just typing what
you want to see but a small pro back
actually interviewed sundar Pichai the
CEO of Google a couple days ago in the
last video and something he mentioned
that same day was there working on AI
assistants and voice assistants to get
better because that's just the way
people communicate we naturally talk to
each other and listen to each other and
respond and that's how an actual
assistant would help a person so getting
our virtual assistants to be as close to
that as possible is the end goal they're
still not there yet as you mentioned
it's still easier to usually type what
you want to see but that's why they're
getting worked on so hard is because the
ideal assistant is kind of just like a
person yo marques eight megapixel
full-frame sensor or 42 megapixel
full-frame sensor light versus detail so
this is the video person inside of me
speaking I would like to see the 42
megapixel full-frame sensor because that
means I'll get high resolution video out
of it
eight megapixels I think caps me at 720p
so I mean I like low-light shooting
capabilities a lot but most of the
shooting I do is not in low-light so I'm
gonna go with that 42 megapixel
something why did you stop putting
Cheerios in your videos I don't I don't
really know what Cheerios are talking
about but they're pretty subtle usually
did you cable manage your place after
Linus tech came over so the thing about
cable management is when you manage your
cables when you use cable ties and like
lock them into place that kind of
implies that your setup in that area is
going to be permanent in some way if you
organize all the cables and lock them
into place and tie them around each
other around the table legs and
everything like that
then if you ever want to change
something out of that setup that uses
one of those wires if a huge pain in the
butt to get it out of that cable
management mess so bottom line
everything that I think is permanent in
here including the insides of computers
is great in the cable management space
but everything that's a little bit more
modular or that
may or may not move or get moved out in
the next couple weeks or months or years
even the kid management is definitely a
little less on point there your allergy
to cable type buddy can buy a velcro
cable time it's like the guy's never
heard of a velcro wrap will be iPhone 8
B port list so assuming you mean the
next iPhone that comes out in this
September is the iPhone 8 I would say
probably not this year but ideally
pretty soon I guess I've said this
before for Apple if the iPhone goal is
to be poreless and the only port that's
left since they got rid of the headphone
jack is the Lightning port only thing
you use that Lightning port for is plug
it into your computer to sync data and
how often do we really plug into sync to
iTunes and charging now wireless
charging is not really I guess where we
want it to be for a full time only way
to charge a phone still a bit of a work
in progress so I don't see the iPhone 8
now getting rid of that last port that
people use for charging but maybe in a
year or two or three where we have like
a sort of a radius based wireless
charging this has been talked about
where you don't have to put it right on
a pad but in a general area and it
starts to charge when we get that down
then maybe we will see a port look like
ah are you ashamed of the number of
typos you make on Twitter we can we can
literally reuse rockets and land them
back on earth and use them again but we
can't edit tweets we could put man on
the moon but we can't edit tweet we can
build skyscrapers hundreds and hundreds
of stories call and thousands of feet
tall with elevators and then that just
shoot up to the top in a matter of a
minute or two but we can't edit our
tweet we can upload 8kv videos to the
internet and and stream them and play
them back on the most ridiculously
high-end machines
I have 140 terabytes over there on the
corner holding video files that I can
access at any time
multiple computers but I can't edit my
pieces
why not Huawei do you hate them okay so
I see this a lot and I I think the
easiest way to address this is I think a
lot of people who have this opinion were
oh you didn't review that Huawei phone
that just came out why do you hate
Huawei so much or oh I see this a lot
you didn't review the newest Sony
flagship what with the hate / Sony a lot
of people saying this are people that
are used to seeing reviews from big
companies with dozens and even hundreds
of people and they can afford to have
different people reviewing different
phones at the same time and just turning
out reviews so they reviewed that
Samsung phone and that Huawei phone and
that LG phone and that Sony phone and
they review all that stuff but for me
I'm coming at it a little bit different
you got to remember I'm one person
I can't review as my daily driver for
different phones at once so I don't hate
Huawei at all in fact I really like Wow
and I've showed their phones before and
I really like Sony and I've showed their
phones before but I tend to show more of
the phones that I'm personally
interested in using because that's why I
review them so I'll leave it at that
it's been a lot of fun I like a lot of
the questions you guys sent but there's
a lot of exciting videos coming up so
definitely feel free to subscribe to
this channel if you haven't already to
see those when they come out very soon
thank you for watching now let's out
together the next one please</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
