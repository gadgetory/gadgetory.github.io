and today we're taking a look at the
bose companion 2 series 2 speakers that
I believe are really great for the price
you get them for 99 bucks so if you want
to check that out that's in the
description below we're starting off
with the set up of those here and
basically how we're going to get started
here is by unboxing them of course so it
foams up for that basically one of the
reasons people buy speakers is so that
they can have a quick easy audio
solution even if it's not difficult to
set up and for 99 bucks that is exactly
what these do they're surprisingly
simple for the price as you can see we
take them out here we can unbox them and
setting them up is as quick as just a
few steps taking them out of the
wrapping for the first time you'll
notice the series two are built like
tanks they're made from a magnetically
shielded plastic cabinet on the outside
and we'll show that more off later
you also notice that one of the speakers
has all the controls on the circuitry
while the other is well a companion so
it comes with this wall adapter that
looks a little bit odd at first but
basically it comes with the plug from
the country you live in so plug that
into the wall plug your main speaker
into the wall and plug your companion
speaker into the main speaker that plug
into the wall and connect your audio
source to the main speaker as well you
can connect up to two audio sources
it comes with one cable but you might
want to attach a second one in the
future these speakers have great
efficiency so they'll generally run
really loud and really clear without an
amp I've listened to a lot of hours of
audio on these $99 bose speakers i've
also listened to a lot of hours of audio
on $600
Aiki audio studio monitors and on $29
earbuds right so that's a pretty full
range but what does 99 bucks get you out
of bose what kind of value are you gonna
get out of $99 bose speakers so during
my time owning these speakers so far
I've learned a lot about why people like
them a lot about the speaker's
themselves and about a lot about why
they cost 99 bucks they have a pretty
decent build quality they're pretty
durable the cables are really durable
and they aren't breaking anytime soon
and also the cabinet is magnetically
shielded so you can have it right next
to a monitor with no problem I was a
little bit concerned about the cabinet
size because the only speaker itself in
the companion 2 series 2 is a 2 and
1/2 inch driver up at the top so the two
and a half inch speaker is the only
speaker in each side so there's a whole
lot of body of the speaker that's not
being used or maybe it's Hollow
I don't really know maybe it helps with
the sound having space in there but it
definitely confused me why it was so
much bigger than the actual speaker and
I like compact speakers so you know
no no so how do they actually sound
that's what people want to know it's why
they came here to see this review well
start from the highs and work our way
down to the lows because that is also
the order in which it falls the highs
sound great they're very very crisp
they don't overpower anything they're
not shrilly or tinny or anything but
they sound great and I definitely like
the way songs in a certain genres like
certain pop songs and rock songs guitar
acoustic stuff like that jazz sounds
great highs are excellent the mids on
the goes to companion series too we're
medium I could definitely hear that some
mids were especially more prominent in
some songs so they sounded good with
again certain songs it was like hit or
miss for me with the mids
and the lows were also decent decent at
best I was into a lot of music like
house music and and music with a lot of
bass in it already so when I'm not
hearing it in the Bose - and I'm used to
hearing it in say my m50 headphones then
it's a little bit weird to not hear that
bass if you listen to a lot of music
with intentionally heavy bass you might
not like these as much or you might want
to go ahead and pick up a subwoofer for
maybe an extra 100 bucks or 75 bucks to
really fill in the sound because the
mids and highs like I said are just fine
on these speakers other than that yeah
that's basically it those are the Bose -
companion series - if you like this
review be sure to give it a thumbs up it
really does help me out and I'll talk to
you guys in the next video thanks for
watching peace
