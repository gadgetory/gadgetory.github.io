tutorial in this 1 i'll be showing you
guys how to zoom in and take screenshots
of your of your computer screen right
now i'm using a 17 inch laptop but say i
have a certain maybe i'm in a calculator
and i got a weird funky number nothing
special but i want to take a screenshot
of it well there are several ways built
into windows disk so that i can actually
do this the first way is to go to your
Start menu and type a snip SN IP and hit
enter this will bring up say would you
like to add it to your quick launch bar
i'll just hit no but it says to drag the
cursor around the area you want to
capture so I'm just going to click and
drag it's very intuitive BAM and it
opened up in the snipping tool and that
is exactly the screenshot that I just
took and of course you can see it's
still in the background I'll exit out so
this is the built in windows vista
snipping tool I can hit new at any time
to take a new snip which I will just do
random little snip of my rocketdock fall
and show you guys that um I can go to
file and say a new snip I can save this
as a JPEG or an image I can also send
this as an email attachment and I can as
get out I can copy the image and paste
it into samek slops word or paint if I
wanted to edit it I can also edit this
in GIMP or Photoshop under tools there's
a a pen and a highlighter tool which is
quite useful for may be circling
something within your screenshot and you
can also customize the thickness of and
the color of your pen also under tools
there's an eraser and a highlighter I'll
show you the eraser real quick all you
have to do if you have a pen mark sales
try a circle show you guys something
here of course that's not exactly
accurate but that would be that would
come under me using my customizing tool
for the pen so now the eraser all I have
to do is just hover right over it and
well it's not working very well but um
that it would be just easy to erase it
real quick so um I'm going to take a new
snip right now and just actually I'm
going to a larger snip than I would
actually need this comes in handy
you actually want to edit your snip I'll
go to edit and copy and I'm going to
open up paint and I'm going to when in
paint is open go control V to actually
paste it so now you can see I have the
snip in here I can crop it I can make it
smaller I could take a certain part out
and remove it etc so this is a really
nice feature that they've built into
Windows Vista that allows you to take
screenshots now this is probably the
best feature because it allows you to
actually take a particular image the
next thing you can do is to actually hit
the print screen button on your keyboard
which might be abbreviated PRT space SC
basically when you click this when you
hit this button BAM I've hit the button
now I'll open up paint again and I will
just go control V and paste that image
and there you see my desktop ready for
me to edit whatever I have to do if I
want to crop it out for I want to open
it in gimp I can do all these things and
edit my desktop so that is basically two
versions of how to take screenshots in
Windows system so i hope you found this
real helpful if you have any other
suggestions then go ahead and subscribe
and just send me a message and I'll get
to it as soon as I can thanks for
