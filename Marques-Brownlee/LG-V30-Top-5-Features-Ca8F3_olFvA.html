and this is LG V 30 this is way better
than any other phone LG's ever made and
it is so very 2017 so LG was nice enough
to send over a V 30 a little bit early
for me to take a look at it so I've
spent a little time with it and it's
kind of funny it's basically the
opposite of the essential phone I just
reviewed like in every imaginable way
it's kind of impressive one is a minimal
sort of bare-bones
small stock phone from a pretty new
company while the other is a big feature
packed really richly enhanced Android
flagship from a well-established company
has done this before now technically
they don't want us reviewing it yet
since this is pre-release hardware and
software but I really want to share it
with you guys because it's so good so
these are the top five things that you
should know about this phone in order so
number five is all the little things all
the attention to detail in this phone
and I think a lot of us can come from
the fact that LG has had a lot to learn
from the v20 and the g6 and the g5 but
some of it is just knowing what people
want and this phone checks pretty much
all of the boxes imaginable it has
expandable storage via microSD for those
who like it
it has wireless charging it has fast
charging it has USB type-c of course it
has IP certified waterproofing it has a
headphone jack and not only does it have
a headphone jack but it backs it up with
a 32-bit quad act that audio enthusiasts
will really like the removable battery
might be gone but the 3300 milliamp hour
battery onboard here is pretty promising
if not standard for this size it's not
something I've tested but fast charging
and wireless charging should back that
up so again it seems like the opposite
of that essential phone which for 700
bucks had literally none of the things
that I just mentioned it gets the
fingerprint reader right also it puts it
in the middle of the back if you're
gonna put it on the back of the phone
that's where it's actually reachable and
Samsung and it also doubles as a power
button still which is kind of LG's thing
so the v3 checks all the boxes in a way
that no other smartphone this year
really has except for maybe the thousand
dollar Note 8 so number four is the
software and I've said this a couple
times in previous videos but I'm not the
biggest Android skin
so it takes a lot for me to say this
about a phone but I really don't mind
this skin and I think a big part of that
for me is how many features elegies
added again think the opposite of the
essential phone this is an LG skin on
top of Android 7.1.2
fingers crossed for a getting updated to
8.0 quickly and right off the bat it
doesn't feel too cartoonish or weird
there is a bit of bloatware but most of
it you can remove or hide if you want
and performance is not only smooth as
you would expect but like really fluid
high frame rate animations you can't say
that about every new phone with the skin
but yeah it just berries so many
features in the settings to mess with if
you want you know previous V Sirius
phones the v10 the V 20 had that second
screen obviously this one doesn't have
that but they do have this optional
floating bar so you can bring it in from
the edge and keep some app shortcuts
there or your favorite actions whatever
you want it's basically kind of like
apps edge on the new Samsung phones you
can rearrange the buttons in the bottom
of the phone and any order you want so
you can add or remove buttons place it
exactly how you want if you take a lot
of screenshots you can add that capture
button there I'm happy to see that still
exists there's all these smart settings
to to adjust profiles basically based on
different scenarios so linger at home it
might turn on Wi-Fi and Bluetooth and
turn down the brightness and set your
alarm but when you get to work it does
something different it has a couple
themes built in too and then of course a
themes store if none of the built-in
ones suit your fancy so if you're into
that you can really make this phone look
a lot different so there's a lot going
on here with the software obviously
because it's Android you can use as much
of it or as little of it as you want so
you might not be interested in any of
the things I just mentioned in which
case you never touch them but if you're
interested any of that it's all included
so the number three best feature of the
V 30 is the design so you've seen it a
lot by now in this video but yeah it's
pretty dope this is one of those phones
that now looks very 2017 it's the huge
display up front the 82% screen to body
ratio that kind of curves over at the
edges it makes this sort of a glass
sandwich design it's not anything we
haven't seen before in fact if you
didn't know better you might say it
looks a lot like a Galaxy Note 8 because
it does but yeah the sides sort of round
off smoothly you've got the antenna
bands matching pretty well a really thin
and lightweight device in the hand IP
certified water-resistant again like
design is really complete and this is
sort of what you'd expect when you put a
dream phone together minimal bezels the
camera bump on the back is the tiniest
of bumps so no big deal it doesn't Rock
the phone or anything when it's down and
the logos aren't too much of an eyesore
either they're really my only real
complaint with the design is I wish
they'd put the headphone jack on the
bottom that's it so everything else is
props LG so then we get to number two
and the number two best feature on this
phone is the display itself up front
this new screen is incredibly good it's
a six inch 2880 by 1440p OLED display
and it gets crazy bright so I don't have
an it's rating for it but it is totally
visible outdoors much more easily than
most and honestly rivals some of the
best Samsung displays we've seen in the
past year two in colors and brightness
and clarity and saturation
now obviously 2880 by 1440 that's an 18
by 9 aspect ratio or as I like to call
it since I learn fractions two to one so
it's a bit narrower than your typical
sixteen by nine so when you're watching
videos or using certain apps sometimes
gaming you'll get these black bars on
either side of the display but again
it's not that big of a deal since it's
an OLED and the black parts of the
screen go completely blank the viewing
angles are pretty good the curved
corners are really great I mean this is
all-around great display and I think
this is what would really put it on the
map for me if I hadn't seen this phone
in person and I was just kind of curious
about it and I saw this screen that's
why I would be interested in it and then
it would get me to the rest of stuff but
that's just the second best thing so to
top that the number one best feature on
the v30 is around the back and it's that
camera or those cameras this phone
supports dual cameras again like all its
older brothers on the back gets one 16
megapixel F 1.6 main camera with oh is
and then a secondary super wide angle 13
megapixel F 1.9 camera and they've done
these dual cameras before with the
wide-angle secondary this time just with
pretty much everything around them being
improved so the main cameras a lot
better shots off this thing looked
top-notch I gonna have to disclaim that
it's pre-production stuff but they're
clean they have punch saturated colors
plenty of contrast and detail and
dynamic range and of course having a
fixed F 1.6 aperture means you can get
pretty close to a subject and
the background will fade away to a
decent Boca which is cool and then the
super wide angle camera has less
distortion than before so less of that
fisheye GoPro look and more of just a
really wide angle rectilinear
perspective which is awesome and then
the camera app itself is really
impressive really what makes this the
number one feature so you can drag the
shutter button to move between the two
cameras zoom in and out which is smart
that's also what Samsung is doing with
the note so it's not the first place
we've seen it but it's very 2017 and it
has your usual massive amount of
settings auto HDR auto phone triggers
self timers all that stuff but then you
look at all the modes look at all these
modes in the phone auto mode is
obviously the one that most people use
but enthusiasts will get into manual
mode manual video time lapses panoramas
slow-motion all that stuff and then
there is something called cine mode and
when you turn on cine mode the camera
records to a flat log color profile so
you can maximize sensor data and dynamic
range and then add color later the cine
mode in this phone's video camera is
literally made for people to import it
from the phone and bring it to a
computer and edit it later if that's not
screaming enthusiasts phone to you I
don't know what is so this is kind of
the ultimate enthusiasts photo and video
cameras obviously stuff like the video
quality itself and more photo quality
testing and the battery life those
things will have to be tested for a full
review but right off the bat v30
looks really promising and I didn't even
cover everything but it's pretty clear
this will be a mobile photography and
videography powerhouse and a phone that
enthusiasts who like all those boxes to
be checked will really like so let me
know would you get a V 30 I mean
obviously with note 8 right around the
corner with iPhone 8 about to come out
possibly having an excellent camera as
well is V fair deal on your radar let me
know thanks for watching talk to you as
the next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
