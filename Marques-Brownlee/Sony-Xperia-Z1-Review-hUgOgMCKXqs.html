this is the Sony Xperia z1 or z2 people
will call it it's basically it tuned up
and refined Xperia Z surprised alright
so it is a major step up on the inside
from the Xperia Z flagship and we'll get
to that in a second but on the outside
it is more of an incremental upgrade
with some minor tweaks here and there
and improvements to the design and the
overall way it feels in the hands so the
whole actual outside of the Xperia z1 is
reinforced metal with this black plastic
band on the inside which is good because
it's not the other way around now the
buttons on the side of the phone I think
are really well placed especially for
smaller hands they're on the right spots
and with the typical Sony full
edge-to-edge glass on the front and the
back of the phone it does have two
effects one it makes the phone feel
super premium and high-end in the hand
expensive even it's actually heavier but
number two it makes the phone feel
actually a little bit more delicate the
metal doesn't quite wrap around to the
front or the back so if you drop this
phone on either of its faces it will hit
glass so I kind of got these mixed
feelings holding in the hand it doesn't
feel bad by any means but just like the
Nexus 4 and the iPhone it naturally made
me more careful not to drop it so a lot
of people are going to love the look of
and just a pure aesthetics of the Xperia
z1 and that's great because it's a
really good looking phone but to me it
still has the same problem as the
original Xperia Z where it doesn't
really know if it wants to be a
ruggedized device or not it's a
great-looking device in the first place
but then you add the fact that it's IP
58 certified so that means it's dust
proof it's water resistant for up to one
meter deep for up to 30 minutes so in
order to do that it has to add a whole
bunch of these different things where it
needs to cover up all the different
ports it has to have almost no openings
the speaker has to be significantly
worse it has this permanent screen
protector on that you cannot remove and
a whole bunch of other things that are
all sealed up about the phone to make it
IP 58 certified but does anyone really
need that in a phone and at the end of
the day it's glass on the front and the
back and it's not exactly the most
rugged thing in the world I feel like if
this device was not IP 58 certified and
if they didn't cover every single port
with flaps and if they didn't worry
about the display being certified and
had
open speaker and just had a a much more
traditional built device it would be a
lot more appealing to me but all the
stuff is no different than the Xperia Z
and neither is the power button that
feels a little bit mushy or the
completely awful speaker on the bottom
all these are sacrifices that Sony's
made to get this beautiful device to
survive some rain or some mud or being
dropped in the shallow end of a pool or
something like that the worst of it is
actually the SIM card tray it's an
absolute disaster to get the SIM card
into the flexible plastic tray thing and
then into the phone and taking it out is
even worse so thankfully most people
will only have to do that one time but
there are also some nice subtle things
that have changed on the good end like
the notification LED inside the earpiece
is probably the prettiest on a phone
next to the lg optimus G and you
probably never know if no one told you
but there is a permanent screen
protector on the glass that you'd
probably never see if you weren't
looking for it and speaking of that
display it's a completely similar story
to the Xperia Z it's rocking a 5-inch
1920 by 1080 panel which brings it to
441 pixels per inch super sharp with
bright vibrant colors and relatively
contrast II pleasing images until you
turn it off axis that's where it falls
apart because of the protector that they
put on the display to help it pass that
IP 58 certification the Xperia z1 has
some pretty poor viewing angles when it
comes to color reproduction you can see
here compared to the Moto X that it
starts getting weird at only about
thirty degrees off-axis and by then it
just looks totally washed out and you're
missing all the color and contrast as
you know the rest of the quirks about
this phone like the flaps that you have
to open to charge it and the glass front
and back in the new design they're all
things that you can get used to after
just a little bit of use but this
display this display was the one thing
that I could never get over because it's
the one thing that you have to look at
when you're using your phone and a lot
of people argue you'll never use the
display off axis but trying to show just
one other person some movie or something
on your phone you'll have to deal with
these incredibly poor viewing angles
even when gaming when you turn the phone
a lot you're going to have to deal with
this but there's another Hardware
feature that we can talk about that's
gotten a lot of attention on the z1 and
that is the camera and it's a pretty
good one now a lot of people
automatically look at that 20 megapixels
and assume whoa
must be in the top five smartphone
cameras now it's actually not but don't
get me wrong it's not bad at all it's
like number six but it has its pros and
cons but first I want to say that this
phone has just about the perfect button
layout for taking pictures like a boss
so anyway opening up the camera app from
any shortcut for single notices the
viewfinder frame rate is very high and
it takes you into Sony's superior auto
mode by default which is supposed to
choose the best photo mode to use by
evaluating the situation but it turns
your image size down to 8 megapixels and
turns the image stabilization off by
default which is weird so I was getting
a habit of switching to manual mode and
turning into 20 megapixels and turning
the software stabilization on now the
phone's camera actually has a pretty big
sensor bigger than the one in the galaxy
s4 and in the iPhone so if you want to
take that for granted it does give you a
nice shallow depth of field it also has
a benefit of Sony optics and Sony like
we know makes great cameras so that
should be all good there but the images
were decent at best they're not going to
shock anyone that you took them from a
camera phone or anything mostly because
the image processing is meh and the
colors really aren't that vibrant they
sometimes look a bit dull but the
sharpness is definitely there and the
focus was pretty accurate in regular
light so they tend to look alright the
camera really struggle though in
low-light I have to mention that the
very colors and the artifacts and the
noise patterns in low-light were just
really bad the flash didn't help either
so there's no real optical image
stabilization so it's really not that
good in low-light but lucky for us sony
has put a lot of effort into the Xperia
skin and the camera is one place where
you can really see a lot of it in action
the manual mode has that exposure
control dial so you can choose how to
meter the image manually which is nice
and again it's in that sweet spot with
the awesome button layout I really like
shooting with it future software updates
in addition to the one that the phone's
already received can probably work on
processing the images a bit better
though but as of right now the camera is
just pretty good not the greatest as a
lot of people expected it to be but I
have a full sample image gallery linked
right below that like button if you want
to check all those out now the rest of
Sony's Xperia skin is very familiar if
you've used any other Sony phone and
it's obvious that Sony is putting a lot
of effort into improving this and making
it a better usage experience it's
running here on top
Android 4.2 jelly bean and since this
phone is rocking a Snapdragon 800
processor yes it is a great performer
like it crushes through benchmarks
browses the web super smooth and very
fast and is just all-around rarely
stutters at all like you would expect
from a Snapdragon 800 device and as
responsive as the software is they've
really added a lot of stuff one example
to take advantage of the larger display
is the smaller windowed apps that we've
seen on other big-screen phones they
come from the multitasking menu here and
there's only a few of them but it's a
step in the right direction and
hopefully other apps will be able to
plug into this in the future and there's
also the menu dedicated to power saving
at Sony's added in it seems that they
were very concerned with battery life
when they made this phone the Xperia z1
has a sealed in 3000 milliamp hour
battery already so it lasted all day
with regular to heavy use but even more
impressive was the standby time it
actually is one of the better standby
times of any Android device I've used so
that's thanks to all the modes that
automatically kick in when you're not
using it for a while and the rest of the
using the phone is exactly as you would
expect really I mean I haven't found any
app that it can't handle or any games
that it can't run smoothly its overall a
buttery experience I'm just hoping Sony
keeps their finger on the pulse here and
updates this device to Android 4.4 when
it comes out because I think there's
going to be some interesting google
experience stuff that skin phone users
are really going to like so at the end
of the day the Xperia z1 is exactly what
it sounds like it's so sort of a refined
tuned up more bold Xperia Z which is
great because if you really like the
original Xperia Z you're going to love
the Xperia z1 but if you're in the same
boat as me where you didn't like the
Xperia Z some software wasn't really for
me I didn't like the way it looked as
much then you're probably not going to
like the Xperia z1 either because
they're very similar in that regard but
either way that's why the comments
section is open let us know what you
think of the Xperia z1 right down there
below and you'll see me answering a
whole bunch of comments as well below
