high-definition video and today we're
going to be taking a look at the
blackberry playbook and today in fact
we're looking at the playbooks ad put up
by a blackberry not too long ago now the
fact that it is an advertisement may put
some of you guys off but it is very very
telling and a lot of the things about
the playbook first thing I'll tell you
is that it does have a 1 gigahertz
dual-core processor a 7 inch screen and
does have a 1080p 3 megapixel video
camera on the back and a front-facing
high-definition video camera on the
front a lot of the things you'll see
here in this commercial have nothing to
do with the tablet itself but the
animations are very reminiscent of
something we've seen in the Galaxy Tab
or the iPad this is because it's running
rims latest version of the BlackBerry
tablet interface good caller them also
rim selecting to have their own
operating system dedicated to this
tablet means they're opening up also to
developers to develop applications for
this tablet so we'll go over that in a
second
something you'll see showcased a lot
here in this ad is that it's very
business driven because of the ability
to multitask we can run multiple
applications at once and that will
surely be enhanced by the one gig of ram
and the dual-core mobile processor it
has inside of it so you see a lot of
these animations are really smooth will
see flash content as it is flash loving
and you'll see a whole lot of other
things on that high resolution screen
that you wouldn't typically see on
something like the iPad or the smaller
galaxy cab it also appears that you'll
be able to pair your current blackberry
phone with the BlackBerry tab which
makes sense as things like that are
already going on with iOS devices and
with Android
here at the end of the commercial we get
a really nice 360 view of the tablet and
a whole bunch of things rim is
showcasing including the camera position
there on the back you can see it offers
an uncompromised rather than the
experience that is enterprise-ready with
Ren's tablet OS and that their
advertising it as a professional camera
looks to be a really nice competitor to
the other tablets out there it'll be a
great addition to the tablet market and
will nice it'll be nice to see you know
how they price this and what it'll
really bring to the market in the future
so this is been mkbhd with a quick look
at the blackberry playbook as shown by
rim thanks for watching this video I
want to talk to you guys in the next one
