here from mkbhd and welcome to another
HD tutorial in the midst of a bunch of
hardware that's going to be coming up
today are these this coming week but I
feel like I should leave you guys with
some more software some bringing you
guys another HD tutorial from the free
studio manager available at DVD video
soft calm and today I want to check out
this free audio converter now I know a
lot of you guys are going to eggs up
because you don't think you need an
audio converter but I suggest you watch
the whole video so you guys actually
understand what I'm what I why I think
you guys will benefit from a free audio
converter so to get this this whole
freeware manager here this is the latest
version just go to DVD video soft comm
you'll see the freeware bundle download
it and all these will be grayed out and
you go ahead and click on the one you
want to download and it'll take you to a
direct download link you install it
everything and you are good you have it
now I don't want to have to explain that
every time I do a studio a studio
tutorial but I you know I guess I have
to so once you've downloaded the the
piece of software number 18 it'll be
dark like this just go ahead and click
on it to open it and it'll come up like
this and it's very very simple just like
the entire rest of the freeware package
you have an input file an output folder
and a format now it does have a lot of
input files so if we want to go ahead
and record something let's say we have
audacity and we you know we're trying to
make a podcast here right so we want to
not only make a podcast but sync the
video of the podcast
with the audio so let's go ahead and
record something real quick testing
testing testing and once we do this
we're going to go ahead and file and go
ahead and save project as
now I'm sorry we're going to export this
and we're going to go ahead and export
it as an mp3 actually no let's go ahead
and export it as a WAV because the WAV
WAV
test doesn't actually work with a lot of
a lot of programs like moviemaker some
certain programs like Camtasia Studio in
Sony Vegas certain ones won't take WAV
so just go ahead and save it and you can
always double click on your wav to play
it there it is on our desktop double
click and it will open up in Windows
Media Player and go ahead and play the
testing testing 1 2 3 so now if we
wanted to import that into something
that doesn't take WAV like I said you
guys I really do believe that audacity
gives you better audio quality than if
you were to record with Camtasia Studio
6 so if I were to do an unboxing video
and do voice over I would definitely
record in audacity remove the audio
there and then import it into Camtasia
Studio so let's go ahead and browse for
our input file here and we saved it to
our desktop and it is called wav test
right there and it will take your WAV
now you go ahead and select your output
name we're going to change it into mp3
but it obviously can be changing to a
number of other things I'm going ahead
and choose an output folder so we're
just going to put this right on our
desktop next to the WAV test and you
guys will be able to see which is really
cool there are a lot of formats that you
can go ahead and convert this into
including mp3 wav and WMA now Windows
Media Audio is one of the more popular
kinds that won't be accepted by a number
of others but this free audio converter
will accept WMA and convert it into mp3
which is really compatible anyway we're
going to go ahead and choose our quality
I'm going to go ahead and go with the
high quality since I'm mr. podcast and
everything and hit the convert button
now it's only a two second file so that
was done almost instantaneously however
if that was a longer file it'll take a
good 45 seconds to a minute and
sometimes higher so we go ahead and
close and exit out and there's that mp3
we just created so there's a WAV as you
can tell by the logo and here's mp3 as
you can tell by the logo and when we
double click the mp3 it opens up in
media player again and plays with the
exact same quality
and another thing is you guys can use
your video I'm sorry your audio recorder
built into Windows Vista if you go ahead
and search recorder under in the windows
just the Start menu you'll see there's a
sound recorder we'll go ahead and hit
the sound recorder and I'm just going to
record something real quick
testing testing one two three testing
one two three and once we exit this this
is going to save it automatically as a
Windows Media audio file a WMA and that
is the only option so when we do say
this says WMA and say we want to import
it into Camtasia Studio 6 it won't work
so when I do my unboxing videos and
record it with the sound recorder and
want to import it I definitely need to
use that audio converter I just showed
you guys and use go ahead and use that
and import it into a Camtasia Studio
now before you exit out I do plan on
doing a video on syncing the good
microphone audio with the bad microphone
audio because I know the audio built
into my my digital camera is complete
crap and I realized that so I will
definitely do a video on how to use your
good microphone audio even though the
camera does not have an audio in so
anyway thanks for watching the software
video guys there will be more hardware
and software to come so I hope you guys
enjoy the variety that I present you
with and please rate this video five
stars it really does help me and it'll
definitely accelerate my path towards
becoming a YouTube partner and helping
more people so anyway thank you for
watching and thank you for checking out
this video and yes the wallpaper link
will be in the description if you guys
want to check it out and also I'll be
tweeting out my wallpaper links at my
Twitter every time I change my wallpaper
I'll go ahead and tweet out a link for
you guys twitter.com slash mkbhd and
that is basically it thank you for
watching
