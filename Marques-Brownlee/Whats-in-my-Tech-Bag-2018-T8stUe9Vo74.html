some might call it an everyday carry
video or what's in my bag whats my tech
bag backpack video so i've watched a
whole ton of these videos they're all
over youtube and they all feel they're
super badass and way more nuanced and
complex than mine so like I didn't feel
the need to share my bag because it
didn't seem that great well you can ask
people I don't really carry that much
stuff on the regular and it's not even
like really a tech bag per se but the
more I thought about it the more it felt
like actually the fact that it's unique
in that way may actually make it worth
sharing so maybe you'll enjoy it it
works for me maybe I'll get some ideas
out of what you want to do with your
tech bag so as a post student that's not
carrying a bunch of books this is what's
in my tech bag so this is the bag itself
it's called the Hershel pop-quiz
backpack it's somewhat new to me
actually I switched from a slightly
simpler Hershel backpack a couple weeks
ago but just for a couple little better
things as far as interior organization
but it's also red you don't have to get
the red one that screams like red and
black you know you can get a much
simpler color I'll link this below as
well as of course anything else I talked
about in this video but basically you
can beat these things up like they're
very durable it's also weatherproof it's
got this hood on the top
although zippers and things like that
are weather resistant so water doesn't
get in you don't wanna get this thing
soaked obviously it's still fabric but
it's held up great I toss it around I
throw it on my car every single day no
problems like I said there's definitely
not a tech bag but I like that it
doesn't scream I have hundreds of
dollars of Technology inside and of
course you can get a more discreet color
and like a grey or a black I was using a
grey before but I feel like those bags
that have like a USB port and a solar
panel and like a battery bank inside
that's a little much you add weight you
add complexity keeping it simple here so
okay inside the main compartment
we got zippers up top my number one
thing and that's in the back in this
laptop compartment which is actually
felt lined and the awl is this cool
black and white pattern
side to which actually think kind of
looks nice but anyway the laptop that is
the 13-inch retina MacBook Pro with
touch bar from last year and it's in
this incase sleeve with a magnet and I
really like the sleeve actually it's got
like this heather gray look it peels
back up here closes like that with a
magnet
it holds the 13-inch MacBook Pro but
there's a 15-inch version as well has
this sort of rubber bumpers on the end
and goes through airports like this
don't have to take it out it's great and
on the laptop itself has held up fine I
haven't upgraded to the latest quad-core
model because I don't do all that much
complex stuff on this laptop like if I'm
traveling for a video I'm bringing a lot
more stuff including the video editing
laptop which is the 15-inch MacBook Pro
but as far as everyday carry stuff this
the most I'll do on it is some light
photo editing a lot of web browsing
email things like that this is great for
that little D brown-skinned on the back
never hurt anybody and it's kept it in
pretty good conditions so this is the
daily laptop of choice so let's see I
also have my water bottle
can never be too hydrated shout out to
all the companies that include stickers
in their boxes that's a definitely a
nice touch and if I like it it'll
probably end up on this water bottle I
also have back here the MacBook Pro
charger this is the higher wattage
charger from the 15-inch MacBook Pro it
just charges the laptop faster so I use
it for the 13-inch MacBook Pro and also
since it's USB see don't tell anyone I
also use it for my phone too that's kind
of the beauty of having one port for
everything hasn't damaged anything as
far as I know yet but USB see among all
the things has been great but then of
course speaking of things that I guess
aren't USB see it's the bose qc25
headphones of choice as far as like over
ear especially for traveling getting on
a plane i don't fly without these
headphones they're noise cancelling they
have a rechargeable battery but they
charge by a micro USB that's the sad
part about them but everything else
about these is amazing and i highly
recommend it that's pretty much always
in the backpack and then that's like it
for the main compartment this i would
say is like my optional accessories bag
which is not always in the everyday
carry but this is
zipper bag from Herschel that's made to
go in their backpacks and it's got a
zipper on the top and if you unzip this
you get a whole bunch of little tech
goodies inside so first up is this media
drive it's USBC and it is easily the
fastest drive I've ever used it's the
Samsung x5 so anytime you need to do
offline media moving it between machines
photos videos RAW files whatever it is I
use this now used to be the Samsung t5
that everyone would use and that's still
a very popular drive that I have but
this is literally like eight times
faster so any big files book will go
through this and I also found these
these came from a Dave 2d video these
are basically a full-size USB to any
number of different micro USB Lightning
or USB type-c cables so if you want to
charge something say from a battery bank
plug this end into the battery bank plug
one of these into what you want to
charge and it will work so if you forgot
your cable or if you need an extra cable
or someone's wants to borrow one you can
give them this and no matter what phone
they have it'll work then we also have
this anchor power bank I've had this for
how many years now for five years
forever I think it's a twenty thousand
twenty thousand one hundred milliamp
hour battery
the great thing about it is it's got USB
type-c so if you want to charge it it
uses the same charger as the macbook pro
to plug this thing up and juice it up
and then there's two full-size USB ports
for again whatever you want this is all
optional this is like if I'm going on a
long flight or if I'm on a long trip
what we're doing video stuff I'll toss
this in there too then this backpack
also has this sort of a extra top little
sleeve up here it's microfiber lined I
think it's because you're supposed to
put a phone in it or something like that
the only thing I have in here right now
why am i reaching so far is the air pots
I use which are the matte black
everything ones of course the most
beautiful pair of air pauses you've ever
seen don't put your keys in there that
is not something you want to do you
don't want to mix that like kind of
defeats the purpose of the microfiber
but that's what I put in there and they
get to them the least-used front
action of this backpack so but the front
is this like organizer section I again
don't use it very much but you still got
that felt like striped lining in here
and then some pockets for things like
dongles or headphones and then I have a
black lightning cable so obviously I
have a whole bunch of USBC going on in
my life but the iPhone is not one of
those things so this is my iPhone
charger things like contact lenses
business cards and that's it for that
and then the final outside is some more
business cards a pen and a little
microfiber you can never go wrong with
having a microfiber what happened to my
card reader oh it's still in here I
almost forgot so I keep this in the
sleeve where the laptop usually is just
because I always use it with my laptop
but this little thing the van Vanja I'll
link it below because I don't know what
it's called but it's kind of like the
Swiss Army knife of media card readers
anytime I need to import photos or audio
from an SD card BAM one side is USB
type-c
but if I'm not about that BAM the other
side is full-size USB or if you pull it
back micro USB it is super useful I've
let people don't like borrow this I have
used this many times with my macbook pro
micro USB or sorry micro SD cards or SD
cards I love this thing I keep it in the
pocket with the macbook pro all the time
it's durable and it's never broken so I
just tossed it in there but that's
basically it that's what I keep in my
backpack every day literally that's
that's about it this video is brought to
you by my wallet actually speaking of my
wallet phone wallet keys that's always
the things I have with me wallet is this
trove slim wallet I'm pretty sure is
what it's called with a little mkbhd
engraved logo on it that's a pretty
special edition thanks tro if you guys
are great keys and whatever phones I'm
carrying right now which are as you're
probably wondering one plus six iPhone
10 okay that's really at this time
thanks for watching and I'll catch you
the next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
