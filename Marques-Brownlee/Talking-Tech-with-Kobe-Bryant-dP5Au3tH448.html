and this week out in LA I got to visit a
little Nike gathering where Kobe
unveiled his latest shoot the Kobe 11
and is a pretty special one to him it's
a last shoe he'll release during his
active career and it's the last one who
wear on the court so I got to talk with
him about it a little bit about tech a
little bit about the shoe and beyond
enjoy during the busy regular season and
all the basketball and all the training
all you all the stuff you guys are doing
how much tech smart phones cameras
whatever do you get to follow I know Roy
is actually like pretty into tech of
shout out to Roy if he's watching what
kind of stuff to get to see well I mean
from the tech perspective you know I've
kind of tried to dabble into it a little
bit but I found myself not being
extremely passionate about it unless
it's sitting around sports right and
things that involve health training
things of that sort but overall I
wouldn't describe myself as a very tech
savvy person my question related to that
since we're carrying smartphones all the
time now yeah
entering the league like what kind of
tech did you carry did you like listen
to music for a game how that kind of
stuff time yeah I mean I you know is
back in the day let's see when I first
came in week I had a phone I was
probably about the size of my head yeah
you know what I mean and then we kind of
graduated to having sidekicks and things
like that and I remember having Walkman
players and CD players my kids don't
have no idea
yeah with a CD player is let alone a
Walkman it was like wait you had to
rewind what yeah when I wait so that's
always over you have to flip it over and
in like use the other side of a tape
yeah yeah yeah so you know um when I
first came in lead the world was such a
different place than it is now in terms
of connecting people and been able to
follow and that's all yes the other
thing is the internet lets you connect
to your teammates your fans all kinds of
stuff like that um it also gives you a
great advantage by the way because the
bag event
we had to do a lot of research myself
which involved going and actually
getting books on the history of the game
and other players and things like that
but nowadays I mean you're a click away
from finding scouting easier it makes it
extremely easy yeah right and so you
know as a as a culture we should
actually be much smarter yeah versus
becoming dumber right because of the
crutch attack exactly no I agree
completely so get into the shoe being
interested in the tech of the shoe I
know you have a big hand in the design
how you put it together how much like
how closely to get to work with the
designer specifically on the tech and
what's going to stream your clothes yeah
yeah because the shoe is always an
extension of the athlete in this case
you know for years I've been with Nike
it's an extension of myself right so the
shoe must um must be something that's
going to help me perform better
yeah but if it doesn't do that we're not
going to create the shoe I heard a story
earlier today about soccer and soccer
shoes and having a low-cut shoe I play a
sport called Ultimate Frisbee hmm
may or may not have heard of it but a
lot of us wear soccer cleats to play so
I kind of struck a vibe with me tell me
about how this kind of stuff translates
from the soccer pitch or cleats or
low-cut queens to the basketball sure so
growing up I played a lot of soccer yeah
and so I've always been a big fan of
sport and so I remember watching the
game on TV is Champions League match and
Sam and they put a lot of torque on
their ankles actually more than we do
why can I create a low basketball she
doesn't make any sense so then I started
doing a little bit more research they
started kind of figuring out how the
ankle actually benefits from being able
to move freely and famous story yes you
put less stress on your knee joints and
things of that nature cause you know
we'll do a little cut shoe but now we
have to really lock in the hill yeah
right because you can't have the Hill
sliding around because it puts puts the
athlete in jeopardy gives them more
makes it more accessible to ankle
sprains and things like that you know
you have to make sure that the forefoot
is really flexible right you have to
make sure your strengthing in areas that
are extremely important where is in the
height shoot you can kind of get away
Bret
those things yeah I feel like a lot of
Ultima players you need to get a low cut
cleat I wear a soccer cleat but then you
get like something for the ankle and
Oriol sacrifice weight and get more on
the ankle right we don't compromise
exactly so this is this is a Flyknit
material this is a big part of the
weight savings tell me about like like
details you had a hand in to design this
kind of stuff yeah so what we did with
it with the Elevens we actually improve
the fly net so we may define a sturdier
made it stronger and and then we've
actually combined technology so we've
combined some free technology we've
combined some zoom and lunar technology
with have been some of the staples with
some of my other shoes but they normally
behave in isolation no they don't
communicate with each other so it's been
our challenge to try to figure out how
to create kind of this marriage between
the technology awesome best of luck in
getting more of that tech-savvy stuff
going I hope you get on top of the game
I would recommend a smartphone right now
but I wouldn't know it's because I don't
know what kind of usage you have
probably I'm a big I phone guy yeah I'm
a big high phone guy ok fair food I
think that's pretty much it thanks for
being a part of this I appreciate the
time and hopefully we get to do it again
thank you awesome</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
