this is the best pocket camera ever made
thanks for watching now but this is a
bit of a secret weapon because first of
all I use this a lot but then I never
really talk to you guys about it so I
realized I figured I should probably
tell you guys a lot more about this
particular device right here I've used
footage from it in a couple of mkbhd
videos I take like all of my Instagram
photos on it now I bring it anywhere I
go when I have an open pocket
so this is the Sony rx100 Mark 2 now I
know a lot of you guys immediately go to
the description and check out the price
and when you guys see the price of this
you're probably going to first say no no
I really don't want that but I urge you
to watch this video first and then tell
me what you think the rx100 mark 2 is
basically a refined masterpiece at this
point it ticks all the boxes and it
makes some improvements over the
original already legendary rx100 mark 1
everything that can be good about a
pocket camera is good about this cameras
so there are already about a million
reviews of the original rx100 out there
on the internet but here's the gist of
what you need to know that makes this
camera so good first of all first and
foremost is the 20 megapixel giant one
inch sensor they put in this thing that
is bigger and more sensitive than any
other camera that fits in your pocket
buy a lot with this bigger sensor you
get better low-light performance a
shallower depth of field and basically
overall better image quality second is
the super fast carl zeiss lens that's f
1.8 at its widest focal length it's so
that's pretty darn fast it's 3.6 times
optical zoom and it also has optical
image stabilization that works really
well there's also a pop-up flash that
can be articulated and used to bounce
light off the ceiling instead of
blinding your subject every time it also
has a 3-inch super-bright articulating
live view LCD that's viewable indoors
and outdoors and can help you get your
shots at pretty much any angle thanks to
that new articulating hinge it has just
about every software feature and mode
you could possibly think of anywhere
from full manual control over everything
and raw or JPEG photos to the full auto
and all the creative modes and even
in HDR it has Wi-Fi NFC a hot shoe it
has a smooth turning ring around the
lens that can be programmed to change
focus or aperture or really anything you
want it takes two chargeable batteries
that last a long time and SD cards up to
128 gigabytes right now and the build
quality all around the outside is all
metal so this thing is built like a tank
and it can be tossed into bags and
traveled with all the time
the controls are well built too they're
well organized and easy to learn and
they're pretty clicky and responsive
when in use and on top of all of that
the images and video that come out of
this camera are stunning they are really
good so even if you think this camera is
the ugliest thing in the world you can't
deny the crystal-clear image quality
colors are very accurate photos are tack
sharp dynamic range is impressive and
basically what I'm trying to say here is
this blows every other pocket camera out
of the water in this department
autofocus while you're taking photos is
super fast very snappy sharp and
accurate and it also has continuous
autofocus during video recording at
1080p which is also constantly very fast
and accurate now I don't know about you
but with a lineup like this there's
hardly any reason to consider any other
pocket camera over this one at this
price point so if you guys remember I
did videos from CES and January in the
beginning of this year where I did some
coverage of an Nvidia event huawei
device sony device and at the end I did
a huge 9 minute wrap-up of all of the
highlights of CES yet 99% of that
footage from those videos came from this
you can actually cut between DSLR
footage and rx100 footage in a single
YouTube video and most people for the
most part will not be able to tell the
difference especially because like we
said the awesome optics the great image
quality and the shallow depth of field
banks with the fast lens and the big
sensor it gives it that sort of DSLR
like filmic look when you're taking
videos with it and on top of all of that
this is what it's like to hold a DSLR
while taking video while this is what
it's like to hold a pocket camera while
taking video freehand this camera could
also be considered may be the perfect
vlogging camera because a lot of the
vlogging cameras you already see on
YouTube are compact and have to take
great quality video on a tiny package
this is
exactly that this is probably even more
compact on a lot of the other YouTube
cameras out there and it takes much
better video quality at arm's length now
I don't happen to do this style video
all that often but if you do like I did
at CES then you'll find that delivers
well pretty much awesome quality and
it's much much easier to do this kind of
style with this than with a DSLR so what
are the main differences between the
mark 2 and the mark 1 you may ask well
the mark 2 here has Wi-Fi NFC a hot shoe
on the top and an articulating LCD
screen on the back if you can live
without these four features then might I
suggest saving a little bit of money and
getting be still godlike rx100 mark 1
and saving yourself quite a bit of money
but I actually really love having the
mark 2 for that Wi-Fi plus NFC
capability which makes it brilliant for
smart phone control so overall the rx100
and rx100 mark 2 clearly an incredible
camera just a really really great buy
for anyone and I would argue that this
could be the full time only camera for a
lot of youtubers out there now I see a
lot of youtubers go out and buy a DSLRs
which is sort of a larger more unwieldy
body for that cinematic look the shallow
depth of field and the quality that you
get but then they never take advantage
of the interchangeable lenses that
you're supposed to use with a DSLR
they'll use the same lens all the time
and I would argue that this is a better
buy because this gets you the same
quality the same image style and it's
smaller it's cheaper and it's just
significantly easier to shoot with like
I said you can get that optical image
stabilization is built in so you don't
have to worry about getting a lens with
that you can use it with one hand and
check your phone at the same time you
can vlog with it is so much more
versatile than a DSLR and it fits in
your pocket and you can take the quality
anywhere it's a great camera so now you
can check the price I know you probably
have it in a new tab anyway but honestly
if I was still giving ratings like
numerical values for devices like this
it would probably be one of those rare
10 out of 10 that just doesn't have any
real flaws to hold the back it's
arguably the perfect camera but either
way thank you for watching this video
and a lot more mkbhd videos are to come
because these are like the two most
exciting months of tech
september/october so I'm really excited
thumbs up for that
most importantly let me know if you guys
want to see more like device like
smaller device reviews like this I
haven't reviewed this camera the one I'm
shooting this on right now I have my
Amazon gear list in the description of
every video and a lot of the stuff on
that list
I have not reviewed yet so let me know
if there are things on that list that
you want to see me make a video about
like I said thanks for watching and I
will talk to you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
