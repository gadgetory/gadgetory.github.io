here and think about this have you ever
seen the perfect smartphone no right
I've ever seen a smartphone hit like all
five of the pillars of a great
smartphone all of those on the nose 100%
it seems like it never happens it seems
like every time you have a new great
smartphone there's always one little
thing holding it back but I think today
that may change today we may figure
something out here so those of you who
don't already know the five pillars of a
great smartphone from me anyway are
great battery great build great
performance great camera and great
display if you can make a smart phone
that nails all five of those things then
you've made a great smart phone that's
worth buying it's harder than it sounds
but that's something to get into
okay great battery life yes this one has
that it may only be a 900 million power
battery but number one it's removable
and number two it's not powering the
most power hungry specks in the world so
I can pretty much guarantee it lasts
longer than your current phone this one
seems to be getting about two to three
weeks of screen on time considering the
screen never turns off great build
quality check so I didn't have to
convince you it's a well-built fell and
you already know it kind of a legend for
that it's a little bit thick but I've
said over and over again that I don't
mind thicker phones it's mildly
water-resistant its dust resistant drop
resistant shatter resistant time
resistant if this thing is really solid
great performance well this thing is
snappy as hell I've been flipping
through the UI a lot not really
multitasking but more just flipping
really fast through the menu options and
I can see pretty much no lag at all so
performance here is also great I threw
some pretty big numbers at the
calculator and after some key work it
seems to handle it just fine not really
sure why more manufacturers Dunkel with
physical buttons but that was really
satisfying I'm not really much of a
gamer but this phone actually is such a
performance beast that it did just
preload games on it they just have games
built in so I pick snake to which seems
pretty straightforward and I pretty much
crushed the high score it did take a
while which shows that can definitely
hold a lot in the RAM I don't know how
much RAM it has but I swear it it
definitely held its own and then great
camera nokia actually took a really
courageous approach with this one and
just straight-up didn't include a camera
at all I mean you know what they say if
you have nothing nice to say don't say
anything at all well if you're not going
to include the absolute best camera why
waste any space just don't put it in at
all so you actually say if you don't
have anything to worry about on the back
of the phone no smudges and also no
camera bump on the back so he used bonus
points there and then great display
okay there's not nearly enough pixels on
the selamat have to take some points off
but overall pretty complete package I
give it an 8 out of 10 I'll definitely
throw the wallpaper in the description
too for those of you asking for it
okay so obviously you've gone to your
subscription box and figured out what
day it is
figured this would be a fun little
project for April Fool's Day happy April
Fool's Day it's funny though and it's
this little project of making this video
I never I learned a lot about these
phones like I never owned a Nokia 3310
this was before I owned any phones at
all so I actually bought like four of
them I just probably just passed Windows
Phone and market share because there's a
lot of really interesting things this
phone does for one thing it boots up
super fast I kind of miss when phone's
booted up just like that
actually has an option to update the
software I didn't try that because it
was hard enough to get the sim card
working but just a lot of cool stuff so
that's pretty much it thank you for
watching this one maybe know if you want
to see other actually old phones like
realistically covered in a video I have
a Nexus One I have my first smartphone
the Droid but there's stuff out there
that we can make videos about either way
thanks again for watching again this is
your annual warning to like not pay too
much attention to your Twitter for you
today but if you want have some fun go
open Google Maps on your phone right now
you're welcome
talk to you guys in the next video peace
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
