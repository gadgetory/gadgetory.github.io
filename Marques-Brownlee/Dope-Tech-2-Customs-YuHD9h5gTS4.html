crispiest lens out there to customizing
a little bit of color where you never
really could this is dope tech number
two alright so in dope check number one
I actually started talking about some of
the equipment I use to make all these
videos starting with the camera the red
weapon dragon but I didn't talk about
the lens on it that is the Sigma 18 to
35 F 1.8 and it is probably my favorite
piece of tech that I own now I have
primes and everything and you can never
really quite match the sharpness and the
image quality from a prime lens with a
zoom but this is a one-of-a-kind lens
and it gets the closest that I've ever
seen the build quality is top-notch much
like the rest of the Sigma Art Series
and it combines a set of specs that you
literally do not see in any other zoom
lens so the 18 and 35 millimeter zoom
which is nice and wide to mid then the
constant superfast F 1.8 aperture
throughout the whole zoom range and a
really close minimum focus distance of
just 11 inches from the base of the lens
so you can get really close to pull off
some basically macro shots with this
lens so that and the image you get out
of it is super sharp from edge to edge
if you want any test footage I've been
using it I'd say probably about 75% of
the shots in my last 50 videos went
through this glass so people ask about
equipment it's pretty easily the number
one lens I recommend there's a Canon
version a Nikon version all types the
one downside being it's for crop sensors
only I'm definitely going to miss it
when I switch to a full-frame camera in
a few months but if you're shooting
aps-c or super 35 or pretty much
anything that's not full-frame and you
have a budget for it do it team Chris B
welcomes you alright so custom tech is
pretty dope and I'm sure you guys
already know that along with pixels and
dynamic range red and black is one of my
favorite combos and I like to see that
in tech when I can some of you might
remember the mkbhd Edition 13 inch
retina MacBook Pro painted and logo
replaced by color world last year so a
year and a half later it still looks
pretty great the paint has held up fine
so that's good news but the laptop
itself is a little dated and I'm looking
for it to be a mobile editing rig so I
sent in a new fully loaded 50 inch
retina MacBook
crow with the same treatment of that
stealth matte black kept the red hinge
and I am now a very happy mobile editor
plus they are now able to paint the
trackpad to so no more silver trackpad
sticking out like a sore thumb this
thing is freaking beautiful and color
where if you didn't know does this with
all types of devices laptops the iMac
smartphones accessories I think they'll
have it for the new Apple keyboard and
Magic Mouse pretty soon and my personal
favorite the mkbhd headphones of choice
custom Sennheiser HD 800 now this is
what a normal pair of Aegis 800 s looks
like silver and black I've shown these
in a previous video pretty classy but
you can pick all the colours you would
want of all the different parts the
hinge the grille and everything on color
where sight size is what I picked and
then this is what it looks like in real
life
pretty clean obviously if you're a fan
of red and black like me this is going
to look hot if not I'm sure you can find
your own colors to suit your setup as
for those curious I have this going into
a whoo-oo do wa7 Firefly right now along
with a pair of Yamaha studio monitors
anyway color war is doping everything
but it's just not cheap and it's also
not fast it takes something like two
weeks for them to accept your shipment
take it apart paint it and ship it back
plus it does void your manufacturer
warranty usually though they do provide
their own but I wouldn't expect to take
this into the Apple store to get
anything fixed so a less permanent less
expensive version of the color where
treatment would be asked in essentially
a vinyl sticker over the top of your
device the upside to a skin is that it
is temporary and it is much cheaper than
a custom paint job kind of like a car
getting a rap versus new paint and you
can change the texture if you want the
only real downside being precision or
how study your hand is the skin from
deep bran you're looking at here they're
all precisely cut but it's really all
about the application process too and
getting that right so they cover almost
all the same devices that color word
does from smartphones right up to
laptops and consoles and they will be
precisely cut so it's just a matter of
you getting a right and it'll look as
good as you make it anyway that's it for
dope tech number two it's a brand new
series so definitely leave your
suggestions in the comments below for
more stuff you want to see in between
all these reviews and I'll talk to you
guys in the next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
