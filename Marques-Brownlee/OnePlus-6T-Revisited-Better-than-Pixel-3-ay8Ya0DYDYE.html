a bit of a different type of video in
the midst of all the Galaxy S 10 hype so
last year I did my smartphone awards for
2018 and that's always a mix of a bunch
of objective reasoning which phones are
best plus a little bit of opinion
injected in there for some discretion as
well but what I didn't have in that
Awards was a favorite smartphone of the
year to use category but hindsight 2020
I kind of think my favorite phones of
last year to use that I ended up using
the most often came down to it probably
toss up between pixel three XL and one
plus 60 and there were plenty of other
good phones that year but a lot of
you've noticed in the past couple of
videos where I'm just using whatever
daily phone it is it's sort of switched
back and forth between one plus 60 and
pixel and one plus and pixel again
that's because in real life I was
getting fed up with one and switching to
the other and getting like missing the
other one in switching back and then
going back and forth it's kind of a
blessing and a curse having both of them
available to me so why was I switching
back and forth between these two main
phones so often for me really it had two
major things to do with the pixel and
it's not the knotch that would be the
performance and the camera so it's a
step away from the oneplus for a second
on the pixel the camera is a plus that's
first of all the pixel 3 camera
consistently takes the best quality
photos of any smartphone I've ever tried
so far and it's kind of not even close
but it's a big but the performance
issues including even in the camera app
itself have stuck with the pixel from
last year so here's the thing there
really are actually two best cameras
there's the camera that takes the
absolute best quality images and then
there's the best overall camera
experience which is a combination of
image quality and speed and a bunch of
other things so pixel keeps for me
winning best camera quality it's that
best camera and I love that about it but
I would give best camera experience to
some other phones the iPhone for its
speed or for its video or for Samsung
for
wide-angle edit just added or the may 20
Pro all kinds of others do the
experience better especially with speed
so that was what was so disappointing so
I've had all kinds of various lag and
performance issues with this pixel after
a couple of months which is
disappointing for a second year in a row
especially when Google makes this phone
I mean you would think they have all
sorts of control over it but when I have
some other apps open or when things like
music apps are working in the background
for GPS apps etc one of the early bugs
would be it would just quit that
background app whenever I open the
camera and that bugs since been fixed
but there are still issues that are not
totally gone
I'm thinking maybe four gigs of RAM
actually really isn't enough so the
oneplus the 60 this is the McLaren
edition by the way that I've been using
for a couple weeks and I really like it
the performance has been fantastic a
plus performance actually it's the
fastest Android phone I've ever used but
and that's another big but the camera
not so great so if the if the pixel had
a better performance more consistently
this would be my far and away favorite
phone or if the oneplus had a better
camera then this would be by far and
away my favorite phone it kind of comes
down to that feeling that there's just
never any perfect phone so the dilemma
is pixel a plus camera C plus
performance or 1 plus 60 a plus
performance c plus camera which do you
choose and for me that was why i kept
going back and forth now i got to give
some credit to the Google camera apk for
those wondering it does make a
difference so you can install what's
essentially a port of the Google camera
app on the oneplus 60 instead of the
oneplus camera app and using that turns
out it's really good it gets you better
dynamic range better contrast and
exposure and even white balance more
consistently and even better detail and
better low-light shots and then you get
a night sight built-in which works
pretty well too but it's still nowhere
near the pixels actual camera in the
detail department and overall image
quality is still clearly going to the
pixel I mean maybe it's unfair to
compare it to the pixels camera because
nothing quite matches up to the pixel
but by itself this app brings the camera
from a c-plus to a B b-plus so
I'll link it below because I think
everyone +60 owner should know about it
now that's of course not the only
difference here's some thoughts I've had
on some other little things between the
two over the past couple months the
display on the pixel 3 is definitely
better than on the oneplus but it's not
massively different enough to make a
huge difference to me you would think
for me you know a pixel peeper a larger
higher resolution display would
automatically take the advantage over
the 60 but then again the 60 has a way
less obtrusive notch but honestly at
this point neither of the notches bother
me that much so the display was a net 0
it wasn't a deal-breaker at all for me
in either direction but for you it might
be different matter of fact most people
will agree that the oneplus 60 has one
of the notches that's easiest on the
eyes for any phone that come out last
year and it wasn't too weird interfacing
with most apps it fits neatly in the
notification bar and didn't get in the
way of icons so if you're one of those
people that really hates notches then
that could actually be a big swing point
for you build quality is also different
between these two in materials and
construction of these two phones
the batteries are different sizes one of
them's water-resistant the other isn't
one of them has wireless charging and
the other doesn't and that turned into
one of the main things I really missed
about the 1 plus 60 is it not having
wireless charging and a lot of other
phones coming out now just generally you
kind of expect a flagship to have
wireless charging and I missed it now I
know they love their dash charging and
they're fast charging is super good but
I have wireless charges in all kinds of
convenient places and it was just really
disappointing to not be able to use them
as I use the oneplus 60 so that's the
one thing I miss and now it looks like
oneplus is probably also not going to
have wireless charging in the oneplus 7
at least according to recent reports
also pretty disappointing then the
speaker of course I got to give that
edge to the pixel as well you know any
time you try to get rid of bezels you
basically have to sacrifice speakers but
the one upside to the pixel having some
of the thickest bezels in the game is it
still has huge stereo front-facing
speakers while everyone else is
including one pluses are pretty average
at best and then there's an operating
system so oxygen OS versus pixels
Android and as I said my review of the
phone's pixels Android is smarter it has
more useful features like call screening
and then now playing song identification
and
top shot a night sight in the camera etc
etc the list goes on but oxygen OS isn't
exactly slacking with features either
it's it's fast and then it's got things
like the shelf it has dark mode it has -
charging it's clean and it also gets
frequent software updates it's ahead of
most of the rest of the skin phones even
if it's right behind the pixels so it's
got a lots of useful stuff on its own so
what it really comes down to and the
point of this video is I really enjoyed
using each of these phones in the
respective times that I use them for
different reasons but the question of is
the oneplus 60 this one better then the
pixel 3xl objectively no it really isn't
actually like if you look at it on paper
you get wireless charging you get water
resistance you get a better camera you
get a better display you get all these
exclusive software features better build
its a better phone than the oneplus 60
but the experience of using the 60 was
often better than the experience of
using the three which is even more
impressive because of the price
difference the 200 plus dollar
difference between these two phones
which is even more if it isn't the
McLaren Edition which by the way just
has two extra gigs of RAM it's not a
crazy huge difference in specs but I
have enjoyed this phone so for those
asking all seven or eight of you
wondering why I keep switching back and
forth it's the performance that keeps
pushing me away from the pixel and then
the camera that keeps pushing me back
easily my next favorite phone to use is
one plus 60 because it's got all these
amazing features and it's got excellent
performance but then I go to take
pictures and I remember how good this
camera is and then I switch back and I'm
disappointed by the performance again
and so you can see how that vicious
cycles played out either way we'll see 1
+ 7 + pixel for this year in 2019 along
with a bunch of other phones I mean this
is an exciting year for phones it's sort
of turned out for those who are asking
if we've reached peak smartphone now we
have a folding phone launching this year
we saw all that stuff at Mobile World
Congress and we have new patents for a
Motorola folding phone and all these
other flagships we haven't even expected
yet the note 10 is totally under the
radar it would be a good year for phones
but let me know what you're looking
forward to we got plenty of videos
coming up on all that stuff including of
course the s10 reviews
let me know what you guys are into
either way thanks for watching this one
talk to you guys later peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
