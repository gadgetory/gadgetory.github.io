let me tell you a quick little story I
usually don't talk about like the exact
gear that I use to make the videos like
on this channel but I am a gearhead and
many of you are too so might as well so
in 2014 last year the camera that I was
using was the Canon c100 and I had been
using that for about a year year and a
half and I've been shooting all Canon
stuff in the previous years all Canon
cameras Canon t2i
60d 5d and then see 100 is all Canon I
wasn't even a brand loyalty or anything
there was obviously other DSLRs Sony
stuff and Nikon stuff but I felt like
Canon stuff did the job for video best
out of sheer curiosity I rented because
that's what people who usually do with
Reds they're very expensive
I rented a red scarlet Mysterium X for
four days just rented one for four days
to try it out I uh I shot some video
with it it seems pretty nice when I was
shooting videos obviously a lot bigger
than a DSLR but I shot some video and
then I imported the footage and I saw
crispy it was I saw the dynamic range
and I saw the white balance slider in
the editor I was using at the time which
was Adobe Premiere and things I've never
been saying now that's a pretty big jump
to make from the Canon c100 and all
these Canon cameras to a red scarlet and
this red line up which is a totally
different workflow totally different
process a different style of shooting I
could go into like an hour long rant
about it I don't wanna make this video
too long but the idea is that was the
entry the entry level for the red
ecosystem now this video is about the
new red ecosystem entry level camera
it's called the Red Raven so I got to
spend some time with the Raven which
comes out soon it's not out yet people
start getting their pre-orders in early
2016 and while this is totally still a
high-end camera is relatively budget and
air quotes in a lineup that can go for
like up to fifty sixty thousand dollars
so Raven will be competitive at around
ten thousand bucks so at that price
you're looking at other cameras like
Sony's fs7 f5 canon c300 Mark 2 C 500
now what makes this raven worth
considering for people trying to decide
well it's the smallest and lightest red
camera ever it's about three and a half
pound
and it's a full-metal-jacket it just
screams build quality everywhere there's
absolutely no plastic to be seen and one
of their goals I'm sure was to get this
like as light as possible without any of
that plastic so not only for solo
operator like handheld stuff but also
for drone stuff and study camp stuff
where it pays off to be light and it's
built on the body style of all the newer
red cameras so it reads the same SSD red
mags it works with the same accessories
so it keeps with Reds theme of modular
everything that's one of the things I
talked about in dope tech number one
where I talked about the red weapon you
can get the brain of the camera by
itself but that doesn't really do you
much you add the extra modules you need
to get up and running to your ideal set
up so for me that would be you know a
single cameraman sort of lightweight
running gun type of quick shooter so the
Ravens body itself by itself is just a
box it's around six thousand dollars but
then it has the SSD reader and the
cannon mountain built-in and then red
has modules for everything else so this
side handle up top you see here with the
red record button built in that's
launching with the camera and that
record button works via a few pins on
the top of the camera talks with the
handle the display on top it's reds new
4-inch display which look pretty clean
to me pretty bright enough to be visible
outdoors it tilts all the way flat but
it doesn't twist that you can plug in
and the module on the back here is
called a jet pack it's kind of like a
backpack to the camera that gets you you
know full size HDMI USB and power to
connect to a battery or you could even
just plug it straight into a wall so
there's all kinds of ways you can
configure Raven as you imagine but
really the best part of a red camera and
like the main reason why it got me so
hooked is the image quality red sensors
and reds color science is just on
another level as far as my experience
goes and I've shot with a lot of other
the other cameras I mentioned earlier
this guy is rocking a 4.5 K dragon
sensor so yes slightly more than 4 K and
at up to 120 frames per second and it's
literally a smaller cut of the same
sensor in my weapon dragon now so that
awesome dragon sensor and it's a 16 and
a half stops of dynamic range and all
the awesome detail red code color lots
of the familiar image quality are used
to from again any of Reds other high
and cameras you could cut between them
all and have no problems now I have to
say this at least once during the video
it's not just the gear that makes the
video at all you guys already know
that's just a part of the equation so
going out and buying this really nice
camera isn't going to suddenly take your
videos to the next level although they
might suddenly look a lot nicer I'm just
saying this is the tool to help you make
something at the end of the day this Red
Raven isn't what you're uploading to
YouTube it's the idea that you come up
with that a camera like this can help
you capture and also like Raven to me is
just sort of like a teaser for the rest
of reds more capable lineup including
this this is the newly announced red
Scarlett W yet no big deal this is just
the only video on the Internet of this
one of one in the world camera it'll
come out right before the Raven in 2016
and it'll have even more of the modular
features you're used to from Red's
higher end stuff like the
interchangeable mounts you can get a
Nikon mount or a like a mount on there
but also at a relatively lower price
than the rest of their lineup
so just throwing that in there so there
you go guys that's my hands-on and
impressions of the Red Raven - cool not
to share so I hope you guys enjoyed and
I'll see you guys in the next one with
some more crispy video thanks for
watching
peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
