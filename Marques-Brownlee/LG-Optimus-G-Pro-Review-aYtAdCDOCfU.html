this is the Optimus G pro from LG it's
LG's first entry into the phablet game
or the 5 inch or larger smartphone form
factor category and they were smart and
took a lot of cues from Samsung's very
popular Galaxy Note 2 and then they took
some design improvements and some spec
bumps and some overall hardware upgrades
and some software tweaks and basically
turn it into the most accurate thing
that we're going to see to the galaxy
note 3 which isn't out yet but this is
probably the closest thing we're going
to see to that for a while so without
any further ado let's take a closer
video look at the lg optimus G pro so
this is a big phone no doubt just like
the Galaxy Note 2 and has a lot of
similarities with its Samsung
counterpart but then each aspect is
slightly improved just slightly so you
can start with the build both phones are
made of plastic but the Optimus G pro on
one hand feels a little bit more compact
in the hand it has a slightly narrower
body while maintaining that 5.5 inch
display and that's because the bezel is
twice as thin as on the note 2 the
Optimus also has a removable back of
course which reveals a slightly larger
battery coming in at 3,140 milliamp
hours a tiny bit larger than the one in
the note 2 and this thing lasts just as
long on a charge I'm talking full
weekend roadtrip companion this is a
road warrior just like the note also
behind that back cover are of course the
SIM card tray any microSD card slot for
expandable storage and up top is the
slightly unimpressive speaker probably
the most unimpressive part of the whole
phone it's a bit small and it could
easily be covered up with a single
finger but you also get the 13 megapixel
camera up there which we'll get to in
just a second other than that though
just about everything about the Optimus
G pros build quality as nearly as good
as it gets on a phone of this size I
mean we've never seen a phablet that's
made of metal so obviously this is as
well-built as a phone that you can
probably get from top to bottom in that
form factor and also the home button
that doubles as a notification LED is a
nice touch the LED colors are great now
flanking that home button are the menu
and back buttons but LG's just flip them
around so they're the opposite of all
those Samsung devices out there so it
took me a little while to get used to
but there's the back button on the left
and the Menu button on the right I guess
if you're going to change something just
for the sake of changing it it might as
well be something small like that but
all around this phone feels about the
same as the Galaxy Note 2 just slightly
different in a lot of ways and then you
get to turning it on and the first thing
you notice even more than that display
is LG's weird lockscreen totally blows
my mind every time I use it but there it
is and that the biggest difference once
you turn it on is LG's display here we
have a 5.5 inch 1080p full-hd super IPS
display as we know the galaxy note 2 has
a 720p display so this display has
excellent color reproduction clarity
sharpness viewing angles brightness
everything about it it's a very good
panel and I love the bezel I love the
fact that it's so thin it really makes
this phone's display stand out it seems
like that's the highlight of this phone
and it should be it's probably one of
the best aspects of it I was initially
concerned about the panel's impact on
battery life thinking that a different
display would have a very different
battery life but like I said before this
one had no problem lasting two full days
on a battery charge with normal use so
that's just a breeze to handle anyway
the next biggest difference and the
biggest thing you'll notice about the
Optimus G pro is LG's skin on top of
Android 4.1.2 LG next to Motorola and
maybe Oppo have probably the most
unconventional far out stock Android
skin of any phone manufacturer today
obviously the lockscreen is one big
change but you'll notice just about
everything about this phone outside of
the lockscreen
has changed too you can see where they
took kids from the note 2 the default
time and weather widget is an obvious
one not too hard to see the similarities
there and also instead of Samsung's
multiple windows running next to each
other LG has qslide which is one app
that can be toggled transparent on top
of the other LG also has a tabbed menu
structure that lets you swipe through
the menus thank goodness but they also
let you switch between the tabbed and
just a full list of all the settings the
default is the tab structure but I kind
of like that they give you the choice to
just get that full list if you don't
really want to drill down over although
it's Android and you can customize it to
look like basically whatever you want
you
make it look however you feel but a lot
of the elements of LG's custom skin like
the credit notification panel for
example are unavoidable every single
time you pull down the notification
panel it's half-full of things like you
know toggles and a slider for brightness
and whole bunch of different stuff there
are also a ton of pre-installed apps
like more than any other phone I've ever
used now I'm using the 18 T version here
but obviously there's not going to be
tons of pre-installed apps on the
international version but there is
definitely a lot of stuff that came on
the phone but overall I like that this
phone is such a great performer it's
that's to be expected of course with the
Qualcomm Snapdragon 600 quad core
processor inside obviously one of the
best processors you can put in a phone
but yeah this thing is a great performer
and constantly surprise me with how
snappy and smooth the experience was
using it probably a little bit snappier
than the galaxy note 2 so that's
definitely a good sign
but overall this is definitely an lg
phone LG really made it an LG experience
and you can see how many cues they took
from Samsung both in the software and
the hardware of course the note 2 has
one of the best eight megapixel cameras
in any smartphone but the Optimus G pro
shooter is 13 megapixels so it takes
slightly more detailed shots thanks to
that extra resolution but nothing all
that crazy it's also not very
contrasting so you lose a bit of that
dynamic range and it's not quite as
vibrant as Samsung's color in photos and
videos from this camera you also don't
get the same interface or the same crazy
features that Samsung throws in there
but overall it's not a bad camera at all
and you won't be disappointed with it
actually the 1080p videos it takes are
really quite good in any kind of light
and I found myself taking pretty much
everything in full auto because auto
does a great job on this phone so props
to LG for that so yeah if I had to
describe the Optimus G pro in one word
it would be LG because this phone is so
LG it's full of LG in every imaginable
way everywhere that there is room for an
LG touch you can expect an LG touch and
these you know these LG touches are all
shots attempting to one-up the Galaxy
Note 2 and I love that it's the
competition that drives us forward and
this is basically the Galaxy Note 2.5 so
in the end the Optimus G pro is an
on phone definitely LG's best yet it's
great in all the same ways that the
Galaxy Note 2 is great you consider it a
small sidestep or even a slight upgrade
from the galaxy note 2 again we don't
know what the Galaxy Note 3 is going to
look like but this is probably your best
bet for an upgrade from the note 2 if
you want to stay in that phablet form
factor and even get a slightly better
phone you know we have a bigger battery
of a higher resolution camera you have a
1080p display you have a whole bunch of
improvements in here so this is LG's
best phone yet I would definitely
recommend it if you're into the LG skin
I personally wouldn't go for it as my
daily driver just because some of the
animations don't quite feel right some
of the software I'm not a fan of and I
don't happen to be a huge fan of the
looks of LG's skin on top of Android
that could change soon but for now it's
a good phone on the hardware front and
it's getting there with the software
