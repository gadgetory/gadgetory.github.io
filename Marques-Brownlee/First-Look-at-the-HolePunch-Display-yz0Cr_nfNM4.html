know how for the past year or so pretty
much every smartphone that's come out
has had some sort of notch in the top in
the middle that's just the way they've
been I've said it before and I'll say it
again
the most interesting designs that we've
seen for the past couple months were
smartphones trying to avoid the knotch
well it looks like for 2018 that that's
gonna be how we get away from it
that's the avoidance of the knotch so
this is what I'm gonna call the hole
punch so yes of course different
companies are gonna call it different
things Samsung will call it the Infinity
Oh display this one we have here is the
honor of u-20 from Huawei they don't
really call it anything so we'll just
call it the hole punch so there's all
kinds of interesting things about this
phone from the blue Chevron back that
changes the way it looks depending on
how light hits it which is really cool
to the four thousand milliamp hour
battery to the 48 megapixel main camera
the six gigs of ram but what I'm here
for is the hole punch display so this
particular version of the hole punch is
through an LCD display so not an OLED
and it's a six point four inch 23 10 by
1080 display so not the highest
resolution but it looks alright and you
can see if they've pushed it to the
edges like a lot of other phones this
past year but instead of having a notch
for the front facing camera they've gone
all the way up to the corner and there's
this hole punched cut out in the
top-left corner of the display so as far
as we can tell this is the future of
smartphone design avoiding the knotch
in 2019 we knew it was coming and it's
one thing to see the leeks and the
renders and another to actually see it
in person the first thing that strikes
me is it's bigger than I thought it
would be I mean I saw the renders and I
think they were a little generous with
how small they thought the aperture for
the camera opening would need to be but
putting in a full camera module means
you'll need the full camera opening and
it's noticeable but you know still not
too bad but then other things I noticed
were really specific to this exact
phone's implementation of the knotch
for example it's not centered even in
the rounded corner of the display it's a
little bit above center to be tucked
further into the notification bar
so as not to interrupt apps below it
which makes sense but it's really hard
to unnotice that it's not centered
and have kind of wish I didn't notice
that like as part of the aesthetic of
the phone is it just looks a little bit
off and then there's also a slightly
darkened area around the whole punch as
if there's a little added shadow
surrounding it I reached out to why way
about this and they haven't gotten back
to me yet but I'll add a pin comment or
a tweet or something if I do but as of
right now I think it's added in the
software because there are other places
in the UI where there's similar shadow
added like the bottom of the display and
party mode or even in the launcher or in
other way way apps if that darkened area
is because of like the way the display
is built because of the hardware or the
way the LCD and the backlight work
that's a different story that OLED may
be able to solve when we see it in
future phones but as of right now it
appears to just be with this phone and
the fact that the whole rest of the
notification bar is shaded it's you kind
of don't really notice after a while
anyway but if you look at it for long
enough you will notice and then overall
you got to think about apps and so far
our apps play with the whole punch
pretty much the same way that they
played with the regular knotch meaning
they ignore the whole space all the way
up at the top there's a section in
huawei settings they still call it a
notch but they let you hide the notch
like go away is that just blacks out the
whole top of the phone and for the most
part full screen apps play pretty well
with it with literally just a hole in
the UI just a hole in the app simple as
that you can watch the videos with a
hole in the screen you can play games
with a hole in the screen it's something
to get used to just like the knotch
and there are also some apps that do
look kind of weird right now because of
things like text up in the corners or
some weird overlapping elements things
that wouldn't have looked quite as weird
with a regular notch in the middle but
again I think people will get used to it
and apps will update as well but yeah
that's as far as the hole punch that's
pretty much it
I think the more phones that we see
start to do this hole punch camera
cutout the more clever ways we'll see of
hiding that hole punch and with like
things like dark wallpapers and clever
gradients and things like that but now
what we got to stay tuned to find out is
what other phones will have the hole
punch cut out so there was the Huawei
nova 4 that was at CES that had the hole
punch already that I got to hold and
take photos of and play with briefly
that's gonna go on sale and of course we
all just saw the samsung galaxy s 10
event that got announced for the end of
February we're all expecting that to
have not only a single camera cut out
but the larger one should have a dual
camera cut out so we'll get to see how
the highest end displays will work with
and twice as big of a camera cutout him
super ready for that and I still I still
wish someone would do it in the middle
like there's no notifications in the
middle there's time isn't in the middle
that's where no information usually
needs to be that's where the not usually
was but as of right now seems like the
corner cutout is the most popular
implementation of avoiding the knotch
in 2019 welcome to the new year either
way let me know what you think would you
rock this phone with the cool sparkly
back would you rock any phone with a
hole punch cutout in it let me know to
think in the comments below thanks for
watching catch you guys the next one
peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
