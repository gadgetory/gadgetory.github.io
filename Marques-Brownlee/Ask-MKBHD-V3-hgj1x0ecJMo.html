welcome to ask me v3 so this is the
third installment of a fun little video
series where I basically answer a bunch
of questions from Twitter and some other
social media for a video and I also have
some questions from the last episode
from the comments section of the v-2 so
if you want to ask questions for the
next ask mkbhd video feel free to leave
them in the comment section below this
video or I might just like answer them
in a comment anyway but either way let's
go ahead and get started I have a bunch
of questions let's go do you edit the
videos that you make for your channel
yourself or we've got people to do the
job so everything that you see on this
channel is completely crafted by me a
hundred percent there is no like second
guy or other behind-the-scenes crew
working on anything it's just me and I
feel like it's sort of like a portfolio
that way of the videos I make and the
projects that I work on what was the
very first device you reviewed the first
one ever was the Motorola Droid the
original og Droid and I was really proud
of that video in fact no shame I'm just
gonna leave a link to that Oh G droid
review right below that like button if
you want to check it out I think it was
kind of good I think I shot that with my
Canon t2i
and like the built-in microphone in my
laptop but I was really proud of it and
I worked just as hard on that video as I
do on my current review so if you want
to check it out there it is do you think
we'll do more news type videos
considering the success of your iPhone
video ah good question mostly because I
I don't know I I guess I expect the
iPhone stuff because so many people are
interested in iPhones I kind of expect
that to do really well but I don't know
if that was a news type of video I still
think that's in my my current style if I
didn't explain video on it and I did
sort of an impressions video on the
materials so I guess yeah I'm still
covering iPhone stuff and what's funny
is my three most viewed videos now in
the past month
according to YouTube analytics are my
three iPhone videos that I've done this
year but either way yeah I plan on doing
the same variety of content that I've
planned on what's your NBA team you
cheer for and what do you think about
LeBron heading to Cleveland so the team
I chew for is the Los Angeles Clippers
and I'm a fan of a bunch of players on
that team
actually Chris polish mark Rock for
DeAndre Jordan but about LeBron heading
home I don't really mind that much I
mean props to him for going home that
seems great especially for Ohio but I
don't really mind that much I'm still
going to be watching Clippers games can
you say boss boss do you own a dog
because you should I don't own a dog
mostly because if I were to like leave
and go like on a trip for ultimate or
school or something I would not have any
place to keep that dog because you know
you kind of have to feed it and walk it
and stuff that's pretty important but I
think in a later time I will probably
end up getting a dog or cat or something
that I can pet what's your favorite
piece of video gear except for your
camera I think I'm gonna cheat a little
bit just because video gear is only a
couple of things and I'm going to say
the lens the lens I'm shooting this
video on now and alums that I shoot a
lot of videos on is a Sigma 18 to 35
I'll leave a link to it below it is
easily my favorite lens ever and I've
used a lot of lenses in my time I've
used some very expensive lenses from
Canon from Sigma and from some others
but this Sigma 18 to 35 is a beast and
it's the fastest zoom lens ever and I
love the wide-angle stuff it's it's
awesome I don't know if I can say enough
about it I've never reviewed it but if
you watch other reviews everyone else
likes it too it's great can we have a
rundown of all the cameras we've used in
the past all right so the video I'm
shooting this on now and what I've shot
for for the last couple months is the
red scarlet may or may not do a video on
the red but I feel like it's a
possibility before this I was just in
Canon c100 for a couple of months before
that I was using the Canon 5d Mark 3
before that it was the Canon 60d you can
see I've used a lot of Canon and before
that it was the Canon t2i
and then before that my first camera
that I ever bought was the Sanyo Zack D
C g10 still an old favorite what is your
least favorite part of doing YouTube
videos Tim that's a great question
because most people ask what's like my
favorite or the best part of making
YouTube videos I would say the least
favorite part is probably just being
like unsatisfied or being your own
biggest critic although it is a pretty
important part of making your own
creative content being like unsatisfied
or unable to achieve
a video look or style that you wish you
could make is is really frustrating but
I guess it's still a motivate a
motivator on the other hand of things so
I guess there's not too much bad about
making YouTube videos what was your
first job my first job I was a caddy a
caddy at a local Country Club I've been
a golfer for more than 10 years now and
being a caddy was like a natural first
job for me to get and spoiler that's a
really good job if you're into golf or
if you're into or want to be into golf
that's an awesome first job to have do
you ever do videos pantsless just
because you can no but now that you
mention it you're right I could
what's one tech device you want to own
but can't other than a Tesla tech device
that I can't own probably the perfect
like the perfect piece of gear like the
perfect microphone or the perfect camera
because it just doesn't exist
maybe that's cheating because the things
don't actually happen in real life but I
would love to have a perfect microphone
that could perfectly isolate just the
amount of sound that I want to record
and block out everything else but of
course physics don't really laugh for
these types of things can you do a
behind-the-scenes video showing how you
make videos yeah so this is something
I've considered doing for a little bit
mostly haven't done it yet because it's
really hard to like do a
behind-the-scenes of how I'm making an
actual video when I don't have someone
to shoot me making a video so it would
be like me making a fake video while I
make a real video about how I make the
fake video kind of difficult I don't
know leave a thumbs up if you like want
to see something like that like how the
videos become what they are sort of
tutorial I guess but it's something I've
considered and I think it might be an
interesting topic at least to cover do
you use art or dalvik on your Nexus so
every phone I've taken out of a box for
the past couple months I always almost
immediately switch it to the art Android
runtime but now that the Nexus I have is
running Android L Developer Preview
there is no dalvik art is the default so
I guess I will no longer have to switch
Nexus is over to artists soon as I take
them out the Box Android runtime is
where it's at what is the one thing no
phone does that you wish they could last
a week on battery without charging at
least I know phones used to be able to
do that how was your experience with the
G watch and Android wear Ben I've had a
pretty mix experience with the G
watch which is the one that I've been
using I'm still waiting for the Moto 360
because I am most interested in that as
a SmartWatch but my time with the G
watch has been interesting number one it
doesn't last very long on battery lasts
a day and a half maximum usually a bit
less than a day and the other thing is
the step counter I don't know if it's
using my wrist as the step counter
instead of my phone sensor because I was
eating breakfast with unbox therapy in
San Francisco after Google i/o and I
took 900 steps while eating breakfast so
that's clearly not accurate so I haven't
just I've just stopped using the step
counter altogether I turned it off but
other than that I like having the
notifications on my wrist like I was
using a pebble for the months before
Google i/o so I was really interested in
how it shows notifications so I like the
G watch as a concept as a proof of
concept but I'm Way more pumped for the
Moto 360 pancakes or waffles definitely
pancakes no question about that fellow
tall person here worst thing about being
tall other people showers other people
showers think about is the rx100 mark 3
significantly better than the previous
versions or should I save my money and
buy a previous version so I've owned
this little rx100 mark 3 uh what I think
is the best pocket camera ever for a
couple of weeks now I reviewed the rx100
mark 2 I would say if you really want
that optical viewfinder if that's
something you actually value in point
shoot which not a lot of people do but
it's an awesome feature then you have to
get the mark 3 and if you really want a
slightly wider lens like you would get
on this it's a 24 to 70 then you have to
get the mark 3 other than that you can
get the rx100 mark 1 and it's still an
incredibly good camera very similar
sensor very similar images there's just
a bunch of slight improvements on the
second version and the third version but
I love the third version and I would
recommend it to anyone who can get it
there you go guys that's just a couple
of the questions I got on Twitter over
the past couple of weeks and from the
last ask me video again if you want to
ask questions feel free to ask them in
the comment section below or follow me
on Twitter shoot me a question over
there I'll answer it just fun quick
little stuff I figured I'd do this video
to get that across either way thanks for
watching and I'll talk to you guys in
the next one bass
