here from mkbhd and welcome to another
hardware review video this one is the
d/s international or the dsi wireless
economic keyboard with a touchpad this
is going to be the hardware review I did
review of keyboard not too long ago and
it was a not really at that
full-featured keyboard but as you can
see if I take this up here this one has
a lot of features for me to go over for
you guys so starting with the fact that
it's wireless we go ahead and flip the
keyboard over here you see it has
batteries in here because it uh it
doesn't actually connect your computer
you just take this out this is your
wireless receiver put the keyboard back
here the wireless receiver is as you can
probably already tell us be so I'm just
going to go ahead and plug that in
whoops is plugged into computer blinks a
few times sets up the drivers and it's
plug and play now if we look down here
at the keyboard again it took me like
three tries to figure this out but if
you go to the other side of the keyboard
pretty much like any other wireless
keyboard you actually have to hit that
on switch right there you have to turn
it on so once you've turned it on you
can also adjust the height with these
little height adjustment thanks most
keyboards do have height adjustments so
once you turn it on and adjusted the
height your set and ready to go so this
keyboard is unique in the fact that it
does have a ton of extra buttons we're
going to start over here on the
right-hand side what you see here is a
huge touchpad well not not a huge such
bed but a very sensitive touch pad I
found I had to do a little tinkering
with the sensitivity of the touchpad it
works almost as well as an actual malice
or the touchpad on the laptop but the
the touchpad is a nice feature to have
on a wireless keyboard you can move
around with it and always have a mouse
wherever you go down here are a number
of buttons and I'll try to zoom in even
more though it's not going to be the
most focused in the world we have an
email button eh sorry this is an
internet button an email client button
keyboard calculator backward and forward
buttons I like that that's pretty cool
at the top we also have a FN lock or a
function lock for the FN key number lock
caps lock and a low battery which is
nice
indicator so if you ever are running low
on battery you'll know that before you
run out in the middle of an essay so
basically the FN button up here the
function button controls a number of
keys along the top of the keyboard and
these are a whole bunch of different
functions so if i have an lock on
instead of triggering SAS 9 + f10 and
all that you actually trigger these
actions up top so if i press f12 it'll
go into the flip 3d here 55 press on f6
little eject the CD so there's a lot of
functions little function things that
you can do with this keyboard now on the
left hand side there are even more
buttons as you can see there's a volume
up volume down there is I'm not sure
with that one is actually we have a
play/pause button record stop back bend
forward button those are backward and
forward from media and a left click on a
right click button so this is almost all
you would ever need for really using a
laptop say you're on a netbook and the
touchpad won't be much bigger than this
so you can actually just attach this to
your netbook and use it just like that
this key actually is not the Windows key
which is right here this key is actually
the media center button which is
actually the same feature as this green
button on the top right hand corner of
this remote which I showed you guys and
that's basically it now they call an
ergonomic keyboard because you can see
here the angle that goes down and up a
little bit with this keyboard is kind of
an ergonomic angle which is nice and i
found that does take a little bit of
time to break into this keyboard
breaking it in you can hear that travel
it's not a really thick keyboard as we
can see the keys are not all that thick
but it is it's a nice sounding keyboard
and it only takes about three or four
days before you can really touch
smoothly with this without making
mistakes the keyboard layout is not that
much different now the other keyboard I
review had a number pad this one instead
utilizes a num lock button and has some
numbers a written in rows here kind of
like the blackberry but that is
basically it for this keyboard I think I
will definitely like using this keyboard
I've gotten a hang of
I've gotten the hang of typing with it
fluidly it's a nice sounding nice solid
build keyboard the wireless has not been
a problem for me it's never disconnected
randomly or anything like that drivers
setting up was a brief and I basically
it so i hope you like this hardware of
