another high definition video with yet
another YouTube update and yes I like to
keep you guys up to date on track with
the YouTube you people more subtle
features that aren't as obvious to you
and one of them which has recently
arisen is not only changes to the
YouTube video watch page but as you can
see by the title sharing YouTube
comments now if we scroll down yes there
are a few change to the YouTube watch
page as you can see here you can
actually see how many likes and dislikes
a video has instead of a chart before
you actually like the video which you of
course should like this the most recent
video and then of course over on the
right hand side instead of seeing that
little chart we could like or dislike
and see how many likes or by hovering
you can actually click this now to view
the YouTube video statistics and I like
this the way it is a chart is very
intuitive and you know to click that to
view statistics but the main point in
this video is actually comment sharing
so if you go you don't actually have to
view all comments to do this but as you
saw when I threw it up on Twitter we can
hover over a comment on the right
there's a share button and it didn't
work for a little bit but it finally
seems to work so you can go ahead and
try to find this exact comment and share
it like I'm doing now so there's a share
button that just popped up you hit that
share button and it doesn't actually
work yet as of right now anyway on the
all comments page so no matter how many
times I've clicked any of these comments
as a matter of fact I can't seem to get
them to share however on the video watch
page for this IQ audio HD r7 review if I
just find a comment this is the test
comment for YouTube video sharing I can
hit the share button and link to this
comment on Facebook MySpace
what's myspace whatever Facebook MySpace
and Twitter so if I go ahead and click
the Twitter button it'll bring me a
separate window where I can see this
comment exactly
check out this comment in quotes a TDOT
CEO shortened via at YouTube and I'll
tweet this and you guys will go ahead
and see that this has been tweeted
signed in as mkbhd and you can go ahead
and follow me there on twitter i'm not
gonna put it on Facebook but I'll go
ahead and I mean you guys know it'll
work the same way on Facebook MySpace
don't even ask me I don't know so you
can go ahead and exit out of that if you
hated by accident but that's really
basically it so if you just get such a
kick out of a comment that you feel the
need to share a comment on a social
network that is now how you do it so you
guys are now free and inspired to leave
amazing comments online videos so until
next time this Ben mkbhd just with a
quick update video about YouTube and
until next time I'll talk to you later
peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
