mkbhd here with a review of the beats by
dre solo HDS by monster cable you've
probably already noted that I didn't do
an unboxing of these headphones and
that's because you probably know what to
expect in a headphone package where
you're going to get with the solo HDS is
the audio cable itself separate from the
headphones and all packaged in this nice
little mesh case and as we all know it's
always great to see a headphone
manufacturer that includes some extras
with their headphones so after that
introduction what I can actually go
ahead and do now is show you what's in
the package and how I've packaged them
alright now we have the beats by dre
solo HDS that are on the main
compartment of the pouch and you
actually have your control talk as what
they call the control talk headphones
that are a nice red and black design in
the pouch that is also within the mesh
case I think these headphones didn't
come with mesh case that it does come
packaged with it would probably be a
whole different deal and not even be a
deal-breaker I don't want to go too in
depth on the package but you can see
it's a nice red and black design and on
the inside it has this pouch on the left
hand side that allows you to keep your
headphones and your cables in the same
pouch so that's a nice little convenient
accessory that they've included and
thrown in when you're buying such a nice
pair of headphones I can't do a solo H
to use headphone review without talking
about the monster cables themselves as
you guys probably know monster cable is
best known for their cable products HDMI
etc and these are no exception the beats
by dre come with these gold-tipped right
angle and straight a cable that actually
comes separate from the headphones so
you plug the right angle cable into your
mp3 player and E because you can see
there's four rings there one for the
microphone and on the left hand side you
can actually plug in a straight angle
cable and that goes directly into the
beats headphones so if you happen to
damage either the headphones or the
cable you can only replace one of them
and you won't have to go out and buy a
whole new separate pair of headphones
you also notice this pretty nice control
talk feature which actually has a
microphone a volume up button a volume
down button and a play/pause button and
those will work with I devices on this
side that plugs into your actual beats
by dre headphones
and I was getting to the headphones
themselves well first of all they're
extremely portable as you can tell by
number one the case it comes in a number
two the nice foldable design it's made
of a durable plastic so you can still
move it around but once you unfold it
and put it on your ears it feels just
about as sturdy as ever also one thing
to note is the customize customizability
of these headphones you can adjust their
width their height you can adjust how
wide it is
it's really quite durable so you can
change it to whatever your head size or
shape is and it's not going to be a
problem one thing to note that I really
like about these headphones is how
comfortable they are I actually wore
these headphones for a six hour car ride
from Pittsburgh to my actual home and it
actually wasn't that difficult to wear
for six straight hours now I did take
them off occasionally to listen to some
other things like the car radio but I'm
telling you right now these headphones
won't be a problem for up to four or
five hours of listening if you're doing
some editing or something like that with
these headphones on now I can already
see the comments about how these
headphones aren't the most durable or
how someone they know actually got a
chance to break their solos or solo HDS
and I'm telling you now those people
were doing something very wrong with
their headphones as you can see about
what I'm doing in this video they're
really durable and will stand up to
everyday use typical music listening
head banging for pretty much a little
life time these are really really
durable headphones if you really throw
them around or don't use a pouch and
then just put them in a backpack or
something they might have a better
chance of breaking but if you get take
good care of your headphones you won't
have a problem with the solo HDS now
pardon the appearance of a Zune HD in a
video where the control talked on these
headphones doesn't actually work for
anything other than I devices but I
obviously don't have an Apple piece of
hardware to demonstrate this with so I
can show you my best with a Zune HD the
right angle cable goes into the Zune or
your mp3 player this could even be your
cell phone and the straight angle
actually goes into the headphones and
BAM just like that you're connected and
ready to listen to some music you can
use the control talk end of the cable to
talk to people on the phone as there is
a built-in microphone and you can also
control playing and pausing a music and
volume increase and decrease on your
iPod iPhone or iPad overall I have to
say this is an extremely nice pair of
headphones and by far the best I've ever
used and these are going to become my
and editing headphones from here on into
the future and I definitely want to
thank monster cable for sending these
out to review I'm going to give these
headphones and nine and a half out of
ten for one or two reasons actually one
because the control talk feature doesn't
actually work for the Zune HD or the
Droid that I'm using and second of all
because these headphones after the six
hour car ride that I went on started to
get uncomfortable so if these headphones
were somehow ridiculously durable and
didn't have any comfortable issues and
actually the control talk worked with
all the mp3 players in the world these
headphones would be a 10 out of 10 in
other words if you've got durable ears
and an iPod go for these headphones so I
hope I've told you all you need to know
and until next time mkbhd signing out
