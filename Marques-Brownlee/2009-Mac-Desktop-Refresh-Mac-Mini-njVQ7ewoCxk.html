related video what's up guys and today
I'm just gonna go over with you what
exactly Apple has done yesterday that
made a big release a lot of big things
happened yesterday in the world of tech
so I'm just gonna go over with you aqua
and maximize this in a video serious
step of them and I'll put them together
in a playlist so I'm gonna have a bunch
of videos about what Apple has done so
there's been a whole desktop refresh
basically so this is going to be video
one about I'm gonna try to cover the Mac
minis today Soto to discover this
basically go to apple.com and go to the
Mac tab apple.com slash Mac and we're
just going to go to the left and find
here we go about halfway over and find
the Mac Mini just click on it the first
thing you're going to notice this it
says faster now I'll get to that
then it says greener and still mini now
we know it's still mini okay but when
they say faster the first thing you're
talking about is five times faster
Nvidia graphics performance and also a
processing improvement so when they say
faster they're using the new nvidia
geforce 9400m graphics processor
bringing you supposedly up to five times
faster graphics performance as you can
see on the screen here and you can also
view the performance jar I'll just click
on it here so you guys can see there you
go previous baseline Mac Mini and the
new Mac Mini seven times better and you
can use the Apple cinema displays notion
is really really sleep so it says the
2.2 gigahertz model compared to the
previous 2.0 gigahertz model so it'll
probably be more like here if you're
going with the baseline baseline Mac
Mini that's new so that's the first part
when I say faster number two is that
they say up to four gigabytes of memory
and we all know Apple likes to put in
that ddr3 memory I don't know if they're
doing this with a Mac Mini quite yet but
that is very good four gigs of memory
again it's a desktop so it should have
all the baseline features that a Mac
that a desktop does have and it's the
Mac Mini so we saw that we've all seen
that video of the first dumb
the guy's spinning around the new Mac
Mini several days before they release it
here on apple.com but you can see as I'm
showing you guys here I'll probably
highlight it there are five USB ports on
the back and we can go around and see
the power button we see the Kensington
lot audio in audio out mini DVI firewire
800 I do believe I have firewire on my
laptop's as well mini DisplayPort and
maybe Gigabit Ethernet so that's a
pretty basically out 5 USB ports is very
good and I give a decent amount of
expandability again it's a baseline Mac
so you're not gonna get an amazing specs
or anything but so bring your own
keyboard displaying Mouse they all
they're also expending what you can use
with the Mac Mini it's basically a
laptop well I want to say that it's it's
got the specs of a laptop but it's just
a small desktop basically this is the
least expensive Mac Mini and I'll go go
over to the price for you at the top of
their website if you go to buy now we'll
see there's more than one model actually
there's a base line 2.0 gigahertz with
120 gigabyte hard drive ok
that's gonna use a 90 400 m graphics
already and it has a 2.0 gigahertz Intel
Core 2 Duo processor and you'll get only
one gig of ram with this model but again
it's baseline it's only $600 so um I
mean they're okay specs is for someone
who's just doing again word processing
they want a simple baseline Mac OS 10
Leopard you know they're not going to do
that video editing or anything on the
Mac Mini on the baseline Mac Mini so
that's what you're gonna get it's not
that hard the second one is the the new
faster one the Intel Core 2 Duo the 2.0
gigahertz with a 320 gigabyte hard drive
which is slightly larger actually it's
got some decent sized hard drive for a
desktop it's not you know it's not again
it's not an iMac it's not a Mac Pro 2
Mac Mini and this one's $800 because
you're also getting 2 gigabytes of RAM
and if we do select it you'll see
there's a number of customization
features we can actually go even more
in-depth say I want to get the 2.2 6
gigahertz processor that's $150 add-on
you can get 4 gigs of ram like I showed
you
also I said it works with the Apple
cinema displays you can get one here for
$900 of course I I'm not gonna recommend
that quite yet
of course the Apple keyboard mouse I
would go 9
over that in a later video but that's
basically it so the new Mac Mini starts
at six hundred dollars if you're looking
into it and yeah that's basically it so
again if you guys have any questions
about the new line if you have any
questions about the new line of Mac
minis just should subscribe and send me
a message and I might do a video on it
I'll answer your question as much as I
can but again there's a new Mac Mini
there's a new iMac there's a new Mac Pro
there's a live phone I got a lot of
videos to do so guys stay with me here
and hope you like this video so thanks
for watching and subscribe and there
will be plenty more tutorials to come
thanks for watching this one face</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
