related video and in this one I'll be
going over exactly not my predictions
but what we actually want from the next
version of the iPhone software the
iPhone third generation software so
we're all familiar with the first
generation iPhone the second generation
iPhone was iPhone 3G and the third
generation iPhone software is coming out
I don't know about anything hardware
wise but I definitely know what I would
like in terms of software so I'm just
going to be going over a number of these
things with you guys today the first
thing that I would like is obviously
cutting pace has been a big thing
missing from the previous generation
iPhone um if I were to bring out my LG
Voyager right now I could copy and paste
from a notepad document and send it as a
text as a text message or I could copy
and paste from a website and send the
URL to of someone by a text message so
that's just one of the things that the
iPhone of software has really been
lacking and that could have been like
the next big thing for the iPhone a cut
and paste feature so that's the first
thing the second thing is that the
iPhone the current software cannot
forward a text message or cannot send or
receive SMS messages or MMS messages
which is picture messages or video
messages I hate to bring it up and over
and over again but I have a very basic
media phone the LG Voyager and
forwarding message is very easy but how
many how often do you actually get a
message um saying like without a message
in it that you want afford to someone
else you can't do that you can forward
email is just fine which is great but
that text message forwarding feature is
non-existent in a current iPhone
software and the other thing is MMS
messaging you can't send or receive
picture messages obviously the email
climb is very good you can send and
receive pictures and email but the you
can't do you can't do picture messaging
via text message on the iPhone software
anyway I still haven't told you guys
what my two current phones are so the
first one I'll show you is the LG
Voyager that's the newest phone that I
have I've been a Verizon person my whole
life so I'm not my whole life but the
latest two phones that I have are from
Verizon and the next one is this this
little flip phone here my first actual
flip phone I thought it was the coolest
thing in the world but um so this is the
my old
phone and you can see on the front it's
a verizon phone okay
any LG Voyager is obviously Verizon so
I'll be comparing the oil it features
like I'm having an actual hard camera
button so that I can take pictures like
just stuff like that I'm comparing what
I've had in my experience with other
cell phones to what I would like in the
newest version of the iPhone soft one
what about sending up sending
appointments to contacts that's another
useful feature that should be included I
think by default on a lot of business
phones and again the iPhone 3G it's very
good phone but the ability to send a
counter appointment to a contact which I
do have on this phone here um this is a
really nice feature actually if you want
to tell someone like I'm wearing when
are we meeting or something you could
just like pull it up in your calendar
shoot it off to him and put the phone
down and you're done instead of telling
him it'll be at this place at this time
and you have of course up and down
keyboards so it's not going to be a
fastest in the world but I understand
the current version of the software but
I'm just thinking of things I would like
to see and then the new version of
iPhone software so we'll see what they
release we'll see what comes out and
I'll I'll keep looking into this kind of
stuff oh yeah and there's no weekly
calendar view for some reason there's
daily there's monthly could we have the
ability to save an email as a draft I
know we can do that on a lot of cell
phones now I have never texted with an
iPhone but I can on my current phones I
can save a text message as a draft
I can save an email as a draft in the
iPhone client there is no such thing you
cannot save an email as a draft and come
back to it later and I understand it so
it's a business phone as well as an a
messaging phone as well because you can
have applications and games on it but
why not be able to save an email as a
draft that would just be nice I know
they introduced the new Macs deleting
feature in the new version of the iPhone
software but that that'll be pretty cool
I would like that and last but not at
all least flash support on the iPhone
what everyone wants their iPhone 3G to
support flash okay it's been a big thing
everyone's like why isn't the iPhone
have flash oh I mean not a lot of phones
do have flash but just the fact that it
is such a great phone great graphics
great screen resolution okay great web
browsing everyone would be like well if
it had flash it would be just awesome
okay flash support would allow you to
stream music on from a website play
games online and I mean the App Store
kind of solves a lot of that criteria
but it's paid so if we can have just a
really great built-in flash support on a
new version of iPhone soft while wrap up
this video because it's probably getting
kind of long but yeah that's what I
would like out of the new iPhone
software I can't expect much from
Verizon to acquire the iPhone I mean
AT&amp;amp;T and iPhone and Apple are just still
rolling solid but again if Apple were to
put the iPhone on more than one network
they would definitely get a lot more
money out of it because not everyone on
Verizon is begging to get their LG there
right now nothing no I wouldn't mind
having an iPhone on Verizon so anyway
that is what I like at the newest
version of the iPhone software coming
out Tuesday March 17th stay tuned for it
go to Apple comm continually check your
Mac rumors your Apple comm for updates
and that is basically it so I'm thanks
for watching this one and I apologize
about the quality again because I'm
using a webcam here but if you do have a
suggestion for a camera I should buy and
looking for a HD camera Corder send me a
message to subscribe and also I do lots
of tutorials so just subscribe and send
me a message and I'll do whatever
tutorial you guys come up with so thanks
for watching this one enjoy peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
