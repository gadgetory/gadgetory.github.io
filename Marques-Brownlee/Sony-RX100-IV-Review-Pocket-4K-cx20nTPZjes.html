and this is the sequel to the best
pocket camera ever made two years
running this is the Sony rx100 mark for
now I've already reviewed the rx100 mark
3 in detail last year so I'll link that
video right below the like button and if
you guys already seen it you know I like
that camera a lot so the rx100 mark 4
will be basically a very familiar camera
to people who have used any previous
rx100 right so the mark 2 here as you
can see it had a hot shoe on the top
then the mark 3 the next year ditched
that hot shoe for an optical viewfinder
and now we have the mark 4 which feature
wise is like an enhanced version of the
mark 3 so the new cameras rocking a
stacked one inch 21 megapixel sensor as
its biggest new feature behind the same
24 to 70 millimeter glass and this
sensor allows for things that make this
camera a lot faster than previous
generations that's the big difference
autofocus for photos is blindingly crazy
fast you can now take photos with a 30
mm of a second electronic shutter that's
really fast and you can out record video
in full 4k and there's also now a high
frame rate mode that allows you to
record video at up to 960 frames per
second it also has a much improved
electronic viewfinder so if you flip it
out and if you actually use this EVF
you'll notice it's right away a lot
sharper than the last one it's actually
kind of trippy when looking at like a
shallow depth of field shot through the
viewfinder kind of looks like a VR
headset and it can actually now be
disconnected from the power setting so
you can close the EVF without turning
the camera off if you want and that
famous ring around the zeiss lens on the
front of the camera is improved too it's
a little bit thicker a little bit
smoother and overall better built and it
can still be used to control things like
aperture or zoom or even manual focus if
you wanted to and then you can't forget
the articulating LCD screen the pop-up
flash that can be used to bounce light
off the wall or the ceiling and the NFC
and Wi-Fi chips inside to let you
instantly transfer full resolution
photos from the SD card to whatever
smartphone you have so all this inside a
metal body that can take a beating it's
built like an absolute tank I mean this
is a seriously well rounded pocket
camera speaking of SD cards though you
gotta mention
you have to make sure you get the right
one only certain SD cards will work with
the 4k video other photos and stuff will
still work but you need specifically a
uhs-i you three compatible memory card
to shoot in 4k I'll link the one I use
below to avoid confusion the slow-motion
stuff was actually really cool I think
at 240 frames per second you can pull
off some really cool stuff and even at
480 frames per second you can really
start to slow stuff down a lot and yet
keep a lot of the quality sony says
you're getting 720p video out of it
though I think at this point we all kind
of know that it's not quite 720p video
but it looks pretty good anyway since
it's so slow and then ah 960 frames per
second gets to the point where it really
doesn't look that good anymore I'd
actually stay away from this even though
you can get it super super slow
when slowing back down to 30 frames per
second it doesn't look anywhere near
720p and it's very noisy and grainy so
it's kind of a neat trick up its sleeve
that you can record a few seconds at 960
frames per second but I wouldn't use it
all too much and I'd stick with the
lower frame rates for the higher quality
but the one feature that I and a lot of
other youtubers were really interested
in when this camera was first announced
was its 4k video and it looks really
good
I love the 4k video that comes from the
rx100 Mark 4 it can be seriously
beautiful
none of that upscale 1080p or over
sharpened over-processed looking
smartphone video this is a huge step up
from that and it looks really good it
has optical image stabilization color is
on point
dynamic range is great and has a big
enough sensor to get some shallow depth
of field going if you can give it a
second to focus this camera can give you
like the best-looking videos the
best-looking vlogs even in the business
I don't know how many bloggers care
about quality like this but the camera
takes some seriously crispy video case
in point
my entire last video about the moto x
style was shot you guessed it on the
rx100 mark 4 and it was actually kind of
the perfect application for it it was
all indoors where the light wasn't that
great but I shot an S log so I could
really push the images in grading
without losing much quality and I don't
know you'd much of a zoom range either
inside since my subject is right in
front of me so if you enjoyed the
quality of that video
boom right there is your six minute for
halo light video sample but is
definitely not perfect first of all the
autofocus during video is definitely
slow this is actually usually the
typical experience here with shooting
video with the rx100 and also sort of a
bigger complaint of the previous ones
and remains if you're shooting with a
shallow depth of field with a lot of
subject isolation and a blurred
background the camera can take a while
to focus on objects that aren't faces
also in this shot thanks to Michael
Fisher of PocketNow for being the model
here it basically refused to focus on
the subject I wanted it to it was an
autofocus mode if I did go to manual
focus I would have been able to nail it
but it wasn't so I had to scrap that
shot and you're also limited to five
minutes at a time of 4k video recording
but not for processing reasons or
anything it's actually just because of
heat this thing makes a lot of heat when
shooting a lot of 4k video and actually
chews through battery really quickly
during this - this is the rx100 mark for
after just the first five minutes of 4k
recording and in the middle of my third
consecutive clip of doing this it just
shut down from overheating and refused
to turn on for about 10 minutes I
actually dealt with this problem at the
Motorola vent literally standing there
in the event playing with the phone just
holding the overheated camera waiting
for it to be able to turn on again but
then again if it's making super-crispy
videos like that I can't even really be
mad so at the end of the day this camera
is really great but not quite perfect I
would still put it as the best hybrid
like pocket video camera in the world
for photos and videos if you're into
both but as far as it being a thousand
dollar video camera it's kind of hard to
consider this like the perfect YouTube
camera I know a lot of people have said
like this you know because it shoots 4k
video and it has such a crispy image is
basically like the perfect camera to buy
to start a YouTube channel or even run a
YouTube channel you don't have to buy a
thousand dollar camera to start but if I
would nitpick I would say that this
isn't the perfect YouTube camera because
of the slower autofocus because of the
fact that if you want to shoot in 4k
you're limited to five minutes and then
it'll start to overheat and if you want
to shoot for long periods of time you're
basically using this as a 1080p camera
which means you might as well get the
mark 3 and then the fact that you can't
use any audio inputs and the microphone
that's built in isn't all that great
you know if I'm nitpicking for a
thousand bucks you could probably go
with something like a
DSLR I'll try to link some other options
below or even like I said something like
the rx100 mark 3 but I think this is one
generation away from being something
really incredible I think that rx100
mark 5 is probably going to be able to
next year shoot 4k video without
overheating without a 5 minute limit and
might even have audio input maybe if
Sony's listening to us so this is a
pretty great camera to start good job
Sony I always thought the first pocket
camera you've ever made but uh looking
forward to the rx100 mark 5 already
thanks for watching and I'll talk to you
guys in the next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
