to be taking a look at episode two of
YouTube tips and yes this episode is
about graphics so in this episode I'll
just be talking to you guys basically
and give you guys a few imagery of the
following things that are pretty
important to YouTube graphics so pardon
me if I look to the side which is where
my notes are you're going to want to
have a logo a channel design or banner
if you happen to be a YouTube partner a
video banner which is above your video
your intro which is actually a moving
graphic and as an added bonus you can
also have a watermark now I actually
have been changing around with my
watermark a little bit so I just kind of
have like a temporary watermark that you
guys can check out and leave feedback on
but you also might be interested in
making all these things in the same sort
of color scheme to make it easy to
remember so as you can probably already
tell all of my graphics are in some sort
of form of red black and white and the
three colors combined happen doing my
favorite colors but those three colors
together are pretty important to a
consistent color scheme now how exactly
do you go about creating these images
well there are a number of ways that you
can try and a number of ways that you
can let other people try my intro was
created using a template and using a
tutorial from another youtube user I
don't even remember where I got it but
it took me a couple days to actually put
together and it's only five seconds long
if you want to hold an intro contest to
let other people who are already
watching your videos actually try to
make an intro for you you can or use
other people's tutorials to do so with
still graphics like your channel design
your video banner or your watermark i
really suggest getting getting to know
gimp give this one of my favorite pieces
of software it's free it's an
alternative to photoshop cs5 and it's
almost as powerful it's a very very
powerful piece of software so if you get
to know gimp and i think you'll you'll
find that that's one of my favorite
piece of software and could be one of
yours
you can make some really nice graphics
now my channel banner and background
we're both made with Photoshop however
my video banner my watermark and all the
other still graphics on my channel were
made with GIMP so that goes to show you
that it can be pretty powerful so
overall in my opinion it might not seem
like a big deal to you but I think that
when you're just starting out or when
you're actually building your brand it
can be a really good idea to establish a
really solid color scheme that people
can remember you by whether it's a blue
and white or red and black or some
orange and black or something crazy but
honestly it's up to you and you can I
like I suggested try to get to use GIMP
and watch some GIMP tutorials there are
some really great users out there I'll
probably try to link a few up right here
that can help you out a lot with GIMP if
you message them or just watch their
videos so there's been mkbhd with quick
episode episode 2 of getting your
YouTube videos together more
professionally and this has been on
graphics stay tuned for episode 3 which
should be coming up I'll probably be
making these videos once every week or
so maybe week and a half or two weeks
they're kind of difficult to make be
surprised either way
see you next time mkbhd signing out
peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
