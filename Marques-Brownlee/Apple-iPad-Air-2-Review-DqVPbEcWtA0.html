this is the iPad air 2 now this can be a
pretty simple relatively easy review
video because we saw the iPad air one
did a review video of it last year and
overall as a category these iPads and
basically any large tablet have sort of
slowed down into this iteration year by
year we see them get a little bit better
but there aren't that many drastic
changes made so really the easiest way
to show this is to give you a list of
the ways it's changed versus the iPad
air one so these are all the changes
made to create the iPad air 2 so number
one is the iPad air 2 is thinner and
lighter than the first iPad air so the
first one was already really thin and
light but this new air 2 is just 0.96
pounds so lighter and 6.1 millimeters
thin so thinner than any other tablet
out there and believe me that translates
really well from paper and just numbers
to actual hardware and holding in the
hand so the build of this thing is
almost surreal it's completely made of
metal all around which is great and it
has rounded sides and chamfered edges
all the way around too and it kind of
just feels like the display is attached
to almost nothing as at this point I
mean this is kind of the reason why I
say it feels like large tablets are
hitting their stride right now if you
show this iPad air to someone 10 years
ago or even five years ago you'd
probably flip out and think it's
impossibly thin there's no way that's
real but it's not just about fitness the
fact that it's also lighter means it's
just as easy as any other tablet to hold
in the hand and while it's definitely
not a one-handed tablet it's much easier
to hold with one hand and type and poke
with the other hand when this habit is
so light like this so the side bezels
are thinned out a little but there's
still plenty of room to rest your thumb
so overall it's really well thought out
I mean the design we've seen it before
and it's sort of set a standard for
build quality and it's pretty deserving
of the name the only quirks with this
new thinner and lighter hardware is that
the mute switch that's been on the side
of every single iPad and iPhone since
the beginning is now gone it's been
replaced with a software toggle in the
quick settings of iOS 8 and I don't even
think that the tablet is too thin for
this it's just a I guess a design
decision by Apple a conscious choice to
not
have it but the other downside of going
so fin and light is the space inside is
a little bit smaller and that means you
have a smaller battery but the thing is
it's still a great battery life for a
tablet I didn't even notice having to
charge it more versus any other iPad it
has great stamina that's basically all
day with any use and has a classic iPad
ridiculous standby time where you can
leave it at 85% not use it for a week
and pick it up to use it and it'll be
right ready I'd like 82% so technically
yes
it is a smaller battery it's a 15%
smaller cell coming in at seven thousand
three hundred forty million powers and
yes I should be mad at them for
sacrificing battery just to make it
thinner again but it's at the point
where I haven't actually yet noticed a
difference in battery life so I guess
that's something iOS on a tablet has
going for it now one of the biggest and
best improvements of the iPad air 2 is
its new display it's still a Retina
display and it still has the same 4 by 3
aspect ratio and 2048 by 1536 resolution
still the same great colors and color
reproduction brightness levels and
everything like that but it's now a
fully laminated display which actually
ironically means less air between the
glass and the panel so this and the
anti-reflective coating is supposed to
give the new screen a much more
glare-free look like the image is closer
to the surface of the glass and I
actually thought it pretty much seemed
like I was touching the pixels like the
image was floating right on top of the
iPad as I touched it and the Retina
display looks great except I already
thought that about the old iPad screens
so maybe they all look great honestly
you probably won't be able to tell the
difference until you see them
side-by-side actually think time AUSA's
speed test video accidentally does a
really good job of showing a difference
between the display on the iPad air 2
and the original air I'll link that
below if you want to watch it but
besides that I did notice a little bit
of a black gap around the edges of the
display just a little bit of a gap it's
something I've noticed other laminated
displays have too and it would be a
little distracting sometimes but a lot
of times I just didn't even notice and
it would be less noticeable on the gray
iPad which has black front bezels
instead of white another improvement
with the air 2 is the specs inside so
the air 2 is rocking Apple's new a8x
chip
which is their best mobile chip yet by a
long shot and without getting too
technical it's essentially a triple core
three core processor and you also now
finally for the first time in Apple
tablet history get two gigabytes of RAM
now the a8x is chip it's incredible it's
super powerful it's really thermally
efficient this tablet basically never
heats up on me and it powers iOS 8 as
smoothly as you'd expect I mean this no
hiccups here this is iOS 8 at its finest
there's not a whole lot of extra stuff
going on obviously it's just a grid of
icons but it better be this smooth in
2014 with specs like this but on a
tablet I've said this before everything
feels like a blown-up version of the
phone interface here on the iPad it's
not really taking much advantage of all
those pixels and all that power and with
2 gigabytes of RAM you would think Apple
would find some awesome seriously
advanced iPad multitasking stuff to
throw in there but it's still the same
interface as any other granted I'm sure
apps will stay open in the background
longer without having to refresh but
honestly unless you're doing some heavy
gaming or messing with some 3d graphics
apps or something really intensive like
that you're probably not going to notice
the spec difference between the air 2
and the original air even though it is a
lot better so that brings us to the
little things there are just a couple of
other little things sprinkled in there
to make this iPad air 2 a really
compelling tablet for a lot of people
that they'll hopefully try to get them
to spend their money on they upgraded
the camera now yes I know it's rocking
an even better 8 megapixel camera it's
essentially the exact same optics as the
iPhone 5s and sure I'll give credit to
Apple you're right the iPad is probably
the best camera viewfinder out there
technically that's true and as beautiful
as it might be to look in front of your
face it still doesn't mean you should
take pictures all the time or video with
your tablet but hey the f-15s took
pretty good pictures so now so does the
iPad you also get touch ID now the thing
print sensor over the home button that
you can use to unlock the tablet but it
kind of stops short of a lot of
potential I mean there's no NFC so you
can't use it for Apple pay but there are
no multiple account sign ins on iOS for
example so you can't sign in to a
different profile with a different
fingerprint stuff like that's missing
I guess it's still the early stages of
touch ID technically but basically it's
just for unlocking right now but it's
there and also got to mention that super
reflective Apple logo which was a
fingerprint magnet like crazy but when
the tablets clean that thing is a
serious eye catcher and the speaker on
the iPad which was very very very loud
so it's actually so loud that it
vibrates the entire tablet at its
loudest volume and then when you put it
down on a sort of a vibrating surface
like a wooden table the chassis makes it
even louder so it resonates through
whatever surface you put it on so it's
kind of funny it's not the best quality
in the world and it's still sideways
facing but the loudness was impressive
so overall as a whole package you gotta
admit the iPad air 2 is pretty sweet
even though I'm more into smaller
tablets at the moment like the Nexus 9
and the iPad Mini and speaking of the
iPad Mini the iPad Mini 3 which has come
out recently I didn't even want to touch
it or talk about it at all but
essentially just for those of you who
are curious it is the same exact product
as the iPad Mini 2 with Retina display
just added a gold version and touch ID
so what this essentially means is the
previous version which dropped $100 is
now a really good deal and if you want
to continue spending full price to get
touch ID and gold that's up to you but I
wouldn't recommend it I would recommend
specifically buying the iPad Mini 2 if
you're into a smaller iPad but I'm also
going to be reviewing another smaller
tablet coming up soon the Nexus 9 and a
whole bunch of other things I like I
said November is a pretty busy month for
tech but has been my impressions of all
the stuff that's new in the iPad air 2
and you can choose for yourself if you
think that's worth upgrading I
personally would say hmm for some people
but again it's up to you
so that's been it thank you for watching
and I'll talk to you guys in the next
one peace
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
