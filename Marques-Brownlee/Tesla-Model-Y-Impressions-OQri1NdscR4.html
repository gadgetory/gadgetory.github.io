what's up guys
we're out here in sunny warm much warmer
than the East Hawthorne California and
we're out here for the Tesla Model Y
event and I say we cuz it's you and I
but it's I'm out here we're out here so
for the like four of you who don't know
model y is going to be the fourth in
Tesla's s3x y lineup so it kind of
completes it so a Model S and Model X
are the big the big car and the big SUV
they're more premium they're more higher
priced and then there's the model 3
which we're kind of starting to see
everywhere especially in the US is a
smaller slightly lower priced because
the lowest price they have car and so
model Y is gonna be essentially an SUV
version of Model 3 so this event out
here in beautiful Hawthorne why I'm here
this is the big reveal this is where
they're finally gonna show us the design
the specs and the price and maybe
they'll start taking pre-orders or
someone who knows maybe yeah maybe a
surprise or two also you could tell by
the reflection I don't know how Casey
and Peter and I you guys vlog with this
one DX this is a gigantic camera but uh
we'll get to it I actually really wish
really wish I had a swish pot right
about now so some of you may be
wondering why model why why model why is
even a big deal at all or even if it is
I think it is I think model why I could
end up being a bigger seller than the
model 3 and it's because I mean we've
seen model 3 sort of rise up in the
charts of best-selling cars over the
past couple months that it's been out
but the best-selling SUV is especially
in the US the best-selling SUVs are
constantly way outselling the
best-selling cars so I think model Y has
a potential to be a much bigger seller
than even model 3
and so there it is one of the very few
tech products of the past year that
didn't leak so this is your first public
look at the Tesla Model Y so my first
reaction is seeing it first rolled up on
stage was a yep
looks about right looks like a bigger
model 3 a little taller but you know
from the front angle on stage very
familiar very similar and the specs of
course are similar too so it's going to
be 230 miles with standard up to 300
mile range with the long range version
and then you can see the acceleration
number is pretty modest if you ask me if
you're not getting the performance
version but of course the performance
one is zippy at 3.5 seconds zero to 60
and the price range and release dates
are all here it's gonna start at 39,000
but similar to model 3 they're not gonna
be making that base model cheapest
version right off the bat they're gonna
make the higher end more margin filling
models starting in fall 2020 then the
base model at 39,000 will come by 2021
also you may have noticed when they got
that car up on stage 7 people got out of
it so Tesla is saying model Y is a 7
seater with 3 rows of seats that is
something I had to see in person because
that's a it doesn't look that much
bigger than model 3 but that's exactly
what I did so when Elon was done on
stage we got to go outside and see it in
person a bit more for ourselves go for a
test ride and take a closer look now
seeing it outside and driving in a
different light basically the more
angles I see it from the more I see it
as basically a hybrid in design between
the Model X and the model 3 it's like
the two of them had a baby or something
and really it's mostly model 3 since
it's sharing parts with it but with a
few differences so one
it's bigger than model 3 that's the
obvious one - there's an all-glass
panoramic roof now which looked really
cool and seamless but was literally
impossible to get footage of tonight 3
the ride height is a little higher and
that's on purpose so you sit a little
higher in the same seats in this
crossover than you would in the model 3
4 I think the front trunk should be a
bit deeper as well that is me
speculating they didn't let anyone
open the front trunk or rear trunk but
it looks like that should be the case
and five speaking of trucks the
hatchback so it is now an automatic
lifting rear liftgate
that is great for cargo I love the Model
S hatchback I've had all four tires in
the back of my car the other day so I'm
happy to see that that's gonna be great
for space and then number six with all
that extra space there is a third row
option now and we saw seeing it in
person it looks extremely cramped and my
gut reaction is I don't recommend it if
you need three rows worth of people on
the regular and get a bigger car like a
Model X type of size because if you do
put people on the third row yeah you
better hope they're either smaller or
much younger because the legroom and
Headroom seem to be both extremely
limited Model X has more space of course
and number seven something I found
really interesting so if you look at the
parts where there is normally Chrome on
the model three so the door handles the
window trim the mirror pieces where it's
normally really shiny all of these
pieces on the model y as you can see are
sort of a satin matte black color and it
turns out that's the way it's gonna be
there are no shiny chrome pieces on this
car it's like a factory chrome delete so
you don't have to get your car wrapped
to get rid of the chrome anymore so I
think that's pretty sweet not a lot of
people notice that and that's mainly it
so I mean you know I got my 30 second
test drive like everyone else who waited
it was pitch black the footage was
almost useless but hey I got to ride in
it and one of the angles that you
actually don't get to see as much in a
lot of the videos you're gonna start to
see is the back of the car like the butt
of it to me it kind of looks like a
model 3 with the lights but then with
the tall shape of the Model X but no
spoiler so again very hybrid like and
the interior as far as steering wheel
and display and the seats and everything
is exactly the same as the model 3 so
basically if you like the model 3s looks
you'll like this if you didn't like the
models 3s looks then this is going to
change your mind or anything but that's
about it I mean all the time I got to
spend with model Y who was pretty brief
hopefully we get to spend more time
it's soon maybe we can do an autofocus
episode in the daylight sometime that
would be sick
also bonus I got to spend a hot minute
with the 2020 roadster first time I've
ever seen the car in person actually and
sweet baby Jesus that car looks
incredible I want it to exist so bad
right now
so many things about it like the carbon
fiber in the wheels the rear diffuser
the screens on the inside the seats the
color the arrow the bodywork everything
so hot I really hope it's on time that
car is sick anyway that's been it guys
hope you enjoyed your first look at
model why the affordable slightly larger
model 3 with the third row option and a
hatchback liftgate I do I really do
think it will sell more than the model 3
because of the utility but only time
will tell so stay tuned for more videos
either way thanks for watching catch you
guys in the next one
