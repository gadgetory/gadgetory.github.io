another HD video review and today we're
going to be taking a look at the monster
mobile jams headphones now I want to
start off this review by saying one
thing and it's actually written on the
case that comes with it
light is too short to listen to bad
headphones and to be honest if you're
going to go out and spend over $100 over
$150 on an mp3 player say your Zune HD
your iPod something like that why on
earth would you stick with the standard
air bugs that come with it the twenty to
thirty dollar ones that come with the
mp3 player not bashing Apple not bashing
Microsoft for throwing in terrible
headphones but I just want to say that
really consider spending more money on
your headphones than just the Tarble
ones that come with it
so if out any further ado these are the
monster jams and I'll be honest I really
like the case despite all the writing it
has on it says monster has a little tag
here jam on blood is too short for bad
headphones and all the gems and it's a
really nice felt sort of design it's
very durable at the top it's magnetic
and inside we have the motor jams
themselves now taking them out like this
brings me to point number one this is a
one of the few monster headphones that
does not have an anti tangling cable
however it does untangle fairly easily
so as you can see here this is the wire
and this is the bugs themselves so we'll
start on this end and work our way to
the buds we have a three a half
millimeter headphone jack obviously
audio jack very standard it's also
gold-plated but it is not the right
angle cable I think the one thing I
would suggest is I guess about these
headphones is to for them to include a
right angle cable instead of this
regular cable I really like the right
angle Campbell with the other monster
headphones anyway moving our way up here
I'll include the length of the cord in
the description then about halfway up or
a little more than halfway up we get
this section here this is a you'll
probably see this in a lot of headphones
but this is where a lot of the chrome
ena starts you'll have this piece to
slide up and down and adjust how close
they are how close these two wires are
together two years but this is where it
splits and this also does say monster on
it if you can there you go it says
monster then on the other end we have
the focus of this review
and I'll have to go ahead on penguinese
these are the mobile jams bugs
themselves there are a lot of
interesting things about these that
first caught my attention but I really
gotten used to pretty quickly number
ones that they are pretty shiny they are
very durable if you haven't seen the
video review or the video testing these
they ran over these with a tractor for
crying out loud so these are very
durable second of all they are kind of
heavy as a matter of fact and they're
made of solid metal and you'll pay the
price and the thing that I notice is
when I was walking with these they did
tend to move around my ears and break
the seal and come loose but I'll tell
you what's sitting down these are some
of the nicest in your headphones I've
used in a very long time now taking this
off here you can see it does have a
pretty large driver and that's
definitely going to reproduce bass
frequencies nicely but I noticed is the
mids and highs really really good I was
impressed by the mids and very very
impressed by the highs of the noble gems
so the right is a right hand side red is
right and blue is left so that's
basically it for the mobile jams you're
going to get like I said pretty good
quality for in your headphones when
you're just sitting down and listening
to music I wouldn't really suggest use
for walking around and using in-ear
headphones but I typically haven't had a
great experience with in ears but these
have been really impressive now I might
be open to try a different pair of in
your headphones in the near future
we'll see how that works out but these
are a pretty impressive pair of in-ear
headphones
pretty good sound quality very good
build quality up here down here on the
audio of the cable and into your mp3
player could probably use a little bit
of work and it's not quite as heavy duty
as these guys but they are very very
strong earbuds that's about all I have
to say about the mobile jams by monster
I'd like to thank them of course for
sending these for review and that's
about as much as you can say about
headphones so until next time there's
been mkbhd signing out peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
