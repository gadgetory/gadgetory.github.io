this is the Samsung Galaxy s7 edge and
by popular demand this is a quick video
about just all the differences between
the galaxy s7 edge and galaxy s7 and
maybe which one you would want to pick
if you're torn so this video can be
pretty short because samsung's
simplified their lineup a lot from last
year where they had a galaxy s6 galaxy
s6 active galaxy s6 edge and galaxy s6
edge+
this year we just get two phones galaxy
s7 and galaxy s7 edge that's it so first
off there are different sizes yes the
galaxy s7 is a sort of a mid to large
size phone with a 5.1 inch display but
the s7 edge is firmly in big phone
territory at 5.5 inches and then
everything else about the displays on
paper is the same so they're both these
bright quality quad HD Super AMOLED
displays and then of course the larger
display has a slightly lower pixel
density number but you won't notice
they're both ridiculous and the s7 edge
is rocking that curved glass on both
sides which earn it its name the glass
just kind of overflows over both edges
now something barely talked about
besides the different screen sizes is
some other dimensions the galaxy s7 edge
is 0.2 millimeters thinner and 5 grams
heavier than the regular galaxy s7 now
being heavier makes sense since it's a
bigger phone but the bigger problem of
the old s6 edge was the sides being hard
to hold since it felt kind of like a
blade in the hand but Samsung did some
work with new shaping on the back and
side metal rails here of the phone are
different this year and it's not as hard
to pick up or literally a pain to hold
even when the edge is so thin so the
shape of the edge is still very much
different from the regular s7 but it's
less dramatic while still being easily
one of the prettiest phones out there
hands down now one of the other Hardware
things is the larger galaxy s7 edge also
has a pretty significantly larger
battery now since it also has a bigger
screen the translation to battery life
is a little less significant but I
actually do see a bit of a difference
I'd say maybe 10 to 15 percent longer
battery life in
the s7 edge thanks to the bigger battery
and that right there is enough of a
reason for me to really like having the
extra space inside and then lastly of
course what occurs on either edge of the
display Samsung built in some software
into the s7 edge to take advantage of it
and a software is better than last year
but could still be better here's why so
it still has this tab to swipe out from
the side to get to some shortcuts and
then you can keep swiping of course to
move between different pages of
different styles of shortcuts so first
of all you can choose where exactly this
tab is on your screen just kind of lives
there you can put it top right top lower
right top left if your lefty bottom-left
wherever you hold your hand it's
supposed to be easily accessible with
your thumb and you can have it be
smaller bigger more or less transparent
even invisible whatever and then you can
choose which edge panel shows up when
you swipe so if you don't want the
contacts shortcut to show up you can
just turn that off or you can add stuff
like a sports scores spoiler tab then
there are a couple more things that
aren't you know on by default like
weather and a compass they're all
disabled but then there's a little mini
store a Samsung mini store just for
buying and downloading more of these
tabs there's only about like another
dozen but hey if you find something you
like you can buy it so apps edge is cool
right it's just a couple shortcuts to
your favorite apps from wherever you are
if you get into a certain app a lot then
you can always have it at your
fingertips from just a thumb swipe in
used to need a third-party app to do
that now it's built into the software
the next one over is called task edge
where you can add shortcuts to different
actions within apps so like switching
opening just the front-facing camera or
starting a stopwatch inside the clock
app stuff like that now fun fact years
ago way before this phone came out I
used to do exactly this on my galaxy s3
with an app called swipe pad swipe pad
still exists today and still does all of
this as good as the edge display feature
here if not better because samsung's
version here it only features a couple
first party apps 9 to be exact and some
of them I don't even use so I would love
to be able to add third-party apps like
opening up a new tweet function in my
Twitter app or a shortcut to open up the
camera inside the
we're just little stuff like that but I
can't do any of that none of them are
supported there is so much that can make
this tasks edge section like my favorite
Android skin feature ever but I just
don't think they even plan on adding
support for third-party apps so for now
it's just a couple of things that you
may or may not even use anyway past that
you have people edge for your contacts
and you know the layout you sports thing
this favorite NBA or NFL or hockey or
baseball or whatever sports teams you
watch and I throw any calendar in there
to for myself but that's pretty much it
you can swipe between these tabs from
wherever you are on the phone and
they're quick and handy access and
that's about it for the galaxy s7 edge a
bit of software a little bit of curvy
glass that make this phone different
from the regular s7 which has its own
entire review of course everything else
is the same from the camera to the
speakers to the buttons to the internal
specs both flagships in their own right
so at the end of the day the answer to a
question a lot of you guys were asking
is which one I prefer between the edge
and the regular s7 and I definitely
prefer the edge for the two reasons one
I have bigger hands I usually use bigger
phones and two I'm a bit more of a power
user and the larger battery is
definitely a big help here I would
almost never recommend actually the
regular s7 over the edge unless you
really don't like the edge features or
we have particularly small hands but
even then the regular s7 is not the
smallest phone in the world anyway so
yeah I tend to recommend the galaxy s7
edge a lot more than I recommend the s7
that being said thanks for watching this
quick video let me know what you guys
think which one you guys like more in
the comments section below that like
button and I'll talk to you guys in the
next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
