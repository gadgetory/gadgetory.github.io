welcome to the smartphone Awards 2017 so
we do it here I mean there were a lot of
phones released over the course of this
year from different manufacturers in
different styles and different price
ranges with different features all kinds
of stuff like that so this show is the
best way to figure out the best of the
best of what's come out in the last 12
months so the way we do it here is I'm
going to declare in each category a
winner and then also if there are some
other good ones I can declare a
second-place sort of a runner-up which
is also really good in that category and
then maybe some honorable mentions every
single phone on this desk was released
during 2017 that's actually that hasn't
always been true about this show but
that's true this year you can check me
on that so there's a lot to choose from
so let's get started so category number
one is best
big phone so phones keep getting bigger
every year there's almost no way around
that even with the shrinking bezels and
I'm a big phone person not gonna life
there's a regular version and a plus
version of a phone I'm taking the plus
I'm taking the XL or the bigger one and
so these are gonna be the best phones
that take the most advantage of having a
large amount of space so big display big
battery big features etc and the winner
for that category for 2017 is gonna be
Samsung Galaxy Note 8
the note 8 does it all and in spent a
kind of a staple big phone for a while
in their lineup the biggest reason I
usually want a big phone is for a big
screen notate has that it's the best
display on any phone has a pretty big
battery it has big optically stabilized
dual cameras it has a big stylus for
those who are into that big specs and of
course big software features to take
advantage of being such a large phone I
still remember when the first Galaxy
Note came out like the first two were
such a staple in like that tech on
YouTube community cuz that was like the
phone that had everything you would take
that phone to CES cuz it had the longest
battery life and a replaceable battery
this is still that slight step above
Galaxy s8 in their lineup it kind of
always will be that way
and holds a special place in my heart
for that reason but there is a runner up
and that came from actually a pretty new
player in the space I mean it's as new
as you can get they exist in the space
for the first time this year and they
happen to do a really good job of taking
advantage of so much space in a phone
and that's the razor phone the razor
phone is an awesome use of being big in
a world of these super thin bezels this
phone is bigger than normal and
shamelessly so it keeps the huge bezels
and inside them it fits these huge
speakers which are pretty much
best-in-class
and it also happens to have a huge 4000
milliamp hour battery it doesn't have
quite as many you know big screen
features as say a samsung phone it
doesn't have as much split-screen
multitasking fun it doesn't have a
stylus and all that stuff but it's just
a good use of space in the hardware
department for being such a big phone I
really like it so the next category is
best compact phone and this is a rare
breed not gonna lie like the compact
flagship smartphone is much less popular
just because phones are still getting
that much bigger so the definition of a
compact phone has changed in size
especially but for me the definition is
still going to be one that keeps as many
flagship features as possible in a small
package and so for that reason the
winner of this category is iPhone 8
iPhone 8 is a legit flagship to a lot of
people it has all the highest end specs
and almost every single feature of the
iPhone 8 plus except for the dual
cameras and it's in the smallest package
so it's easily the most compact if
you're a small hands person if you want
the lightest smallest device possible
iPhone 8 is gonna do that for you it
kind of got overshadowed by the slightly
bigger iPhone 10 and even bigger iPhone
8 plus but if you're looking for
obviously a great camera a pretty solid
IPS display if you're still into the
fingerprint reader on the front touch ID
is still extremely fast I mean this
thing is complete so that's getting the
best compact smartphone but if you're
looking for a runner-up in that category
I think it's a no-brainer to give that
to a slightly bigger phone but still one
that keeps all the flagship features of
its Big Brother and that would be the
pixel 2 if their biggest complaint is
that you don't get the better camera of
the iPhone 8 plus on the iPhone 8 pixel
2 has the exact same camera as pixel 2
XL it's a little bit boxy and has a
little bit bigger bezels but you still
get front-facing speakers you still get
a great display and you still get all
the same specs and features as you do on
the bigger phone so this is another
smaller version of a phone that does all
the same things as its bigger brother it
might even have a better screen than the
XL also another honorable mention shout
out to the galaxy s 8 for being by far
the best designed compact phone the s8
plus is its bigger brother but you still
get the infinity display and of course
all the same specs as the s8 plus in
this smaller phone so again if you're in
a smaller phones all the features of the
bigger brother will come from those so
the next category is best camera and
this was a good one this year obviously
everyone here on this desk has a camera
on the back and most people take most of
the photos in their life with their
smartphone camera and the winner for
this year this category actually took
such good photos and videos that it
spoiled me to the point where I didn't
want to use some other phones this year
because the cameras just didn't stack up
it was that good they've always been
good but this year was particularly
great the winner for best camera in a
smartphone is Google pixel 2
this was a pretty easy one for me the
photos and videos from this guy but
particularly the photos are ridiculous
from pixel to and pixel to excel awesome
detail dynamic range sharpness fast
focus image stabilization low-light
performance as it's pretty much great at
everything and it's just super easy to
use and on top of all that the portrait
mode is incredible with one camera so
again it does the same thing in the
pixel 2 &amp;amp; 2 XL I'm gonna link all the
reviews of all the phones I talked about
in the description below that like
button so if you want to see all the
sample photos and you hear me rave in
detail about each one then you can check
that out but for now just know that
pixel 2 takes the best photos you can
get on a smartphone my runner-up is one
that I think actually does better video
just because 240 frames per second slow
motion high quality 1080p video is
severely underrated and that comes from
the dual optical image stabilized camera
wildung iPhone 10 not a lot of cameras
are capable of what this thing is in the
video Department and it fits in your
pocket which is awesome but I think most
importantly despite its exposure
problems iPhone 10 photos have the best
colors like if I could combine the pixel
twos image processing and dynamic range
and portrait mode and sharpness and
detail and all that with the iPhones
colors I totally would so the next one
is best budget phone so this is gonna be
the one that gives you the most smart
phone for the least amount of money
that's what it's all about you can ask
people everyone has a different
definition of budget if you say what's
the best cheap phone cheap means
something different to everyone but
either way you look at it this winner
has the best smartphone bang for the
buck the most phone for the least money
and that one is the 1 + 5 t
that's because for the price this thing
really is a flagship from the design the
all-metal build the thin bezels the dual
cameras the high-end specs eight gigs of
ram it's not skimping anywhere it even
keeps the headphone jack but in a year
where we've seen phones costing seven
eight nine hundred even a thousand bucks
the one plus 5t does almost everything
they all do and it starts at 499 lat is
serious bang for the buck and that's why
it wins the award this year now a lot of
people might be thinking wait a second
500 bucks
isn't quite what I would consider budget
and I agree again cheap is different for
everyone so I'll give my runner up to
Moto G 5 Plus which is still the best
phone you could get under 300 bucks in
fact it's probably closer to 200 bucks
now we reviewed it so long ago earlier
this year but it's still the best bang
for the buck under that price range and
also give an honorable mention to Huawei
honor 7x all these phones are doing
great things for the money and I'll
repeat what I have said before good
phones are getting cheap well not so
much we still get thousand-dollar
flagships but cheap phones aren't
getting really good so the next category
is best battery life this is pretty
simple right we just look for the ones
that have the longest lasting battery
that will last an entire day us heavy
users look for long screen on time and
we look for being able to take it off
the charger early in the morning and not
touch it again until late that night
with no issues and the winner for that
category has been the razor phone
so another award for the new comer in
2017 razor phone made a great use of
that space that big chassis and that
huge inside they put a four thousand
milliamp hour battery in here and it
showed it lasts a really long time they
built this phone around gaming so a lot
of their decisions were around gaming
eight gigs of RAM
because it'll make gaming better big
speakers because it'll make gaming
better huge battery because gaming is
really battery intensive but a lot of
those things just make a better phone so
if you're not gaming all the time
razor phone still has a huge battery
which means it lasts almost forever so
that's why I won the award this year
I'll leave the full review link below if
you want to check that out but also give
some runner-ups
or sort of an honorable mention to two
phones that lasted a really long time
one is pixel to excel the OLED display
stock Android and huge battery did great
for it lasted all day for me pretty much
every time and also my iPhone 8 plus is
still the king of standby time it's a
huge battery and a smaller display
because of those big old bezels but that
just means it lasts you all day and if
you use an iPhone you kind of know
already this thing is really good so
this next category is my design award
and this is one that's actually kind of
evolved over the years because it used
to just be the one I had the craziest
design it used to be the best built
phone this year in 2017 is going to be
the one that I think has the best combo
of design and build and that's going to
go to another newcomer for this year and
it's the essential phone
this was one of my favorite and most
polarizing phones of the year
I really couldn't recommend it because
when I first came out of fell short and
a couple other categories like the
camera and battery life for the price
that we're trying to charge but now that
they've dropped the price so much I
really think this is one of the best
looking phones to come out and it's
worth the price again it's a ceramic
back titanium sides and there's all
different ways to handle super thin
bezels but this not really drew on me
and when you actually look back at using
the phone I got used to it really quick
I liked it a lot and I think overall
this one's the design award so now that
I've ruffled your feathers with the
notch I do have some runner ups also and
I'm gonna give that to the iPhone 10
again for getting rid of the home button
the iPhone had huge forehead and chin
bezels for so long that even if there is
a notch
I again got used to it really quickly
and I think getting rid of the home
button was a major step for it so that
gets the the runner-up award and also
give it to Galaxy s8 and si plus the
super clean design from the review
you've already seen but the overhanging
glass on each side it's not everybody's
favorite because of the curved edges and
some potential accidental screen touches
but I think it's super clean and it's
hard to argue it just how good it looks
being this class sandwich and the super
sleek design so that's my design award
so this next award is for the biggest
bust of the year there's a bust every
year I hate giving out this word because
you want to be positive and you want to
focus on the best of the best because
there's so much good but some just stick
out like a sore thumb and and just are
not a good use of space for some
particular reason so the bust of the
year for 2017 as you probably saw it
coming is the HTC u ultra
ya know this this one takes the cake
worst phone of the year for 2017 just
not a lot good to say about this one I
don't want to spend a ton of time on it
if you watch the review on it or if
you've seen the title you know exactly
how I feel so I don't want to spend a
ton of time on that but if we move on
quickly to the next award to chill out
the HTC elevate comments section this is
the biggest comeback of the year it's
the most improved player it's just
sometimes you have to fall down hard to
take your next biggest step up and I
think that's exactly what HTC did this
year because then HTC u11 came out and
it turned out to be great
yeah this thing had a lot more going for
it it has obviously the sweet
color-changing back which I'm a big fan
of but just generally was a really good
phone had a much better camera it didn't
add a headphone jack but had speaker's
had a really nice display and a nice
software experience from HTC and these
phones would also introduce us to that
squeeze feature with the
pressure-sensitive sides to launch
something that we would later see in the
pixel 2 and to excel so that was really
cool to see and then even later in this
year HTC came out with the HTC u 11 plus
which I don't have because it never came
to the US but that wasn't even more
complete more impressive phone that
thing had an even better camera it had
an even better design to see through
back that I think looked really cool so
yeah HTC's year kind of went something
like that but then had a thing like that
they kind of had come back Player of the
Year written on their forehead from the
beginning and so that brings us to the
MVP and the finale the best phone of the
year to come out in 2017 and there I
mean there can only be one but there
were so many great phones that came out
over the past 365 days you know pixel 2
had its highlights LGV 30 probably the
most underrated we had 1 + 5 t doing big
things for low prices even huawei mate
10 Pro flying on the radar iPhone 10
making waves so many big new phone names
coming out
razor phone essential phones so if we
didn't expect to see but there's only
one MVP there's only one most complete
phone of the year and my winner for that
is the Samsung Galaxy Note 8
this is actually the most complete
smartphone that came out this year
honestly the biggest problem I have with
this design I know there's a lot of
glass phones out right now is the
placement of the fingerprint reader and
that is a nitpick for a lot of people
everything else about this it's
waterproof
it keeps the headphone jack it has a
stylus it has a huge battery it has
great software experience it has the
best screen on any phone it has dual
cameras both optically image stabilized
it has big specs lots of RAM fast
processor loud cameras expandable
storage the dimension is water-resistant
already I mean this thing is super
complete it is expensive and I think a
lot of people have trouble spending a
thousand dollars on a phone but if you
were to you would want it to be as
complete as the note 8 so I actually
don't have a problem with its price this
probably could have also technically won
Comeback Player of the Year considering
what happened to the Galaxy Note 7 which
was bust of the year for exploding at
everyone's pockets the bezels is thin
and the overall design it's kind of what
a lot of people are looking up to again
if Samsung could move that finger print
reader down a little bit I would be
really happy but Galaxy Note 8 is the
MVP and have some runner-ups to my first
runner-up for MVP is gonna be the pixel
2 XL this phone again also has a lot
going for it it has the best camera in
any phone in my experience it has the
best software and the fastest updates of
course already to Android 8.1 the finger
parameters in the right place it doesn't
have the headphone jack but it has great
front-facing speakers the display on the
XL is probably the only one that really
kept it holding back but this is the
phone that I have used for the longest
time this year that my SIM card has been
in as my daily driver for a couple of
months I keep coming back to it so
that's why I give the first runner-up to
the pixel 2 and then my honorable
mention is gonna go to iPhone 10 just
for finally shifting what it means to be
an iPhone because honestly be an iPhone
in my mind before this thing came out
meant not having modern design and not
having thin bezels on the top of the
bottom and has changes that this has a
modern design and thin bezels now it's
also paved the way for a bunch of other
thousand-dollar phones to come out now
that this is so damn expensive but I
like that it's paved the way for future
iPhones to also be modern and clean and
admirable in the design department the
way they haven't been
so that's a good start so that's it
that's the best of what's come out this
year in 2017 not a bad year if you ask
me as far as what came out and whether
you're a person that has you know a
preference for low budget phones or if
you like big phones or compact phones or
if you need an all-day battery whatever
you're into whatever you need from a
smart phone you can probably get it and
it you'd be hard-pressed going wrong
with something on this table right now
more phone cameras got so good that I
just I'm more encouraged than ever to
take photos with my pixel to the display
has got so amazing Galaxy Note 8 looks
like a freaking movie theater if you're
looking at it in the dark but there's so
many good things to focus on that it's
just fun to look back at the stuff that
came out over the year and that's part
of why this series is so fun but yeah
that's pretty much it if you got someone
you know that's looking to buy a phone
around this holiday season you should
probably send in this video but until
then until the next one thank you for
watching talk to you guys the next one
