welcome to your first look at the retail
shipping packages for the iPhone 8 and
the iPhone 8 plus so these things are
about to start shipping and these are
the boxes you can see the little glass
details on the front and there's only
three colors of this phone right off the
bat silver which we have this new gold
which we'll get into and Space Gray no
red and no jet black at least this time
around for right now but the small
detail you may have noticed the box for
this new gold colored iPhone which I'll
call it like a blush gold is actually
not white it's an off-white like the
cream color on the back of the phone so
the more you know but either way let's
take into the iPhone 8 first so it's a
pure white box and you get your
paperwork up top above the phone and
then the iPhone itself so pretty much
identical to last year so here's the
glass packed wireless charging iPhone
and all its moderately new glory but
we'll put that to the side for a second
to look at the accessories it comes with
which surprise are exactly the same as
last year I swear this is an iPhone 7s
wall adapter earpods the Lightning audio
dongle and your Lightning charging cable
okay great so let's look at this this
new colored phone this new gold for the
iPhone 8 plus in its cream-colored box
and copper colored accents and all that
again has the paperwork on the top which
is actually still white so not cream
hopefully you can see that it's kind of
hard to show on camera but then of
course you get the iPhone itself white
front again both these lighter colored
phones have the white front only the
Space Gray iPhone 8 has the black front
bezels so long story short these both
look very familiar because they're super
similar to last year in design the glass
back is new obviously but you have
identical dimensions to iPhone 7 so any
cases you have from that phone will also
work with these and most of the changes
are on the inside and the speck bump so
let's fire this one up I actually went
through the setup process for iOS 11 and
it was mostly the same with putting in
my SIM card and sign
- Wi-Fi and Apple's accounts and all
stuff like that the one thing that was
new was true tone so you can choose now
to turn right on the true tone color
display right out the box or not which
is pretty cool of course you know is
just that later so I flew through
everything and once I finished one of
the first apps I want to take a look at
like last year was geek bench on geek
bench for here says iPhone 8 plus with
the AAA 11 Bionic chip has three gigs of
RAM again compared to the six or eight
gigs that we're seeing in some Android
phones now but we did that CPU benchmark
and it did pretty damn well
as you can see so it comes out with a
comparable multi-core score to the
snapdragon 835 in this note eight but a
massive single core score which is
awesome for everyday activities like
thinking around the user interface and
quick animations and things like that so
that's good to see and you also might
notice the iPhones display looking a
little warmer here here is the toggle
for the true tone display responsible
for that on iphone eight me flipping a
switch here doesn't make a huge
difference on the camera since my video
lighting is pretty much on point but the
true tone will make a bigger difference
in places I outdoors or with more harsh
lighting so that's something we'll
explore more in the full review but
that's pretty much what's new with the
iPhone eight first experience I think
the best way to appreciate the slightly
new design is to have it next to the
same color iPhone 7 which you can see
had since it's metal like a bit more
texture to the aluminum back you can
actually feel the cutout for the Apple
logo where on the iPhone 8 this new one
it's more under the glass so you can't
feel it by running your finger over it
and also there's no FCC markings on the
bottom of the new iPhone which is why it
looks cleaner and it's just a bit
heavier feeling because glass is after
all a heavier material than metal but
yeah I guess what I'm really trying to
figure out is is this new gold a good
color I mean I mentioned it in one of
the previous videos the gold kinda looks
I think pale in the middle is the word
the glass to me it kind of looks a
little bit light like the rails on the
side where it's still metal I definitely
kind of like that it's a gold metal the
ring around the home button and the ring
around the camera cut out it's a new
look but then the middle of the back
just looks so sandy I don't know I think
I would stick with the silver or Space
Gray on this one but that's up to you
let me know
you think full review is coming soon and
also iPhone 10 coverage when that's
available but until then hit that
subscribe button thank you for watching
and I'll talk to you guys the next one
