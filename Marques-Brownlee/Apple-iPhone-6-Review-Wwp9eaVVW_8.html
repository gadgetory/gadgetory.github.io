this is the iPhone 6 plus in my iPhone 6
review I mentioned that by upgrading to
it from an older iPhone you get a bunch
of the benefits that naturally come with
a larger display and an overall larger
device with the iPhone 6 plus all of
these differences all the pros and all
the cons are magnified they're amplified
by an even bigger device so if you're
trying to decide between the 6 and the 6
plus hopefully I can help you by going
over these benefits and drawbacks as
someone who's used both phones benefit
number one larger display so the iPhone
6 plus has a 5.5 inch 1080p display
versus the iPhone 6 is 4.7 inch which
means everything you look at on the
screen everything you interact with the
panel that you're staring at all day is
bigger so you get a bigger keyboard for
an easier typing experience especially
if you have big thumbs like me you can
watch videos bigger and game bigger and
browse the web bigger and read more
documents bigger basically anything
consuming media is bigger it doesn't
necessarily show more information but it
so is the same amount of information in
a larger and generally more enjoyable
way plus if you have games and videos
that are 1080p the 6 plus will fully
take advantage of them now despite how
huge this display is Apple doesn't
really do a whole lot in iOS 8 to take
advantage of the extra real estate
besides the extra row of icons and reach
ability so really essentially it's just
a blown-up version of the iPhone 6
experience which is fine
I just wish they've done a little bit
more like I mentioned but one thing you
can do on the iPhone 6 plus that you
can't do on the 6 is home screen
rotation anywhere so you can go 90
degrees to the right or you can go 90
degrees to the left if you want or
sometimes and I don't even really know
why you would do this but you can go
completely upside-down 180 degrees in
fact sometimes I end up taking it out my
pocket and unlocking it and it's already
upside-down and I have to wait for the
animation to flip back honestly I think
it's pretty silly I think they should
remove the upside-down rotation but yeah
home screen rotation is a thing and yeah
you also get a slightly more spaced out
keyboard so it's much better and much
more efficient when you're in landscape
on the 6 plus
complete with its own copy and paste
buttons which is too bad because I never
type in landscape benefit number to a
bigger phone means you have a bigger
space for a bigger battery so the iPhone
6 plus has a huge 2915 milliamp hour
battery I say huge because it is way
bigger than the one in the iPhone 6 and
the immense battery life is one of the
best traits of the iPhone 6 plus I can
basically guarantee you'll never kill
the whole battery from 100% to zero in a
single day and you can't say that about
many phones and there have been plenty
of times where I do two full days of
light use while forgetting the charger
or something overnight I saw a battery
to spare for the second day I typically
get 7 to 9 hours of usage or screen on
time but again it's there have been
plenty of days where I get way more than
that and I don't use the phone as
heavily take this day for example when I
was mostly using it as a camera all day
and had the six and a half hours of
usage with 61% battery left at the end
of the day basically this thing is a
battery champ go to sleep with 50%
charge you'll wake up with that 50%
charge
standby for days and the only con here
really is that it takes a little bit
longer to charge up benefit number 3
optical image stabilization this is huge
the iPhone 6 camera was already really
good but having more space inside the
body of the iPhone 6 plus gives some
space source and bigger camera optics
meaning they fit optical image
stabilization in the iPhone 6 plus
this is stabilization done with hardware
which is different from stabilization
done with software's the actual elements
of the lens moving around to compensate
for your shaky hand rather than software
stabilization that a lot of other phones
have that doesn't work nearly as well
the result is two things one the iPhone
6 plus becomes a low-light beast
allowing the shutter to stay open a
little longer to capture more light
without blurring the image and this
combined with optical image
stabilization makes some of the best
low-light shots I've ever seen from a
phone with no flash and to oh is is
awesome for video you can take a super
shaky shot and make it seem slightly
less shaky or even take a slightly shaky
shot and they can seem like it's on a
tripod so you can move around a lot more
and have a lot less fear about getting
the shot you want from a fast-moving
object or subject that's moving all
over the place basically the iPhone
six-plus now takes some of the best
1080p video from any smartphone and also
takes some of the best photos from any
smartphone period and as a pixel peeper
I love that
so downside number one optimized apps
this is something that's getting better
every week but it's the same situation
as the iPhone 6 like I mentioned in the
review but again magnified even more
it's a 1920 by 1080 display and you
would think that you know that's a
pretty standard aspect ratio and
resolution shouldn't have any problems
but apps that haven't been updated for
this new phone look either fuzzy or
wonky and weird so developers get on
that quick downside number to
slipperiness so this is a big phone the
iPhone 6 plus has rounded edges all the
way around like the iPhone 6 and it's
even bigger so you're going to have to
manipulate it around more often to reach
all the corners of the display
especially if you're one handing it
which you're probably not but so this is
the one phone where I would really
recommend covering it in some way to at
least get a better grip or make it
easier to hold in the hand I mean at all
super thin rounded slab isn't exactly
ergonomic Apple knows that but they do
have some first-party case options they
have a leather case in a couple colors
which I think looks pretty nice from the
video reviews I've watched so that I
will link below my preference though as
I've said before is a skin just to
change the texture of the device but not
add much thickness at all so I'll leave
a link to that this is a D brand skin
right below again they have a couple
different colors and you can choose
which one you like best from there
downside number 3 bendgate
and I'm only including this section
because it seems like anyone who's ever
seen my phone and asked me about the
iPhone six-plus always seems to have a
follow-up question about whether it bent
or not so for the record no mine hasn't
bent and I don't expect it to because
I'm careful with my phone but listen
it's an expensive electronic device you
paid a lot of money for it don't sit on
it don't put a lot of pressure on it and
watch my bendgate
explainer video if you want to know more
about that I got the iPhone 6 and the
iPhone 6 plus at roughly the same time
and I took the Apple in six out the box
first and played with it and started
using it a lot and set it up and then I
took the iPhone six-plus out the box and
immediately knew that I liked it more
than the iPhone 6 I don't know if it was
the feel in the hand or just the fact
that I'm more used to devices this
than the smaller iphone 6 whatever it
was I am one of billions but I like
personally the iPhone six-plus more so
that's why I picked it that's why I
chose it more and you can choose if the
benefits that I showed you are worth
more than the drawbacks to you but
that's been my overall thoughts on the
iPhone 6 plus so that's been it thanks
for watching and I'll talk to you guys
in the next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
