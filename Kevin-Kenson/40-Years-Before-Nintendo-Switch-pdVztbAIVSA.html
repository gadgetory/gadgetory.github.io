made their first entry into the home
game console market that company was
Nintendo in that system was the color TV
game six
jugo Shimano game simulator Hara today
be game 15 choosing a cioppino
carotids every game
now Nintendo is actually a much older
company than a lot of people realize
they actually had their start in the
late 1800s as a card game manufacturer
and over the years they have had a very
large number of different businesses
under their belt from owning a taxicab
company to making a line of instant rice
to even owning a TV station and most of
these businesses didn't really pan out
but they finally hit their stride in the
60s with toy manufacturing now with toys
they got really big at first with this
little extendable arm thing and then a
really good line of light guns but
things really changed in the 70s when
they started seeing the boom of video
games Nintendo's first exposure with
game systems was with the Magnavox
Odyssey which is one of the oldest
systems to come out in the US and was
popular thanks to the game table-tennis
which became much much bigger when it
was basically copied and real released
by Atari as pong now Nintendo released
the Magnavox Odyssey
in Japan and that gave me the idea to
eventually make their own system which
we now know as the TV game 6 this was
actually something that was licensed
from Magnavox to use the pong design and
they actually made the hardware
alongside the Mitsubishi the game 6 was
a very very simple concept and system it
just had two knobs to dial players to
play basically just six different
variations of table tennis thus the name
the TV game six you've had three
different modes in each of those votes
had a single or double paddle option now
the thing about the TV game six that
made it such a success in Japan wasn't
the fact that it was just another pong
game which I mean was a lot of part of
it but it was actually the most
affordable one at only being 9800 yen so
here we have the actual TV Game six and
there's a couple different models of
these that were made and this is one of
the actual first line ones so there's a
couple things they changed later that
were well improved this one's doesn't
have this one isn't the only kind that's
in the white color later versions came
out in a bright orange the knobs in it
are smaller so it's a little less
comfortable and this design is only
powered by C batteries which is a little
inconvenient and later models they added
a DC option to actually given constant
power now as you can see these are the
controls in the middle to set everything
up with different game types turning in
all that kind of stuff it's all in
Japanese which I can't read so we need
to translate this the words are freaking
out a lot I think we need actually take
a photo to comfortably translate your
word because it's it is
not happy at the moment so let's check
out the main controls on the bottom here
now I think this one said power earlier
yeah so this is the power switch that
turned it off the green button is reset
so that just starts the system and then
I think this is for switching between
the three game types I need a high light
better yeah hockey tennis and volleyball
yeah so those are the three game modes
and then there's two different versions
of each one so would actually play on
this thing we of course need both two
players so we brought on our local all
things Japanese or guy who's most
recently been to Japan ken bolito
yeah be honest guys I've done a lot of
research on this thing I may have this
thing wouldn't talk about the video but
I haven't used it firsthand at all so
this is gonna be new for everyone here
right now let's turn it on and see how
this goes
hopefully not horribly and hey that's
the name color TV it's really blurry
yeah resolution wise especially I mean
I'm sure it's like scaling my crazy
systems from 70s that this is a 40 year
old system so hey this is so this is a
regular tennis well it's different the
other way now oh so it's literally just
a different like overlay and the scores
are the same by the way we changed
sports but it's just I know so it does
add more yeah it adds it adds more
barriers at least so it does actually
change the gameplay a little whoa I love
that you can change this Midway by the
way there's no just no pause at all
there's over the hose and your positions
are in the same place I didn't actually
translate what these other switches do
let's find out oh that made you small oh
oh it's faster oh here we go here we go
here we go whoa whoa what oh this is the
other boat this is the double paddle
mode this is how its six games and not
three in the process of trying to get
this to work on an American TV
apparently this thing hooked up to
Japanese channel 2 in America that's
that's channel 96 I want to meet the
person who's like an expert on this game
where there's like yeah I know the game
is six yeah no I never lose well there's
like it's just timing there's no sense
of acceleration on the knob either so
it's like if you could turn the knob a
certain yeah
and then it just kind of like flatlines
in terms of your speed so you can't even
you know really quickly just go down to
the other side the corner just have to
be frantic which they did fix in the
later versions of this for them and a
couple changes one of them was they
actually made it so it would stop when
you got to the edges so you couldn't
wrap around like this repeatedly so this
got a terrible but the fun thing is that
that was actually kind of an intentional
choice on Nintendo's because after this
thing came out not even well a wonderful
week later they released this guy
the tv-game 15 which was about 500 yen
more I think and had over twice the
number of games and is basically just
the all-out better version of what the
game six did I mean let's just even take
this guy out so even like right away
something you could tell us a lot better
controllers that you can actually hold
instead of being hunched over the same
unit not to mention the fact that as far
as the internal hardware goes the game
sticks is basically the same thing they
just handicapped it and didn't handicap
the 15 so you have board game options to
choose from so like with the six it's
got a lot of games but they're really
just variations of the same core stuff
the reason why you have an odd number is
cuz there are seven Ripper games as to
to promote and then there's one extra
game which is a shooting game instead of
a paddle one like all these guides wait
why am i serving with a steady paddle no
yeah they said that one of this must be
a shooting game but how do you shoot or
just do anything there isn't like what
is a red button
I guess you go to the system to fire
okay so here's game 15 guys yeah so I
mean the core gameplay is still more or
less the same but having the actual side
controller is a big improvement over
having two people loom over the same
console box just Nintendo keep doing
what you're doing you know I'll I think
this is a good start just you know
someday might have a more successful
system maybe do stuff with plumbers I
don't know a really interesting takeaway
from all this is the fact that this is
the stuff that allowed Nintendo to kind
of save themselves as a failing toy
company and move on to making things
like their own systems like the Game &amp;amp;
Watch the Nintendo Entertainment System
boy everything up until now with the
switch is all pretty much thanks to pong</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
