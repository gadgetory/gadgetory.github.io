weekly serving of the news talking about
the biggest stories to come out of the
gaming industry this past week and I
want to start by talking about the
return and the departure of two
different lead game designers both of
which have had a very large impact on
the industry as a whole to begin with at
the start of this week on Monday Cliff
Bleszinski the father of the Unreal
Tournament and Gears of War series
announced on Twitter his official return
from retirement with plans to announce
something very big in the next week
later he also tweeted a link to a
countdown site which is presumably
counting down to whatever his big
announcement is which will be hitting
zero at around 9 a.m. Tuesday Pacific
time now Bleszinski left the gaming
industry and epic games two years ago
but only after a year he already started
talking about that he had interest in
getting back into Triple A games
development and more recently he's shown
a lot of interest in making a new PC
arena shooter helping to bring more
evidence that this return is in fact
really happening earlier this week
Bleszinski also filed for a new company
which actually already has a website
that is very bare-bones at the moment
called boskie productions whose twitter
page is also already teasing the project
named blue streak now Unreal Tournament
was easily one of the best arena
shooters of its time and if you're a fan
of the series or even of Gears of War
then this is some great news and
hopefully something that we have to look
forward to we're just gonna have to wait
until this coming Tuesday to get some
more solid info and hopefully find out
what he's got in store on a similar but
sadder note earlier this week Rob Pardo
announced that he is leaving Blizzard
Entertainment after being one of its
main creative minds for the past 17
years
Pardo has had a hand in just about every
major product Blizzard has released in
his time working there and served as
lead designer on games like Starcraft
brood war Warcraft 3 and its expansion
Frozen Throne and of course world
Warcraft and its first expansion the
Burning Crusade considered by many to be
the Golden Age of WoW pardo posted his
farewell letter on battlenet and while
it is very heartfelt and he discusses
loving his time at Blizzard and looking
forward to playing more other games in
the future as a consumer it's not
entirely made clear why he's chosen to
leave right now whether it was a
personal decision because he's tired of
working with that particular company or
if someone else made him an offer he
does mention in the farewell letter that
he is looking forward to the next
chapter in his life in the gaming
industry so while he is leaving Blizzard
Entertainment it has been made clear
that this is not the last we'll see of
him it's just that whether this is
solo project he plans to work on in the
future or if he's planning on joining in
their dev team is yet to be known in
other news this past week
oculus technologies suspended all sales
and pre-orders in China for the latest
version of the oculus rift due to what
they refer to as extreme reseller
purchases this issue was initially
brought up and discussed on reddit where
users in China were confused and angry
over their pre-orders getting cancelled
the main reason for this decision
basically comes down to the fact that
the oculus rift is currently not in a
full retail version but rather a death
kit that's meant to be purchased and
used by developers to help create more
content for the device so whenever
someone ends up purchasing it just to
flip it and make a lot of profit
well that just takes units away from
people that actually are planning to
make use of it and create more
interesting stuff now
oculus technologies has discussed the
fact that they do still want to find a
way to get units to their Chinese
developers that want to make use of it
but when they plan to do this and how
they plan to do it without getting in
the hands of resellers is still
currently up in the air now last but not
least for the news to come out this past
week EA was called out by the UK
government for what they consider and
really what most gamers consider false
advertisement back in February EA
released a mobile remake of a classic PC
titled Dungeon Keeper which was met with
a less than favorable response from both
fans of the original game and just new
mobile gamers that just discovered it
the reason being that while the game is
technically free to purchase it over
uses a passage of time mechanics so much
that it's more or less impossible to do
anything meaningful in the game without
spending real money on gems to take
actions faster functionally making the
game actually a pay-to-play for those of
you that want to do something more than
just stare at the screen and do nothing
well after some people vocally
complained in regards to a advertising
the game as free the UK's Advertising
Standards Agency decided that such a
claim was in fact false and the ad must
be redone as well as have all future
advertisements clarify that while the
game is free to download actually
playing it does require payment now this
could be some fantastic news not because
it's just calling out a company for
false advertising but because it might
help set a precedent for how we handle
pricing it in mobile games this has been
a really hotly debated issue and a lot
of users are getting very frustrated
with all the different pricing methods
and surprise fees and actually calling a
company out might help get the ball
rolling on finding a new better way to
price and distribute these mobile titles
hopefully this makes it so that more
games of this style will no longer be
advertised as free and as a result
companies will try to find a new better
way of pricing them and if we're lucky
it'll actually be a step up from the
current model well that was just a quick
look at some of the biggest news stories
