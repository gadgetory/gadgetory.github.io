announcements at this year's e3 was the
reveal of the very heavily rumored Xbox
one slim which looks to be a major
upgrade over the original model to begin
with let's look at the cosmetic
differences in this new model this
console is 40% smaller than the original
Xbox one which is a lot more significant
than you would think until you actually
see it in person it also comes in a
white color rather than the usual xbox
black and the vent design has changed to
being the sort of dotted great look
rather than the shafts from the original
model which personally I'm not a big fan
of but it doesn't make it look horrible
and for those of you that spring for the
two terabyte model you're going to get a
vertical stand so you can show the
console off whichever way you'd prefer
though those of you that grab the 500
gigabyte or one terabyte model are going
to have to spring for the stand
separately now aside from just the looks
the system also features some actual
performance upgrades over the original
system featuring a slightly stronger
processor what this upgraded processor
allows for is that the Xbox 1s is going
to support HDR as well as 4k display
allowing you to stream video in 4k as
well as support Ultra HD blu-ray which
by the way also means that the 500
gigabyte Xbox one slim is going to be
the cheapest Ultra HD blu-ray player on
the market now for me personally one of
the really big deals about the system
though is the changes in form factor in
a lot of ways there's a lot of things
with this slim model that should have
been in the base Xbox one taking a look
at the front of the system you'll see
that we now have a front-facing USB port
which was sorely needed before as well
as a syncing button on the front and a
built-in IR blaster instead of relying
on the Kinect and if you actually take a
look at the back of the system you'll
see that the Kinect port has been
completely removed so if you want to
make use of that still you're gonna have
to buy a separate adapter although if
you're upgrading to the slim you can
actually register and get one for free
when you get the slim - changes that are
really huge to me although I admit one
of them is kind of minor is that this
system now has an internal power supply
no more gigantic ridiculous brick and it
actually as a mechanical power button so
you're no longer accidentally turning
your system on every time you try to
move the console now along with all the
improvements to the sillim itself we're
also getting a new Xbox one controller
which sports two main improvements first
off the controller now has built-in
Bluetooth so you no longer have to buy
an adapter if you want to use it with
your PC and it allows for a longer range
of play with your system
on top of that it also uses a different
texturing on the grips the controller
making it a lot more comfortable and not
nearly as sleek as the old controllers
and for those you that are huge fans of
customization you can actually now order
your own unique design using their
design lab which allows you to pick from
multiple colors for both the face the
back and all the different buttons which
costs you 80 bucks and is going to ship
in September although you can also
spring for an extra 10 bucks if you want
it unique engraving on it now for those
of you that want to spring for one of
these right now it's actually already
available for pre-order and is gonna be
shipping in August it's gonna cost you
300 bucks if you want to get the 500
gigabyte model and an extra 50 bucks to
get in one terabyte and another 50 on
top of that for 2 terabytes those of you
that have been wanting to grab an Xbox
one but just haven't spring for it yet
this is an excellent time to do so
because this pretty much has all the
major functions that the system should
have had in the first place
that or you can just wait and spring for
a good high quality gaming PC because
play anywhere whatever if you want to
check it out I got a link posted down
below in the description where you can
pre-order until next time guys I'm Kevin
Gibson and I'll see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
