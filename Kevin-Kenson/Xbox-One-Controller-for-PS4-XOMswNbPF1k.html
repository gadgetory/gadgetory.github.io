unlike the FPS plus this is not going to
feature any kind of this Wireless oh
this is a wireless controller it's a
bluetooth a couple weeks back Hori
released a new ps4 controller currently
exclusive to Europe called the Onyx and
what's unique about this controller is
that it is the first officially licensed
controller for the PlayStation 4 that is
Wireless instead of wired and what's
really unique about this too is the fact
that usually when a third party makes
controller the goal is either that it's
wired and cheaper but more affordable
for people or you go the opposite
direction and it's a pro controller
where it's more expensive and it's all
kinds of extra bells and whistles the
Onyx on the other end has a very very
simple pitch which is it is an
alternative choice to the Dual Shock 4
that is Wireless which is simply
designed for people who like the Xbox
one controller better does it accomplish
this goal let's get into the specifics
first let's start with be good for this
controller to begin with I think both
the buttons and sticks on this thing are
solid the buns gonna have what I think
is now kind of the standard for a lot of
Hori controllers where compared to
official ps4 Xbox one controllers the
travel distance on them is just a little
bit farther and they're a bit stiffer
it's not necessarily better than the
official controllers nor is it worse
it's just a different style that works
as for these sticks I think they are a
little stiffer than the official
controllers which I do not like a little
bit but it still works really well and I
really like the concave shape design
they have going from I think it gives
you a good grip I kind of wish there was
a slightly rougher material to make sure
you could really stick on them but it's
good enough to get the job done now as
for what's just okay on the controller
the d-pad is alright it's not a bad one
but it's just not as good as what you're
gonna see on the DualShock 4 or an Xbox
one controller for that matter and the
front shoulder buttons are alright they
feel like they have a little extra
travel distance but in a bad way
compared to the regular buttons they
don't have great feedback they'll work
it just doesn't feel quite as snappy as
you would get on a normal controller now
on the other hand this controller does
have some drawbacks and sadly while
there's only a few drawbacks they're all
really bad biggest thing that I noticed
immediately as soon as they even just
put my hands the controller is the grip
design see it is definitely inspired by
the Xbox one controller I mean the
general
shaping everything the button placement
is all like an Xbox one controller and I
do like the button placement itself but
the big thing that's a problem is the
hand grips see wallet may at first
glance look pretty much the same it's
actually much narrower on the back
compared to an Xbox one controller so
when you hold the controller with an
Xbox one one normally you just kind of
rest your hands and it feels very
natural with the Onyx on the other hand
I feel like I'm gripping a lot tighter
just to have a proper grip on it which
causes a lot more stress in my hands
while I'm playing and it's just a much
more uncomfortable experience the second
thing I noticed and is honestly the
biggest problems controller has is the
triggers I absolutely hate these
triggers they have this kind of
resistance to them that doesn't really
feel proper at all like it gives a lot
of resistance up front and then it
loosens up at the end and it just
doesn't feel well really just natural
compared to either controller design the
ps4 or the Xbox it just doesn't feel
right which is really a shame because I
feel like the genre that benefits the
most from the Xbox one layout is FPS
games and that's the situation where
you're gonna be using the triggers a lot
and so having these kind of awkward ones
that just don't even give you the proper
feedback or feel like you're not
pressing them properly it's just not a
good sign another button that feels
really awkward on this thing and
honestly this is more of a minor one
because it comes up so rarely for most
games but the touch pad button has the
same kind of issues where it doesn't
really feel like you're pressing a
button properly it just kind of feels
like there's this platform here with
some Springs underneath and you're not
getting a good feedback as though you're
actually pressing the button it just
kind of feels like the thing depresses
and pushes back right away it just
doesn't feel like the right kind of
activation and lastly something that on
the ps4 at least can maybe be forgivable
is the fact that like most third-party
controllers in the ps4 this is still
lacking any kind of headphone jack so if
you're using some of the official Sony
headsets for the ps4 you don't have to
worry about that because you can just
use the wireless USB dongle but if you
want to use one of your own headsets or
anything that uses just a traditional
aux cable you're not gonna be able to do
that with this controller which is a
major loss so is the Onyx worth grabbing
over an official DualShock 4 controller
maybe look I know I'm being really harsh
on certain aspects of it like the
triggers in the grip but those are
real problems in my opinion however if
you are the kind of person who really
dislikes the symmetrical stick layout of
the DualShock 4 and instead you want
something close to the Xbox one this can
be worth grabbing just realize that if
you do you are gonna be losing certain
aspects of quality like how those
triggers feel like the grip it's just
gonna be a little worse in some respects
now of course the other question here is
how much does it cost compared to a dual
stock for because if it's cheaper you
might find it to be more worth grabbing
over a new lock for now like I said
earlier this is currently only in Europe
and if you're looking at the UK prices
for it in pounds the onyx is a little
cheaper than a DualShock 4 but for those
of us that have to imported to the US
the price basically comes out to a
little over $60 so it's just as
expensive if not a little more than
grabbing a DualShock 4 which for a lot
of you might just be the thing that
breaks your decision on whether or not
to grab it</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
