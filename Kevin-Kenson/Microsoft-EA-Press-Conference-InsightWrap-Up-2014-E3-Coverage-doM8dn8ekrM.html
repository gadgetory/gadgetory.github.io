tomorrow is the beginning of III s floor
show but today is just press conferences
galore with four different companies we
just finished the first two with
Microsoft and EA and I wanted to take a
moment to bring you guys a brief little
recap of those two shows and their
highlights what I liked about him what I
got excited for or what just bored me
and just my overall thoughts of the
press conferences so far so to begin
with there was microsoft's press
conference which in all honesty in my
opinion was one of the best one they've
done in years at no point did they
dedicate 30 minutes of the show to just
watching people flail around in front of
connects or take time talking about
third-party deals they made for media or
new UI functions on the Xbox one it was
nothing but games after games after
games now I wasn't a big fan of how they
started things off with call of duty
advanced warfare mainly because that is
a multi-platform title and I was hoping
to see more exclusive stuff right away
but I will say it was really nice to see
a new call of duty game that actually
looked new and not just a reiteration of
what we've seen for the past five years
overall we saw a lot more trailers and
gameplay for a lot of other
multi-platform games you've heard about
already including evolve we saw a SAS
ins Creed unity announced its four
player co-op mode dragon age inquisition
the division and my personal favorite
actual gameplay for the witcher 3 but
the really big thing i think about this
press conference were how many actual
exclusive games they also announced and
are actually going to get a holiday 2014
release in particular sunset overdrive
looked like a ton of fun and i really
like the gameplay they showed but i am
just a little skeptical about whether or
not the game will look like that at
launch compared to today's demo i'm also
mildly interested in fable legends
despite how I felt about some of the
later games in the series but I'm just a
huge sucker for a symmetric game so the
idea of having four player co-op with
heroes fighting against one basically a
digital dungeon master sounds really
cool to me I just hope that they really
addressed the combat issues from the
earlier games and make it a lot more
complex than just press X to win now of
course there is the one gigantic
microsoft exclusive elephant in the room
which is halo 5 which we didn't really
get that much more new info for outside
of a couple of trailers but they did
announce the halo master chief
collection which is coming up this
holiday which contains halos 1 through 4
for xbox one including an HD remake of
my personal favorite halo 2 including
the original multiplayer gameplay it
will also be including a live-action
series called halo nightfall and a bay
for halo 5 which will be starting in
december outside of that we did to get a
couple other announcements in terms of
games we got a nice little montage of a
lot of different indie games which is
not something Microsoft's done in a
while especially one in particular that
was really gorgeous called Ori we also
got a couple games announced for 2015
including a sequel to the tomb raider
reboot and a new action game from
platinum games called scalebound which
features a main character that's clearly
not Dante fighting against an alongside
really giant monsters that looks like it
could be really interesting and I'm
hoping to see real gameplay for soon
overall it was a really solid press
conference there wasn't anything
particularly earth-shattering but it was
just nice consistent announcement after
announcement and easily in my opinion it
was the best Microsoft press conference
in quite a few years then there was a
witch in all honesty I wasn't really as
enthusiastic about now to be fair I am a
bit biased when it comes to EA Sports I
just really don't care that much about
those games I'm not really interested in
fifa madden or pga tour even the new
criterion games featuring vehicles or
UFC pretty much the only thing that can
knock me out of the slumber as if they
announced a new SSX game now there was
one particular segment of the show
dedicated to bioware games we finally
got to see some actual gameplay of
dragon age inquisition which at the
moment I'm caught on the fence about I
really loved dragon age origins and
didn't care as much for dragon age 2 and
it looks like the gameplay we saw really
shows a very similar action focus like
we saw in dragon age 2 which isn't
necessarily a bad thing it could still
be a major improvement it's just that
there's not enough info to work on yet
so it does have me a little more worried
alongside that Bioware also announced
two other projects we are for sure
getting a new Mass Effect game though
there wasn't really any new info outside
of a focus on new environments and then
another unnamed IP that is in the works
that we really got no information on
outside of the fact that it exists there
is also a lot of time spent on sims 4
which basically just boiled down to a
lot of gameplay showing a bro working
out and obama dancing at a house party
which to be honest I kind of blanked out
on now EA also showed some more gameplay
for their attempt at a MOBA game dangi
which really didn't get a whole lot more
new info on just a few behind the scenes
interviews and seeing just a little
snippets of gameplay now there were
three actual big things that happened
during the EA press conference that were
peppered throughout basically one at the
start the middle and the very end first
up was a closer look at star wars
battlefront 3 we finally got to see just
a little bit of game
play looking at environments but still
not too much info yet second off we
finally got to see some actual gameplay
of mirrors edge 2 which does look very
similar but we saw a lot more of the
in-depth behind-the-scenes work of how
they're trying to make the perk or as
realistic as possible and really for me
this was the highlight of the whole
press conference now third up and last
but not least we saw a really long
gameplay segment that was clearly
scripted of battlefield hardline but the
really interesting thing is that they
also announced that sign ups and the
actual close to beta for it is starting
today which also led to the website
having just a few problems as a direct
result overall I really didn't care that
much for the e a press conference there
were some highlights that I liked but it
just felt really weak and slow
especially considering what we saw at
the microsoft press conference right
before now these were just two out of
the five press conferences planned for
e3 we've still got Ubisoft and so need
to deal with later today which i'll be
posting a response bid for as well and
tomorrow we'll have nintendo which
depending on my schedule you might be
putting up as well so don't miss that
