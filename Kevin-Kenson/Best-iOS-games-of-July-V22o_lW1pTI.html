time try favorite iOS games of the month
this particular mix contains some
classic arcade style pixel games as well
as more traditional puzzle and tap based
app games to begin with let's take a
look at the long siege now this is a
genre that's been getting more and more
popular in app games and that's where
you're taking the puzzle formula but
combining it with something else in this
case strategy games the entire idea is
that by matching certain tiles together
you'll summon troops to attack an enemy
tower if you get combinations of four or
five you'll get larger more powerful
versions of them either getting warriors
archers or mages combining tiles can't
have other effects as well like giving
you gold repairing your Tower and giving
the option to summon cannons that can
attack enemy troops that are defended by
shields or just dealing direct damage to
aid your troops after completing so many
different side quests or main missions
you can take the gold and silver you've
gained to improve your troops or your
base increasing how powerful your
cannons are giving you more health or
giving your troops special abilities to
make them more effective this is an
excellent addition to your options for
different puzzle hybrid games and while
it's not free to play it's pretty cheap
and definitely worth picking up next up
is tofu fury the newest game from Amazon
Game Studios which has been popping out
a lot of iOS games the past couple
months but this is really the first one
that has fully caught my attention now
this is using a pretty familiar formula
for app games where it's sort of a
puzzle platformer fusion with a little
bit of combat in it but what it does
really well is striking a nice balance
of slowly adding new mechanics as you go
along keeping the levels from becoming
stale now as is pretty common in games
of this type it's pretty easy to just
complete a level the real challenge
comes from meeting all the games
different side objectives by collecting
so many items finishing levels in so
much time or with so many few moves it's
pretty tough to try and a hundred
percent this game and there's also
challenge mission so you can try and
rank yourself on a scoreboard against
your friends the production values for
this game are great the level design is
fantastic it's one of the better titles
to come out of Amazon game studios and
definitely worth taking a look at now
for a third were going from high
production value to low with tap quest
now to be perfectly honest when I first
saw this game I thought it was just
another cookie clicker ripoff and wasn't
very interested but turns out it's
actually something a bit different it
definitely does have some
mechanics in common but it takes a
little more of your attention what you
have to do is you're controlling a main
hero protecting a tower from oncoming
enemies you tap the left screen to
attack to the left right screen to
attack to the right and just go back and
forth back and forth attacking enemies
and if any of them stand on the tower
long enough its summons a dark evil
dragon and it's game over aiding you
you'll be able to upgrade the tower to
have its own cannon as well as a fairy
little attack enemies and sometimes
you'll get special drops that give you
special attacks such as setting your
sword on fire creating huge explosions
or sending out a chain lightning wave
every time you fail you'll take all the
gold you've saved up to increase your
perros powers improve your tower and
ferry unlock new abilities equip new
armor all kinds of stuff to make it
easier honestly the basic comes with
this game is pretty simple it's just
make yourself stronger and then tap left
and right like crazy but if you're
looking for something super simple to
just kill time with mindlessly this is a
great option the in-app purchase options
in it are a little on the ridiculous
side but they're not necessary at all to
complete the game so you don't have to
worry about dropping any cash on it
unless you're really desperate to finish
it very quickly now fourth if we have
more pixely action with samurai blitz
this is a side-scrolling action game
that's entirely focused on just jumping
in attacking enemies and avoiding
obstacles pretty simple idea but the
execution is really well done with a
fantastic soundtrack and visuals one
thing I really appreciate about the game
is that it isn't taking the modern app
approach of just making an endless
runner but instead treats it more like
an old-school arcade game where there
are multiple levels and there are bosses
you need to deal with another thing I
really like is that they did a great job
I'm pricing there in app purchases
there's really not a whole lot you have
to buy to do well in this game there are
ninja Scrolls that give you different
special abilities that you can equip but
outside of that everything else is
pretty much cosmetic and if you want to
buy gold to speed up the process it only
takes a buck three buck stops to buy
most of what you absolutely need or if
you want to support the developers
there's also an option to pay three
dollars to just permanently double how
much gold you gain so you still have to
grind things out and play the game but
you're still throwing them a little
money real simple gameplay that's tons
of fun with a great aesthetic definitely
make this one title this month to look
out for and give a chance now last but
not least we have another arcade style
game and this is a genre that I'm really
we haven't seen more app games try and
do and that's operation dracula a bullet
hell game now for those of you that
aren't familiar with the bullet hell
genre the way it works is that it's a
top-down shooter which seems fairly
standard but what makes it very
different is that there are enemy
attacks missiles bullets everywhere that
you have to dodge constantly thus the
name bullet hell now if you never played
the genre before this game can be a bit
daunting at first but it does offer an
easy mode where enemies are a lot easier
to kill you're a bit more resilient and
there's not nearly as much shit flying
on the screen every moment however
playing in easy mode isn't going to get
you any achievements you can't unlock
the game's hidden character and you
can't even fight the final boss so it's
a good way to get your feet wet but
after that you really need to tackle the
challenge of the games normal mode you
do have three different characters you
can play as all that have their own
different attacks special moves and a
bomb attack and if you beat the game
with all three of them you can unlock a
fourth character this game is a little
on the pricier side for an app game but
honestly but the amount of time you
could soak into this if you're up to the
challenge it's easily worth it not a
game for those of you that are faint of
heart or just want to have a casual game
experience on the side this one is
definitely about the challenge well
those were my favorite app games of July
2015 as always there were a whole lot
more titles that came out this month I
caught my eye but just didn't quite make
the list so if there's scheme that you
