reported that Nintendo is supposedly
working on a new model of the switch
dated for sometime next year possibly as
early as summer now this is something
that we've been long speculating about I
feel like almost as soon as a half a
year after the original switch came out
a lot of people already wondering well
what would they do if they made a new
version whether that's a excel a pro
pocket some kind of new version
what could they improve now so far based
on what the Wall Street Journal is
reporting the only thing that's really
been talked about from Nintendo is the
idea of improving the screen with better
LCD technology the main two takeaways
from would be potentially a better
battery life and a brighter screen but
those kind of changes alone don't
exactly justify an entire model refresh
so let's talk about what other changes
Nintendo could possibly be making for a
new Nintendo switch now when we're
talking about the switch it's important
to note that the switch itself is really
just the tablet portion of the system I
know often times people picture it as
one whole unit when it's in portable
mode but really that's the joy Khan's
being attached to the switch and their
own kind of separate thing and that
partially influences what Nintendo could
potentially do with a new one we'll get
to that a little later but for now let's
just talk about what kind of changes we
could see happen with the main switch
body first we've already mentioned the
fact that it sounds like Nintendo wants
to give it a brighter screen but another
possibility is a larger screen as well
now it's not very likely that they'll
increase the size of the switch unit
itself because that kind of messes with
the whole dynamic of having joy Khan's
that can slow on to the side unless they
make large icons but then that's a whole
thing with where the new stuff doesn't
match up for the old stuff and that's
just a whole issue that I'm hoping
doesn't happen but assuming that it is
maintaining the same general portions
and sizes it's still possible that we
could get a larger screen size by
reducing the bezel because the bezel on
the switch is fairly large noticeable so
it is something that we could see a
little bit bigger physically another
possible change that I would personally
love to see I mean once again this has
always been one of the biggest nitpicky
arguments about the switch itself but
let's change the kickstand please
somehow maybe something that doesn't it
quite as easily break off I mean I know
the idea is that if it breaks off it's
easy to reinsert but if that happens
multiple times it gets the point where
it's just this thing that doesn't sit
right let's just let's just overhaul
that whole system please now physically
that's honestly it on my
for requests like I said I don't think
we can do things like make it a larger
or smaller body because then that gets a
no whole territory of actually being a
separate system from the current
ecosystem but there is some stuff
internally we could change for instance
I really would like to see just a bit
more power in the system I'm not talking
about some kind of major overhaul we're
getting some kind of 4k supportive
switch which would actually be really
cool but you know something a little
more realistic I just want a little more
power for the sake of just smoothness of
gameplay you know there's a lot of games
right now that aren't fully optimized
for either portable or home there are
games where portable is great and then
if you're playing on dock mode you're
getting small frame rate reductions
there's other games where if you're in
home mode it looks great but then if
you're doing things
handheld there's resolution drops and
just all kinds of issues so we can just
get just a little more power to even out
a lot of those issues I would really
like that now the other big question is
what happens to do it cons themselves
are we gonna see any kind of revision
for those if there's a new switch
because once again we still run into the
same problem of if we want to make sure
that any kind of new stuff still works
with older current switch stuff they
have to be roughly the same size still
or at least have the same kind of rail
size to be able to attach to the side of
the switch but there's another
limitation to worry about with joy
clones as well and that's a Nintendo's
obsession with the ability to use them
as their own singular controller when
held sideways because there's a lot of
stuff that might make a lot of sense
when you're using the switch in handheld
mode or using a pair of droid cons at
the same time that doesn't necessarily
make sense for using a single jerk on on
its own part of the reason right joy
clouds aren't quite as comfortable as
they potentially could be is because
Nintendo wants to be able to hold them
like this or like this but it's like I
said they dropped the idea of having
both those options available a pro
option could offer a better more
contoured grip design that could make
them way more comfortable in either
situation we're using two at once
something that's a little more unlikely
but I think maybe possible is also
adjusting the size of the Droid cause
once again you can't mess with it too
much because you want to make sure that
it can still work with modern systems at
least I hope that's something that
Nintendo cares about but all that really
matters for droid cons the slide on the
switch itself is that the rail sizes of
match up so as long as the rails are
right you could potentially make a
larger droidcon as well for those people
that find the smaller size to just be
way too uncomfortable now another big
question is if this actually is
happening we're getting a kind of
revised switch what is it going to be
called Nintendo
doesn't have a deep history of revising
systems when it comes to their mainline
consoles but they have done a ton of
revisions when it comes to handhelds and
based on we've seen in the past with
those there's really kind of two forms
of launching a Nintendo uses either they
take the simplest route possible and
just call it something like the new
version for instance if this new switch
has nothing noticeably super-different
about it they could just call it the new
Nintendo switch and honestly I'm leaving
that be most likely answer however
something else that Nintendo has also
done is if there's any kind of major
significant noticeable change they'll
name it after that specific change
whether that's making it larger calling
at the switch XL making a smaller
calling of the switch pocket if it
offers 4k they could call it the switch
4k any kind of combination like that
depending on what that most significant
change is could influence the name look
there are a lot of things to in Tendo
could possibly do with your revised
switch and I think everyone has their
own wish list of things they would like
to see or think really need to change
honestly personally I'd lean towards the
idea that I really think Nintendo's
probably going to be somewhat minimal
with it I don't think they're looking to
radically change the design of the
switch or how it works I think if
anything we're just gonna see things
like better battery life brighter
screens hopefully larger screens and
just in general some performance ups
would be really nice but we don't know
yet we're running off very little right
now and hopefully we're gonna find out
more soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
