weekly serving in the gaming news this
past week we've got a couple of
different game announcements as well as
further confirmed titles and a little
bit interesting news regarding what
Microsoft currently has planned for its
future as a whole company and for its
Xbox division in particular but to begin
with let's talk about some of the actual
game announcements we've seen this past
week to start with on this past Sunday
which was the last day of the fighting
game tournament evolution 2014 Cup
tahira Harada announced the seventh main
installment of the Tekken franchise
while no actual release date or even
released quarter has been given yet it
does look as though the game's going to
be getting and our kid release first
followed by home console versions later
and will be built using Unreal Engine 4
now on the related topic of fighting
games on the following morning on Monday
super smash brothers for Wii U and 3ds
announced three more characters
confirming the return of Captain Falcon
as well as introducing two new
characters from the Fire Emblem
franchise Robin and Lucena counting all
the me fighters as one this brings the
full announced roster thus far to 36
making this now the largest Super Smash
Brothers roster compared to brawls 35
and it may still not be finished yet
we're still missing a few series
favorites and veterans most particularly
Ness and given the frequency of how
often we've been getting these character
announcements it's actually very likely
we'll see at least one or even two more
until the 3ds version gets released on
October 3rd with the most likely time
coming up being Comic Con later this
month where Nintendo will be hosting a
Super Smash Brothers for 3ds tournament
now as far as other game announcements
from this past week go Tecmo Koei's
Nintendo got together to announce and
reveal a new trailer for the next fatal
prim game which is planned for the Wii U
whose title loosely translates to fatal
frame the black haired shrine maiden
this is the fifth game in the Fatal
Frame series the first three were on the
ps2 with the fourth one coming out on
the Wii although that one was restricted
only to Japan and it's not clear yet
whether or not the fifth one is going to
follow that trend we just know that the
fifth one is currently planned for a
Japanese exclusive release date of
September 27th now last but not least
this weekend has been QuakeCon and
during it a new gameplay trailer was
released that is currently exclusive
just a QuakeCon we're not seeing any
internet coverage of it just yet for a
game that has been stuck in dev hell for
years doom 4 which is now retitled
simply as doom this one does look to be
a full reboot of the
doom franchise which does actually make
a lot of sense considering how long it's
been since doom three and how many times
it's changed owners hands now obviously
I haven't seen the actual gameplay
trailer this was exclusive just a
quakecon attendees but as far as the
news coming out and what people have
been saying it looks as though those new
games going to have a much heavier
emphasis just on fast paced combat and
really getting back to FPS roots with an
emphasis on outlandish monsters
outlandish weapons and no more
regenerating health we haven't got an
exact release date or quarter for this
game yet as well but it has been
announced that it will be made available
on Xbox one ps4 and of course PC now
with all that aside one of the biggest
pieces of news to come out of gaming
industry this past week in terms of
business is that Microsoft is having a
lot of cutbacks and layoffs this was
originally reported after an email was
sent out by the current Microsoft CEO
announcing plans to have major layoffs
across the entire company numbering as
high as 18,000 although the majority of
those are coming from its Nokia division
which is looking to have about 12,500
jobs cut over the next year Microsoft
has made it clear that they plan to
support the Xbox division and have a lot
of big plans for it in the future
but that doesn't make it an exception
from these planned cuts in fact we're
already getting a lot of reports that a
lot of different studios are either
shutting down in the near future or
already suffering major layoffs of these
it's been reported that there's been a
lot of job cuts over at the Xbox EMEA
team which includes a lot of their
operations over in Europe the Middle
East and Asia as well as the soon
shutdown of the Xbox entertainment
division this is the same group that
Microsoft placed a lot of emphasis on to
e3 s ago when they were announcing a lot
of original television content exclusive
for Xbox Live it looks as though the
reason for part of this decision is due
to the fact that Microsoft wants all of
its different divisions to focus more
heavily on their core content rather
than having more extensive side programs
as a result the Xbox division is now
going to focus a lot more on just games
rather than trying to make the Xbox one
the be-all end-all entertainment system
it was originally pitched as now
obviously not all cuts and layoffs are
happening right this moment there might
be more announced as the year goes on so
it'll be interesting to see what happens
to the Xbox division as time goes by so
that was just a quick look at some of
the gaming news to come out this past
week what games have been announced and
a little bit on the gaming industry I'll
be seeing you guys next weekend with
another
update now until then I do have some
more reviews plan to come up in the next
