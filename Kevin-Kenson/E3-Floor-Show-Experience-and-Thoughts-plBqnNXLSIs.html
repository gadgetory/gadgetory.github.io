is normally the day that I've been
posting a news video but as many of you
are aware this past week was III so
there is quite a bit of news to cover
but I actually covered a lot of it
already in my press conference response
videos now if you missed those those are
all linked down below but what I want to
do with today's video is talk to you
guys about my experiences on the actual
III show floor I only got to go for
about a day and a half and I didn't get
to cover every single game that I would
have liked to but I wanted to let you
guys know my personal experience
hands-on with the games I got to try so
both days I really spent the vast
majority of my time on the main central
hall this is where you're gonna find all
the three major companies namely
Nintendo Microsoft and Sony and while I
did get to play some games that I was
really hoping to check out you quickly
realize when you're at the e3 show floor
that you spend about a good 50 percent
of your time just waiting in lines
especially when you're trying to play
those really high profile titles that
everyone's curious about now to begin
with I spent a lot of time mainly on the
Nintendo show floor this is the first
time I checked out and as a result is
just the one end of spending a lot of
time on for the most part one thing I
was really cool pup the Nintendo show
floor is that they actually had a lot
more of the high-profile games set up so
there were less lines for each one and
they also had a really good strict time
live with a lot of them so it was really
easy to try multiple games except in the
case of Hyrule warriors which was just a
grueling wait in a very short line now
when I finally did get the chance to
play Hyrule warriors it basically played
how you'd expect a warrior's game to
play but with a lot of Zelda themes
going on especially adding a few little
special new mechanics like finding items
like the bomb bag or hook shot to really
make it feel more like a Zelda title
really it was nothing more than just
good straight forward action fun which
really is a good thing for this because
it just capitalizes on Zelda fandom and
giving you something that's simple and
straightforward but easy to just lose
time into now the one game I spent a lot
of time playing on the Nintendo show
floor is the one that I think most
people are really excited for coming out
and that is of course the new super
smash brothers for Wii U and 3ds and I
actually got to play these games with
fellow youtuber Austin Evans and we got
to do both the 3ds and Wii U versions
using GameCube controllers in fact we
even did a video together that he posted
on his channel of us talking about our
experiences with the games which I have
linked down below for you to check out
as well the biggest thing that I really
noticed about the new Super Smash
Brothers other than of course having a
fun with some new characters namely Mega
Man and lil Mac is how much the speed
has been adjusted in this game it's
still not as fast as melee but at the
same time it's a lot faster than brawl
which was basically molasses compared to
what we were used to before and I really
liked that I think it's a good even
speed to choose from and I also really
liked a lot of the new items introduced
in this game and assist trophies as well
now the last game I tried on the
Nintendo show floor is one that I was
really curious about before and from
what I got to play I'm just even more
interested in now and that's their
newest IP splatoon thankfully the
gameplay was just as interesting as I
hoped it would be and it's a really
interesting twist on an objective based
shooter with an objective we've never
really had before of just covering the
floor with your team's paint but at the
same time the game does stoller or jus
for traditional FPS tactics like
destroying enemy teammates to help give
you guys a little more advantage
timewise being able to cover the enemy
map there were a lot of mechanics in
terms of exploration and movement that I
wasn't able to fully explore and the
time I had but it'd be really
interesting to see what kind of advanced
techniques people come up with once the
game is fully released I also really
like the way the game utilized the Wii U
gamepad it uses its screen as your
mini-map and it also uses it as one of
your main forms of control you actually
use tilt controls to look around on the
screen the one thing I didn't like about
this though is the fact that the R stick
is still used for looking left and right
but not up and down it's really weird
that you would divorce the mechanics
that way with the tilt controls looking
all the way around but the stick only
left and right the tilt controls are
comfortable and it is something you can
get used to but I just don't understand
why they would make that one fully
functional and just cripple the other
option especially when it's one as
popular as the right stick now after
Nintendo I spent some time on the
Microsoft show floor and the one game I
really wanted to get a look at was Sense
and overdrive but it had the single most
ridiculously long line out of any game I
saw on the show floor so ended up not
being able to play that one but I did
spend some time playing a few other
games on the floor I spent a little time
on UFC 2015 with fellow youtuber Liu
from unbox therapy you can check that
out linked down below I also got to try
out the amazing new DLC for Dead Rising
3 which I actually haven't already
picked up and plan on bring you guys a
full review of soon now the one game I
tried out on the microsoft show floor
that completely caught me off guard was
fable legends I have a bit of a
love-hate relationship with the fable
series especially the ones that came out
after they stopped doing numerical
titles but this one really shows some
promise now one of the interesting
things to note about fable legends is
that it's really not that much of a
fable game outside of its name its
setting and its art style like I said
before in my Microsoft press conference
I am a huge sucker for asymmetric
gameplay and the idea of for Heroes
going against a villain that has control
over the map is just really intriguing
to me now during this demo we got to use
four different heroes there was trout
who is basically sort of stealthy ranger
assassin type Inga who was a really
strong sword and board tank leech who
can do different like life stealing
abilities on enemies as well as healing
allies and then there's the hero I got
to try sterling who's sort of the fast
melee damage dealer type with a rapier
each hero had their own unique movesets
and in some cases they even had
different resource mechanics than one
another
and what you can't create your own hero
like you would in most fable games I did
talk to some of the reps and they were
discussing the fact that the game will
feature some appearance customization
options to make each hero fit your own
style and they might even be adding some
moveset changes as well the one thing
that really jumped out at me though is
the fact that fable legends combat was
actually more difficult than regular
fable you couldn't just unlock enemies
to death like you normally wouldn't old
fable games enemies would actually
absorb blows and fight back so you
really had to time when you used which
attacks which special moves dodged out
of the way in time and because each hero
has their own specializations teamwork
was actually really important to
overcome the villains challenges there's
still a lot that could go wrong with a
game like this at launch but after my
experiences of the demo I'm a lot more
curious about how the final product will
be and I can't wait for it to come out
so I can bring you guys my full thoughts
on it now sony was the last of the three
floor shows I got to check out and
regretfully was the one I was able to
play the least a number of games on
though part of the problem of this is
the fact that Sony felt like they had a
lot less major exclusive games up for
actual playable demos and had more
things where you just watched other
people play or just watch trailers we
had already kind of seen before now the
one game I did get to try and wait in a
particularly really crazy long line for
was destiny and I also got into the
destiny alpha as a result now I'm
working on bringing guys a more in-depth
video talking about the destiny alpha
but for now let's just talk about the
crucible mode which was in the e3 demo
which basically just makes the gameplay
like a much more traditional multiplayer
FPS in it players take part in battles
that use two teams of six players and
during this demo we were each given a
class to play as in my case
I played as the Warlick which had a
really interesting grenade like attack
which caused an AoE blast that dealt
damage over time and also had a super
move that basically just instantly
vaporized any enemies in a small area of
effect one of the interesting things
that really noted about the mechanics of
the game is that the only weapon that
would recover ammo between deaths was
your main weapon which is usually some
form of assault rifle marksman rifle or
burst rifle weapon whereas your
secondary weapon like a sniper rifle or
shotgun required special secondary ammo
that you had to find on the map and
there was also heavy weapons which were
really powerful but required you to find
rare ammo drops that occurred during the
match to be honest I wasn't a huge fan
of the e3 demo mainly because of the
fact that it's just the crucible mode so
it didn't really make a destiny feel any
different from a lot of other FPS that
have come out so far but that is of
course the point of the crucible mode it
lets you play it like a traditional
multiplayer FPS but the Alpha has shown
a little more of the actual
single-player or cooperative side of the
game and I'll let you guys know more
info about that soon in another video so
those were some of the biggest games I
got to try out on the e3 show floor the
show itself overall to me felt like a
really strong one compared to years past
last year there was such a huge emphasis
on the new consoles coming out that we
got a lot of interesting hardware news
but there weren't really that many new
games to play on the floor or anything
for the next-gen that was really that
interesting whereas this year since the
focus was on all the new exclusive
titles coming out there was just way
more to interact with and way more games
to get actually excited about and get a
little taste of now after my experiences
on the floor show I really have to rank
the companies the same way I did with
the press conferences to me personally
Nintendo really won this e3 with just
having a really great mix of titles
we've been waiting on and brand-new
titles to really get excited about
Microsoft was a pleasant surprise had a
few good titles to look at which I also
enjoyed and while Sony was strong in its
own right it just didn't have the same
level of impact as the other two for me
personally at least so all-in-all this
was a really strong e3 and in my opinion
one of the best in the past couple of
years and I'm really interested in
seeing how a lot of these titles pan out
now as I said earlier there are a lot of
videos linked down a description my past
press conference response videos as well
as some appearances I made on other
channels don't forget to check those out
