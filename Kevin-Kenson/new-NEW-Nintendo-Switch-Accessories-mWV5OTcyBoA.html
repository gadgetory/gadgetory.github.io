result some of you guys might have found
yourselves to be the proud new owners of
a shiny switch but now the question is
what stuff do you need to get to get the
absolute most out of it so it's that
time again for the best new new
accessories for your Nintendo switch
first off one of the big weaknesses of
the switch is that while it is awesome
to use in portable mode it doesn't
exactly have the best battery life so if
you want to get the most out of it you
can grab one of these battery case
attachments for the system now this
particular one is really awesome because
there's a lot of different uses
obviously the main one is it extends
your battery life it's got 6,500
milliamp hour battery which is basically
another full charge for the switch plus
an extra about 30% so you're gonna over
double the time can play in portable
mode but aside from that it has a few
other uses first off it gives you this
double kickstand which has multiple
stops and is just honestly all around
way better than the one built into the
switch it's got a little storage
compartment where you could put two
additional switch games if you're using
them all on the go and it has a little
layer of protection here so if you drop
the switch it's gonna protect not only
the battery but obviously the switch
itself and what's great about all this
is that while it offers all these
benefits it does make the switch just a
little bigger but still just small
enough to fit in most carrying cases
with no problems sort of barely impacts
your day-to-day use now if you're not a
fan of the idea of having this
attachment on your switch at all times
to get the most battery life out of it
another option you can use is a charging
case like this one right here now it's
really cool about this one is that it's
basically the same size as most other
standard switch cases maybe just a
little bit bigger but it has a battery
sewn into it that you can plug the
switch into while you're carrying it
around so it fits nice and snug it's
gonna not gonna rattle around in there
you gotta charge your switch while
you're carrying it around and still
having all the extra storage you need
for things like the charger gain cases
everything you need I will say one kind
of awkward part about it is the charging
cable right here is a little longer than
it needs to be I think they just kind of
stocked up on what was available it gets
a little annoying but doesn't get in the
way of it performing its main function
which is giving you all the extra
battery life you need while you're on
the go next up is something that we
featured before in one of our setups and
if you missed out on this you definitely
need to check this thing out because it
is amazing this is made by PDP and as
dumb as it sounds it's basically a dock
for your dock the
that you take the Nintendo switch put it
on top of this dock setup plug it into
the USB port and you have these
different face plates you can put up
front that are gonna lit up you can do
either one solid color or a changing
color like you see right here and you
get two different options when you buy
it this Zelda design which I personally
really loved but if you want another
option it does come with a Super Mario
Odyssey one as well if that's more your
speed it's a really simple addition but
honestly I think it does a lot to spice
up the switch stock design itself and
bring a little more life especially if
you want a livelier setup other than
just the plain black design it normally
has next up we have an awesome headset
option for your switch and that's the
Arctic's 3 Bluetooth headset from steel
series I love this headset first off
just because I'm a big fan of Steel
series headsets to begin with I think
they do a great job of offering a
balance of sound quality build quality
and being really comfortable so you can
use it for a long period of time and
while this headset is meant to be
multi-platform you can use on Xbox one
ps4 PC all that good stuff
it has one really awesome benefit for
the switch in particular see while this
is a Bluetooth headset it has the
ability to do a hardwire connection and
Bluetooth connection simultaneously so
on the switch you can hardwire it into
your consoles you can get game audio
that way and if you're playing something
online like splatoon you can do chat
audio Bluetooth through your phone
instead of having a giant mess of cables
like you would with the Nintendo headset
that they want you to use which is not a
good idea
then we've come to one of my latest
obsessions with accessories a wall mount
setup for the switch now if you've been
keeping up with the channel you may
remember that we did do a vertical wall
mount setup with the switch before and
the way we did that was just by putting
command strips on the back of the switch
which honestly wasn't our smartest or
safest idea
we might have to seal that because while
I did hold the switch up you ran the
risk that if the right pressure was
applied it would pop open forward and
the switch could maybe even fall out
with this full amount from height it
though that's not an issue at all it
actually gives you all the support you
need to make sure it's nice and strong
on the wall and you can't open the
switch so it gives you a nice safe way
to dock it take it out no big deal at
all making an awesome way to incorporate
it in any kind of wall or minimalist
setup</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
