for you guys today Microsoft was awesome
and sent us this box of stuff right here
I have one very good guess about what's
at the bottom of the box but I think
there's more stuff in here so let's open
it up and check it out
and oh that's fancy like even the inside
of the box actually is like a design on
it little book of some sort like a
booklet oh whoa
there's like a whole like introductory
thing just talking about all their fan
stuff on the Xbox next layer there's a
lot more stuff here and they like send a
lot of stuff in this thing a 4k Ultra HD
copy of planet Earth - because honestly
there's no other way to test the 1x
properly without this I mean it just
it's pointless
get to the real reason we're excited for
this box we've aloft so many Xbox 1s is
that it's actually like I notice
immediately that this box is just a
little bigger you know just a little bit
we have a knife getting started we have
another Xbox Live in-game pass but this
is like the standard one that everyone's
gonna get whenever they pick one of
these up this is the same kind of
packaging contents we see with a lot of
the Xbox 1s is it a power cable in here
HDMI and a black Xbox 1s controller
which is nice because all the 1s is so
for all the 1s designs they haven't got
a black one yet so if you bought a
system you have an actual these oh yeah
oh man that is definitely like a little
heavier than the 1s it's not like super
heavy but I can just tell the weight
difference like right away and for the
unveil as it gets stuck there we go oh
man there's the front for you guys oh
man it's interesting how this is so very
clearly similar in design to the 1s but
there were clear differences for
instance we have the full actual just
slate right here instead of having it be
the half and half like the 1s has so you
don't have the vents on top instead it's
venting entirely from the sides you'll
also see on the back here that as far as
ports go this is like the same setup as
the Xbox one and it uses the same power
cable which is honestly kind of insane
for the power draw necessary for the
system to be able to do 4k gaming
compared to the 1s really cool they were
able to actually fit all that in there
and you can use the exact same cables
you had for the 1s on this one I'm gonna
say this is a really good-looking system
actually you know I mean a lot of people
were always clamoring for wanting to
have a 1s in black that was one of the
top complaints when they mailed the
white one and they never
revealed a black one after that but now
we know why because now we were saving
up so we could get an even better system
and an all black finish now you may have
noticed that this Xbox monix here is
actually just a standard retail one the
ones that are coming out on launch day
are the project Scorpio editions which
are a little different for instance on
the system itself you'll actually see
the words project Scorpio or it might
just be the word Scorpio and then the
controller is also going to have the
label Scorpio running down middle but
it's also an entire black out design so
whereas this one has like the
traditional you know red blue green and
yellow buttons the one that comes with
the Scorpio is an entirely black out
design so it's gonna be a different
controller as well so now we've got this
thing out though let's go ahead and take
a quick moment and compare it to the
other Xbox ones let's start by going all
the way back so obviously the original
Xbox one is a considerably larger system
especially when you realize the fact
that this one is so much more powerful
and yet it is way shorter not nearly as
wide and less deep as well all around a
much more compact system and honestly
much better looking now we'll go ahead
and move on to the more recent Xbox 1s
now
the Xbox 1x isn't as small as the 1s but
it is honestly very close especially
considering how much more powerful this
system right here is it's only a little
bit wider tiny bit more deep and it's
actually just like a hair shorter from
the top than the Xbox 1s is it's really
impressive that this is basically the
same size despite being so much more
powerful than its older version so I'm
gonna go ahead and take my time over the
next week actually hooking this thing up
playing on it checking stuff out it's
going the 4k content and let you guys
know my full thoughts in a week until
then see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
