coming out in just a few more days and
the hype for this game is ridiculously
strong so strong in fact that I'm
willing to bet there's more than a few
of you out there that are planning on
grabbing it without having played all
the other titles in the series which for
a series this complex and laden with
conspiracy theories just means you're
gonna be really really lost about some
of the plot elements so to help you guys
do a little bit of catch up I want to
give you a brief sum of all the
characters we know that are going to
show up in the phantom pain and what
their plot up until this point has been
that goes without saying that there are
going to be some spoilers in this video
but I'm just focusing on really huge
events and character relationships there
are a lot of details that are being left
out so if you get the chance to still
play some of those of the games I highly
recommend it because they are fantastic
so with that in mind while mittigar
Solid 5 the phantom pain is technically
the 10th game to come out in series
depending on which games you do and do
not count it's really only the fifth one
that happens timeline-wise we're the
only games before it being Milic your
Solid 3 portable of Sookie's Walker and
of course middle of your Solid 5 Ground
zeroes and we're talking about important
characters you need to know we of course
have to start with this guy right here
big boss also known as venom snake punch
snake and the slightly misleading title
naked snake thing is when you're talking
about big bosses history you really need
to talk about two other characters and
how it basically forms the major
plotline of the whole series and those
characters are the boss and zero C the
most important thing to happen in the
entire Medicare sald franchise it really
sets everything in motion is the ending
of Metal Gear Solid 3 where big boss
sweat this time is still going by the
name Naked Snake is sent on a mission
with zero acting as his handler and that
mission is to kill his former mentor the
boss who seemingly betrayed the US
government to the Soviet Union well it
turns out that once you finish her
mission all of that was a lie the boss
has been working for the u.s. all along
and has been doing a bunch of their
dirty work and taken all the blame on
herself causing her to not only lose her
life but her reputation
now this self-sacrifice has a huge
impact on both snake and zero who both
idolized the boss and they each make of
their own life's mission to try and
accomplish what they think or her ideals
so fast-forward through the events of
portable office where zero comes into a
shit
of money and resources and decides to
form his own personal totally not big
bad guy shadow government the Patriots
and he has Big Boss be one of the fellow
founding members the thing is right now
Big Boss doesn't really like the name
Big Boss he still wants to go simply by
snake because he feels like he hasn't
earned the title the problem is zero
really wants to push that and use boss
as a figurehead to attract more and more
soldiers to their cause and this doesn't
really sit well with Big Boss it's at
this point they realize that they
actually have two very different ideas
of what the boss's dream was zero
believes that it was to create some kind
of unified world government where there
can only be peace because people don't
have enough free will to do anything
disruptive snake on the other hand
thinks that she wanted to have a
soldier's paradise a world where
soldiers were empowered individuals that
were fighting for causes they actually
believed in rather than being the pawns
of different world governments well
seeing as how these two ideas clashed
very heavily boss ends up leaving the
Patriots and forms his own organization
called the MSF the first private
military group that doesn't know its
allegiance to any world government now
this idea doesn't really sit well with
zero who for the time being changes the
name of the Patriots to cypher and like
an enraged and psychotic ex he makes
this really convoluted complex scheme
where he's trying to get a snake to come
back to the Patriots and that's what
ends up being the story of Metal Gear
Solid Peace Walker now this plan doesn't
really pan out in zeros favor and the
rift between them gets even bigger and
this is what leads to the prequel to the
phantom pain ground zeroes where snake
goes on a mission to rescue some of his
former allies from a cipher prison camp
the thing is it's all part of once again
a ridiculously complex team set up by
zero or possibly one of his subordinates
skull face except this time it actually
works
destroying snakes home base killing off
most of his army and leaving snake in a
coma until the start of the events of
the phantom pain where he wakes up and
is ready to exact sweet sweet vengeance
now with the big guys out of the way
there's a few more returning characters
we need to talk about and to begin with
there's a few new characters that a lot
of people speculate might actually be
returning people with huge plot twists
which I'm gonna lead conspiracy theories
to other people I just want to focus on
the characters that we know for sure are
returning which are Ocelot Koz Miller
pause and Huey Emmerich
now Ocelot has by far the most
kid story line out of anyone in middle
yourself franchise because he's present
in all the numbered Metal Gear Solid
games and during each of those his main
roles to be that of a triple agent where
you never really know who the hell he's
working for until the last possible
second and this is exactly what happens
during middle gear cell to three where
initially they are rivals but by the end
of the game Ocelot has gained a great
deal of respect for Big Boss and in fact
he was one of the other founding members
of the Patriots and it was his idea to
have zero invite big bust to form them
in the first place now given his history
of working for basically every single
faction in the Metal Gear Solid universe
his goals in the van campaign aren't
exactly clear yet but given the fact
that he looks really buddy-buddy with
snake and a lot of the trailers this
might be the storyline where we find out
how they became such close friends or
it's all once again part of one of
ocelots ridiculous triple agent plays
which it is you just won't know until
you actually play the phantom pain that
next up is Hughie Emmerich who is the
father of Hal Emmerich better known as
Otto Kahn the lead supporting sidekick
to the original Metal Gear Solid
protagonist Solid Snake and he feels
pretty much the same role as his son as
being the lead science nerd plot wise
see Hughie is introduced in peace walker
as a scientist working on a new super
weapon the thing is he doesn't know
that's what he's doing and once he finds
out he's not really happy about it so
pretty much entirely out of spite he
goes to work for Big Boss and helps him
build his own personal Metal Gear Zeek
as for what he's doing in the phantom
pain it's not really clear yet based on
trailers other than the fact that he is
getting tortured an awful lot by cos now
one of the things that the e3 trailers
have talked about is that cipher is
working on some kind of new even more
dangerous for a lot more dangerous than
a Metal Gear so Huey's involvement would
make a lot of sense for that but once
again that is just speculation now third
up is Koz Miller and this is another
character that has introduced
timeline-wise
in peace walker although he first meets
Big Boss off-screen and at the start of
Peace Walker we see him acting as the
main right-hand man of Big Boss
the thing is during these events causes
actually secretly doing some background
deals with cypher in order to try and
help expand the MSF faster this doesn't
really go in his favor and he ends up
regretting these actions greatly
especially considering the fact that
they do eventually indirectly lead to
the M
being blown up in ground zeroes and then
we see cause and trailers for Fanta main
being a much angrier and much more
bloodthirsty character torturing
basically every other major supporting
character we've seen so far now last but
not least is pause another character
introduced in peace Walker who fulfills
a very similar role to Ocelot where
she's working for pretty much every side
eventually though you find out that she
is working for a cipher and she's the
lead agent and trying to get Big Boss to
come back to the Patriots problem is she
has failed spying 101 and has done the
biggest mistake anyone can make him
infiltrating another organization and
that's sympathizing with the enemy she
ends up really wanting to work for the
MSF instead of cypher but still tries to
complete her mission which doesn't
really go well and ends with her being
jettisoned into the ocean and you not
really being sure if she's dead or alive
it's only during the ground zeroes that
we discover that she is in fact a living
and is now being held at a cipher prison
camp which is snakes mission to go and
retrieve and rescue her problem is like
I said earlier this is all part of
another one of zero schemes one that
works and includes Paz having a bomb put
inside of her which explodes causing the
helicopter crash that puts snake in a
coma the weird thing is despite coming
down with a really bad case of exploding
Paz still shows up in trailers for the
phantom pain in effect she looks like
she hasn't even aged a single day which
might mean that we're seeing a cloning
plot element come up which would make a
lot of sense because cloning is a huge
part of the Metal Gear Solid mythos
especially considering the fact that the
main protagonist of the original games
Solid Snake is one of three clones of
big bucks now these are the characters
that we know are returning from games
earlier in the timeline there are a
couple characters however that looked
like they might be child versions of
people that show up later on in series
first off is a young boy wearing a gas
mask with psychic powers which is very
very reminiscent of one of the main
villains of men appear solid Psycho
Mantis the other is a young boy named
Eli that looks suspiciously a lot like a
younger version of Big Boss and in fact
during the e3 2015 trailer it is very
heavily hinted that he's in fact one of
the clones of big boss most likely
liquid snake the main antagonist
tremenda Gear Solid so those are all the
characters that we know of that are in
phantom pain that have shown up in other
games like I said there are a couple
others that people have conspiracy
theories about but I just want to stick
to the ones that we know for sure
hopefully with this little sum up or
you'll be able to have some idea of
what's going on once you pick up the
phantom pain which is coming out in just
another couple days once it does I am
also planning on doing an unboxing of
the collector's edition and give you
