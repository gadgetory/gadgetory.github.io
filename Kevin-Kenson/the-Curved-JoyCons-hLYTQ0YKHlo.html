about these fake Joy-Cons
which, while it's really cool
to have a cheap alternative
that plays like Joy-Cons
on the Switch, they were not
great, less than impressive,
but now we have our hands
on some new fake Joy-Cons,
and these ones might be better?
Now, when it comes to fake Joy-Cons,
there's a couple of different
things we need to consider,
what functions it actually still supports
versus a regular Joy-Con,
the build quality,
how the buttons and sticks feel
compared to normal Joy-Cons,
and of course, even
the other fake options.
Now for these ones,
one of the first things
you'll immediately notice
is the change in shape.
Regular Joy-Cons have
very rigid, flat sides,
and even the fake ones we
did followed that same design
but were just larger overall,
these on the other hand,
have a little more curvature going on.
You'll see there's kind of a concave curve
right here on the side, and on the back
it actually has a little
bit of fitting as well
that's a little more designed
like a traditional grip
on a controller, instead of the normal
just flat shape Joy-Cons
have, which honestly,
just right out of the gate,
holding it does feel like an improvement.
Now, aside from this curvature,
there are couple of
things about this design
that when you hold it up
side by side are just,
well, not quite right.
The shoulder buttons are actually
one of the more accurate
aspects which is pretty cool,
but the front-facing is where
a lot of weirdness starts to happen.
You'll notice the sticks have
a much flatter overall surface,
it still has that same kind of
little circular design around it,
but it's not quite as pronounced
so it doesn't really latch
onto your finger as much,
and the A, B, X, Y buttons,
instead of regular circles
are now these ovular shapes.
Also, like a Joy-Con and
unlike the other fake Joy-Cons
we checked out, this does not use a D-pad,
but instead sticks with
the same four button setup,
which does make a little more sense
when you want to be
able to use it sideways,
but for those of you who like having
the full handheld experience,
it is kind of a sad loss.
Now, what's really interesting
about these Joy-Cons however,
isn't just the change in shape
and how they're just a little
bit different and cheaper,
but the fact that they actually operate
a little more like real Joy-Cons.
See, with the other fake
ones we talked about before,
they were always wireless
Bluetooth connection,
even if you connected them
to the sides of your Switch
it didn't actually connect to the Switch,
you had connect them wirelessly still
and just kind of pretend you were doing
a normal handheld experience.
With these on the other hand,
if you attach them to
the sides of the Switch,
it will not only charge
the Joy-Cons, but connect
and register like Joy-Cons
are attached to the side
and you can swap to wireless as well.
That being said, there is a little bit
of weirdness with them
when you set them up.
These are actually the
only Joy-Cons I've seen
that when you connect them to the Switch,
they actually have a
different logo than normal.
Usually the Joy-Cons appear like
whatever color Joy-Con you have,
and even in the case of
the other fake Joy-Cons,
it looked like the regular gray ones,
in this case though, it's
just a pure black silhouette,
kind of like what you
would normally see in
just the small logos in the corner
when you're actually in the syncing page,
that's how they register.
By the way, if you guys want a
closer look at these Joy-Cons
and see them side-by-side
with regular Joy-Cons
and the fake ones, make sure
to check out my Instagram,
we're gonna have multiple
pictures of these posted up.
As for features, there's three main things
we're looking for in
comparison to regular Joy-Cons,
rumble motors, motion
controls, and amiibo support,
and like what is true with
so many other third-party
options out there,
these do not have amiibo support,
but it does boast the other two features
which I would argue are
the more important two.
So, that's everything on paper,
but let's actually hook
them up and try 'em out.
So, we're gonna start with
a little bit of Smash Bros.,
and one of the things that
I'm noticing right away is
that I do like the curvature
that these Joy-Cons have.
They're still the same
kind of smaller size
as the official ones, so your
whole hand can wrap around it,
but with that kind of
curved side going on,
it's easier to rest your palm inside of it
which I really like.
Now, while I do like the
grip on these Joy-Cons,
there are a couple other aspects of it
that I'm not as big of a fan of,
which is sort of the natural result
of it being a cheaper
third-party alternative.
To begin with, the
front-facing buttons are okay,
they're worse than regular Joy-Cons
but I would say they're a little better
than what we had on the
other fake Joy-Cons.
The shoulder buttons are pretty good.
The weakest thing by far though
is definitely the sticks.
There's this kind of little
extra resistance to them
that doesn't feel quite as comfortable,
and the shape of the stick
head is a lot more slippery,
it doesn't grip to your
thumb nearly as comfortably.
Something else that's
really stood out to me
about the Joy-Cons versus
the other fake ones
that we used before is,
if you saw the video
on the other fake ones,
one of my big complaints is
that the rumble motor was
just always on at full blast,
it rattled the whole shell
casing and just didn't feel good,
these ones actually feel a
little more varied though,
it's getting the highs and lows,
it doesn't feel quite as
detailed as the HD rumble
in Joy-Cons, but it's a lot closer.
Something I gotta say too is that,
while these are definitely not
officially licensed products
and they don't completely work
the same way normal Joy-Cons should,
the syncing process for
them is still really simple,
the only kinda extra weird step is
that when you go to the
pair controller screen,
you have to mash down all
the front-facing buttons
and that's how knows to search
for a Switch to sync to.
You can't just do the
normal shoulder button taps,
you have to mash these down.
So, that's kind of a little
extra step you have to remember,
but it's really not anymore of a hassle.
I gotta say, these Joy-Cons
actually surprised me!
I think after the experience I had
with the other fake Joy-Cons,
I had a bit of a bad taste
in my mouth and just didn't
really expect anything to be,
well, good, but for
being, what are honestly
just knock-off versions of
regular Nintendo Joy-Cons,
these get the job done pretty well.
I do think regular Joy-Cons
are still the better way to go
if you're willing to spend the money,
but at 30 bucks these
things do a great job!
Again, you're able to use them
connected directly to
the Switch or wirelessly,
and the experience
overall feels a lot more
like you're using an
officially licensed product
and not something that was just designed
to kind of awkwardly work.
While certain aspects of them
can certainly use some improvement,
like the sticks, the front-facing buttons,
and they're just a little
too light in the hand for me personally,
all the other benefits they have
at their price point is really great.
I like the curved design, I
think it actually works out
better than the actual
official Joy-Con shape,
it's just a bit more comfortable,
especially when you're
using them independently.
Add on to this that they
have working motion controls
and a rumble feature that
isn't all out insane,
if you just want a cheap
alternative to Joy-Cons
to save a little money or
maybe even give to a kid
or something, these are
actually pretty worth it.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
