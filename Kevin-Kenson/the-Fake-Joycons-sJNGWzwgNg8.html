- Today we got somethin'
really special to look at.
I ordered these a while ago,
and they have finally arrived.
Fake Joycons, now when I
say fake, I don't just mean
that these look like Joycons and aren't,
but actually these are
controllers that are wireless
that will work for the switch,
and they just happen to look like Joycons,
but like, something's not quite right.
Now these cost us just a little under $30,
so a good fit under half the price
of an actual set of Joycons.
But to be honest, you could find these
for even cheaper depending
where you buy 'em from.
We just wanted to get the
fastest shipping possible
so we could get our hands
on them, and check it out.
So we're gonna put these side by side
with real Joycons to see
what exactly is different
about them, what is probably worse?
And maybe, what is surprisingly
the same, or even better.
First I just wanna take a
look at how these Joycons
actually line up with the real thing.
So we've got the fake left Joycon,
with a real right Joycon,
and some differences are
pretty immediately noticeable.
I think one of the first big
things is that the fakes ones
are a lot bigger, they're noticeably wider
than real Joycons.
And something that might make
that even stand out moreso
is that when you're
actually holding these,
they are really, really light.
It almost feels like there's
- Nothing at all!
- inside of the Joycon itself
which worries me a little bit
'cause we actually haven't
tried connecting this
to the switch yet,
but assuming that there's
functional stuff in here,
it is surprisingly light.
Now aside from the general
difference in shape,
and how all the buttons and everything
are just a little off different alignment.
There are some differences to just how
everything is designed.
The plus and minus buttons are these
big old squares instead of
being the actual shapes.
There's a D-pad on the
left one which is actually
something I kind of appreciate.
The sticks actually look like
the same style of stick
which surprises me,
and then again with the
capture and Home buttons,
it does look similar.
The right home button does look different
on the other Joycon, we'll
pull that up separately.
So yeah, there's a lot
of pretty noticeable
differences right here.
I think that with these fake ones,
if you just had them by themselves,
you might have a moment
where you have to double take
and be like wait, that's not right.
But side by side, yeah,
you can really see it.
Also one little thing I appreciate,
there's just a random oval at the bottom
of the left Joycon, I
think that's supposed to be
kind of the Nintendo logo.
They can't actually put
the word Nintendo in there,
so you just get an oval.
There are also a couple of the differences
on the inside of these Joycons.
So it has a rail that looks very similar,
and you do still have the
shoulder buttons right here,
but in addition, there's
also actually a USBC port.
The reason being is that
these don't actually charge
the way regular Joycons charge,
you can't just put in on
the switch and leave it be.
You have to charge them individually,
they also have a significantly
lower battery life
of four hours.
So let's actually sync
these to the switch,
and it takes a couple more steps
than it normally would
with traditional Joycons.
First you actually have to turn these on
for them to start searching
for a switch to connect to.
And the way you do that is
by holding left on the D-pad,
and the screenshot button
to turn on the left Joycon.
You can see the light going on right now,
and then for the right Joycon,
you hold Y and the Home button.
Once they're both on, wait
for the lights to solidify.
One of them did it, come on.
Come on other guy, you can do it.
Thinking, thinking, there it is.
And then to actually do the
normal pairing as per usual,
just hit the shoulder buttons,
and there we go.
And it even reads them as
Joycons that are paired,
it doesn't read them as some
other kind of controller,
I like that it displays two gray Joycons.
So now that we're all connected,
let's go ahead and test
that with some actual games,
and we'll start with a
good old classic, Zelda.
Now one of the things I do notice
right away while playing
is that the sticks
actually do feel pretty good.
I almost wonder if these are actually like
either overstock, or
really high quality sticks
they just found that, it
feels like the switch sticks.
It has the right amount of resistance,
the stick heads feel the same.
That part's pretty much
the exact same experience
which is cool.
What I don't know is the
same experience though is
every other button on here.
The front facing buttons right
now just feel really stiff.
Like it's not a very, all
the buttons on a real Joycon
are very clicky.
There's not a lot of distance to travel,
there's very immediate tactile feel.
These though, you're
pressing down a lot further,
and it just feels hollow,
if that makes sense.
Now the same isn't exactly true
for everything else though.
Like the shoulder buttons, and
the plus and minus buttons,
these do have a little bit
more of a click in this
that feels like an actual Joycon,
but it's almost too small
than they are actually.
Like it doesn't really press down much,
and the triggers themselves
are probably the worst part.
It doesn't really feel like
an actual small lever pole
like you get with the Joycons.
You're just kinda pressing it down,
and it feels like you're
kinda pressing it.
It doesn't have a very good push back.
Something that's also really
distracting with using
these Joycons in handheld mode is that
they don't actually connect
to the switch directly.
Like even when you're using
them in handheld mode like this,
they're still connecting wirelessly.
And so you can actually see the lights on
for syncing to it at all times.
And that can be very distracting mid game,
it's not a great look.
The grip in these are also
a little different too
actually I'm noticing more and more now.
So if you can actually see here,
there's this like lip
going on on the inside,
whereas on the actual Joycons,
it's just one smooth surface.
I guess it's not super uncomfortable,
it's not a big loss, it just
feels strange by comparison.
So, so far in handheld mode
I'm not really a big fan,
but let's try these in a wireless setup,
and see if maybe the larger size,
and the rearranging of the buttons
makes it a little more comfortable.
By the way, if you're wondering
about this blue switch
that we're using in today's video,
this is actually a skin that's
made by today's sponsor,
D Brand, they make a
whole line of switch skins
that are totally safe to
use on the switch itself,
the dock, and even the Joycons.
The real Joycons, not the
fake ones in today's video.
If you're interested in checking out
the different colors
and designs they have,
check out the link down below.
Playing some Smash
Brothers, I gotta say that
still the buttons on these are not good
really by any measure.
The sticks still surprise me,
they feel just like a regular switch.
But something that is a
little more in their favor,
I do think they're more comfortable
because of the larger sizing.
It fits in the grip of
my hand a little nicer.
It's not like, I'm not having
as tightened of a grip,
so it is working out a
little better in that sense.
I don't know if it's worth the trade off
of everything else, but it
does make me kind of want
bigger Joycons from Nintendo now.
Oh also, these do have rumble by the way,
so that surprises me a lot
'cause considering how light
they are, I did not expect
rumble motors in here.
They're not particularly good,
it's a very light, and rapid shake.
It's like giving you
the same kind of thing
as the HD rumble in Joycons.
But if you just wanna
make sure you have rumble,
these do have those which I appreciate.
Still, none of the other
special functions of Joycons though,
like scanning amiibos, or motor controls.
I'm actually gonna reset these up,
'cause now I wanna try just
a single Joycon sideways,
and see how that works
out for this redone shape.
And yeah again, the larger size on this
actually does come in handy.
I think this is more comfortable
than using a regular Joycon sideways.
I mean don't get me wrong,
I would still prefer
some kind of actual grip to put it in,
but if it's the choice
between a Joycon by itself,
or this by itself
sideways, this is comfier.
And actually another one in this mode too,
let's see how these
shoulder buttons work out.
Yeah okay, that's actually
not, that's not bad,
that's about on par with what
you get on the normal Joycons,
they're still very tiny,
and it's just that little, just
tiny snap of a button push.
So about the same as a real Joycon.
After playing with these a while,
I gotta say it feels like the purest form
of that whole meme of
what the second player
controller was like growing up as a kid
where yeah, all the right
buttons are here and it works,
it's just weird, not particularly great.
I think a lot of third party controllers
have come a long way in actually being
good options that are competitive,
and this just goes right
back to that old feeling.
Are they cheap?
Yes, do they work?
Yes, are they worth grabbing?
