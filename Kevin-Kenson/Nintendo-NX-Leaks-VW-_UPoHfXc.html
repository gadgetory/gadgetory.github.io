gotten any new information about
Nintendo's upcoming new system the NX
but this morning Eurogamer released a
lot of information and rumors they've
recently gotten from their sources so
the first biggest thing is the
revelation that the NX isn't really a
traditional home console but is instead
a new dedicated handheld device that can
link up with your TV through a home
docking setup what's important about
this is that for a while a lot of rumors
and speculation kind of frame that the
NX was going to be the successor to the
Wii U and a direct competitor to the ps4
and Xbox one when really it's more like
a follow up to the 3ds or even more
accurately a fusion of both product
lines which is really freaking smart in
my opinion because it shows that
Nintendo isn't trying to actively
compete with Sony and Microsoft but is
instead choosing to focus on one of
their biggest and oldest strengths
handhelds the controller will supposedly
consists of a main screen and two
controller halves which can be removed
now eurogamer's reporting that these
detached bits can work like two separate
simple controllers for two-player games
but I don't think it's that far of a
stretch for this design to also embrace
what Nintendo did with the Wii mode
having these separate segments combined
with numerous attachments for different
controller designs maybe even a center
bit for both of them to attach to to
form a more traditional controller
layout like the Wii U pro controller now
one assumption that was being made by a
lot of people and was rumored about the
NX was that it would supposedly be on
par with if not above the ps4 which
doesn't look to be the case the NX will
supposedly be using a Tegra processor
with current dev kits using the x1 which
is designed for a balance of performance
and minimal power drain putting it more
on par with the Xbox one performance
wise if not slightly below now given
that the system is going to be a
portable it's possible the screen
resolution is only going to be 720p
meaning that that's plenty of power for
the NX Nintendo has filed patents for
using an external supplementary
processing device so it's possible that
the home box component of the system
could offer hardware to let the system
achieve 1080p on your TV without
performance loss now the last bit of
news is further rumor that the NX will
be using cartridges rather than discs
which especially for a portable system
makes a lot
since now the downside of that news is
it means the NX will not be backwards
compatible at all with the Wii or Wii U
one of the fuzzier details is the idea
that these carts will cap out at 32 gigs
which is a bit small for most modern
games but if you look at what kind of
first party stuff Nintendo has released
on the Wii U none of us really
approached that high before with
Xenoblade Chronicles X being one of the
biggest at 22 gigs the report also said
that we should be seeing an official
reveal of the system this coming
September which means it'll most likely
be at TGS or a standalone Nintendo
Direct sometime during that same month
either way hopefully we'll get some real
info soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
