you know what that means it's time for
more of my favorite iOS games to come
out this past month this time around
we've got a great mixture of RPG action
and platforming games but to begin with
I'm gonna cheat just a little bit
because there's one game I really like
that came out last month that just
didn't quite make the list and there
were a lot of games this month I
actually didn't really care about so
it's making an appearance now and that's
devious dungeons
now the first devious ton who name was
actually on one of my previous top 5
lists and that's cuz I think the game
did a really great job of having very
fast easy to play mechanics but at the
same time offered a really interesting
versatile randomized dungeon that didn't
require a massive time sink it was a
really fun pick-up-and-play dungeon
Delmer now what to does to make itself
different is something that you see a
lot of games do when they hit their
sequel and that's adding new playable
characters in the original game you were
just a guy with a sword this time around
you can pick between three different
characters though there's the barbarian
which uses a sword thieves that use
faster shorter weapons and mages that
have longer reach and can actually like
cast long range spells some of which
even have special effects like slowing
down enemies this adds a lot more
replayability to the game because once
you've gotten through the whole thing
once with one character you can start
all over with another one and just grind
through them as well admittedly it's not
the deepest for most complex game but as
far as just something that's nice and
simple and has a random dungeon for you
just delve again and again and again
this is one of the best options out
there now as for games that actually
came out this month second on the list
is one more - now one more - is one of
those really simple games or all you
have to do is tap the screen at the
right time - go for it
but what makes it a little more
interesting is the fact that you end up
having time yourself to dodge different
obstacles and some of them can actually
be made use of to help your life lasts a
little longer by bouncing off them and
ending up back in the same starting
position the only thing is by doing that
often you aren't going to get not as
high of a score admittedly this is not
one of the most original ideas but as
far as simple tap challenge games go
this one just has a really nice unique
aesthetic and I think it's a great
option if you're just looking for
something free-to-play if you don't mind
a few ads here and there and just do
something mindlessly
for one thing or another next up on the
list is the latest entry in a small
franchise but one that hasn't been
exclusive to F games and that's geometry
wars 3 now the series is already well
known for its intense visuals great
soundtrack and just fast paced shooting
combat but it helps to set this one
apart is that along with the classic
mode where you just have to survive
waves of enemies and get the highest
score you can in a time limit the game
also offers an adventure mode now in
this mode there's gonna be multiple
levels you can go through there are
power-ups can get all the levels have
different little world designs or you
actually have like a globe or different
interesting arenas so it helps to give
it a lot more flavor and interesting
replayability outside of just doing the
classic mode again and again you can of
course compare scores with your friends
put stuff on Facebook all that kind of
fun social integration but as far as
just a cheap but really good-looking
action game goes it's hard to beat what
geometry wars has to offer good simple
addictive fun now fourth on the list is
another sequel but of a very different
kind of game and that's Knights of pen
and paper - now has a bit of a love feet
relation to put the first game in the
series and it's still kind of true in
this one - because this is basically
just a combination of a lot of mechanics
that have made modern RPGs extremely
repetitive and yet when you distill it
just to that and kind of make a joke out
of it it's really addictive simple fun
entirely focused on things like just
building your party power leveling them
up and doing lots and lots of grind
quests for experience and money you
create your own party by picking members
based on who the player is whether it's
something like the jock the cheerleader
or the hipster you pick what class
they're playing as which gives them
different abilities and you pick the
race which gives them some kind of
passive benefit combat is really simple
and straightforward you set up the
encounters yourself pick how many
enemies you want to fight wash rinse
repeat again and again and again yet
despite being so repetitive I just can't
quite bring myself to put it down once I
start playing it helps that the game has
a ton of inside jokes that point out
different tropes in both video game and
tabletop RPGs so if you're a fan of
either the game is going to do a great
job of sucking you in now normally I try
to avoid putting games on here that are
ports from other systems and I want to
just focus on apps that are designed to
be well app games in the first place but
there was one that came out this month
that I think they did a phenomenal job
adapting it and that's one of my
favorite indie titles legend of Grimrock
now this is a classic dungeon delving
game where you create your own party of
adventurers
pick up pre-made one you walk through
it's solving puzzles dealing with
enemies but one of the things that
really stands out about this one is that
they just did such a great job of
adapting it to a touchscreen interface
interacting with puzzles and objects
fighting enemies changing inventory or
looking at your statistics all of it is
really really intuitive and never breaks
up the action in the game now of course
the game does lose some of its strengths
from the PC version when it's ported to
this you can't make your own levels or
import other peoples but it is being
sold at a much reduced cost compared to
that version so putting down five bucks
for this game is completely worth it a
special trip fan of old-school dungeon
delving adventures and even if you're
not it's a great modern-day introduction
well those are my favourite app games of
may 2015 if there are any that you guys
