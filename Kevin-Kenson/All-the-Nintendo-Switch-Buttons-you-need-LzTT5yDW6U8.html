at a controller that is
a little more interesting.
This is the Emio Switch pad.
Now if you've never heard of Emio before,
or maybe you have,
it's a brand that makes a
lot of interesting looking
Xbox, PlayStation, switch
controllers that aren't very good.
Usually you'll find
them if you're on Amazon
just looking for cheap alternatives,
to use different systems.
But their designs are
often pretty crazy looking
and in some cases just look
like weird Frankenstein
creations are putting
different controllers together.
And the reviews on them
aren't always the best.
But there's a reason why
I want to take a look
at this one in particular.
Now this design is obviously
made for the switch in mind
and as a controller it's again
nothing very spectacular.
The grip is actually pretty decent on it.
It's got a decent shape
and I like the kinda
rubber texture it has, it's very grippy.
The triggers are different tensions
and one of them feels like
I'm not really pushing
it down all the way.
The front shoulders are a little clicky.
And all the other buttons are sub-par.
And in fact this controller in particular
won't even connect to a
switch wirelessly anymore.
It did at one point but
after the infamous 5.0 update
which made a lot of third party
controllers no longer work,
this is one them.
Now normally there would be
firmware available to fix this
however Emio has actually
taken their website down
with that firmware and anywhere
you look that links to it,
doesn't any more.
Thankfully, it can still
work as a wired controller
for us to try out.
So this isn't by any means
an amazing controller.
So Kevin, why are you reviewing it?
I'll tell you, audience.
Because there's one unique feature
that is really intriguing to me
and I'm starting to wonder
why I haven't seen it
on more pro controllers.
You can swap out the buttons.
Now when I say you can change the buttons
on this controller, I don't just mean,
oh there's different
colors, there's symbols.
Although that is kind of part of it.
You can remove this
entire module right here
and replace it with other designs
that are based on previous
Nintendo controllers.
And it's pretty simple to do.
First you have to rip off this faceplate
which can be a little annoying.
There it is.
You pop this out.
Then you can put another
design like Super Nintendo.
Or you can even lose
some buttons and do NES.
And what's really neat about this one too
is that each of these also
has a matching faceplate.
So we get this NES
right here, pop that in,
and we have a little
Frankenstein controller
with only an A and a B.
Speaking of customization,
if you want an easy way to
personalize your switch,
check out skins from
today's sponsor, dbrand.
They have a whole line that
are totally safe to use
on the switch, on the
joy cons and on the dock.
They come in a variety of colors
just like these purple ones
that are very reminiscent of the GameCube.
If you wanna check them out,
check out the link down below.
What's really interesting about this
isn't just the ability to swap out
for different colors or style
changes to things like NES
but it's actually got options
that end up feeling like
way different button set-ups.
For instance you can
swap over to something
like the N64 which adds the full C set-up
which in case these ones
just act like X and Y
while the other ones up
here act like R2 and L2.
And I think the most
interesting one to choose from
is you can even use a GameCube style setup
where you have the curved X and Y.
This actually opens up
a really whole new level
of interesting creativity
that I'm kinda sad
isn't available on any other
controller option out there.
Because one of the
things that's really cool
about different button
setups like the GameCube one
is that for certain
games this ends up being
a better way to arrange the buttons.
Instead of each one being
equally spaced and the same size,
you can have the game
where A plays a big deal
and everything keys off of that.
So you have the A in the center,
you can roll over to B, you
can roll over to the X and Y.
It's a different setup that
depending on the game that you're playing,
can end up being way more comfortable.
I mean imagine having an
actual switch pro controller
that you could swap out the buttons for.
So if you're playing say, Smash Bros.,
and you wanna have that
kind of A, B, X, Y setup,
you can do that.
This is one of those ideas that
you know when I finally
see it here in this form
I have to wonder
why don't we have that
yet in more controllers?
Because so many pro controllers
emphasize things like
being able to swap out different D-Pads,
to different stick heads.
And a lot of them have
programmable buttons
that are in addition to the ones
normally placed on a controller.
But why not have the option
to change the very way
this thing is laid out? I
think part of the reason
why we haven't seen a
feature like this sooner
is because in general we've
gotten very comfortable
with the traditional
simple four button layout.
I mean it's the way that
Xbox has used for all their systems,
PlayStation has used
for all their systems.
As far as current major systems go,
Nintendo is the only
one that's experimented
with this at all
and even they've switched
over to this format
for all their modern systems.
But that doesn't necessarily mean
that it's the only button
style out there that works.
I mean there's a reason
why there are third
party controllers still
that do well because
they offer some kind of
interesting alternative to the norm.
For instance, once Super Smash
Brothers came to the switch,
we saw a bunch of GameCube
style controllers come out.
People were finding ways
to use GameCube controllers on the switch.
People were really seeing
new third party ones
that use that same kinda button layout
because it's a very popular
design for that specific game.
And even for fighting games,
if you're not using a fight stick
but instead you wanna
use a fighting style pad
a lot of those use six button setups
because it works better for the concept of
which buttons are tied to which attack.
Again the standard four style button setup
will work for these,
it's just not always the best.
And when it comes down to
expensive pro controllers
whose whole focus is
trying to give you the best
most focused experience
possible for your game play,
it's kinda weird this isn't a part
that's been experimented with a lot yet.
I mean even with the ASTRO
C40 that had just came out
and the whole focus is in
the idea of modularity,
you can switch the D-Pad and the sticks,
you can change different stick designs.
But the buttons,
even though they're
under the same faceplate,
are not changeable.
That's still locked in the same place,
no matter how you set up your controller,
that's always going to
be a fixed part of it.
Part of why I focus on this so much
is because we're getting soon to the end
of the current generation of the system.
The switch is gonna continue
being a strong contender
but PlayStation 4 and Xbox 4
are starting to hit that phase
where we're gonna see
a new version come out
probably within the next year or two.
And so while those new
controllers, those systems,
are likely going to be the
same kinda standard setup
we're getting used to right now,
it just makes me wonder,
when it comes to third party
options and pro controllers,
what's the next thing
that's gonna reinvent that?
Because we've already got
plenty that change our sticks,
plenty that switch
between wire to wireless,
plenty that give all kinds
of other adjustments.
What's that next new edge?
And this might be it.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
