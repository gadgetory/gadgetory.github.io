Microsoft's press conferences we see
where they both have to offer so let's
see how it affects the constant war
between xbox one and ps4 or should I now
just say Xbox one X versus PlayStation
four pro
first things first let's talk about
hardware we officially know what the
Xbox one X is called we know what it
looks like
and we know what it runs on and in
complete honesty it completely blows the
PlayStation 4 pro out of the water when
it comes to power the power to roll -
the power to be masters of the universe
I mean it's literally better computer
parts across the board I'll try one more
a little more subdued to illustrate this
let's break it down to some of the
simpler numbers the Xbox one X has a GPU
capable of 6 teraflops whereas the
PlayStation 4 Pro only is 4.2 at the
same time the Xbox one has 12 gigabytes
of RAM nine of which is dedicated to
gameplay while the other three are
reserved for things like the OS and
other side functions while the ps4 pro
just has eight and what's really the
Marvel about all this is despite how
much more power the Xbox Linux has it is
actually just as small if not a little
smaller than the 1s which is definitely
smaller than the ps4 Pro so it's not
only the more powerful system but it's
also the more compact now that's not
just a difference in power here that's
important it's how that power is being
used one of the things that was kind of
awkward about the PlayStation 4 pro is
that it only showed support for games
that had very specific Pro patches if a
game at launch didn't have a pro patch
it would work on the ps4 Pro just like
it would on a ps4 slim now eventually
they did introduce an option called
boost mode which would make it so that
if a game didn't have a pro patch it
would still see some updated performance
thanks to the ps4 pros higher power
whether that's just more stable frame
rates higher framerate so on so forth on
the other hand with the Xbox 1x it's
effectively always in boost mode games
are going to see better frame rates more
stable frame rates everything's going to
be better and in fact it'll even make
use of things like super sampling so if
you don't have a 4k TV you're going to
get clearer crisper better images than
you would with a regular Xbox 1s not to
mention the X features an improved hard
drive that does have faster loading
times now now of course one big issue is
4k gaming the whole reason why these new
systems exist in the first place and
it's really interesting to see how
Microsoft and Sony have taken very
different approaches to this the Xbox
one X is all about true
4k gaming Microsoft took a look at all
the games coming out this recent
generation and saw what kind of tech was
necessary to push them into native 4k
whereas the ps4 Pro does have some games
that display in native 4k resolution but
they're the kind of games that aren't
exactly graphic intensive and don't take
as much work to do so whereas with a lot
of bigger triple-a titles the instead
make use of a variety of upscaling
methods to achieve something that while
not true 4k is pretty close as far as
most people are concerned now all this
processing power does come at a cost
literally it is going to cost you more
money the Xbox one X is currently listed
at a price point of 499 dollars whereas
the ps4 Pro came out as a launch price
of 399 a whole hundred dollars less now
all that being said if hardware is of
course important but what's even more
important in my opinion is the software
that they are running so let's see what
games each company has announced for the
upcoming year that just might affect
your decision now when talking
exclusives for each system and just
looking at the press conferences for the
past couple days honestly I kind of lean
towards microsoft having the best press
conference just as far as new titles
announce goes I think they did an
excellent job of having a wide diverse
array of different titles admittedly a
lot of them were a little vague as to
whether or not they were permanent
exclusive to Xbox one some of them would
specify things like at launch but it's
still not clear whether or not those
games would go to things like
PlayStation 4 switch PC we just don't
know yet but when we're talking about
games that we know for sure are
exclusive to Xbox one as well as Windows
10 because play anywhere is the thing we
still got some strong titles including a
personal favorite for me which was Orion
the world wisps we got ports of
motorsport 7 which wasn't really a
surprise to anyone but it's still great
to see crackdown 3 is back on we got new
footage for games like state of decay 2
and sea of thieves and I think a big
surprise for a lot of people is that
player unknowns battlegrounds is
actually coming to console exclusively
on Xbox one now on the other hand with
Sony I gotta be honest and actually say
that this year's press conference was
kind of a weaker one for me I mean I
loved in the last two years I think they
won the last two e3 s but this one was
focused a lot more on just showing a
little bit more on games you already
know about and not a whole lot of new I
mean all the new stuff was either VR
games which are honestly kind of hit and
miss for a lot of people I think we got
to remake foreshadow the Colossus which
does look amazing but it's still a
remake and that was all
the one actual non VR exclusives they
announced because the other game was
Monster Hunter which is awesome but
turns out that's actually coming out on
PC and Xbox one as well that being said
the new stuff we saw for games you
already know about it did still look
pretty good you know I really like the
gameplay for God of War spider-man
looked amazing I liked what I saw for
Detroit and uncharted didn't really care
about days gone that much personally
it's just not my kind of game
so overall Sony still had some good
stuff to bear I just think Xbox one did
a better job of building hype with their
press conference the thing is though if
we're looking at all the games coming
out on both systems I'm still leaning
towards Sony having the stronger
exclusive library like I said they had a
really good last two years and part of
that was announcing games that still
aren't out yet but just weren't talked
about it this year's e3 and her in the
pipeline stuff like death stranding the
ff7 remake Last of Us part two there is
still a lot of stuff on the way for Sony
so when we look at the full list of
exclusives for each system
I still think Zoe's winning</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
