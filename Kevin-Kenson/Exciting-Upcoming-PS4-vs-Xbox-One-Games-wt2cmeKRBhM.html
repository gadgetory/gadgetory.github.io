in price anytime soon
which ps4 game are you most excited for
in 2018 okay so this is a little weird
because honestly when we look at the
full list of games coming to PlayStation
exclusive this year there's only a
handful we've actually seen real
gameplay for you know spider-man God of
War ninokuni - all of which look great
I'm probably most excited for God of War
out of that list but then there's a
whole bunch of other stuff which sounds
really cool in concept but we've just
seen trailers and stuff like last of
those part two or of course death
stranding which I'm really curious about
I just don't know if I can say that I'm
most excited for them since I don't know
how they're playing if I'm being honest
though what I'm hoping for the most
which isn't confirmed yet is whatever
from software teased back at the game
Awards which yeah it might not be a ps4
exclusive but might be multi-platform
but it also could be blood-borne - which
I really really absolutely want that's
what it needs to be or at least
something designed in the same manner
whatever just that's that's what I want
to have happen now to be fair out of all
the Xbox exclusive this year which one
are you most excited for
definitely right now see a thieves I
really love the idea behind it I love
the just design goal of how it
accomplishes multiplayer and just giving
friends stuff to do and working together
and planning stuff out at the same time
I'm really glad they've announced there
are ways to do kind of just
single-player exploration kind of tied
into it I love the idea there's some
other stuff this year that looks like it
could be good crackdown 3 another state
of decay we're probably gonna see a
couple of their big names announced -
like port surprisin for hopefully a new
Gears of War I would love to see that
happen but as of right now what we know
for sure see of these what the Thunderer
that beanie
do you think battle royale modes in Call
of Duty 2018 and Red Dead Redemption to
actually work or will it destroy the
battle royale genre destroys a harsh
word I really don't think it's gonna
happen even if both those games ended up
having terrible battle royale modes at
the end of a people can just go back to
pub G or fortnight or whatever it is
they're playing that they enjoy what you
really need to be worried about is the
year after or maybe even as early as
this e3 where every developer Under the
Sun is gonna announce their battle
royale clone to try and compete I mean
it's the same thing that happened with
MOBAs we had legal legends DOTA all that
stuff and then all of a sudden there's
this explosion where every company is
trying to do the same thing and copy the
success and that's exactly what's gonna
happen with battle royale so the real
issue is once all those games start
coming out and people get really tired
of the genre because there's 50 million
different options to choose from that's
what you should be scared of what is the
oldest system you continue to play so I
actually dust off a lot of my consoles
pretty often the oldest one I use fairly
often is the SNES I definitely use that
one the most especially lately because
the super analog antique came out so I
know I'm not really using the SNES but
I'm playing all those games a bunch i'll
also break out a gameboy advance
playstation 2 to also play ps1 games i'm
constantly working on a gigantic backlog
of old games that i know we're supposed
to be amazing and i really liked but I
just never got around to finishing
there's just there's too much stuff out
there guys to stop releasing games for
like 6 months I know it would kind of
suck but I need catch up I'm a huge Mass
Effect fan and my question is only about
that but other huge franchises how can
something big with a huge fan base get
treated so badly when you have a great
developer and a big publisher EA the
future of handheld gaming with the
obvious overlap between the DS and the
switch as well Sony giving the Vita the
Wii U treatment do you think we'll see
another D S or PSP on the DSN no I
really don't think so one of the long
arguments that was happening for a long
time is that you know handhelds are
losing to mobile phones and that's kind
of become true at this point because
even the intend oh you'll notice is
making stuff on mobile phones and
pushing ahead with a switch they said
they weren't gonna drop the D S which
they haven't yet they've still been
releasing games for about the past year
but I think it's gonna really drop off
this year and don't think we're gonna
see a new system I think they're gonna
be fully dedicated on the switch
especially after how well
been doing now as for Sony their
handhelds have never really done
incredible I mean honestly I do like
them a lot they've been great especially
if you really love Japanese RPGs there's
a lot of great ones on those systems but
they've never been huge successes so I
don't think it's impossible for Sony to
do a new one but I don't think it's
likely and if they do it might be
something that's closer in style to what
the switch does which they actually have
kind of messed with before I mean the PS
TV and the PS Vita was trying to kind of
do what the switch does it was just
wasn't as good because they're two by
two different systems that play the same
games instead of one system that did
both</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
