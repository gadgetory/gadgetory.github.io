the rapture for the ps4 and I got to
admit I liked it a lot more than I first
expected to the thing is is that there's
this genre of games that start of
getting more and more popular in past
couple years
that places a heavier emphasis on the
arts side of gaming rather than the
mechanics and some people like to poke
fun at these by calling them walking
simulators because you basically spend
ninety five percent of the game just
walking around looking at stuff and to
be honest this kind of game has never
really grabbed my attention before
there's been a couple that have gotten a
lot of huge exposure but they just never
really grabbed me I think part of it
comes of the fact that growing up I
really loved the game Myst which has
similar elements but it's like taking
that game and removing all the puzzle
aspects to it which just feels weird to
me personally
the thing is though everybody's gone to
the rapture has caused me to change my
opinion just a little bit on this style
of game and it mostly comes down to the
fact that it just introduces a greater
scope for the genre and represents a
step forward to what I think it could
really end up developing into so for
those of you that have no idea what this
game is the basic idea is that you start
the game off by showing up in this town
and have zero context for what's going
on the only obvious thing is that all
animal life is dead and there is no sign
of any humans anywhere otherwise it's a
pretty peaceful albeit very deserted
town the whole premise is to explore and
experience events in the town in order
to piece together what exactly happened
the whole thing is done by either
following these orbs of light that
guides you from important place to
important place or activating other orbs
of light which end up causing you to
view memories of people that once lived
in the town the town is divided into
basically six major areas each of which
focuses on a different person's history
I'll get little bits and pieces of other
characters but for the most part you're
focusing on the storyline of each of
these six individuals which you'll learn
about by viewing memories by listening
to telephone calls between them and
other characters or by finding radios
that constantly have narration from the
character Kate and this is really all
you do in the game you just walk around
find things to watch interact with and
just pay attention to all the little
different minut details the game has in
order to get the full gist of the story
so let's talk about what the game does
well which I think the biggest strengths
by far is its aesthetics which are near
perfect
for conveying the kind of tone the game
wants to have well there are a few weird
graphical glitches here and there
overall the design of the town the use
of colors lighting and shadows just
makes the whole thing look really
beautiful I love the fact that even
though it takes place in one small town
there's clearly different terrain types
and environments going on within
different parts of it so it doesn't just
feel like you're exploring one stagnant
area it feels like a real part of the
countryside you might see now as far as
the music goes most of the games
actually dead silent which is a good
thing because it really kind of instills
that feeling of loneliness and your
characters are exploring this deserted
town but while you're viewing certain
memories or listen to certain very
important phone calls the game will
occasionally begin to strike up
different kinds of music that really
kind of drive up the either dramatic or
religious or mysterious tones that the
game likes to impart oftentimes these
will play during these scenes and carry
on a little afterwards before slowly
subsiding back to the quiet loneliness
you'll usually be hearing now the one
thing that I think really helps to draw
this one apart from a lot of other
artistic games like this that focus on
narrative and exploration is just the
scope the game has to offer the whole
town itself is rather sizable and
there's a lot for you to look at there's
lots of different little details
different act available items that you
can listen to that all give you
different aspects of the story and it's
possible to miss a lot of this on your
first playthrough you know depending on
how you like to approach a game of this
style you could just blitz the whole
thing and finish it in a few hours maybe
a little longer but really the main
point is to take your time exploring and
find every little nook and cranny to
understand the story the best that you
can and doing so can actually extend the
length of this game quite a bit hitting
the low double digits or at least very
late single digits the breadth of
experiences that the game covers really
is its strong suits because you're not
just following one storyline you're
seeing all these different aspects of
different people's lives
seeing how they interconnect finding out
different side stories to each them and
the whole thing just has this really
strong emphasis on the ideas of
relationships memories and the
importance of what kind of legacy you
leave behind once you've up and gone and
disappeared like everyone in the town
there's a whole lot this game has to
offer for people willing to take their
time to explore which is really great
but there are some downsides to it as
well first off those
orbs of light I talked about that will
help guide you around to the most
important sections of towns well those
don't always work out the way they
should I've had a couple times where one
of them gets stuck in a wall and just is
trapped there or I walk up to it and it
does absolutely nothing which it's not
necessary to follow them to complete the
game but it's one of the better ways to
pace out experiencing all the different
memories so having them not work is a
really weird problem that detracts from
the rest of the experience my other and
far bigger complaint though is that for
how much this game has in it it just
feels like it's still incomplete in many
ways not that what's here is bad but
that it just could have been even more
there's a lot of buildings in the town
that you just simply can't enter either
because the door is locked for some
reason the door doesn't have a handle
and there's a lot of situations where
you can find like outdoor sheds that
have windows and if you look inside them
it's just a barren empty room not even
having a floor just having grass
textures inside of it
so what it ends up feeling like is the
game is just guiding you to all of what
it considers the important areas and
tries it's best to distract you from all
the places you can't go or areas that
just clearly look undetailed
it's not enough to completely nullify
what this game has to offer but it just
makes you think about what it really
could have been if the entire town was
completely detailed as opposed to just
the bits and pieces they wanted to have
stand out now keeping that in mind I
still think that the rest this game has
to offer is still well worth exploring
and pretty worth the 20 bucks you know I
could definitely see someone wanting to
wait for a sale but as it stands right
now I don't feel bad about how much I
spent on it the thing is is that pretty
obviously though this game is not meant
for everyone if you're looking for
something with action or puzzles or
really anything that most people would
consider to be a traditional semblance
of game play mechanics you're not gonna
find that here but if you're willing to
put those feelings aside and instead of
focus on the three things this game does
care about exploration aesthetic and
narrative then there's a lot that
everybody's gone to the rapture has to
deliver on I do think that the formula
for the style of genre is still very
unrefined but at the same time
everybody's gone to the rapture is a
great sign of growth and the kind of
game we can eventually get where we're
seeing large open areas with a much
greater degree of detail
within them like I said it's not for
everyone but if you want a game that
delivers on a beautiful aesthetic and an
interesting form of narrative this is
definitely one of the new titles to keep
your eye on and pick up when you get the
chance well those were my thoughts on
everybody's gone to the rapture as
always if you enjoyed this video hit
