sequel to the cult hit mirrors edge is
finally here and sadly it is one of
those games that just does not live up
to the original and here are five things
that kept it from being great first off
was the decision to make the game an
open world setting which is something
that does have its upsides but also its
drawbacks on the one hand it makes it a
lot easier to implement things like side
quests collectibles challenges which is
something this game is stuffed with not
to mention it gives players a much
greater sense of control because they're
able to go where they want when they
want rather than being forced to follow
along with the game's main story on top
of that one of the best ideas going into
this game for using an open world is the
fact that you as a player can create
your own time trials to challenge other
people with despite this though it just
feels like Mirror's Edge is a kind of
game that doesn't really benefit from an
open-world setting or at least the way
was implemented in this game one of the
things that made the first game so great
was its sense of fast pacing there was a
very little story very little forcing
you to wait through one thing or another
it was very fast-paced gameplay that got
you from one place to the next and with
this you find yourself spending a lot of
time having to run back and forth back
and forth over the same areas in order
to go to wear different missions start
to find different collectibles and it
doesn't help that the world you're doing
this in is honestly very boring the
style and design for it makes sense for
the setting and it fits well but it just
doesn't make fun interesting of a thing
for you as a player to explore it's a
lot of white space a lot of the same
collectibles things that you can find
everywhere and it just gets very boring
after the first couple hours now whether
or not you like the idea of it using an
open-world one of the things that keeps
this game interesting and keeps you
rooted in is of course the core par core
mechanics which is by far this game's
biggest strength it is tremendously
satisfying to play through the game's
different challenges missions and
cyclists over and over again trying to
shave time off your best score to
compete with other players and it really
harkens back to this feeling of
old-school games where yes you're doing
something that is kind of repetitive but
at the same time it's really satisfying
because you're just seeing how you're
doing a little better each and every
time what really messes this up though
is the fact that this game is
ridiculously bugging over the short time
it took me to complete this game I
encountered all kinds of bugs including
clipping in
wall and getting stuck between the wall
and a ladder walking on thin air and
also falling down but surviving causing
the game to checkpoint in an area where
I couldn't actually proceed so I had to
restart the entire mission all over
again it didn't happen enough to make me
completely rage quit the game but it was
definitely dense enough to really kind
of sour a lot of the experience and make
me have to take breaks every now and
then because I was just so frustrated
with the issues and while the core par
core mechanics are really cool there is
one aspect of them that was very weird
to me and that's point number three the
progression system over the course of
playing catalyst main story there are
two forms of progression that really get
unlocked some things that are
automatically given to you for getting
so far on the story and other things
that you have to unlock yourself by
spending experience points that you get
for playing the game now the gear based
rewards for getting further in the story
I'm completely ok with I actually
thought that was a good idea because it
gives you a reason why you can't explore
certain areas of the open world just yet
and it gives you new ways to complete
old trials faster and better but the XP
based progression just doesn't really
make sense in this game to me it's
become this thing now we're a lot of
games that weren't RPGs to begin with
now implement pseudo RPG systems and
they just don't need them and this is
one of those situations where it just
wasn't necessary at all in fact several
of the abilities that you unlocked with
XP are things that you really should
just have right away as soon as possible
because they're necessary for getting
through some of the games later levels
like being able to immediately turn
around being able to do a role when you
land or even double wall running the
game does make sure the main story bits
do give you enough experience in order
to afford these abilities but it just
seems like it just didn't need to be
there in the first place now point
number four is probably my biggest
problem with this game and that's the
combat system there are some cool
aspects to it in particular the park or
style attacks where the game rewards you
for knowing how to use terrain against
your enemies and basically just for
doing cool shit in general but if you're
just standing on the ground trying to
fight enemies toe-to-toe it is extremely
boring and it doesn't help the fact that
a lot of the enemies come across as
complete idiots a lot of their AI is
extremely simple they lose track you
very easily all they ever really do is
walk up to you and try to swing with the
same attack over and over again and
enemies that have guns just stand at a
distance and randomly fire here and
there rather than just freely unloading
on you
when it would be so easy to also it
comes across like all of them are a
little drunk all the time because the
animations they have for when they run
into each other or when you push them
into boxes is extremely silly looking
and it's kind of dumb how easy they pass
out from some attacks and to make all of
this worse unlike the first game there
are parts in this one where you have to
fight enemies in order to proceed there
is no option for running away or getting
by then you have to beat up a bunch of
guys to get farther forcing you to deal
with this game's weaker mechanics last
but not least the final point to talk
about is the game's storyline now I
actually didn't mind the basic idea
behind this game's plot I think a lot of
the ideas for the reboot for faiths new
origin for the main plot arcs of the
game we're actually pretty cool the
problem is it feels as though there was
a much larger plan initially put in
place that didn't end up happening so we
ended up with a very large cast of
characters that never really got any
time to shine and never got fleshed out
there are so many characters in this
game that have interesting little quirks
or try to get characterised but then
have no screen time and no time to build
up and it just feels like there's a
whole lot of secondary characters that
don't do anything aside from one or two
of them it feels that the game would
have been a lot better had they cut out
half the cast or at least collapse some
of them together into one character
because as it stands a lot of them just
aren't very interesting in this along
with all my other points really just
sums up how i feel about this game it's
a lot of squandered potential i know a
lot of the points i've been making sound
extremely negative and might make it
seem like this is one of the worst games
of the year it's not it's a perfectly
mediocre game that after some bug fixes
and some price drops can definitely be
worth picking up but that's the problem
it's just mediocre and you can see how
much potential this game had while
you're playing through it especially
compared to the first and it just seems
like at some point the dev team ran out
of time money resources or just didn't
have the heart put into it to make it
what it could have been and ultimately
after having finished it I'm not really
angry about it I'm not salty about it
I'm just sad</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
