Nintendo switch one of the really big
ones to come from traditional gamers is
the lack of a d-pad on the joy con but
there is now an official solution to
this with Horus d-pad joy con
replacement
this is something that has been out in
Japan for a little while it was having a
few problems it was first released it
would soak up a ton of battery from the
switch itself but that has been switched
with the latest switch firmware and now
it's made its way to the states in an
awesome little Zelda design and a Mario
design as well however while this is the
first official way to get a d-pad for
your switch this is not the only option
out there and there's actually much
older one that we've done before on this
channel and that's making your own
modded joi con with a d-pad so we're
gonna compare the benefits and this is
of both of these in which one's actually
worth getting what
first let's talk about what exactly
you're getting with this hoary deep at
droidcon now this is an official release
joy Khan it's half the price of an
actual joy Khan and has the benefit of
adding this little d-pad here but there
is a lot of stuff it's sacrifices first
off it has no internal battery batteries
not included
and no Bluetooth connection this cannot
be used on its own you can't use it
wirelessly you can't use it sideways it
is only meant to be connected directly
to the switch when you're playing in
portable mode and as a direct result of
it missing all that tech inside it is
considerably lighter than regular
droidcon you might actually even think
it's fake or an unfunctional when you
very first pick it up because there's
nothing in here it also doesn't have the
Rumble battery or gyroscope so it is the
bare-bones basics that you need to have
a functioning controller and in fact
when I actually first open this I was
really confused for a moment because I
was just checking it out looking at the
buttons and I was like oh that's weird
it doesn't have any shoulder buttons it
doesn't have anywhere else connection
there's no point it's only used on the
side so there'd be no reason for those
now for how this works compared to using
a traditional joi con it's actually
fairly close in a lot of areas like I
said it is a lot lighter which can throw
you off a little bit but you don't
notice it as much well it's connected to
the system the stick feels pretty much
identical to the one on traditional joi
cons shoulder buttons feel great the
only areas we really noticed a
difference are the minus button the
screen capture button and then obviously
the d-pad the - and screen capture
buttons I have a little more software
they don't have the same kind of
satisfying click that the traditional
droid cons have and then the d-pad
doesn't have the snappy button feeling
at all because the drug comes have
actual buttons it's much softer and
feels much more akin to like an
old-school SNES controller so when it
comes to just being used as a substitute
for a regular droidcon when using your
switch in handheld it actually does the
job really well it fits in really
seamlessly and since it doesn't have
that battery problem anymore it's pretty
awesome there's just one major problem I
have with it and it's actually this
little raised bump right here so where
the release button is there's a
different shell shape and at first
glance you might think oh that's kind of
weird but whatever it's not a big deal
right the problem is especially when
you're using a switch in portable mode
something we've been talking about a lot
lately is that it's great to buy a grip
to use with your switch in portable mode
but
cuz of this little group right here most
traditional grips are not going to fit
your switch anymore
because the grip doesn't actually fit
over the controller it causes buttons to
be misaligned and the whole thing just
ends up being really awkward and weird
that aside though if you're just like
using your switch straight up and you're
not using any kind of grip or
attachments or anything this is actually
a pretty awesome little upgrade I do
love the visual look of it too when the
original resident Japan it was just this
straight blue look but in the u.s.
releases they've done this is all the
one and a Mario on that as well that
look really really nice I actually kind
of wish we had an official droidcon that
a designed kind of like this so for 25
bucks this is actually a pretty cool
little replacement but the question here
is how does it compare to something
that's even cheaper and just requires a
little elbow grease on your own part so
just as a quick refresher on how easy or
maybe actually how hard it is to do a
shell exchange we're going to do a fresh
one right now this is actually the first
joy con we ever did a shell mod on we
added this white one we're gonna take
this one and replace it with another
white shell but one that has the d-pad
so let's get at it right now
I really hope I don't break a joy cone
so that actually went pretty smoothly
and as a result we now have a fully
functional left icon that has the d-pad
so unlike the holy one this has wireless
connection gyroscope Rumble all those
awesome features and you can still use
it on its own sideways if you wanted to
although that is a little awkward with
the deep head right here and all of this
comes at arguably the cheaper price
point of $15 for the left shell deep pad
by itself now of course the reason this
is arguable is because well the shell is
cheaper than the hoary d-pad you are
also going to have to take a joke on you
already own and convert it into this
design so if you don't already have an
extra joy con you're going to take the
only leprechaun you have and turn into
this which can be awkward for scenarios
like I was saying where if you want to
use the sideways like this a big bow
and then there of course there is also
the very real issue of if something goes
wrong when you're doing that conversion
process I mean what we did just now
worked out fine but that's also cuz I've
done this a few times and I'm starting
to get the rhythm for it anyone who's
doing their shell exchange to the
reverse time really does run the risk of
possibly stamping a cable not plugging
something in right maybe messing up how
certain buttons are laid out and give me
a lot of effort that could end up
turning into well nothing by the way if
you like the idea of having a white joi
con but you don't want to run the risk
of accidentally destroying one that you
own a great easy and affordable solution
for it is today's spot is today's
sponsor D brand foldable they've made a
whole line of different switch skins
that are totally safe to use for your
joy cons the switch itself or even for
the dock you can get him an awesome
white design like this or in a variety
of colors and even special ones like
carbon fiber if you're interested you
want to grab any check out the link down
below now we've already talked about a
lot of the in-depth ups and downs of
these different methods of getting a
d-pad there's still one very important
comparison to have and that's just what
the experience is like using each of
them because while the shoulder
placement has all the benefits of still
being used wirelessly and all that kind
of stuff as far as it goes just using
either of these attach to your switch in
portable mode the experiences are very
similar except for how those D pads
differ starting with the Zelda Hori one
like I was saying earlier the d-pad on
this one is a little softer it feels a
lot closer to using like an old-school
controller which on the one hand can
feel a little familiar and comfortable
especially if you still play a lot of
old-school gaming systems I mean this
feels like I'm going back to using like
an SNES controller but at the same time
I'm not sure if it's still the best way
to go because it works well for things
like rolling motions but it just has the
same kind of satisfying feedback they
can get with the official droidcon so
let's actually switch to that shoulder
placement right now and see how those
differ
so with the shell replacement you're
still using the same kind of underlying
buttons that the regular Droid coms
would have it's just that instead of
them being contacted by four separate
little buttons it's this one d-pad
that's just hitting each of them so
you're getting that same kind of kind of
clicky feeling you get when you hit each
side of the d-pad and honestly that's
something that I've really grown to like
with this design it's not exactly
traditional but I actually find it to be
functionally a little better and if you
do end up wanting to use the droidcon
sideways for whatever reason it can
still at least work kind of like you're
hitting those four buttons because
you're getting that clear feel that
you're hitting each one so in the end I
got to say that while the hoary deep AB
controller is a great option that's
gonna work right out of the box and and
I think a fair price if you're willing
to put the work in and you have the
confidence you're not going to
accidentally break anything the shell
replacement is the much better method to
go with you're gonna get the better
d-pad of my opinion and not to mention
the fact that you're still going to get
the full functionality of a left joy con
that you can use wirelessly</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
