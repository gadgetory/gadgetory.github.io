ultimate gaming setup this time with the
PlayStation 4
now in the past some of the giving set
ups have been a bit much
so this time I want to do something a
little different and focus instead on a
setup that is a little more functional
but still aesthetically pleasing with a
minimalist very clean looking design
which led to this so as you can see
super minimal setup I mean there is
nothing on display here other than the
TV and the sound bar now as far as these
go the TV is one I've used a couple of
times before from Samsung I'm not going
to say the name because it's just a
bunch of letters and numbers the point
is is that it's a 4k TV with great color
depth but more importantly a super low
response time for a 4k television which
is super important for multiplayer games
as for the sound bar it's from LG same
deal I'm not going to say the name cuz a
bunch of letters numbers the point is
that while this is the most
cost-effective option it does offer
amazing audio quality and a pass-through
for 4k systems now while we do obviously
have the ps4 set up right now I want to
do something a little extra on this
setup and have not just one system but
two we not only have a ps4 Pro hooked up
to this TV but also a livingroom PC
upping the amount of gaming goodness and
giving you just way more games to choose
from the way we've set this all up is
that we have this credenza right here
from living spaces called the baile
cadenza which is a great looking piece
of furniture and it basically has three
main doors while restoring all the
functional bits of this setup behind
door number one is this little top down
opening shelf we've got our ps4 Pro and
our Alienware alpha which we're using as
our living room PC for this setup we
load it up with a gtx 960 the Alpha is
the perfect balance for what we need in
this setup something that is small
aesthetically pleasing to fit on the
shelf but at the same time offering the
power necessary to give us a good smooth
frame rate while gaming now below this
is a drawer which is where we're storing
all of our physical copies of games
because I'm a caveman and still buy all
my discs physical I avoid digital
whenever I can and as well as a little
storage case for additional accessories
we may need such as additional
controllers so and so forth and on this
third larger door is where we're storing
the psvr now the PS VR is a bit messy
when it's fully set up so to kind of
avoid that instead we just have it set
up on a charging base for now and this
little storage cubby filled with all the
additional
wires and pieces that are needed so when
we want to set it up it's all easily on
hand but it's not constantly there
creating a huge mess of wires now
something that we've done with past
setups that I wanted to avoid this time
is having a lot of important bits like
controller charge stands headphones all
that kind of stuff on the entertainment
console itself because let's be honest
who actually wants to walk up and pick
things up to then sit down you should be
able to just sit down in your comfy
chair and play games and if everything
you need on hand right next to you so
that's why on this little side table we
have a charging dock solution set up for
our ps4 controller so you can just have
them right there with an arm's reach and
not have to worry about the batteries
being dead we also have our platinum
headset set up right here we don't have
a set up to be charging right now but
that's why in this drawer we actually
have a charge station set up so we can
plug stuff in when need be you can also
use it for things like charging your
phone or anything else on hand that
needs charging and then when we're using
the PC we have this Bluetooth wireless
keyboard set up we were able to use this
as a lap keyboard with a little place to
use the mouse as well
this design I really wanted to focus on
just having something that was
functional but still aesthetically
pleasing but in a very minimalist way
you know not every setup has to have
statues and figures and all kinds of
bells and whistles everywhere instead we
just focus on all the things necessary
to make an excellent gaming experience</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
