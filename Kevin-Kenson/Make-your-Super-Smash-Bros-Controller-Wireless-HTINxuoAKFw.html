release of super smash brothers ultimate
and if you haven't noticed there are a
lot of accessories coming out that are
tied into this game a lot different
gaming controllers different third-party
accessories and I am really excited
today to talk about one of them the g
bros adapter
this is an adapter that can plug it game
controller into and it makes it a
wireless controller for your switch
which is an amazing idea now if you're
wondering why something like this is so
exciting and why we're seeing so many
different GameCube accessories coming
out for smash well the reason why is
because the basically the definitive
smash game that people always compare
other smash games to is super smash
melee for the GameCube is someone that
really propelled the series into
popularity it cemented a very strong
tight-knit fighting game community and
because it was on the Gamecube well it
used the Gamecube style controller and
that really solidified it as the go-to
controller for Smash Brothers this is
why when brawl came out on the Wii a lot
of people want to make sure they had the
ones that were backwards compatible with
GameCube so they could use those
controllers that's why when the new
smash came out on Wii U they released a
separate adapter and new GameCube
controllers to connect to it and that's
why for the switch we're seeing once
again Nintendo released the adaptor
again their own controllers again and
even all the third parties like PDP
Horry and power are all jumping in
releasing their own third-party GameCube
controllers and to be clear I don't
think this is just situation of oh
people used it back then so they feel
comfortable it I really do think the
game controller is an excellent
controller my opinion of it has always
been that it's not the most well rounded
controller but when a game is designed
specifically for it in mind it is
amazing in Smash is an excellent example
of them and that's what really makes
this thing really cool is the fact that
you can take that controller you'll be
using ever since smash melee hook it up
to this and now it is a wireless
controller for your switch giving you
both the benefit of a GameCube
controller but the comfort of a wireless
setup and thankfully it is really easy
to use and set up so let's check it out
there's not that many buttons you need
to worry about all in the unit itself
there's basically just these four
there's a syncing button that looks like
a little C stick which is a nice little
touch there is a trigger right here that
goes between X input and switch mode X
input is if you want to use it with a PC
we're gonna use this for the switch
though so we're gonna put it to that and
these two buttons vary based on how
they're being used this one is the home
button on the switch it's also how you
initially turn on the G Broz and then
the start button acts as screen capture
now setting this up of your switch is
very simple it works like a lot of other
wireless products you just have to go to
the switch is connectivity screen make
sure the G bro's is set to switch mode
plug in the game controller you want to
use with it and then hit and hold the
home button to initially turn it on and
make it search for a switch to connect
to and then after just a moment it
connects that's it done let's go
and Tre game now like with a lot of the
other GameCube controller videos we've
done so far
smash obviously isn't out yet so instead
we're gonna play brawl out because
that's one of the closest ones that can
still make use of this layout so let's
check it oh yeah this just feels natural
this feels like using a regular GameCube
controller I'm not really noticing any
input lag I mean no more than you're
using a wireless controller would have
versus a direct wired in but nothing
nothing that would be a problem so yeah
that's really as simple as it is I mean
I just haven't plugged in and synced and
everything runs perfectly fun right now
I will say that for the setup I mean
it's not like having a wave bird where
it is just a truly wireless controller
and that's it you do have to deal with
the cable which the braaap does help
with but you're always gonna end up with
a little bit of bunched up cabling that
might bother you for me it's not a big
deal just make sure you have a place to
sit this next to you while you're
playing and it's really a wireless
experience something worth noting
compared to the official Nintendo
GameCube adapter is that this does add
some buttons that you're missing on the
game controller specifically the home
button and screen capture like I
mentioned earlier but you are still
missing a ZL button so depending on the
game you're playing you are potentially
still missing an important button but
this does up its ability to be used
across more games than usual so it works
but how does it compare to other
GameCube controller options for the
switch well the first obvious comparison
is of course the official Nintendo
GameCube adapter which like I said
earlier this has a couple benefits in
that it does give you a home in
screenshot button and obviously is a
wireless setup instead of a wired one
but the big trade-off here is that the
official into the one gives you four
controller ports where this is just a
single one on the other hand once again
Wireless additional buttons and it
supports rumble on the GameCube
controller which the official Nintendo
adapter does not so they're not real my
fear is this if you're planning on doing
local multiplayer games in one situation
where for people all at once can have
GameCube controllers the official
Nintendo is just going to be the cheaper
more affordable way to go but if you're
only gonna play by yourself or you only
ever want to do two-player games that
are more competitive 1v1 this is a great
option even if you need to grab two of
them I think it's worth it so this is a
great go-to option for using your
old-school GameCube controller but
another option worth considering if you
just want a wireless GameCube controller
experience on your switch is power a
wireless option the trade-offs here are
a little more in
because if you don't already own an
official GameCube controller this is
gonna be an option where you just buy it
by itself and it's gonna work right out
of the box you don't have to buy
anything else now to mention the fact
that while this does give you a wireless
experience on a game controller you're
still dealing with the fact that there
is a cable hanging somewhere and how
they get bunched up might be annoying
for some people which this doesn't give
you at the same time however while this
is shaped like a GameCube controller and
as I think a really good controller that
comes close it still isn't quite the
same true original GameCube controller
experience and if you want that if you
want to have the actual old-school
controller especially be already own one
this is still gonna be the way to go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
