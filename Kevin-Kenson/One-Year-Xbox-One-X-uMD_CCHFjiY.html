officially one year old,
and we're gonna talk
about what has changed
in that past year, how
well it's been selling,
and how it stacks up against
its chief rival, the PS4 Pro.
(upbeat electronic music)
- [Voiceover] So, do
you have any smack talk
for people who are buying an
Xbox One and why Sony's better?
- You're wasting your time (laughs).
- When the One X was first released,
the really big push for
Microsoft is that this
is the most powerful console ever made.
If you just looked at
the specs you'd be a fan.
That was definitely the case.
I mean, it had a lot more
power than the PS4 Pro.
When it came to games that were coming out
that holiday season,
we were seeing results
where the One X versions
were running better
at higher native resolutions and
often times offering
more graphical strengths.
But seeing things on a spec sheet
don't always translate
to real life practice.
As time goes on, some things can happen
where dibs might handicap
a version of the game
because they want console parity, or maybe
it's just they made one version that
works equally well on each system.
Thankfully, that really hasn't been
the case for the One X at all.
Over the last year, we've seen a lot
of big name, AAA titles come out
on both the PS4 Pro and Xbox One X,
and time and time again the One X
is the crisper, better looking version.
With examples like,
Assassin's Creed Odyssey,
Call of Duty Black Ops 4,
Rise of the Tomb Raider,
and most recently, and probably most
importantly Red Dead Redemption 2.
The PS4 Pro versions can't get close
with things like advanced upscaling
techniques like checkerboarding.
But, at the end of the day, the Xbox One X
has a higher native resolution,
resulting in a crisper
image, and often times
games will also include
different graphical
improvements, like better draw distances
or higher quality shadows.
Now, raw power alone
is cool, but something
that I really did like
about the One X at launch
versus the PS4 Pro, is that I feel like
Microsoft has put a lot of effort into
improving the user
experience in the system,
and that's something that has improved
as well over the past year.
They've pushed a number of updates
that have improved the
wide, add more customization
control for the user, as well as making
things just easier to navigate.
And, they've made a lot of changes to the
adaptability of the system to work
in a much larger range of setups,
including support for 120 hertz monitors,
fortune 40p resolution,
and even supports freezing,
which mostly works with monitor setups,
but there are Nano Samsung TVs that also
use this technology to
give you a much smoother
looking frame rate
experience on the Xbox One X.
Microsoft's also been
pushing a lot of products
and updates to help make sure the system
is more accessible to a
larger number of gamers,
including the adaptive
controller, which makes
it a lot easier to use the system
with different physical disabilities,
a narrator for the Xbox One, which is now
available in a lot more languages
for people that have vision impairments.
This is even reflected in their
new avatar system, where people can make
avatars of themselves featuring
different impairments,
like being in a wheelchair.
All of this is great,
and I think it's really
what's helped meld the Xbox One X
into really being the best gaming console
when it comes to just its
hardware and software.
That has reflected a bit in sales,
where while Microsoft hasn't really
talked specific numbers anymore,
it does look as though the One X has been
improving sales for Microsoft in general,
but still not quite enough to
compete with other systems.
A large reason for that is the one
weakness of the system, exclusives.
While the One X has made
itself the go-to system
for multi-platform games
to get the best visual
experience possible,
when it comes to unique
and exclusive games on it,
things have still been pretty slow.
Over the last year, we've basically
only had three big name exclusive titles
come out on the One X,
including State of Decay 2
and Sea of Thieves, both good games,
but neither which has really had
an explosion of popularity
enough to really
justify them as console pushers.
The third title is Forza Horizon 4,
which is a really good game, honestly,
I think it's the best one in the franchise
and really worth playing,
but at this point
anyone who's a Forza fan has probably
already picked up an Xbox One.
It's not getting new
people into the system.
Now, with that said, I
think this is something
that Microsoft is acutely aware of
and is something they want to change
in the coming future, but its
not happening just quite yet.
I think they've tried pushing toward
this idea a lot at last E3, where I think
they were really trying to
make three big points clear.
First off, Xbox One X is the system
you should go to for multi-platform games.
Ending their E3 conference
with Cyberpunk 2077
coming from the same
studio that made Witcher 3,
which was a huge success, they're sending
the message, hey, everyone's gonna wanna
play this game, and One X is
gonna be the place to do it.
Two, they announced a number of exclusives
for big name franchises
they've already established,
like Halo Infinite and Gears of War 5.
And three, most
importantly, they announced
a lot of new studios.
What's more interesting to me is that
they've also acquired Compulsion,
who's responsible for We Happy Few,
and Ninja Theory, who's made a lot
of really interesting, beautiful games,
and could do some really
cool stuff for Microsoft.
And, if recent rumors turn out to be true,
they could also be acquiring one of my
personal favorite developers,
Obsidian Entertainment,
responsible for some of the
best RPGs in recent years.
While none of these acquisitions
solve the immediate problem and give us
games right here, right now today,
it shows that Microsoft is
investing in future ideas.
And, another year from
now, we might start to see
a lot of really cool, really awesome
exclusive games down the road.
So, that being the current state of the
Xbox One X, what is next for Microsoft?
What is the future of the Xbox?
Looking at a lot of the
stuff they've been doing
the past year or two,
and also they've talked
about in recent press conferences,
I really feel like they're moving towards
the idea of Xbox no longer
being a set of hardware,
but instead, Xbox as a service.
I mean really, look at a lot of stuff
we've been focusing on lately.
At E3, one of the things they talked about
was the idea of focusing
on game streaming,
bringing it to other devices so you
can play Xbox games on
things like your phone.
- Our cloud engineers are building
a game streaming network to unlock
console-quality gaming on any device.
- Recently, they revealed concepts for
a controller adapter
that'll work with phones,
and even tested the
idea of Xbox All Access,
a program where instead of just
buying Xbox for a set price
amount right out the gate,
you can instead pay in installments
over time, where you pay for the services
like Xbox Live Gold and Xbox Game Pass,
and at the same time you're paying off
this controller in small fees over time.
So, the idea could be that, down the line,
instead of being something where you just
buy a system, maybe you're
just buying a stream box.
Or, maybe you are buying hardware
you can use in your home,
but you're paying for over time
and accessing this large library of games.
I mean, it's even evident by the way
they have approached the idea
of backwards compatibility.
While Nintendo and
Playstation are focusing
on releasing old games through
other side retro consoles,
or doing different special programs,
Microsoft does approach the idea of,
hey, you bought this one
system, this one box,
and we'll try to get it to be able
to play all the 360 games you liked,
all the original Xbox games you liked,
and of course, all the Xbox One stuff too.
I think Xbox made something really special
with the Xbox One X, and while things
have been a little rough as far as the
first party games go, I think they've
got a really interesting and bright future
ahead that I want to see shaped.
And, we might get some more
insights into that soon.
They're doing a new
Xbox event this weekend,
in just a few days, and I'm really curious
to see what, if anything,
new gets announced.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
