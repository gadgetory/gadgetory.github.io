the Nintendo switch but unfortunately a
big problem a lot of them is they're not
cheap I mean just getting a brand new
joke on one by itself is 50 bucks so if
your new switch owner you've had them
for a while and you're looking to get
some new accessories for it let's talk
about some ones that are going to be
really cheap I'm talking under 10 bucks
first we're gonna start with something
really tiny and that's a micro SD card
for your switch now yeah if you're
looking to spend under 10 bucks there
aren't a lot of options out there and
largest you're gonna get is a 16
gigabyte now if you are dedicated to
just getting all your games digitally
this isn't gonna cut it but if you're
like me and you buy all your games
physically this is really all you're
gonna need to expand just a little more
storage into the switches it's almost
double as much and it's gonna help you
with all the DLC and stuff patches and
the occasional smaller download only
game that you want to grab next let's
talk about a bunch of different ways you
can improve your controller experience
with a switch really cheaply starting
with these jail guards for the joy cons
now this makes the experience of just
using the joy cons as a pair a lot more
comfortable it adds this gel texture
which may gives it a little more grip
one of the bigger things though it
actually adds up some extra little plush
right here on the back so it gives a
proper grip format rather than the flat
back the Droid cons have making it much
more comfortable for extended gameplay
it also add these little gel tops to the
control sticks which adds a little more
height and makes them more grippy so
that's great if you want to use your
droid con separately but what about in a
more traditional controller setup well I
really
this cheap grip you can grab from
Powerade now at first glance this looks
a lot like the comfort grip that you get
with the switch when you first buy it
and honestly I hate that thing it's just
not comfortable doing at all and so
while this guy does look similar it's
actually a big improvement because of
the grip design first off instead just
being a flat grip which doesn't really
contour to your hands at all
this guy actually curves in a little bit
so it's a lot more comfy and it's not a
hard plastic it's actually kind of a
softer just still hard but a rubber
design that just feels more comfortable
for long-term play so if you like the
idea of using the comfort grip trust me
this guy is an awesome cheap upgrade as
for using your droidcon separately we're
used to have one at a time using those
things sideways does not feel
comfortable in the slightest so I really
recommend picking up these guys now
these all come in pairs of two so you
always get them they come in different
colors you can also get in a straight
black and all it really does is give you
a place to slot your joique on so it has
a much more traditional controller grip
style so the grips on these while still
hard plastic is a lot better than using
this little guys sideways and even gives
you improved bumpers for using the
shoulder buttons so honestly huge
upgrade especially like doing any kind
of multiplayer games or sharing joy
Kahn's everywhere if you're doing some
like Mario Cart much better experience
next let's take a look at stuff that
helps you when you're using your switch
portably now I've said many times before
that for me the switch is primarily a
portable system and there's a whole lot
of accessories in grab to improve your
experience using it portably now first
off one of the most kind of required
things to get a grab is a case now there
are a lot of fancy designed ones out
there that you can spend a lot more
money on but if you just want something
to get the functional job done
you can grab this basically guy right
here for under ten bucks and it has
everything you need really it may may
not have like a Mario or is all the
thing going on but it carries all of
your game carts you have a place to
store cables as well as additional joy
cons and what I really like about it too
is that it securely keeps the switch in
place and even has a little indent to
make sure that the shoulders and
everything have a nice little place to
rest it isn't pressing any buttons down
by the way you may have noticed that so
far the video all the joy cons you've
shown off aren't exactly that
traditional Nintendo designs that's
because they're all actually just the
standard Greyjoy cons but with the
newest D brand skins put on them and
they got a whole bunch of different
options they only go for under five
bucks for a single joy con so you can
get a set for under ten bucks you know
all kinds of choices like different
glossy colors like this pink here also
red
green etc as well as some other
different designs like matte white a
carbon fiber or even camouflage it's a
really easy way to customize your joke
ons for super cheap especially don't
want to spend a whole bunch of money on
brand new colorful joint cons another
thing that's important when you're
playing stuff portably is of course
being able to hear the game clearly
especially in a noisy day so picking up
a set of headphones is a really good
idea now there is some stuff you can
grab that's branded for switch but that
really doesn't matter if you just want
auto so we are able to find this really
nice cheap set of headphones that are
just under ten bucks from Panasonic
they have great sound quality for their
price range it's got adjustable ears
hips and everything and they come in a
large variety of colors now along with
playing at home on a TV setup or outside
portably the third option is to use your
switch in tabletop mode and the main way
you're supposed to do that normally is
to make use of the kickstand which I've
said many times before I'm not really a
fan of it makes the switch constantly
fall down it breaks off it's annoying so
there's a couple accessories you can
grab to make this situation better like
this little portable kickstand right
here now this is a little part we'll set
up that folds up really easy to put into
a bag and it just gives you a nice
little way to set up your switch for a
tabletop mode that's not going to be
falling over constantly the other upside
is that since it lifts the switch up a
little bit you actually have a space to
plug in a power adapter so you can
charge it at the same time which is
another annoying aspect of playing in
tabletop mode now if you want
something's gonna walk more of a line
between tabletop or portable you can
grab a hybrid cover like these guys
right here there's a whole lot of these
on the market but there are now some
cheaper ones showing up for under ten
bucks that you can grab it's basically
acts as a protective case your switch
should open this up real quick and just
gives you a way to set it up that's
gonna give it not only a little
protection but a way that it has a
built-in improved kickstand setup as
well something else that's really
important to keep in mind too is that if
you're gonna use your switch a lot in
tabletop mode or portably you're gonna
need a way to carry around all your
games especially if you buy them all
physically like I do in which case you
want to grab one of these guys right
here these are from power a they make a
couple different designs and all it is
is a little portable case that can hold
up to 12 cartridges for your switch so
definitely cuts down instead of having
to carry on a bunch of cases or having
all a little
cartridges fly around loosely which you
don't want to have happen so definitely
a good pickup</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
