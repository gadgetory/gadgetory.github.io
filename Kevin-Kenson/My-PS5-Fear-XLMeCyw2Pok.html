of having a surprise reveal of some
of the early specs behind,
what we're all currently calling the PS5.
And a lot of is sounds like some
really exciting, awesome
stuff, for the future.
But there's a part of me
that's a little worried.
First, let's talk about
what exactly that news was,
if you guys aren't fully up to speed.
So, Mark Cerny did an
interview, with Wired,
talking about the specifics
of Sony's next-generation system.
There were three really
main areas they focused on.
Visuals, audio, and storage.
Visuals are, of course, one of the main
focus areas that a lot of
people get hyped up about
for next-generation systems.
And, they certainly weren't
pulling any stops on this.
Now, the claims for this
next-generation system
is that it is gonna be able to support 8K,
as well as be one of the first consoles
to make use of ray tracing,
which is a technology
that allows for more advanced
and realistic depictions
of how things like light and sound travel.
Obviously, 8K isn't something that people
are going to be making use of, right away,
considering what TV options
are out there, right now.
But the idea is, it's
going to have the power
to be able to do that and therefore,
should be able to handle
4K or maybe even 1080p
with no problem whatsoever
and be able to offer
these super premium experiences
for people that have that option.
As for audio, this is
something that I feel
like a lot of people are
actually glancing over,
when they're talking about the news,
which is a little disappointing.
Because I think it's actually one
of the really interesting
parts to come out of this.
Because audio is something
that is oftentimes
very neglected when you
talk about video games.
We gotta talk about it a lot in terms
of like, oh, do you have
a good enough headset?
But, we don't always talk
about, is your system
actually giving you the
best experience possible,
in the first place?
So, as part of this announcement
of ray tracing technology
being in the card for
PS5, there's also idea
that this will also support 3D audio.
How sound travels in games is going
be more realistically
depicted and something you're
gonna notice a lot more, with a nice set
of surround speakers or
with a really good headset.
Where you're gonna get drawn
into the game a lot more,
than what is currently possible on the PS4
or any of its competitors.
As for storage, the
discussion wasn't so much
about how much data the PS5 could hold.
But more importantly, how
quickly it could load that data.
Because they're making one big upgrade,
finally moving to SSDs.
Now the main example
that you had for this,
was running a Dev Unit
version of Spider-Man for PS4.
And showing that on a PS4 Pro.
If you're fast-traveling
from one part of the city
to the next, it takes 15
seconds to load that up.
If you're taking that exact same situation
and applying it to this
new version of the system,
using an SSD, it only
takes point eight seconds.
So, why am I worried?
Well, I'm worried because of histories.
Specifically, Sony's.
Let's look back at some of their systems.
The PS4 has been doing great.
The PS1 did well.
The PS2 was a huge
success, in fact it's still
the top-selling console ever.
And then the PS3 hit a wall.
And there's a few reasons
why the PS3 hit a wall.
It had a few problems with it's hardware
and services, at launch.
There weren't a lot of super strong games,
when it was first released.
And it immediately had a
problem with perception,
because of its price.
Sony was at the top of
the world, when the PS3
was getting ready to release and when they
announced a price point of 500 dollars
or 600 dollars for a bigger hard drive,
compared to its competition.
That was an insanely high number,
that freaked a lot of people out.
And as a result, it had a very, very,
rough start, sales wise.
It eventually clawed its way back out,
but that was after numerous remodels,
cutting a lot of features and making it
a much more affordable option.
Now, how is this relevant to the PS5?
Well there's a quote that didn't make it
into the original Wired
article, that started
making rounds afterwards.
But, certainly talking about
the price of the system.
Specifically, he said,
&quot;I believe that we will
be able to release it at
a suggested retail price
that will be appealing to gamers in light
of its advanced feature set.&quot;
Translation, it's going to be expensive,
but it's going to be cool enough,
that people aren't going to care.
And that hasn't always
been the case with history.
Sure, we have Pro versions
of systems, right now,
that are expensive and people think
are cool and are buying.
But, those aren't the main
moving versions of those systems.
They are expensive options,
for people that can afford it.
While other people are
moving for Xbox One S's,
and PS4 Slims, because
they play the same games,
they get the job done and
they're a lot more affordable.
Whereas, with the PS5,
if it's the only option,
or all models available for it at launch
are gonna be super expensive.
And we're talking about a system,
that's launching at minimum 500 hundred,
possibly even as high as six.
That's kind of a scary
thing and reminiscent
of what happened with PS3.
And you can even see this
from other companies,
representing more modern history,
like with the PS4 vs the Xbox One.
When those systems came out,
the PS4 was 400 dollars.
Still expensive, but a new, shiny thing.
And it felt like, kind
of the right price point.
Xbox One, on the other hand,
launched at 500 dollars,
for what was actually a weaker system.
But, it came with a Kinect.
Which was thought to be
a cool enough gimmick,
to maybe balance it out and wasn't at all.
No one cared.
Everyone went for the system that
was a little more powerful.
But more importantly, was
also offering a better deal.
Now, I get it.
It's supposed to be a premium, new, cool,
super powerful, thing.
And that costs money.
Nice things cost a lot of money.
But, I'm kinda looking at the standpoint
of looking at the history
of how consoles have sold
and how things performed.
And, at the end of the day,
a really important thing
is making sure that a lot of people
are excited for your
system and are willing
to throw down money for it.
Because if someone spent
two, three, hundred dollars
on a PS4, a year before
a new system is released.
And now they're told, hey,
those games that you love,
well, all their sequels
are now PS5 exclusives
and cost 600 dollars
just to get the system,
in the first place.
That's not a thing people tend
to always react very well to.
There's a lot about this news that's still
really exciting to me.
I mean, obviously just the entire concept
of how powerful it could
be, is a really cool idea.
And there's a lot of
other, like side tidbits,
about the news that's really cool.
It's still going to support PS4 games.
Though, there were previous rumors
that a new system could maybe
even go all the way back
to PS3, PS2, and PS1.
That'd be cool.
But, even if not.
At least a PS4 would be very much welcome.
And, it would even
include support for PSVR.
Which, leads also to the theory
that there might be a
better, stronger version
of that, in the future, as well?
And even if it doesn't,
it being really expensive,
that isn't necessarily
the end of the world.
I mean, again, the PS3 had more problems
than just its price.
And even with all those
issues it did eventually
end up doing, basically fine.
It pretty much broke even with the 360,
in international sales.
Plus, there's ways they could
even balance out this entire issue.
For instance, maybe the
one we're talking about
right now, with Mark Cerny,
is their super, top-line,
amazing version of the system,
that's gonna cost money.
And there might me a
more affordable option
that launches with it.
I mean, after all, not everyone
really needs a 8K system.
Especially, if it's gonna come out
sometime in 2020, maybe 2021.
There's a lot about the system,
we still don't know about.
How it's gonna shape into.
And what kind of additional
services or things,
it's gonna be capable of.
And I am super excited to learn more.
So, let me know what you guys think.
Are you excited about this news?
Do you believe all the stuff
being said about the PS5?
And how much do you think it should cost?
Let me know down in the comments.
And until next time guys,
you've been watching
the Kevinator, I'll see you later.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
