had some really strong presentations and
hopefully this year is no different
Toni will make continued own out efforts
to live up to your confidence and
expectation that's a little interesting
they're doing this time is that while
most companies are remaining somewhat
tight-lipped about what they're gonna
talk about or just doing little hints
here and there Sony's been fairly
upfront about what their conference is
gonna be about they have said
specifically that they're not really
gonna talk about a hardware this year
and they're gonna focus on four games in
particular this doesn't mean that those
are the only four games we're gonna talk
about these are gonna take up the most
time at the show they've got the lead
right now as far as them vs. xbox goes I
think out of the three press conferences
Sony has the lowest chance of premiering
a lot of new stuff but hopefully what
they reveal is gonna be really strong
now before we talk about the press
conference itself one thing I want to
bring up is that like last year Sony is
once again gonna be doing days of play
that's a little kind of celebration they
do for III where right before III starts
they're gonna do a whole bunch of sales
on major PlayStation games they're gonna
do hardware sales and I think one of the
most cool parts about it is that they're
actually not released once again a
special edition ps4 last year they had
the gold and silver designs for the slim
this time they're doing a ps4 slim
that's with a one terabyte hard drive
and is a blue design with this gold
PlayStation symbol thing going on the
front which looks really nice by the way
if you really like the look of the blue
on the new days of play ps4 but you
don't really care for the gold symbols
or you want it in a pro or you already
have a ps4 you don't want to spend 300
bucks just to get a different design
there's a really easy way to do it
yourself thanks today's sponsor dbrand
you can actually get one of their skins
which comes in basically the same blue
actually right here and put it on your
ps4 slim or ps4 pro for way less than
buying a brand new system and if you've
got a switch they actually just came out
with new skins for the switch that
aren't gonna damage the paint job and
look really nice
the focus is gonna be on games and like
I said earlier there are four main ones
that sony plans and spending a lot of
time on first up is the Last of Us part
two now we've seen a couple trailers for
this guy already but there's a lot we
still don't know about this game that's
hopefully gonna be illuminated this time
we've got a couple trailers each focus
on different characters we don't
entirely know how it ties the first one
just yet other than obviously Ellie's
going to be in it but whether or not any
plot from the first game carries over
beyond just her we've seen no game play
yet so hopefully our going to see some
actual stuff and maybe even see if
there's any major changes to the game
design versus what we saw in the
original next is Ghost of Tsushima now
if you haven't heard about that one that
was announced at PS X late last year and
it's the newest game coming from Sucker
Punch so sadly we're not getting a new
infamous just yet which I was hoping for
but this game's looking really cool -
it's supposed to be a historically
accurate free roam game where you play
as the samurai kind of as a ninja though
based on at least what we saw in the
last trailer really interesting to see
how that games actually gonna handle and
play because right now we just kind of
have teaser shots of at least the
setting third up is the biggest licensed
game that Sony's gonna have as an
exclusive for this year and that is of
course spider-man from insomniac games
now of the four they're gonna focus on I
feel like this one's gonna be the least
mainly because we actually saw quite a
bit of it at last year's e3 we've got a
trailer that not only showcased some of
the plot but also a good bit of gameplay
go more so than any of the other games
on this list so we're hopefully gonna
see a little more in depth a little more
actual explanation and not just gameplay
without context but of the games on this
list we know the most of this guys so
hopefully we just get a little bit info
and we focus on the others and then of
course the fourth games are gonna talk
about and probably the most hyped
mysterious extremely strange game on the
list is of course death stranding coming
from Hideo Kojima now we have had a
number of trailers on this game and we
have a vague idea of what it's about
it's pretty intense it's pretty all over
the place I mean if you've seen any of
the trailers you know what I'm talking
about
there's babies and whale bones and rain
that makes you immediately age and
disintegrate there's just a lot going on
with this game which a lot of people are
excited because it is a Kojima product
but at the same time we know nothing of
the actual gameplay still so hopefully
this is the year that we finally kind of
break down those doors and see what this
game is really about
now these are the four games that are
gonna focus on that doesn't mean those
are the only games are gonna talk about
at all I mean there's a lot of stuff
that we know is coming to the
PlayStation that has not been released
yet as far as first party stuff goes
we're gonna at least see a trailer four
days gone even if they're not gonna go
in-depth on it and I'd be really
surprised if they - press conference
without any brand new games to announce
that our first hand whether that's some
more HD remasters which sony has been
doing a lot of or hopefully one new
project I mean most of their main
studios are still busy right now or just
release stuff I mean obviously God Ward
just came out from Santa Monica blast of
us is still being worked on by Naughty
Dog
so if there's one company they have that
could maybe make at least a new teaser
announcement for something
I think it's guerrilla they're released
horizon zero dawn so the timings right -
all these T's either the second one of
those or maybe even another brand new IP
personally if they do announce something
I'm kind of hoping it's not another
Killzone because if horizon zero dawn
proves anything they should just make
other new IPs because that was really
cool and then of course there's gonna be
some time for third-party companies as
well now there's some that are having
their own press conferences but could
still at least make an appearance at
Sony because it has been proven by
history that lots of times games will
make trailers at most press conferences
just to kind of get hype on all fronts
Square Enix of course has ff7 remake
happening for PlayStation at least timed
exclusive so hopefully we get some more
info on that Kingdom Hearts 3 could
maybe be exclusive to a Square Enix
presentation since that is gonna be a
multi-platform game hopefully we're
gonna see something from Capcom as well
because they do have some new stuff in
the works they work a lot with Sony and
at this point I really just need Devil
May Cry 5 actually announced or some
kind of successor because that series
needs to come back one thing that I'm
really hoping to see some more info at
at Sony's press conference is whatever
fromsoft is working on they obviously
just released the remastered version of
the first Dark Souls they're kind of
done with the main Dark Souls line for
now but they did tease something back at
last year's BGA's which could maybe be a
bullet board - but more likely as some
other new IP that is hopefully gonna be
using the same kind of formula as the
souls born games now there's no
guarantee that what they were working on
is a Sony exclusive that wasn't really
talked about in the teaser they did but
considering how well blood-borne
on the playstation floor isn't exclusive
I would think Sony's gonna push for some
other new title to come from them for
ps4 because blood-borne was amazing and
I just need more stuff from from soft</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
