start talking about what we could expect
to see from the big three companies this
year starting with Sony yeah the
interesting thing about Sony this year
is the fact that the last two d3s have
been very heavily focused on a lot of
games that were very much far future
production stuff that we still don't
have out yet so just looking at that
backlog of titles we already know about
there's a lot I could still be discussed
at this III where they can have no new
announcements and just focus on those
games giving us release dates and
showing actual gameplay and it might
very well be enough so what games can we
expect to see well we're still waiting
on two titles that were announced back
at e3 2015 including Shenmue 3 which did
get officially kick-started but we
haven't really heard anything official
since then and the Final Fantasy 7
remake which has gotten a little bits of
info here and there we've seen a little
bit of gameplay but there's a lot of
unknowns that game still we don't know a
launch window
there's been talk maybe selling it in
episodes rather than just one complete
game there's a whole lot we still need
to know about this and it would be nice
to know by now then from e3 2016 last
year we get a lot of games that are
still not out yet and really haven't
even talked about much more beyond what
we saw back then God of War 4 had an
awesome demo but that's it the new
spider-man game coming from insomniac it
was really just trailers and real
gameplay would be really nice to see
because a good spider-man game has not
happened in quite some time
and of course death stranding new game
coming from Hideo Kojima that has been
nothing but cryptic since its initial
announcement and were really starting
look for some answers now and if all
that was enough we also Quantic Dream's
detroit become human which they've
talked on and off about the last few
years and at PSX after last year's e3 we
got the announcement of Last of Us part
two and uncharted the Lost legacy so
like I said there's a lot of games
they've already talked about that we
need more info on now before talking
about what new games you could expect to
see at this year's e3 I want to talk
about a rumor that began circulating
recently regarding the potential
announcement of the PS 5 now this rumors
started circulating from an analyst who
in the past has properly predicted both
the ps4 slim and a ps4 Pro and really
while it seems like this might be a
shorter gen cycle than most it's very
not that insanely short I mean both the
ps1 and ps2 around for 6 years the ps3
was around for 7 but if the system does
come out the potential PS 5 in late 2018
that's five years since the ps4 was
released so yes it's a little shorter
but not by a crazy amount now does this
mean I think it's going to make it
appearance at this year's e3 I'm not so
sure about that I mean especially since
Sony has now been having their own
yearly special press conference at PS X
it almost feels like an announcement
that belongs there more than at actual
III and if we are going to see it it
would be at most maybe just a light head
nod or one of the last things they
mentioned to help build hype for the
coming year
so new games what could we expect this
year at e3 well the two biggest rumors
that have been circulating recently for
Sony specifically are resistance for and
blood-borne 2 and none of those
resistors for feels a little bit more
like the outside choice for me at least
I mean it's true we haven't had a new
resistance game since 2011 there was
also burning Skies in 2012 but that
doesn't really fully count but the
reason why I'm a little unsure of that
is the developer is insomniac who as I
said earlier is working on a new
spider-man game
IP that huge is probably gonna take a
lot of dedication and I'm not sure if
they're gonna be juggling that alongside
a new resistance game at the same time
but I could be wrong
as for blood-borne 2 from software has
said they are done doing Dark Souls
games for now but blood-borne is only a
select not part
same series so doesn't really apply they
have also talked about maybe working on
a new IP at the same time but that could
be very well in its early stages with
blood-borne two being something that's a
much closer release which I would be
super excited for because we have had
sold games basically one every year we
Starks all three last year blood-borne
one the one before that so hopefully
we'll get blood-borne two for this
holiday season and lastly while rumors
had not been circulating at all like I
said back in my e3 wish list
sucker-punch has been really quiet the
last few years they did infamous second
son back in 2000 it was either end of 13
or very early 14 they released infamous
second son back in early 2014 with a
standalone DLC called first light after
that and nothing since not a word not a
peep
so I think it's about time we get
something new from them is it a new
infamous I hope so but it could also be
Sly Cooper another franchise they go on
that hasn't been touched in quite some
time so the chances of one of those two
showing up hopefully are pretty high so
that's what we might see at this year's
e3 coming from Sony now in my opinion
last two years they won t 3 so it's
going to be really interesting to see
how they do this time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
