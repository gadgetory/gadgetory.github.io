right now because we've got another
limited edition system that just came
out that we're gonna box for you guys
and it's this polka ball too
now what's kind of interesting about
this is that the new Pokemon game isn't
even out yet it's actually coming out
next Friday so I guess a Nintendo just
couldn't wait for people to start
grabbing these here just now so let's
open it up check it out we have of
course the AR cards that are still
shipping every time we have our pokeball
that's just a pokeball it's pokeball
what am i doing that's awful
forgive me guys forgive me oh it's
actually really shiny it's actually
really funny because if you guys watch
my other unboxing video yesterday I
talked about how that Call of Duty
system had the mixture of gloss and
matte and I didn't really care for it
this is doing that too but in a way that
I actually really like so the black
finish all here is this glossy
reflective while the main body with the
white red is matte which actually gives
a nice kind of just outline to it and
lets the main popol design really pop
out really like that so this is
different too so most to DS's the inside
is still like a plain black matte finish
not here we actually have red for the
main body still black around the screen
but this is definitely much different
looking design compared to the other 2d
s as we've seen so far really diggin
that black and red aesthetic on the
inside the latest in a very very long
line of special edition pokemon theme
systems that Nintendo has knocked out
because Pokemon being one of their
biggest franchises makes a lot of sense
that they're just gonna pump out as many
different special editions as they can
and I gotta say of all the ones they've
done so far this one's actually one of
my favorite for one very important
reason it manages to be a Pokemon themed
system that isn't one of two things one
it isn't based on a specific game we
don't have legendaries for a certain
game on earning like that it's not tied
to a specific Pokemon to where once you
find out you hate that one too bad and 2
it is not Pikachu there is so much
Pikachu on every special edition before
I love this one's actually just a unique
design that celebrates Pokemon but isn't
tied to anything super specific that
being said this is actually one of two
special edition to DS's that are coming
out this one is the only one that we're
getting in the US meanwhile in Japan
getting another one that is you guessed
it pikachu themed but that being said
it's actually a really cool looking b2
theme because it's his face but like
this one it's actually kind of grooved
out to where you actually like the
contour of his nose which is
unbelievably cute while this isn't
coming out on the same day as a pokemon
game it is time for pokemon ultra sun
and ultramoon which should hang out a
week from now okay made another mistake
here guys the game is coming out on the
17th which is two weeks from the special
edition system not one week resuming the
video and this is one of those point
five updates where we're not seeing like
a whole new roster of a pokemon added
but it's an update to sun and moon'
that's adding new forms a couple new
pokemon designs and some really rad new
features the most recent thing they've
announced is that every single villain
from all the other pokemon games is
coming back for you to battle which is a
really cool thing you've been a longtime
fan of the series so there we have the
pokeball two DS unboxing if you guys
want to check this thing out I'm gonna
link down below in the description and I
will see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
