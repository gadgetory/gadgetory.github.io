an end and if you're still looking for
that one little gift to get a friend or
maybe a stocking stuffer for a kid
whether you're shopping online or going
to stores let's go over the best cheap
gaming gifts you can grab first is
something I've talked about a little bit
before this year but I feel like really
needed its own dedicated spot and that's
pixel pals from PDP you I love
collecting these little things I love
the 8-bit stylings of them that make
great displays whether you have them lit
on or off and the number of properties
they've started covering is really
really huge actually when they first
started off there is a focus mostly on
more traditionally retro actual 8-bit
stuff like you know Mario Zelda Megaman
but lately they've been covering a lot
more properties that you know never came
out back then but they've now reimagined
in the ways that look really good like
kratos right here from god War Master
Chief from Halo they've got more combat
Street Fighter all kinds of different
stuff that just looks really freaking
awesome then we have a gift that's also
a little bit of a curse this is
something that I've been getting really
into lately and that's blind boxes these
things have been getting really huge
lately things to go binding two of the
best and worst parts of gaming's
collector obsession and gambling basic
idea is that you buy a blind box it has
one of 10 12 16 different things you
open it up and you see what you get and
there are a whole bunch of these out on
the market now for different pop-culture
things lots of gaming ones but one of my
favorites is blizzards cute but deadly
series these are all different Blizzard
property characters from Warcraft
Starcraft overwatch and they all have
little bit of redesigns that make them
just a little more adorable and just
honestly really fun little collectibles
now this is a series too so it has stuff
from across all of blizzards different
huge properties but if you have a friend
who's a really big overwatch fan keep
your eyes open for series 3 because that
is nothing but overwatch stuff so I
actually haven't even opened this one
yet I don't know what's in it so let's
find out and of course so you don't just
open it in store stuff to go through one
more stage and we've got you an
alternate color awesome actually real
like this characters that's out now of
course collectible stuff is cool but
what I really love is something that's
not only collectible but also serves a
functional purpose as well now common
options for that normally are things
like slippers t-shirts but clothing can
always be kind of hit or miss something
I think makes a great
there are a lot of options out there for
is mugs there are so many different
gaming themed mugs especially for right
now during the holiday season in fact
this is one I found a Gamestop for just
five bucks it is something that is
exclusive to them you can find it online
and I'll make sure to list that as well
but it looks like a lot of people
reselling them so they're going for a
little more but honestly if you can
track these things down or any other
kind of similar design these can make a
solid gaming gift next up is probably
one of the weirder fines we've had but I
actually really really love it
especially for our cheap it was and
that's an off-brand nerf gun that's
based on a halo this is a plasma pistol
design I've seen a couple of the ones
from the same company called boom Co
which also did like the needler and
stuff but this one out here was just ten
bucks and for that price this thing is
actually really really awesome it comes
with five darts there's a place to store
all of them on the gun itself so you
don't just stick them in a drawer and
forget about them until six months later
when you're cleaning stuff out and
despite its cheap price it actually
packs a really really powerful punch now
if you like the idea of a figure but you
want something a little smaller not as
expensive maybe just a nice little
stocking stuffer add-on a great choice
are these pop keychains they've made so
many different designs for gaming stuff
like from overwatch or pac-man they have
a lot of other like just pop culture
ones like from Disney that make great
little collectibles now I've said before
that I'm not a huge fan of the
traditional pop figures because
something about the eyes just really
really creeps me out
and that's still true but for some
reason when you make them super tiny
like this it just looks a lot better to
me so if you want just a little
something to add on for someone these
are an awesome choice so there's some
great last-second inexpensive gaming
gift ideas for you guys you can find a
lot of the stuff online I'll link it
down below or if you just have to make
your shopping trip for this year you can
find them in a lot of stores and best of
what to you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
