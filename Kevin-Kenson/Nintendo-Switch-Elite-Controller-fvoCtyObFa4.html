favorite style of controller but you
can't use it on any device you want
because oh you have to use controller
design for our system with it you have
to buy these specific ones sometimes you
just want have your favorite controller
and use it on all your devices and
there's a couple of ways you can kind of
work around this that we've talked about
before for instance there's this little
receiver right here from 8bit dough
which lets you use ps4 controllers or
xbox controllers with your switch at the
same time Microsoft is also kind of done
options before where there's a receiver
lets you use an Xbox one controller with
a PC well today we've got something that
kind of the similar idea but works in
the opposite direction that I'm really
curious to try out and it's this guy
right here this is an adapter for an
Xbox one controller which all-in-one
will supposedly let you use it on a
switch a ps4 or your PC instead of
having to have separate dongles for each
system and on top of that it also adds a
couple other features as well for
instance giving you headset support on
ps4 or more interestingly motion
controls on the switch which all in one
little package it's also returnable
battery which didn't come with a cable
for some reason that's a little knowing
but it is just micro USB so that's not a
huge deal they're not too expensive to
pick up so let's try this guy out so the
part I'm really curious about is the
motion control so we're gonna set this
guy up with an Xbox one elite controller
and play a little zelda with it to see
how well we can actually aim the bow
using motion controls so the way this
guy works is we should just be able to
remove the battery cover and slide this
guy into place it's gonna take the place
of that cover as well as plugging into
the micro USB port on the top of the
controller so let's try that out
okay that felt a little weird to do and
kind of worked me for a second but it's
in and feels like yeah it's pretty
secure okay so the next step something
that you do with a lot from Bluetooth
controllers when you have to change
settings to work with different systems
is you have to enter a certain kind of
mode the way it works on this guy is I
need to hold this button up here until
it blinks yep there it is and then I hit
the I figure what Xbox calls it but like
the menu button here the one the one on
the right or left I whispering what it's
called and then for switch I think I
said to hit pain so just seems like it
shuts it off okay all right I was just
holding the button too long I think
maybe it's not a this might just be a
bust we're gonna take a quick commercial
break so I can reread the directions to
this guy
so turns out I was doing everything
wrong
so first off I memorized to the wrong
button combination I was entering ps4
when I need to do switch which is B
instead of a but also for the very first
time you set this guy up you actually
have to plug it into the switch
temporarily which is something that I've
had to do before with other kind of
similar not Nintendo controller setups
for the switch so let's go ahead and go
through that process right now
it's saying to make sure that in our
system settings we have switch wired a
controller support active yeah pro
controller wide communication on so
that's an important part that a lot of
these kind of hacks have to keep rely on
so that's why I already have that on
connected using a USB cable which once
again it didn't come with so I had to
find another one scrounge it up it's not
showing up but it's staying on this time
if cannot be successfully repaired
reboot the switch and try again power
cycles fix everything
making sure everything's right one more
time it just turns out that like I have
latest Pat's just totally destroyed the
way this knockoff adapter would work and
it also brick source which if you try
using it I think we might just kind of
say like and we're gonna go ahead and
stop until I can take a look a day to
figure this out so approach it for you
guys out there whenever you buy a new
piece of tech it is generally a very
good idea to make sure you do any
firmware updates before you actually try
using it I didn't do a firmware update
so I actually checked and it turns out
that the latest firmware specifically
fixes it having problems with switch 5.0
so it's installed now let's go ahead and
see if it actually works
so aha yes
and then i unsynched it on accident cuz
I hit the wrong combination of buttons
while I was celebrating victory first
step down we have it working on the
switch
now once again this is something we've
already been able to do before using
other accessories but where this guy is
hopefully going to give us a little
extra bang for our buck is that we're
gonna be able to do actual motion
controls with the Xbox one controller so
let's go ahead and start up Zelda
alright so so far our controller works
great I mean it feels natural nothing
feels off yet so next let's go ahead and
try the motion controls yeah I have
motion controls and it feels natural I
mean it feels like the same way if
you're using the switch Pro controllers
that's awesome actually that this is
giving me that full functionality with a
controller that normally doesn't do that
at all
rechargeable battery pack makes it work
on switch and it works at motion
controls that's I might not use a pro
controller again now so yeah this guy
actually works really well and now one
problem you saw me kind of having with
this guy though is the fact that an
ongoing kind of weird thing between
Nintendo and Xbox controllers is that
they both use ABXY but they're not the
same ABXY a lot of the buttons are
flipped so it gets confusing sometimes
if you're using an Xbox controller uh
Nintendo system but what's really cool
about this guy is that on top of you
know being a battery and letting use
this with other systems and stuff it
actually gives you a way to onboard
remapping for what signals sending to
the switch so it's actually really easy
to do you basically just have to hit the
options and Xbox button to enter the
right kind of mode and then basically
just hit the buttons you want to read
map do a couple combinations and you're
done it's really easy to do on the fly
and I did it to flip all the buttons so
while the placement is different than it
would normally be in Zelda I have to now
kind of think like oh you know normally
a is run the bottom buttons normally to
run so now it's this one on the side
now whenever I get prompts for things
like you know oppress a right now or
press B or X or Y I actually hit the
correct button the Xbox controller
because it's just reflex when you're
using this thing another similar feature
it boasts as well which is set up the
same kind of way where you just have to
do a couple button combinations to set
it up properly is that you can also
activate a turbo mode on some buttons so
that when you press it once it reads it
as you've pressed it several times very
quickly so I gotta admit I was super
skeptical about this guy and it wasn't
really helping that we had trouble
setting it up but once you figure out
the firmware stuff and got this thing
attached which is a little annoying -
it's pretty amazing actually I mean
there's always going to be the issue
that possibly down the line any of these
systems can be patched to where this
doesn't work anymore hopefully the
firmware just keeps up with it but for
the time being if I'm just using an Xbox
controller and everything now or at
least on switch</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
