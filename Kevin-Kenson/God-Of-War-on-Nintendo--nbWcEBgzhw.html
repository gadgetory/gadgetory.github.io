us but uh kind of a weird the new bid is
visible mouth kind of bump of a head
with two little beady eyes it's kind of
creepy looking we are so close to the
release of the new God war and I am
super excited for it for a lot of
different reasons but what are the ones
that really stands out to me is how this
one feels like sort of a revitalization
and breath of fresh air to the franchise
see when God aware first came out it was
very much a game of this generation it
was heavily defined by other action
games that come out shortly before it on
the ps2 especially those from Capcom
specifically Devil May Cry nany Musha
see Devil May Cry served as sort of the
basis inspiration for God Wars combat
was very fast-paced it was combo focused
juggling enemies all that kind of fun
stuff although God of War did add its
own cool spin with the idea of finishing
moves and using QuickTime events to have
these awesome cinematic finishes two
bosses on the other hand Audie mush has
served as sort of the almost heart
inspiration of God of War where on
emotion was this game that was super
focused on being soaked in Japanese law
or mythology whereas God mores the
answer that focusing instead on Greek
myth and this fusion of myth driven
storyline and the fast paced action
combat worked out really great so much
so that they made five more games across
the ps2 ps3 and PSP which were excellent
titles but it started to feel a little
old a little stale been there done that
kind that kind of thing and so with the
new God of War along with shifting the
settings of Norse mythology and kind of
having this overall much more somber
tone something that plays into that a
lot is a change in gameplay as well
where it's adapted the action gameplay
mechanics more recent games like Dark
Souls it may not be the exact same kind
of super punishing style of difficulty
but you can definitely see the influence
as far as that sort of slowed down more
methodical melee combat and looking at
this idea that God of War is very much a
game of its time that it's constantly
shaped and based on what's happening in
gaming trends when it comes out brought
the question me what would it have been
like back in 1987
now obviously this isn't real I mean
physically real I'm holding it but this
isn't something that actually came out
back on the NES this is what's known as
a romhack now if you don't know what
Romick is it's this really popular
movement which involves taking lots of
old-school games especially from the NES
SNES and Gameboy eras and modifying them
in some way a really common form of this
is just translating games that never
came out in English or maybe D censoring
something that had was different in
different areas but other times people
will get a little more creative with it
and do stuff like messing with game
mechanics rewriting storylines or in
this case even replacing characters with
well things that didn't exist back then
to make old-school representations so
this is a romhack of an old-school game
that came out back in 1987 called rygar
from Tecmo it's actually a really good
fit for God of War while Rygaard isn't
actually based on Greek mythology it's
filled with all kinds of crazy fantastic
creatures that could have easily fit in
Greek mythos and one of the things that
makes it most appropriate really is the
fact that the main characters weapon is
a shield attached to a chain which
basically perfectly simulates the idea
of Kratos sword chains but it's not just
the visual aspects of this as if it's
well I actually really think this is a
good representation of what a God of War
style game would have looked like way
back then it's this nonlinear approach
where you're exploring the world killing
bunch of monsters and you have to
collect items to be able to get to all
different areas very heavily influenced
by Metroid once again the entire theme
of a game being based on popular trends
Weds released given there are other NES
games that are based on Greek mythology
which could maybe fit but that gets a
little weird when you try picturing
Kratos and Kid Icarus that was really
using your head to the Icarus so Rutger
by the way was this it's not like
notoriously hard like ghosts and goblins
all kind of stuff but something that was
weird about it is that it was a pretty
hard game but also really long by enniaa
standards and there was no save feature
so if you want to try and get through
this whole game you need to just leave
your NES on for possibly days in a row
because you just couldn't maintain
progress at all if you game over you
could resume somewhere nearby but
otherwise you're you're stuck
I'm up the rope stop being attacked by
things leave me alone armadillo creature
thing in Turtles so that's cool so one
of the things they change to along with
making the main character Kratos is the
fact that before and rygar those these
parts where you encounter these like
wise men and caves and they'd give you
hints boat you're supposed to do and
this they've been replaced by Ares and
he's basically just telling you to go
kill things and pass this trial yeah
that's cool too because they definitely
based like the way they designed this
Ares off of how he looked in the
original God of War I mean just the
beard shoulder pads obviously it's all
much older graphics but the ideas here
you're wondering how we got this by the
way you can just find this on eBay in
fact there's a lot of rom hacks that
have been put on a different card so you
can grab sometimes for games that like I
said earlier never came out in the US
you can play in English or weird stuff
like this it's really concerning a bit
too how when you get a game over in this
game it takes you back to the front
screen but if you hit continue you just
go right back to wherever you died not
like right there but like the beginning
of that and still the very beginning the
game like you would think yes so far the
main changes in this that I can tell at
least is Kratos has replacement
character and Ares is in the caves I
there might be a changing backdrops or
something the enemies are definitely the
same as they were so yeah this is what
God would look like if it came out back
in the 80s but more importantly I want
to see how it looks when it comes out in
2018 I am so excited in fact we actually
ordered the collector's edition ps4 pro
version for the game so we're gonna
unbox that guy if you wanna miss out on
that make sure to subscribe to the
channel and I'll see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
