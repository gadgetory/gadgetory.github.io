we got the release of some really great
games on Android some ports some mobile
originals all excellent and to start
we're looking at one of the best
tactical RPG series to come out in years
banner saga to the first banner saga was
an excellent remix on classical tactical
RPG gameplay mixed with a story of
survival and nordic influence that made
it a unique and memorable game and to
has done an excellent job of not only
continuing the level of quality but even
improved upon it especially in the story
Department it picks up right where the
first one left off and those you with
save files from the first game can
continue your particular version of
events or you can start a brand new game
with one very important decision to make
from the first that heavily impacts two
stories right out of the gate while made
for PC originally the games tactics
system and controls port perfectly to
phone or tablet touchscreen interfaces
it should go without saying that you
should play the original game first but
if you just want to jump into this one
right away it does have a handy summary
that at least gets the job done of
catching you up on events fellow tactics
fans do yourself a favor don't pass this
one out second up is the legend of the
skyfish now I've said a lot of people
talk about this game in comparison to
Legend of Zelda which is kind of fair it
definitely draws a lot of inspiration
and influence from the series but it's
more of a distillation of a few core
parts than trying to be the same kind of
game legend of the skyfish has you
navigate through linear levels as you
defeat enemies shove statues step on
pressure plates avoid traps and most
importantly platforming your way through
levels with a fishing rod the game's
equivalent of the hook shot its art
style is charming well maybe a bit
simple I'm still worried about the
characters lack of arms and its plot is
bare-bones but enough to hold it all
together
word of warning the first world and few
levels are incredibly simple enough so
that you might leave this game before
giving it a proper chance and while it
never gets extremely difficult it
definitely gets interesting enough to
warrant giving it a shot don't go into
this one looking for a Zelda clone
accept it for what it is right at the
gate and you will have a lot of fun with
it
now speaking of games with charming art
one of the weirder recommendations this
month is
early men at the see this is an oddly
very relaxing game to pick up and play
for short sessions it's an adventure
game but a very very simple one
pretty much amounting purely to just
making decisions that branch out a
linear story with a single playthrough
only taking 10 to 15 minutes at the end
of each playthrough the particular mini
story you just completed is catalogued
as a new book on a shelf and you'll
eventually fill it up across many
playthroughs while you could power
through the entire game in a single
evening it's really not meant for that
it works out a lot better as something
that you dive into just every now and
then when you have some time to kill
doing a different series of choices each
time a nice little way to just relax and
have a bit of a distraction when you
need one it also helps that the game's
presentation all-around is excellent and
oh so charming not just the art but all
of the sound design with a nice
soundtrack and sound effects that are
all just a guy making noises into a mic
which works out so much better than you
would think
this is definitely a game for you more
artsy gamers out there worth playing for
it's simple but charming tales you can
play bit by bit now from a charming
adventure game we move on to something
creepier and much much more twisted
vaultboy this is a classic
point-and-click adventure game putting
players in situations that they need to
solve with whatever's around them while
the formula may be familiar bull boys
art and story are far from anything
normal it's surprisingly really dark and
messed-up at times something that may
turn some of you off from it but it's
what makes the game stand out and it's
not just the twisted world the game
takes place in that sets it apart it's
also the main characters uniqueness that
makes how you solve some puzzles and
navigate your way different from what
you might be accustomed to in most
pointing clicks fans of old fashioned
point-and-click adventure games will
find this easily worth playing but it's
also an easy enough introduction to the
genre for those you that usually don't
care for it but love this game's insane
tone last but not least is the fourth
and final game in one of my favorite
franchises to make its home on mobile
Steve Jackson's sorcery for based on old
school choose-your-own-adventure stories
the sorcery series has mixed basic RPG
mechanics and combat with storytelling
and survival mechanics for an incredible
series that classic RPG fans can enjoy
all four games compose one full story
start to finish and the final game has
built upon all of them with excellent
unique visuals and a worthwhile finish
to its classics swords and sorcery style
plot getting through the game on your
first try is possible but not very
likely and the number of things that can
go down differently based on decisions
you make gives each of the game's
fantastic amounts of replayability plus
if you've been making your way through
all of them you can port your saves to
carry over all your progress four makes
an excellent finish to the series but it
is definitely not due comer friendly so
this is something you've missed out on
and want to check it out you have got to
start on the first one and trust me it's
completely worth grabbing all fours</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
