the Xbox and we've talked pro controller
to the ps4 we've not yet touched on
cheap controllers for the ps4 now with
Sony this is a little awkward because
they don't really license out their
products as much as Microsoft does
there's really only one company that
makes a lot of more affordable
controller options and that's Horry one
of the more recent releases being the
hoary mini ps4 controller now this is
controller that we have touched on a
little bit before and the main idea is
that it is a cheaper alternative to the
DualShock 4 which is wired and it's
specifically made for kids or people
with smaller hands in mind which White
has a grip design that's very similar to
an older controller like an SNES versus
the more recent grip designs we see in a
lot of modern controllers now if you are
used to that grip design you like that
there's actually a whole lot of good
stuff going on with this controller it's
got great buttons I really like the
sticks good d-pad the only stuff as it
that is kind of bad is the shoulder
buttons feel a little awkward they work
but the pressing down mechanism just
doesn't have the best feedback it does
not have an actual working touch pad it
does have a button that you can use for
pressing in the touchpad but any games
that use you know motion controls which
is very rare nowadays aren't gonna work
with this controller and something that
it shares with all of the controllers in
this list and that it does not have a
headphone jack now on the ps4 this can
potentially be not an issue at all for
you because a lot of the official ps4
headsets are bluetooth but if you like
using a wired headset that's going to be
a big problem for any of these wired
controllers now as I said Sony is very
stingy with their licensing so if you
want a controller that's not from Hori
you're gonna have a bit of a tougher
time you're not really gonna see stuff
in many brick-and-mortar shops instead
you're gonna have to turn to the
internet for good old-fashioned
controllers made in China from companies
you have never heard of which is exactly
what led me to the Loray go now this is
actually ones that had higher reviews on
Amazon which is why I checked it out and
bought it and I gotta say while I did
read good reviews I still went in with
kind of this negative mindset of like I
don't know it's unlicensed it's probably
to be weird and while it does have its
downsides it's actually surprisingly a
really good controller all the buttons
on the front face feel great good
triggers the sticks are a little too
stiff at first but after using them
extensively it got a lot more loosened
up it feels more natural still a little
tighter than like an official ps4
controller but still
very usable also it's very easy notice
that this is clearly meant to be the
same shell design as a dual shock for
but also features these kind of
rubberized grips that make it a lot more
comfortable actually that being said
this controller still definitely has
some downsides aside from the obvious
fact that it's well wired first off the
d-pad is terrible it's fine enough we're
gonna play a game where the d-pad has
very minimal use like you just have hit
up every now and then but if you're
playing say a fighting game and you're
like using D pads this thing is awful
also well it does have a touch pad it
actually doesn't do anything I mean the
button works they fit Dave a hit a
button for the touch pad but if you need
any games that use the touchpad controls
which is pretty rare nowadays this
doesn't work at all so if you want to
have that functionality avoid this that
aside though if you're able to put up
with that and all the usual downsides of
a cheaper wired controller this is
actually a surprisingly really good
choice now of course I wanted to write
more than just one unlicensed controller
option and another one that really stood
out to me visually was this one right
here from snakebite I like the color
design I like the fact that it uses
symmetrical sticks like the ps4
controller but it actually has a grip
style like the Xbox one a little bit
good of a mix in here but the thing that
kind of stops me from giving you a full
official thought on this is that this
one that I got has a defective home
button so I can't actually log in and
use it at all so I want to read some
other reviews of it kind of see if this
is a common issue with it or not and the
consensus I'm seeing is that if you get
a working one of these it's actually a
really solid controller which I'm
inclined to believe because honestly
just feeling the sticks the buttons all
would feel solid for a cheap third party
especially unlicensed controller however
not only were there people experiencing
home button issues like me but a lot of
people had defective shoulder buttons
cables that were ripping apart all kinds
of issues now of course this can't be
covered by warranty you can ship it back
get another one but by everywhere it's
gonna be a little annoying to deal with
that so if you want to take the risk
this might be worth looking into but not
so much now coming full circle we have
another controller from Horry now unlike
the earlier when we talked about the
mini which was recent release this is
actually one of the older ones they've
done in fact this was the first
officially licensed third-party
controller for ps4 this is the FPS Plus
and as the name implies it's designed
with FPS games in mind
now this controller is more expensive
than the other ones on this list but it
is still cheaper than an official
DualShock floor and as a result it is a
wired design that does feature some kind
of minor pro controller options now
first off design wise very clearly this
is based more on the next box one
controller you have the grip design like
an Xbox one the sticks have been moved
around and it uses a hair-trigger design
rather than the more full pull you'll
have on a ps4 which I do like this
design better on here and asks for what
kind of Pro features this controller has
there's a couple that are very standard
one that's a little more unique as for
the standard ones you're going to read
map some of the buttons on the fly you
have a turbo button for being able to
have rapid button presses on a single
one but the more interesting one is this
switch on the bottom here which actually
allows you to change the right stick
sensitivity so for FPS games
specifically in mind you're able to do
things like make slower stick movements
if you need more precision aiming versus
when you just need to move wildly about
in other games the usefulness of this is
a little more varied and just not as
much so interesting design not as cheap
but if you're looking for something
specifically for FPS games pretty solid
option now while this is from Horry like
I said it's one of their older designs
and it's not one of the really pushing
anymore and part of that is due to a
recent announcement that came out right
as we were shooting this video turns out
Tory's been working on a new wired ps4
controller where the very specific sales
pitch is that it is a ps4 controller for
people who like the Xbox one controller
better in fact just even looking at it
you can see the similarities now unlike
the FPS Plus this is not going to
feature any kind of this Wireless oh
this is a wireless controller it's a
Bluetooth this is a wireless Bluetooth
controller and they haven't actually
done official pricing just yet and it
looks like it is gonna be released only
in the UK for now so we're gonna try to
import one or see when it's coming to
North America so we can compare that
price wise to all these controllers as
well as just how it handles compared to
a dual shock floor</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
