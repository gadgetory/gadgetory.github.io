at a soon-to-be-released
keyboard and mouse option
for PlayStation 4 players,
the Tactical Assault
Commander Pro, version two.
Keyboard and mouse
support on gaming consoles
has been an increasingly popular topic,
ever since Microsoft started adding
official keyboard support to the Xbox One
and while PlayStation has yet to open up
that full option to their system,
although one specific game
does allow them, Fortnite,
there are options for still using
a keyboard and mouse-style
control on your PlayStation.
Now, we actually talked before
about a HORI gaming controller
called the Tactical Assault Commander
and that was an older one they released
that featured a mouse
connected to a half-controller
that was
okay.
It was kind of weird.
Honestly, it wasn't the best choice
and HORI realized it and afterwards,
released the Tactical
Assault Commander Pro,
which was a half-keyboard
mouse combo and now,
soon, they'll be releasing
the version two of this setup,
which offers some pretty
cool improvements.
So, let's take a look at all
the features it has to offer,
what's been improved over
the previous version,
and whether or not it's
really even just worth using
for your PS4 FPS games.
Now, if you're not
familiar with how mapping
a PlayStation controller
to keyboard and mouse
works exactly, it's really simple.
Most of the major buttons,
as well as the left directional stick,
are moved to the keys over here,
while the right analog stick
and the shoulder buttons
are mapped to the mouse.
Now, it's worth noting,
it actually is possible
to customize the key bindings
for which button is which,
but there is a default setup
that is marked on all the current keys
and it works pretty well for most games.
There's a couple parts
that I would like to change
and customize, which thankfully, you can,
but for the most part,
it works out pretty fine.
There's a couple little
nice additions to it
that I like as well.
For instance, along
with the regular keypad,
you also have this additional
stick on the left side
that you can hit with your thumb
and an X button placed above it.
Now, the stick, by default,
works like the D-pad,
but it can also be customized
to work like the left
or right analog stick,
depending on your preference,
and the reason for the
X button on the side
is mainly for menu management.
Basically, every single major
PlayStation game out there
uses X for selecting things on the menu,
so it's a really easy way just
to have a place to remember,
hey, if I need to select
something, confirm something,
whatever, get through menus,
just keep tappin' right here.
Before moving on, I'd
like to take a second
to thank Datawallet for
sponsoring today's video.
Everyday, companies are
profiting off of your data
with zero input from you and
Datawallet gives you a way
to take that control back.
With their app, you're
able to take control
over data collection from
websites like Facebook, Amazon,
Spotify, and Uber, and
allows you to be the one
to profit off of that information,
as well as have better control
over what they can see,
and to top that off,
Datawallet's also holding
a contest to celebrate
the launch of their app,
where you can win up to $100,000.
Check out the link down
below for your chance to win.
Now, along with all
the buttons and sticks,
you also have a fully
functional touchpad located
at the top of the keyboard,
which isn't the most comfortable
thing to reach for and use,
but honestly, I think that is
really the best possible place
to put it, as far as the
situation is concerned.
Not many games really make use
of full touchpad capabilities,
especially FPS games,
which this is primarily designed for,
so while this certainly
isn't the most comfortable
to reach for, it's basically
the best you can do
with this kinda layout and it's fine.
If you haven't used
something like this before,
it is also important to keep in mind
that it doesn't necessarily
work exactly the same
like using a traditional keyboard on a PC,
because again, the whole point of this
is that it's emulating a controller input,
so there's a couple important
things to keep in mind.
First off, the mouse
does not perfectly feel
like a mouse normally would.
It is, once again, acting
like a right stick,
and that does take some
adjustment to get used to
how to move it just right to match up.
Now, you can customize some
of the sensitivity options
on this, as well as how it reads,
and there's a few buttons and options here
that open up a little more
customization and control
when you need certain
exact types of movement.
In particular, the keyboard offers
three different special
modes you can activate,
which are walk, sniping, and quick-look.
The way these modes work is that,
while you're holding one
of the respective buttons,
it modifies the sensitivity of how
the left and right sticks are being read.
For instance, the walk button.
Now, in a lot of games, when
you're using the left stick
for movement, if you slightly
tilt it, you'll walk,
if you do a full tilt, you'll run,
but when you're using up,
down, left, right keys,
that doesn't really work
that way, so instead,
when you're hitting these,
it reads like a full tilt,
but if you want that slight tilt,
just where you're crawling
forward a little more carefully,
that's when you would
hold the walk button.
On the other hand, the
quick-look and snipe buttons
modify the sensitivity of the mouse,
giving you a little more
different kind of control
when you need it.
For instance, quick-look
will make the sensitivity
as high as possible so you
can quickly turn around
when need be, while snipe will
reduce that sensitivity so,
whenever you just need to aim down sight
and just slightly adjust
where you're aiming,
that's where that mode comes in handy.
Aside from all these fancy features
and ways that buttons are read,
there's a couple other little features
of the Tactical Assault
Commander worth mentioning.
It does have an adjustable
palm rest, which is nice.
So, if your hand's a little bit bigger
and the standard grip doesn't
feel quite right to you,
you can extend it out further.
It does have mechanical keys, however,
they are HORI brand, not
any kind of Cherry MX
or anything like that, and it is backlit,
which always gives that cool look.
One other really useful feature of this
is the ability to swap
between PlayStation 4,
PlayStation 3, and a PC keyboard mode.
Now, what's interesting about this is,
like I said earlier, one
game in particular, Fortnite,
supports external keyboard
and mouse support,
so if you put this in keyboard mode
and plug the mouse directly
into your PlayStation,
it's now going to read like a proper mouse
instead of using that
right stick emulation,
which allows for much smoother control
that feels a lot more natural.
The only downside of this is
that the cable on the mouse
is significantly shorter than
the one from the keyboard,
which makes sense when
you're in this setup,
but if you're doing it this way,
you have to make sure you're
a little closer to your PS4.
Anyways, that's all the
functions and features of it.
Let's actually play some games.
(techno music)
You know, I've used a
couple of these different
keyboard and mouse setups
now that emulate controllers
and I gotta say, they are an improvement
over using a controller,
but there's this opening
kind of adaptation period
you have to get through first
because, yeah, it works
like a keyboard and mouse,
but at the same time,
it doesn't entirely work
like a keyboard and mouse,
or at least the mouse part,
because again, this is
emulating a right stick input
and so, it doesn't have quite
the same feeling and flow
as a traditional mouse does.
So, if you've played a lot on PC,
it might take a little time to adjust
to how it feels different,
but once you get through that period
and you start customizing
things and fine-tune it
to your play style, this
is an awesome choice
for any kind of FPS game on console,
whether that's Apex Legends, Fortnite,
or even just single-player,
over-the-shoulder stuff
like Resident Evil, and
that's especially true
with this controller because
one of the really big upgrades
that the version two has over the original
Tactical Assault Commander
Pro is that there's actually
an app you can get on your phone,
which allows you to connect
to the controller directly
and make customizations on the fly.
With this app, you're able to customize
up to eight different profiles
for each mode on the controller,
PS4, PS3, and keyboard,
and with each of these,
you're able to do things
like change which buttons on the keyboard
are bound to which buttons,
how sensitive the mouse movement is,
how sensitive the stick is,
whether the stick acts as a
D-pad, left or right analog,
and even adjust things
like how much exactly
the walk button or snipe
button affects the sensitivity
when you're in those modes.
With all this customization,
you're able to fine-tune
this controller to really
any game that you're playing.
You can use a different
profile for each one
and if you take the time
to really figure out
which sensitivities work
just right and which buttons
are best for that
particular game's controls,
it just ends up working beautifully.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
