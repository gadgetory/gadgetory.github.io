wrong so I may have made a mistake last
week's me guys might have caught a video
that promptly disappeared which was
about this little controller right here
this is a kit from 8bit do--the allows
you do hollow out an NES or SNES
controller and turn it into one of their
Bluetooth controllers which is really
cool but what complaints I had is that I
thought there was no way to charge the
controller without actually reopening
the case and plugging in because there's
a microUSB port inside on the board and
I saw the cable didn't really take a
close look at it and assumed it was a
micro USB like most of the controllers
it's not the cable that comes with has
the specialty little attachment which
plugs into the LED light indicator up
top that used in the mod kit which is
actually a pretty genius solution to
make this a really simple swap out so a
lot better than I thought it was but
that gave us some more time to be able
to mess with the controller try on some
other stuff so here we go round 2
if you've been watching this channel you
know I'm a huge fan of anything that
involves mixing retro gaming with modern
day tech and a company that does a lot
of stuff like that we've talked about a
few times is 8-bit dough and one of the
most recent things they've done is
pretty interesting actually they've
released these kids where you're able to
mod and NES or SNES controller into a
Bluetooth controller that you can use
with one of their retro receivers they
have released their own kind of retro
style controllers before but this gives
the ability to make a Bluetooth
controller that actually looks like an
official Nintendo on which is really
cool it's all supposed to be really easy
to do so we're gonna go ahead and try it
right now now to be honest I did try to
do this yesterday we actually found a
bunch and while the process does look
really simple we ran into one very
specific problem we were really ready
for and well yeah it didn't go great
this screws definitely in trouble we're
drilling
so my supposed to go full speed is
reckless thing another plan
so anyways let's go ahead and try this
again and I have more controllers so
hopefully won't have that problem so
let's go ahead you know what we had
problem with SMEs yesterday let's start
with NES to kind of just start on a
different foot so the process is
supposed to be pretty simple
based on what I've read of the
instructions everything all we really
need to do is pop open these controllers
which is where we had a problem last
time but once you do that all you're
doing is basically just switching out
the board inside and breathe closing it
back up there's no soldering there's no
DRAM bowling
nothing special like you have to do with
some mods very very straightforward
random thing I just noticed while I'm
doing this taking my template screws for
the longest time I never remember to
realize that NES controllers have the
cable offset for whatever reason in my
memory if you just picture in your head
I'm like yeah the cables in the middle
that make sense no all right so there's
the inside of an NES controller and
here's what we're gonna replace it with
okay so we have this is the new board
that's gonna go inside I think goes this
way
no that doesn't make sense now it makes
sense
I had the controller ups that day okay
right here and then where the cable was
coming up before is we're gonna have
what I think is like the little sinking
button for the controller which also
serves kind of like a little indicator
light I'm not realizing that of the two
NES controllers I could have switched
out for this is actually the slightly
uglier of the two oh wow I'm not
backtracking alright seems pretty get
there I probably messed up and putting
the button in we'll deal with that later
so we've got our modded controller all
set up and you're probably wondering
what are we actually connecting this to
cuz the NES doesn't have bluetooth a
little too old for that so like other a
Pinto controllers this guy's designed to
work with a few different other systems
you can use it with like a switch or
Android which is a little weird because
you only have basically four buttons on
the d-pad not a good idea
it should just auto sync after a little
bit of time yep there it is so obviously
this is gonna make playing some games
rather difficult so we're gonna stick
with Mario Kart I can't use items and I
can't hop or anything but I can go and
break so that's all we really need you
know so yeah if you want to you could
use an original NES now you could also
use the SNES controller which would
actually make a little more sense and
give you few more options actually
probably even giving you full
functionality in some games but you know
sometimes you just wanna use an NES
controller I can't throw the shell I
want to throw this shell but I can't I'm
going over buttons that I don't have
so obviously the NES controller is not
the strongest choice for anything that
isn't an NES game but the Esmee has
control the other hand offers just
enough extra buttons you can use it for
a lot more stuff for instance I'm hooked
up to my MacBook right now I'm playing a
recent indie game chasm which is a kind
of retro style Metroidvania game so it
fits perfectly it only needs six buttons
the four front facing and the to start
and selects and yeah you're able to play
it just totally fine it actually even
feels extra even more natural to me
because this game is clearly
to kind of capture an older style of
game and this just feels right
especially having grown up on the Super
Nintendo I actually started being better
at this game this morning one started
playing it with this controller versus
using the keyboard like I was before
the main thing you're supposed to use
this though with is with their retro
receivers which hook into NES is the
Nessun ts is to let you use their
Bluetooth controllers or these guys so
let's go ahead and set it up yeah we've
got a retro receiver already plugged
into the NES we just need to set it up
to sync so I turn the controller on put
it in retro receiver mode light blinking
there it is and then we just set these
guys up to sync and should just take a
moment for them to connect em Phasis
unship no but I mean I did the same fix
on both hope there does hey okay took a
little while but it did do it as you saw
us mid worried but there we go so just
take a second little brief yeah other
than just the kind of general looseness
of playing original Mario where he's
just sliding everywhere this is working
really well so far just feels like using
an NES controller just without the cable
one of these is cool about this too is
that while a pedo does make a lot of
different Bluetooth controllers that are
styled after old Nintendo stuff the NES
controller they have isn't really an NES
controller it kind of looks like one but
they have added shoulder buttons it
actually has a four button setup it's
all designed is where you could still
use it with other systems and it makes
sense in this case though we actually be
true NES setup so this was really easy
to do and is actually pretty awesome but
the question is whether or not it's
worth grabbing one of these kits and
doing yourself versus just buying a
Bluetooth control of this retro style
and they have their ups and downs I mean
it's half the price of a lot of other
Bluetooth controllers which is great it
was really simple to do so it's not any
big investment there but at the same
time especially with the NES controller
you're not getting as many buttons as a
lot of Bluetooth controllers will have
so that kind of limits you a little bit
in what kind of games you can play this
is especially true of the NES controller
where you really just have the d-pad and
four buttons including start and select
the SNES controller on the other hand
with some shoulder buttons and digital
buttons on the side can be useful for a
lot of kind of retro style indie games
which are meant to recapture that era of
gaming anyways so it can work really
they're simply buying a brand new
Bluetooth controller is the easy answer
here but if you already have an older
school controller and you like the feel
of it you just want to update it for
modern games this is for you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
