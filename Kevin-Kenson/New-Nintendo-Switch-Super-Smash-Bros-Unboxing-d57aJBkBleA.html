first day of things coming out not the
actual game but we are getting Super
Smash Brothers stuff on the way now
yesterday was the final Nintendo Direct
revealing the rest of the roster and
going in-depth on all the rest of the
modes in the game and now we have a
switch bundle for it even the game is
out for a month yet but it's included
with the system which is nice
now before we talk about the system
itself I really quickly want to talk
about the box because I really like the
box for the system sometimes Nintendo
can get a little lazy with their box art
as can other companies out there was
just like hey look there's a picture of
the special edition that's what it looks
like gay this one though we actually
have some really nice-looking Super
Smash Brothers art on the front with a
picture of the system itself as well and
love back you have actually a little
kind of reduced roster picture showing
some of the original fighters from the
first Super Smash Brothers as well some
editions that came later that are more
popular characters including newcomers
to this game inkling and ridley as for
the system this is honestly kind of
weird situation because this is a
special edition bundle but I don't know
if I would call it a special edition
switch because the switch itself is just
a switch there's no art here there's no
anything suffering Smash Brothers all of
the art on the system is on the joint
columns and the dock itself so let's
take a look at those two parts the dock
is by far the coolest part about this
bundle I'll admit that I was a little
worried when I first saw pictures and
leaks and people are seeing like oh this
is what the special is gonna look like I
was like I hope not but actually I
really like it
my initial worry had to do with the lack
of color I really think Nintendo could
do more colorful vibrant things with
their docks especially with what they've
been doing with joy cons but I actually
really like this kind of black-and-white
comic book shaded aesthetic they're
doing for all the character faces
actually comes together really nicely
now the joy cons on the other hand I'm a
little more mixed on because the let joy
can't by itself I think looks good I
think that gets the idea across if it's
a Smash Brothers design it's very simple
but it gets the job done
the right joy con when they're together
you get the idea when it's by itself
it's a silver lion on the bottom that's
it
it's it's kind of awkward I get why they
kind of didn't want to do the same
design twice in each one but I think
that might have been the better way to
go because yeah together looks good left
by itself looks good right I think this
represents a little other missed
opportunities too because while once
again the system doesn't have anything
on the back if you're gonna do something
special the joy cons they could have ax
done something interesting with the grip
as well even just adding that bar to go
across from one joke on to the other
instead it's just a standard grip design
so when they go in awkward intermission
time where I'm setting something up
there's just this gap and it doesn't
yeah I don't know like I really like
this droidcon by itself but the rest
just kind of doesn't keep the energy up
very well if you're a big fan of Super
Smash Brothers and you haven't bought a
switch yet I think this is a really cool
bundle to get you started you're gonna
get an awesome dock design and at least
a really cool left joy con if you
already have a switch I don't know if I
would recommend buying a whole nother
one just to get this design but there is
good news on the horizon because it's at
least been shown that in Japan they are
eventually selling the joy con and dock
design separately there's no official
word for the u.s. just yet but even then
the option of importing comes up because
none of this is region-locked like I
said at the start of video this is the
first of a lot of stuff we're gonna
start seeing tied into Smash Brothers we
have a lot of things on the horizon
coming out specifically controllers so
the joy cons are the first kind of
branded controllers forgetting but then
there's gonna be a bunch of different
GameCube controllers you're getting an
official Nintendo one which is actually
at the same day as this system it has a
little smashed by the symbol on the top
and it's a wired GameCube controller
then we're also getting wired
controllers from power a PDP Hori and
power is even releasing their Wireless
GameCube controller option all pretty
clearly meant for Smash Brothers none of
them are necessarily hard branding that
but that's why they're being released
right now all for Smash Brothers and
then we of course also have an official
and Nintendo switch pro controller which
features the smash logo and its design
as well similar to how the Joey Kahn's
been set up what I really find
interesting about the system too is that
this is the first thing in Tendo is
released physically to start building up
hype for the game a full system
dedicated to is release and it does
include the game as well it's a digital
code it doesn't do anything right now
other than set up a pre-order you can't
play it but you can note it will owning
a themed system and then also buy more
controllers and get hyped up and still
wait while you have the game or the
period or just sitting there waiting to
be played so you just have it and you're
waiting patiently
I did get a chance to play Smash
Brothers back at e3 and that combined
with just having all this upset oh no
it's definitely making that weight a
little more rough I enjoyed what I
played though I love this pacing of it I
love the characters I got to try out and
there's so many more than been out since
then that I am so excited for I can't
even decide to who I'm going to main
just yet because I have smelled
favorites like I can sell dope but then
we also have newcomers like Richter and
Ridley and just so much cool stuff I can
just do I'm gonna play actually in fact
let me know down below in comments guys
who do you want to play as so for the
first special edition so it should at
least come out in the US Japan to get
one before us before this but the point
is for this design I think it's a good
start and I'm excited to see what else
in intended can do in the future if you
want to pick this bundle up we'll have
it linked down below though I'm sure
stocks getting a little scary and if you
are shouldn't these designs we don't to
get a whole new switch yet keep your
eyes open for when they start going up
individually hopefully in the u.s. if
not import from Japan</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
