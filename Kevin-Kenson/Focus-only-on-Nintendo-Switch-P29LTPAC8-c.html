old Nintendo is continuing to heavily
push the 3ds family of systems ever
since we've got a revision back in 2017
with the new 2d s XL we haven't seen
more and more new colors and limited run
specialization systems like this one
right here the Animal Crossing 2d s XL
which just came out in Europe and Japan
for fans of the system and for the
series this is a cool little collectible
system right here but it raises the
question that you know seven years
having been out and with a new very
successful system out a year ago the
Nintendo switch you have to start to
wonder why is Nintendo still pushing
these released back in 2011 the original
3ds was Nintendo's newest entry and
they're very successful line of handheld
systems and was based very heavily on
its predecessor the original DS it had
the same clamshell design and much of
the same button layout as the esses but
there was a few major things that really
set it apart first it of course had much
more powerful hardware enabling it to
have way better visuals than the DSP
capable of it had the addition of a
circle pad alongside the d-pad which
gave kind of an analog stick format that
would work with the clamshell design and
offer a little more control than
previous systems had and of course the
namesake was the addition of
glasses-free stereoscopic 3d which was
kind of the main gimmick and at least
thought to be the selling point of the
system it wasn't the initial release of
the 3ds was one of Nintendo's worst
launches at least until the Wii U
happened a few years later mainly due to
the fact that while 3d was kind of a
cool idea it wasn't enough to justify
two people spending two hundred and
fifty dollars on a brand new handheld
which at first glance looked very
similar to a system that was already out
as a result of this Nintendo had to take
some pretty heavy measures to try and
correct course very quickly resulting in
a price cut very early on its lifecycle
bringing it down to $170 and rewarding
people who've adopted it early by giving
away some free GBA and and 16 o GBA and
SNES
nes okay these price cuts along with
finally getting some huge hits on the
system as well as some revisions later
like the larger more comfortable Excel
and the much cheaper to D s led to the
system finally think it's tried in 2013
and 2014 was hitting some crazy peak
sales and if ur since then it's been
slowly falling off which is natural as
the system's lifespan goes on as time
went on Nintendo has done a few little
things to try and keep giving more and
more life to the system like I said we
had those first two revisions with the
excel in the two TS and later on that
you've introduced the new 3ds and 3ds XL
which featured more powerful hardware
that would support a few more games that
were just a little too intense for the
original line to handle as the floors
eventually led to last year's revision
the 2d s XL now well Nintendo turned
things around at the 3d s was doing a
lot better they did run into a new
problem which is probably one of the
most infamous things they've done now
the Wii U the Wii U was the biggest flop
in Nintendo history which has thankfully
already been addressed and fixed with
the release of the switch which is a
huge success one of the most successful
console in years but it's been so
successful that it kind of brings up the
question of since it is a handheld and
portable of sorts
why does Nintendo need to keep releasing
3d asses and what's interesting about
that logic and thought is that if you
look at the sales of the 3ds since the
switch came out the first full years the
switch had 3ds sales were barely
impacted at all they did go down a
little bit but not nearly as much as you
might think and a large reason for that
is this guy right here the new 2d S when
it was first announced last year and
released after the switch it was met
with a lot of confusion because
Nintendo's having this initial success
with a brand new system and something
they should be focusing on but at the
same time they go oh by the way we also
have the fifth version of this handheld
that's been out for six years now and
most of you already own one but here it
is again and so there's a lot of
skepticism about why they would do that
and whether or not it was a good idea
and time has actually shown that yeah it
kind of actually was the right call
because yes while the two DSL is the
sixth version of a system and they'd
already sold really well there's a
couple things that were just right about
its timing because this was kind of the
fine-tuned combination of all the things
that were good about their other
versions
the new 3ds a new 3d excel were the
nicest versions of the line but they
were pretty expensive especially when
compared to the switch I mean you have
this new system for $300 why not to
spend the extra little money to get the
new hot thing and at the same time they
did have the original 2d s but that guy
had a lot of problems going on because
it was a great cheap option to get for
kids but it had the smaller screens it
didn't have the clamshell design and
while it was arguably the most
comfortable of the 3ds designs it was
also the ugliest so not exactly a great
selling point for a lot of people so the
new 2d s excel was a way of bringing
that all together you're getting the
clamshell design you're getting the
comfort and the larger screens of the
new 3ds but at the same time you're
getting the cheaper lower price point by
removing the 3d that honestly this point
everyone knew no one was using this made
the new 2d s excel a great entry point
to a large library of fantastic games
and while the switch was doing really
well an important thing to specify about
how well it was doing was that it was
bringing a lot of people back into
gaming and so when you had the
successful system you go hey we had this
other one that does all these awesome
games if you already played one Zelda
and you want to get more grab one of
these for half the price and complete
library not only that but anyone who
already owned an older version of 3ds
was now much more tempted to actually
upgrade to the new design because it was
so much more affordable and still
featured the benefits of greater comfort
and larger screens but the one thing
that's really been topping all of this
off and this comes back to this guy
right here is that Nintendo has really
been hitting the mark when it comes to
special edition designs this isn't to
say that innocent Oh hasn't done good
special editions before but when you
look at the whole 3ds line and what kind
of limited editions they've done there's
been some hits there's been some misses
its overall been fine but ever since the
2d s excel has come out they've just
been on complete fire when it comes to
color choices themes execution just all
the different details they've been
working on they were making cooler and
cooler looking systems and they've only
been growing even more look I love the
Polka ball - yes I love the Highland
shield one that just came out but the
animal crossing one has been getting
even more little attention to detail
because I'm not a huge fan of Animal
Crossing but this is an awesome looking
little system and one new thing they've
done with this they haven't done with
the others is even on the back part of
the
system they've added more little
customization bits where this is
matching the theme of animal crossing
which is awesome for anyone who's a fan
of the franchise this combination of the
switch bringing in new fans the 2d SXL
being the most refined system and all
these awesome special editions has made
the 2d s still sell really well this
last year regardless the fact there
hasn't really been any games it's just
people wanting to buy cool-looking
systems or tapping into this giant
library they've never had before
so yeah Nintendo still making these DS's
and you might kind of wonder why but
it's been working</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
