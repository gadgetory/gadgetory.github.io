is an awesome system.
It has a great library of
games that is still growing,
but when it comes to
kinda looking at the past
and bringing back some great classics,
there's still a few things missing,
and something a lot of
people have commented on
is the lack of a proper virtual console.
Sure, we have a NES games
to the online app right now,
but that's it.
There's no SNES, there's no N64, and one
that people have been really clamoring
the most about, no GameCube.
I think a big reason why a lot of people
miss the GameCube is
it's at this very awkward
midpoint in gaming history, where the NES
and SNES are old enough systems
that we've seen lots of re-releases,
plenty of people have emulated things,
there's the classic editions,
virtual consoles on other systems,
lots of ways to play a
lot of those classics,
whereas, with more recent systems
like the Wii and Wii U,
well there's at least
kind of convenient ways to play those
on modern TVs.
A Wii will play both those systems.
But the GameCube is just in this
kind of middle point,
where there's not really
a convenient way to play it currently.
Or is there?
This is the EON GCHD,
and the short version
of what it does is that
it's a very simple,
plug-and-play adapter that you put
in the back of a GameCube.
It gives you an HDMI-Out.
You can plug it into a modern TV
and get a nice, clean looking
signal from the GameCube
as well as having zero input lag.
Now part of the way
this is able to do this
is it makes use of the original GameCube's
digital AV-Out port,
and this is not a port
that is present on all the GameCube's.
In fact, this is something
that was kind of experimented
with from Nintendo.
When they first launched the GameCube,
it had the ability to support
special component cables
that would give you a 480p signal.
Thing is, not a lot of people
were really making use of those yet,
so they were available exclusively
on Nintendo's online store,
they didn't sell very
much, and Nintendo decided,
well no one's using this, why are we
spending money on it?
So they discontinued those cables,
and new models of the
GameCube starting in 2004
dropped the port entirely.
And the reason why this is important
is if you use an old-school GameCube
that doesn't have the digital-out
and instead you just use the
AV cables with a modern TV,
you're not gonna have a good time.
As it's trying to actively convert
that analog to digital signal,
you're gonna see a lot of input lag,
and the game's just gonna
look like a blurry mess,
whereas if you did have an older GameCube
and access to the very, very expensive
and hard to now find component cables,
you could hook it up and
have a much cleaner image.
So, the result with this guy here
is to make use of that same signal
and give you a way to use an HDMI cable
instead of component, and give you
that really nice, clean
visual on modern TVs.
Anyways, enough with the history lesson,
let's actually plug this into
my GameCube and try it out.
(slow upbeat music)
So, we've hooked the GameCube up
and of course the first
game we need to test
is the classic Super Smash Brothers.
Now something a that
not a lot of people know
about GameCube games is that, again,
the GameCube did initially support
that digital AV-Out, and supported 480p.
So for some games that support it,
like Smash Brothers, as it's starting up,
hit and hold the B button,
and that'll activate
progressive scan mode,
which is gonna help result
in that cleaner picture.
If you don't use that, you're gonna end up
with something that looks almost like
the screen is constantly
slightly vibrating.
It's just a little fuzzier and not quite
as clean looking, so you
want that progressive mode on
whenever it's an option,
and it's worth noting too
that for those games
that don't support that,
the GCHD does also have
a line-doubler mode
that automatically activates, and that
helps clean up that image as well
since it doesn't have
the normal 480p option.
So you can see right away on the screen
just how clean it looks.
This is a 480p signal.
It's not being up-scaled to
1080 or anything like that.
It's using the TVs own built-in up-scaling
to fill the image, but
it looks super clean.
You can make out little
pixely bits here and there,
but that's really not that bad.
Another thing I wanna emphasize
about the experience with this adapter
is that there really is zero input lag,
at least from the GameCube to the TV.
Depending on the TV you're using,
you might need to turn
off a bunch of settings
and annoying features that
you don't actually need,
especially when you're
playing on a GameCube,
but as long as all that
stuff is set up correctly,
you're gonna have a very,
very smooth experience.
It'll be just like playing
on a CRT back in the day.
No Pikachu, no.
That's enough Smash.
Let's try one other game.
I'm gonna switch over to a very colorful,
fun classic, especially
'cause I'm in a Capcom mood,
Viewtiful Joe.
Something that can be really funny
with the experience of using
something like this too
if you haven't really messed
with playing older systems
on new TVs is you really start to notice
when certain scenes or things in the games
are pre-rendered, versus
something that the game
is actively rendering out, because
you'll end up with the
things like cut-scenes
that are very blurry and
kinda messy to look at,
but then it cuts to gameplay
that is noticeably way
cleaner and smooth looking
because it's actually
being displayed properly
and it's not just a recording
that's stuck at its resolution.
I can't emphasize enough how cool it is
to be able to take a classic
system like the GameCube
and make it work with a modern television.
This is something that I am
personally really big on.
I mean I've talked before a lot
about like the analog
systems which allow you
to play NES, SNES and soon Genesis games
in HD and modern TVs, and so being able
to take the actual classic GameCube itself
and just add a simple adapter is so cool.
It's really cool how certain
games age beautifully
for the situation.
Like anything that's more cartoony,
like Viewtiful Joe, or even
Legend of Zelda, Windwaker,
it's an experience that,
because the visuals
rely a lot on just colorful looks
and not any kind of
insane realistic detail,
it looks great on this up-scaled image.
Like it just looks like something
that would have been released today even.
Now if you're playing anything
that's more realistic, like
some of the Resident Evil games,
you're gonna notice it more
that it's definitely
more outdated graphics,
but anything cartoony is awesome looking.
Fun fact, there are a very
small handful of games
that will actually look
worse on a modern TV
than on a CRT, which no
fault being to the GCHD.
It's actually because, when these games
were being made, the developers
would cut certain corners
because, well hey, we're assuming
it's gonna be on a CRT, no one's
gonna be able to see this
'cause it'll get blurred out
a little bit, but when you see it
cleaned up on a modern TV, you start
to notice this stuff.
A really good example of this
is the original Resident Evil remake
where they made heavy use of dithering,
especially for the outside parts,
which basically what that does
is it reduces the demand on the system
in exchange for making a better looking
kinda color shading, but when you're on
a nice, cleaned up TV,
it's not blurred out
and you just see all these very hard lines
and all the coloring looks very awkward.
The more you know.
It's worth noting that
this is the mark two
of the GCHD, so there are
some new features on this
that were not featured
on the previous model
that was released.
One of the biggest additions is that
along with the HDMI-Out, you also now have
a component out that's based
on the Wii component cables.
So if you'd rather use
those or works out better
for connecting your TV, that
is an option you have as well.
You can even plug in both at the same time
to split the signal between
two TVs simultaneously.
It also now has an audio
jack on top of that,
so if you wanna split the audio signal
from the video, that's
an option that you have.
While you can treat this like
a simple plug-and-play device,
and it's gonna work great, there are also
some additional settings you can access
in a slightly inconvenient way.
So on the back of here is actually
a little IR blaster, so if you use
a universal remote, or the
Wii U game pad in TV mode,
you can access a special settings menu
to adjust some of the
properties of this device,
and there's basically three reasons
why you might wanna be able
to access these settings.
First off, you could be very particular
about how you want your games to look.
So within these settings,
you can do things
like adjust the
saturation, the brightness,
and if you're using component cables,
you can even mess with the type of signal
that's it's pushing, which
should have slight differences.
Reason number two, some
games might freak out
a little bit with certain TV combinations,
especially with some of the settings
that are automatically engaged,
so you can access those to turn those off
in case you run into those problems.
Now I haven't had any
personally in my experience,
but they do have recommendations
for some situations, like
turning off the line-doubler,
or turning off DVI mode.
And third, the simplest
thing that you can do with it
that honestly is also the most fun
I think for a lot of people,
the ability to turn on or off scanlines.
It's not necessary, it just adds
this very nice, warm, fuzzy feeling to me
to actually see those on older games.
The GameCube has such an
amazing library of games,
and it's a real shame there's not really
convenient way to
experience that right now,
and I really do hope that someday
it comes to the Switch, because
having some of those games on the go
would be awesome, but until then,
if you just want a way to re-experience
those classic titles, and honestly,
have them have a visual style
that is way better than anything
you would have experienced as a kid,
this is the way to go.
It certainly isn't cheap, but
considering the alternative
of buying super rare,
expensive component cables,
this is awesome.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
