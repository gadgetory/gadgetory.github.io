- [Blake Harris] One of my favorite things
about working on the book
Console Wars was that I
sort of imagined, at first,
it would be like these
two great heavyweights
slugged it out, like Magic
Johnson and Larry Bird.
And they didn't really like
each other at the time,
but they had respect for one another
and pushed each other to new heights.
But 28 years later, talking
to the people who worked
at Sega and the people
who worked at Nintendo,
they hated each other, still.
(drums)
The people of Sega thought
that the people at Nintendo
were bullies.
And the people at Nintendo
thought the people at Sega
were frauds who had no
style and no substance,
that it was all on marketing.
(edm music)
- I love retro games.
I love the ability to
boot up an old school game
that I grew up with and
relive that nostalgia
or even find old hidden gems
that I never knew existed
or just never gave a shot before.
And there's a lot of different
ways to play retro games,
but they're not all equal.
Some are really accessible
but don't really give the best
way to re-experience these games.
Others are more expensive.
And, sometimes, you just want
to rig up an old school CRT
with a system, which works, too,
but isn't always practical these days.
And an option that's
been really growing on me
the last couple years is the
analog line of retro systems.
They started off with the Nt,
which allows you to play
old school NES games.
Then, they released the
Super Nt for Nintendo.
And, now, they're giving us the chance
to relive one of the greatest
and most defining moments
in gaming history: the console war
between Nintendo and Sega.
This is their latest system.
The Mega Sg.
A console that allows you
to experience not only Sega
Genesis games but a variety
of other Sega systems
thanks to a number of different adapters.
This, combined with a Super Nt,
allows you to relive
one of the most intense
and most important
moments in gaming history.
When Sega went against Nintendo
with two very definitions of what
exactly is okay for a game.
Something that really defined
the modern gaming landscape.
I think a lot of people don't
really give the Sega Genesis
the credit it deserves.
I think when a lot of
people talk about Sega,
in terms of consoles, they go, oh yeah,
they were really
neck-and-neck with Nintendo
back in the day and, then, they lost.
And that's not really, entirely fair.
I mean, yes, the Sega
Saturn did not do great.
And, probably even more
depressingly, the Dreamcast failed.
But the Genesis was a huge deal.
I think the way Sega went
about opposing Nintendo,
and the kind of tone it created
for that entire console war,
really shaped modern gaming.
And to really kind of get
more at the core of this
we should talk to Blake Harris,
an author behind a book
called Console Wars,
which does a whole deep dive
into that entire competition
and is really enlightening.
- Back in the late 80s and
early 90s, I was just a kid.
And I was a soldier on the front lines
of these console wars.
And, so, in 1989,
when the Mega Drive in Japan
and the Sega Genesis in
the United States came out,
Nintendo literally, or almost
literally, had a monopoly.
They had 95% plus of the market.
One of my favorite archival
finds is a advertisement
that basically says there's
no such thing as a Nintendo,
meaning that Nintendo was
becoming so synonymous
with video games like
Kleenexes with tissues
or Jacuzzi is with hot tubs.
The Nintendo was trying
to protect the trademark.
And, so, when the
Genesis came out in 1989,
they were just a gnat in Nintendo's mind.
There's two things that
I really appreciate
about the analog series of consoles.
One, the physical design
of the systems themselves.
And, two, the actual gameplay
experience you get out them.
Now, getting both of
these upsides together
doesn't come at a super cheap cost,
but no one else is really
doing this kind of work
for retro games.
First, the physical build.
So like the Super Nt, the
Mega Sg is very much designed
to be sort of like a micro
scaled down slimline version
of the system it's based on.
It's not trying to mimic
the exact appearance of it,
like a classic edition system.
But, instead, it just
has little kind of notes
and references to its design
while having the small, compact shell.
In the Mega Sg's case, it's this ring
that runs along the top
having different colors
for the front buttons,
which match the designs
on the Sega Genesis
and Mega Drives themselves.
And one little note that
I like is it also adds
this little in-depth info
of what kind of graphics
and quality it runs for the games,
which is very reminiscent
of the old school Genesis
having that line of high
definition graphics on the top.
Now, like the Super Nt,
this one does come in
four different colors.
Three of them are based
on the different designs
the Mega Drive or Genesis
had in different countries.
And, honestly, all very similar.
They're black systems.
They just have light different accents.
This is the US one with
this red and white up front.
The Japanese version
looks very much the same
but is blue right here instead.
And the European version has
more white and gray accents.
As a fourth option, that
is entirely different
from all of them,
you can also just get a
straight up whiteout version.
Visuals aside, what I
really want to emphasize
about just the build
of the system, though,
is that it is a solid little brick.
It is a dense, tiny system
that doesn't feel frail at all
and keeps everything
nice and clean looking.
You've got the two ports
up front for controllers,
a headphone jack reminiscent
like the original Genesis,
and, then, on the back, just two ports.
HDMI for visuals and audio
and a micro USB for power.
Something that's really
interesting about looking back
at that console war is that
a lot of people don't realize
that while it was during the 90s,
the Genesis is actually an older system.
It came out in the late 80s
and just didn't really get full attention.
What really ended up shaping everything
was around the time that Nintendo
launched the Super Nintendo,
and two things that happened to Sega.
- Here, in the United States,
where the console wars were fierce
between Sega and Nintendo,
we think about this crazy,
heated marketing-driven,
amazing game battle.
But it didn't really heat up until 1991,
so two years after the
Sega Genesis came out.
And that was largely
because of two things.
One was the new CEO at Sega
of America, Tom Kalinske.
- Our sales, right now, are up about 50%
versus a year ago at the consumer level.
The market is down.
I think that's an indication
of where the consumer's going.
- And, then, Sonic the Hedgehog.
Sonic changed everything.
Sonic came out in the summer of 1991.
And the Super Nintendo came
out in the fall of 1991.
And the rest is history.
- [Ad Narrator] He's
the fastest thing alive.
He's the fastest thing alive.
- Something the analogs really excel at
is this concept of versatility.
Where it appeals to, I think,
two very different kinds of people.
You've got the hardcore enthusiasts
that have been collecting
games for a long time.
And, then, you've got the other
people that are just like,
oh yeah, I grew up with Sega.
That was neat.
I'd like to play those games, again.
And the way the Sg does
this is with its approach
to settings.
When you first boot up the Mega Sg,
you're greeted by a very simple menu.
It has the option to run the cartridge
that's currently in it, the
option to play Ultracore,
which we'll talk about a little bit later,
and, most importantly, the settings menu.
And within the settings menu,
probably the most robust section is video,
which is how you're gonna be
able to craft all the visuals
about how these old school
games are gonna appear
on a modern TV.
Now, by default, it's designed for people
that don't really wanna
go all that in depth.
You can do things like choose
which resolution you want,
a few different pre-designed
height and width ratios,
and choose whether or not
you'd like to have scan lines.
On the other hand,
if you wanna really get
into the nitty gritty
and just fine tune the image
exactly how you want it,
even by a specific game by game basis,
you can change to the
advanced mode options
which opens up so many more choices.
If you're a diehard retro
fan, this is all great.
Because it gives you
the ability to fine tune
each and every game as you start it up
and figure out what looks best.
On the other hand, if you just
wanna be able to pop in Sonic
every now and then and not care about it,
you can just basically
ignore all these options,
aside from maybe the scan lines,
and still have a great experience.
In fact, you can even change
the menu settings themselves
to where every time you turn the system on
it just skips the settings entirely
and jumps right into whatever game
is currently sitting in the system.
- [Blake Harris] What I can
attest to as someone who lived,
who was fighting this battle
on the playground, basically,
what each company represented,
it was almost like Sega
represented freedom and choice
and, then, Nintendo represented control.
And control probably has
a negative connotation,
a sort of authoritarian connotation.
And there is some truth
to that with Nintendo.
But what I really mean is that Nintendo
had the Nintendo seal of quality.
They had very rigorous standards.
They wanted games to be very
cartoon-like, family friendly.
And Sega had sort of more of
a grip it and rip it strategy,
which was important to developers.
Because developers are in
their 20s, 30s, 40s, 50s.
They wanted to do more mature content.
They also, Sega, did a
lot to push licensing.
Licensed games.
Sports games.
So really Nintendo was
all about Nintendo games.
And developers and consumers
were beholden to them
and a certain type of game
that is on the Nintendo.
And Sega really did represent freedom.
And, then, they also tapped
into this 90s zeitgeist,
sort of this MTV generation
idea partnering with MTV,
having commercials that
really resembled MTV's
flash quick cut style.
(rock music)
- [Ad Narrator] What the heck was that?
Forgot what I was gonna say.
Welcome to the next level.
- [Blake Harris] Which, by
the way, was also a by-product
of Sega just having
less money than Nintendo
and needing to do things quicker.
But, Sega, their marketing campaign
welcome to the next level.
And that is, largely, what
they succeeded in doing.
They welcomed gamers to a
more mature, different level
of gaming where anything went.
Even though 16-bit graphics
maybe there's not all that
much anything you can do,
but compared to Mario and Zelda
it was a little bit different.
(Sonic music)
- I also want to take a moment to talk
about the controller that it ships with.
This is the M30 controller from 8BitDo.
We did do a video focused on this before.
But this is actually,
technically a different model,
which is real easy to tell when
you have them side-by-side.
Yeah, not really.
So this is the 2.4GHz model.
The important difference here is that,
unlike the Bluetooth model
which can connect to a variety
of different devices including
8BitDo's own receivers,
this guy right here only
connects to a dedicated receiver.
So the downside of this
is that it's not gonna be
able to work with as many
different things.
It really just works on the Mega Sg
or an actual Sega Genesis.
But the upside of this is this model
is going to give you way less input lag.
Like the Bluetooth version of the M30,
this is designed as kind of a crossover
between the six button
Sega Genesis controller
and the Sega Saturn controller.
And, honestly, I just love it.
I think this might be my
favorite retro-style controller
I've used, which is insane
because like I've said,
I grew up with Nintendo.
But this is, honestly,
just so comfortable.
The shaping of it is awesome,
especially for a design
that isn't a more kind
of modern grippy one.
It has the best D-pad I have ever used.
And just all the buttons and
everything feel really nice
and snappy on it.
Another really interesting
aspect of the design for the Sg
that actually separates it a bit
from what analog's done before the Nt,
is they're pushing this concept
of also running more adapters into it.
Now, again, this can play Sega
Genesis and Sega Mega Drive
games, which are basically
just different region versions
of the same system.
And you can also get up to a Sega CD.
Sadly, it will not work with a 32X.
On top of that, however,
when you buy one of these,
it actually ships with an adapter
so you can also use it with
Sega Master System games.
And while the option hasn't
been made available just yet,
the plan is that, to be sold separately,
they're gonna have more adapters
to allow you to play
things like the SG-1000.
One of the oldest things Sega has made.
And Game Gear, adding a
kind of Super Game Boy
approach to it.
The experience this ends up giving you
is, honestly, beautiful.
And something that's really
interesting for me, personally,
when dealing with this system,
is that when I messed with
the Nt and the Super Nt,
I grew up in a Nintendo household,
so it was a lot about
re-experiencing games
that I grew up with and
being able to go, oh yeah,
this looks beautiful, now, on an HDTV.
Whereas with the Genesis,
I played some of them a
little bit growing up.
But this has really become the
opportunity for me to go back
and actually explore this library
that was always kind
of out of reach for me.
So having a system like this
opens up that possibility
to actually hunt down
these old school games
that I never played, pop 'em
in, hook 'em up to a modern TV,
and actually play them like it
was some modern indie release
that's just trying to pay
tribute to retro games.
Don't get me wrong, there's
always going to be that soft,
warm and fuzzy spot of being
able to hook up an actual CRT
and play games like they were
designed back in the day.
But it's just not always
the most convenient.
If I just wanna be able to
hook it up to the main TV
I had set up that I also
use for Xbox, PlayStation,
or the Switch, that's just a
lot easier and just super fun.
Something that really stood out to me
as being super important, too,
was this concept of Sega focusing more
on bringing games to adults.
It's not that there were no
games that appealed to adults
before, but a lot of them were older
and predated when Nintendo
started making their way to the West.
Cuz when they did, they
focused a lot on the concept
of oh the Nintendo is a toy.
It's a kids thing.
Here are all these fun
family friendly games.
Whereas Sega didn't
really want to pigeonhole
the entire genre into that.
They wanted to make sure
that there was stuff
where people who were
older would find things
that were fun to play, too.
- [Blake Harris] So at this time,
video games were just perceived
as childish play things.
They were sold in Toys &quot;R&quot; Us.
They were sold in KB Toys.
They were considered toys.
And Sega, under Tom Kalinske,
helped transform them
into consumer electronics.
I remember playing video
games with my brother
when we must have been
eight and six years old,
and we would play with our father.
And my dad would play with us,
cuz he's an awesome father.
But he would play with us the
same way a parent would play
with a child having a fake tea party,
like there was something
kind of offending about it.
He's like video games are this kid thing.
And that changed with Sega.
So the marketing was important
in expanding what video
games were all about.
- Despite the fact that
Sega's followup systems
didn't do that great
and eventually caused them to
stop making consoles entirely
in favor of just focusing on games,
I think it's really important
to focus on this concept
of how the Genesis really opened the door
for all the other companies
that started getting into gaming.
You can even see it in today's landscape
where Nintendo is still associated
as being the sort of family
friendly, more kid-aimed games.
Even though they have a
little more mix going on.
But because of that, we
have Sony and Microsoft
bringing a lot more
attention to video games
is something that's for everyone,
especially focused on more adult themes.
And that really might just
be because Sega did it first.
- [Blake Harris] I think
that without Tom Kalinske,
Sega would have just
been a blip on the radar.
And there's so much that
came from that battle
between Sega and Nintendo.
I think that the most
important lasting legacy
is video games becoming
more of a mainstream
form of entertainment and skewing older.
Took one of Tom Kalinske's
primary strategies
was to try to succeed where
Nintendo was not dominating,
which was kids or adults
older than 14 years old.
So going after teenagers,
going after adults,
and turning video games much
more into what they are today,
with a little more mature
content, a little bit of blood,
as we know from the Mortal Kombat stuff.
And, so, without Tom Kalinske,
I think that Sega would
have been more successful
than these also-rans in the past,
and Sonic the Hedgehog
would have been a good game.
But Pac-Man was a good game.
Frogger was a good game.
Crash Bandicoot was a good game.
Didn't spawn an iconic character
that, 25 years later, lives on.
And, so, I think that
without Tom Kalinske,
we don't have the industry
that we have today.
And that also includes the fact
that just the idea that
Sega was able to compete
against Nintendo, for a
certain amount of time
able to surpass Nintendo.
They proved that the
console market was bigger
than just one player.
There was room for more
than one company at a time.
So I don't know if we'd have Sony.
I don't know if we'd have Microsoft.
We'd definitely have a
very different landscape
without Tom Kalinske.
