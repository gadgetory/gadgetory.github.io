November 7th of this year and chances
are if you're thinking of grabbing one
you're probably upgrading from an Xbox
one S or maybe even the original Xbox
one now we stopped quite a few months to
wait but there's actually some ways you
can prepare and start getting ready for
its launch right now you know it does
everything's a lot of pbd capabilities
Sam is going to be incredible
I just want to know is it karaoke
capable first off invest in an external
hard drive now I've talked about the
merits of using what I used before with
an Xbox one s it's an easy way to give
you extra storage for more games and
downloadable content or in the rare case
where you actually have multiple Xbox
ones an easy way to carry around a lot
of game data without installing it all
the time and that's exactly how this is
really useful for the Xbox one X now
chances are when you pick up the One X
you want to jump in and play games right
away and not waste your time waiting for
everything to download and install so
instead take all the games you have
right now in your Xbox one backup up on
an external hard drive right now plug it
in when you grab your One X and you're
good to go
now speaking of games obviously the big
point in getting One X is true for day
gaming and there's a lot of stuff on the
horizon is going to be supporting that
but there's actually some games out
right now that Microsoft has already
confirmed will be getting 4k patches for
the One X so if you want you can start
grabbing those right now put a little
playtime in and get ready to enjoy them
on the One X and really see and feel the
difference these titles include some
their biggest hits like Gears of War 4
forth of horizon 3 Halo Wars 2 being a
more recent release killer instinct and
for some reason also minecraft if you
want to enjoy really good looking pixels
made up of smaller pixels the highest
quality pixels these are the highest
quality pixels that anybody is seeing
now this next item is not a necessity
for the One X to work however if you're
investing $500 in a gaming system you're
the kind of person that obviously likes
having the premium top-line stuff which
is exactly why if you haven't bought one
yet you should grab an Xbox one elite
controller these things are absolutely
amazing and way better than the regular
controller better build quality more
comfortable exchangeable sticks
different D pads adjustable triggers all
kinds of programmable different stuff
it's just an amazing controller I've
covered many times in the past the point
is it's a great controller to go with a
great system now regards to more
peripherals there is
another accessory that Microsoft really
really loved to push for a long time and
they stopped finally thankfully but some
people still like using them no judgment
whatsoever and that is of course that
connect now look honestly the point is
if you have an original Xbox one and
you're still using Kinect awesome
problem is this is not going to plug
into an Xbox one X this is something
they removed with the one F and is still
missing on the one X so if you want to
use one of these and make the leap to 4k
gaming you're gonna need to buy an
adapter they're already on sale but they
might start disappearing click on the
legs launches so grab one of those ASAP
now of course a 4k gaming system like
the Xbox one X is only half of the
equation for a proper 4k setup obviously
you're also going to need a 4k TV and
one I really really recommend is this
Samsung model with a name that I'm not
going to attempt to say out loud it's a
long stream of numbers and letters the
point is it's a great TV for gaming now
this is actually the same TV I used for
my Xbox Wynette's think it makes a great
fit for the One X as well of course
you're getting 4k resolution sport and
HDR - the main reasons you want to get
an Xbox one x2 the first place but
what's really appealing about this TV as
well is that you're getting these
features while still maintaining a very
low latency there's a lot of other high
quality TVs where you're going to notice
a definite lag input which is
devastating and gaming so having low
latency with those great visuals at the
same time is an excellent combination so
there's a bunch of stuff you can do
right now to prepare for the upcoming
launch of the Xbox one X I've got links
down below for everything I talked about
in this video and I will see you guys
later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
