got a major announcement
for their version of the future of gaming,
and this morning was Apple's
turn with Apple Arcade.
Now Apple Arcade is not
quite the lofty, insane idea
that Google has with Stadia.
It's something a little
more straightforward
and plays to the strengths
of mobile gaming.
The idea is simple, and
is basically their version
of Microsoft's Xbox Game Pass
where you pay a monthly fee
and you get access to a number of games
that are exclusives to iOS, as
far as mobile platform goes,
there's a few different games
they showed off very quickly
and a couple of them we have
seen announced for console,
but when it comes to mobile phones,
these games are gonna be iOS exclusives
that you get to play.
So the idea here is that instead of having
to buy these guys
individually and potentially
never give some of them a shot,
now you just pay this monthly fee
and you've access to
over 100 different games
that you can now access for free,
and be able to try them out.
Now there's a couple really cool ways
about how they're choosing
to approach this as well,
for instance, it's advertised
that none of these games
are gonna have any ads,
nor are they gonna have
any in-app purchases,
there will be no content that
is behind any kind of a paywall,
if you're a part of the membership
you get to play the full game.
And to top all that off,
games will be accessible
both offline and online.
So if you downloaded a game on your phone
or your MacBook,
and you're somewhere where
there's no reception,
or no WiFi you like to use,
you can still play the games no worries.
One thing that's kind of an interesting
distinction too about this services,
is that it's not just curating
a bunch of stuff that already exists
and is bringing stuff to people,
Apple's actually talking about
how they're working
directly with developers,
and helping fund and support the projects
they're making for this
program specifically.
So it's not just,
hey this stuff's already
successful on the App Store,
let's go ahead and add it to
this subscription service,
they're actually making original
games specifically for it,
which is really neat.
The only thing about
it that we don't know,
and is kind of a big deal,
is how much it's gonna cost.
And there's a lot of theories
you can have about this,
what's affordable, what's not,
and it's a weird thing to
compare to other services
because mobile games are
priced so much cheaper
than they are on a lot of other platforms.
Whereas, something like Xbox Game Pass
is giving you access to games that cost
as low as 15 and 20 bucks, as high as 60,
most app games are really
three, four, five dollars,
maybe ten tops, it's very
rarely something above that,
unless it's some kind of very special
port of a classic game.
So with all that in mind,
how much are they gonna
really charge for this thing?
Because, in my mind, a fair
amount could be as high as $15.
That's basically three games a month.
But that's not exactly a
competitive price point,
especially when you consider how cheap
other streaming services for other things
like movies and stuff go for.
So, really I think they
need to be aiming for
at most $10, maybe even
trying to get a little below
the double digits with
something like $8 a month.
There's been this long debate about
whether or not mobile games
really count as true video games,
which is kind of a silly argument to me.
I mean, there was maybe a
tiny bit more validity to it
years ago when a lot of mobile games
were either free-to-play ones
that just had tons of in-app purchases,
and required you to just
buy things left and right,
or they were trying to
take console experiences
and put them on a phone
with touch controls
and it just didn't really translate well,
but over the years there's
really been this movement
of lots more games developing
for the mobile platform
in mind that make truly
memorable experiences.
Whether it's games that
are very bite-sized
and aesthetic focused
like Monument Valley,
or other games that learn
to take touch controls
and really embrace them to
do something interesting
or different like Dandara, or Severed,
or still one of my favorites games to play
is the Reign series,
which is basically Tinder
where you're swiping
left and right but it's all
fantasy kingdom management
and works really well.
So on paper this sounds
pretty good so far,
but I have to wonder is Apple
Arcade actually a good idea?
Don't get me wrong, I
think the initial launch
of this program is gonna
be something really cool.
I think they've been
putting a lot of money
behind some big name creators
to bring some great content,
they did a little hype reel
of some of the games coming to it,
lot of big names including even Sakaguchi,
the guy that started Final Fantasy,
I think that's awesome.
And these look to be really
full, big experiences,
maybe even a little more beyond what
app games currently really show on mobile.
It's also cool that they're
really heavily pushing
the idea of a continued experience
across multiple devices,
this is similar to something that Google
talked a little bit with Stadia,
where you can go from
one thing to the other,
with Apple you're still
downloading the games
but you can still bring
save files across things.
So you can play on your phone,
but then move on to playing on your TV,
or your MacBook, or a tablet, whatever,
you have the option to switch between.
Where I'm getting a little worried though
is the long-term
development of these games
that are coming to Apple Arcade.
This isn't something
that they talked about
during the press even this morning,
but it was reported earlier by people
that were talking about what
Apple might be talking about,
and one of the concepts is that
for all these games that are
being put on Apple Arcade,
the way the developers are getting paid
is based on how people play their
individual titles on Arcade.
That's how they decide how
to split up all the income.
Where this can get a
little worrisome is that,
sure, it's great these games
don't have in-app purchases,
it's great they're not gonna have ads,
but there's other aspects
of free-to-play games
that might start to worm their way in
because it's beneficial for these games.
The biggest thing is time-suckers,
one of the things that I
really appreciate a lot
about the better mobile
games that you pay for,
is that they're very
isolated quick experiences.
It's something where you
can pick the game up,
and it might only be an
hour and a half, two hours,
maybe even as long as
a five hour investment,
but they're little digestible games
that can be really good experiences.
On the other hand though,
if developers are getting paid based on
how much people play your game,
well now they need to
start investing in ways
to make the game last longer,
make it take longer, make
people play more often,
maybe give you a reason to login
every single day with
some kind of incentive,
add more content that isn't necessarily
actually adding anything
of substance to the game
but still encourages people enough
to keep playing more, and more, and more.
Is this something that
for sure's gonna happen?
No, of course not.
This is just conjecture
based on how things
are supposedly working right now.
I just bring it up because
I think there is a certain
merit to the way that the
really good mobile games
are currently designed and
I don't want that to go away
'cause a subscription service seemed
like a better way to advertise them.
What I'm trying to say
here is that mobile games
have been coming a long way
and are only getting better,
and I'm really hopeful that Apple Arcade
is something that embraces and
brings them to the forefront
and doesn't stop all of that momentum
and turn them into something else.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
