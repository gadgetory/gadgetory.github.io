out there who do not like the Nintendo
switch job for a couple of really good
reasons some people have scratched
screens others have talked about how it
doesn't exactly ventilate heat very well
and more than anything right now it is
the only way to get a video signal from
your switch to your TV so if you want
another option what can you do
obviously break your dock and build
something better and in my case I want
to try something a little special and
put it in a classic NES cart to start
you're going to have to break your dogs
now it's worth noting that Nintendo
really doesn't want you to open this
thing so there are a lot more steps
doing this than you would think first we
have to take off this backplate but to
do that you have to have a pretty
esoteric screwdriver design called ay0
now these aren't exactly common so you
have to buy one of these specifically or
get it as part of something like an I
fix it get after removing the backplate
you can see the inside working bits of
the switch duct which you can pry off
pretty easily but run into the issue
that the ribbon cable and power
indicator light are buried behind a
second layer so we're going to have to
remove that as well which guess what
requires an entirely different
screwdriver now at first glance you
might think you can use any small
Phillips head screwdriver to do this but
some of the screws are actually recessed
really beeps you're going to have to
make sure you have one that also has the
reach to get to them now after taking
those out we do need to temporarily
unplug the power indicator light which
just takes a little pressure to pull out
while the ribbon cable is going to need
a little more finesse and is made much
easier using a small prying tool with
the board disconnected and all the
screws gone you can easily remove that
second layer we hook everything up and
boom we have freed the insides of the
switch dock from the surprisingly kind
of large comparison shell so now that we
have the board all we have to do is open
up the Zelda cart which is actually a
lot easier all you need is a screwdriver
that works with a three-pointed security
screw which is a pretty common design
for most older electronics opening the
card up we get to see the core of the
original Legend of Zelda which is
actually really interesting to compare
to other NES carts because it's actually
quite a bit larger with the inclusion of
this battery and extra memory because it
was one of the few NES games where you
could actually save your data by
pressing the reset and power button at
the same time so with the car cleared
out all we need to do is get the docs
board inside of it and
 okay so this is actually gonna take
a bit more work because well the card is
big enough a lot of the molding that was
designed to keep the cards insides in
place are getting in the way so we're
going to actually have to destroy this
card a little bit using a dremel with
the cutting attachment we got rid of the
central screw peg and if you're me also
scratch up the inside a little bit and
then you switch over to a sanding tool
to even that out and get rid of the
bottom molding which was used to hold
the game boards pins in place kids don't
try this at home
adults if you're going to try this don't
be dumb like me and actually wear
protective eyewear so after cleaning
away the burning and melting plastic I
love that smell in the morning we can
now safely fit the board inside we just
need a way to secure it there's a couple
ways you could do this one of the
simplest that we went for is just using
a square of mounting tape just placing
that on top of the HDMI port since that
gives us a nice flat surface and putting
it down inside of the cart leaving a
little room on one side for us to fit
the USBC ribbon cable now it is at this
point that we realize that the USBC port
is just a little too thick for the carts
Mouse to just stick out of it so it's
going to have to hang a little bit
outside and we chose to have it facing
forward for easy access after that we
can close up the cart now we did dribble
away one of the screw pegs so you only
need to um now throw the third one away
and the two we have left are enough to
make sure the cart closes nice and
secure so after doing all this we
actually have a completed design now we
just have to see if it works so when
doing stuff like this there's always the
worry that while breaking things apart
we might have actually broken something
beyond repair so we're going to go ahead
and test this out right now so you'll
see we got this little USB AC extension
cable so it's not just talking the life
into the cart like that plug it in and
success
did you think I did I hope it did that's
all that matters now of course that does
lose the dark aspect of well the
Nintendo sewage dock turning instead
into a more portable breakout box now if
you want a more permanent fixture for a
setup you can of course create a little
mount or stand for it like we've done
right here I also really recommend
getting a stand designed for a tablet or
the switch so you can set it up side by
side for a nice little display and
really this is just one example for all
the different things you could do once
you figure out how to open up the dock
and take apart all the important bits
you can even celebrate your love for
Nintendo by putting it in a Sega Genesis</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
