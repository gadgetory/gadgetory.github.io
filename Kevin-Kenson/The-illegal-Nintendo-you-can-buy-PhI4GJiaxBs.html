been doing the last few years is their
classic edition systems these little
tiny consoles that look like they're old
school systems that all you to play some
of the biggest hit games from them like
the NES and the SNES and well it hasn't
been confirmed yet we're all pretty sure
that an n64 classic is going to be on
its way this year but a question comes
up every time these systems are released
you can do this yourself it's just not
exactly legal and if you don't want to
do it yourself you can actually even buy
them in fact some guys around the office
bought one of these for me to try out
the retro mini this is just a little
tiny Gameboy mock-up which supposedly
has a number of games already
pre-installed on it and it was less than
50 bucks on Amazon
super easy to grab I haven't actually
tried out yet I don't know what's on
here for sure so let's check it out are
we supposed to charge this to be didn't
charge it you just took it out of the
box I guess we'll find out okay so a
power switch on the side just a gameboy
and okay there goes it's on yeah it's
got power it also has a music and video
section oh yeah
so this looks like a gameboy like a more
classic style is probably closest to the
pocket it designed but this is loaded up
with possibly everything honking Boy
Advance this is kind of silly I'm still
in the A's I know there's big beyblade
i've already this is annoying because it
has so many games in it and you can't
like speed through them you have to
either tap every single time to go as
fast as you want or hold it where it
just kind of crawls down the list right
no mega man you ever do mega man there
we go don't care about plot let's just
speed through that I think it crashed
there's a part of me that secretly is
like alright let's turn off and back on
power cycles fix everything let's try
this again
Mario advanced okay let's see if this
one crashes oh that's right the first
Mario advanced is Super Mario Brothers 2
alright so there's definitely some some
weirdness here a little bit because the
image looks really good like this is a
really crisp image of a GBA game but
there's something off about like the
framerate like it has a lot of
stuttering it's enough to where it's
playable but up nope I just died so I
don't really know this kind of stuff but
I will say that for this one in
particular if I wanted to use something
like this I would not like using this
guy
for anything kind of action intensive
because so far at least from what I've
tried either the game doesn't work or
it's very jittery and not very good for
a game where you know timing and
patience and stuff like actually matter
it might be better suited to something
where you're just doing like turn-based
stuff or things where you don't need to
like hit a button at just the right
moment I think I read on the Box this
goes back to main menu up yep there we
go
oh and it's ports save states so if a
game is too hard for you you can always
use those to cheat
okay well I'm already a little angry
because they have pokemon sapphire and
ruby which is cool and all but I don't
see oh no way here there ok ok no we got
fired and LeafGreen yes in this world
there's Pokemon I had no idea when I
bought this it's still nuts to me that
this can be like on Amazon and there's
no apparently no repercussions and yeah
this is definitely the kind of game that
would work better I mean you also lose
out on like you know all the good parts
Pokemon where you actually trade things
and stuff no not you there he is that's
the right choice alright I pick squirtle
whinny yeah ok you know I kind of take
it back when I said earlier about like
turn-based games being better on this
guy because while yeah you could play
this this is still hurting my brain like
just seeing the kind of just stutter
that happens I don't know some people
would be willing to put up with that but
this like bothers me especially when I
know how this you know smoothly runs on
an actual system so yeah this guy works
it's just not entirely smooth and to
baylin's it just kind of reminds me more
of the fact that I'm just not really a
huge fan of this kind of stuff I mean
yeah it's really cool that you have all
these games little guy and it is kind of
questionably legal but personally I kind
of really prefer it when Nintendo does
their own official versions of these
yeah I get it doesn't have all the same
game sometimes because of licensing
rights sometimes because Nintendo just
doesn't put stuff on it for whatever
reason but there's a certain degree of
quality and authenticity that comes with
these classic edition systems the style
of presentation and just the consistency
of the system working that you don't
always get with stuff like this that I
really appreciate you know it's cool
that way these little tiny systems that
hook up to a TV but it'd be really
awesome to have just a little really
just a normal full-sized replica of a
Gameboy pocket because any smaller gets
a little awkward for your hands but
having this enclosed system that offers
a collection of all these classic games
sure you can get a lot of them as
downloads on the 3ds but there's a
certain feeling about having the actual
class control scheme and everything
altogether that I think would be really
cool and there's another layer with this
too something really interesting about
the n64 that once again not official but
pretty sure we're getting in 64 classic
is that there were some games that
messed with compatibility with Game Boy
and what if they carried that on in the
classic systems imagine that we get the
announcement of not only in n64 classic
but a Gameboy classic too and not only
do they each have their own awesome
library of games but they actually
interconnect a little bit too because
even think about it you have something
like pokemon stadium on the n64 and
pokemon red or blue on the pocket and
you can actually have them interact the
way the old-school games did that would
be really awesome because with an idea
like that you're not just making a
collection of old classic games but
you're also recreating old experiences
and reviving a kind of nostalgia that
we're not just getting quite yet with
the classic systems I think Nintendo has
the right idea but stuff like this just
reminds us of how much more they can be
and I think Nintendo can do that they
just need to take that extra step</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
