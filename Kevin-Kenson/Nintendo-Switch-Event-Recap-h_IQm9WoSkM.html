just wrapped up and holy that was
kind of amazing and kind of not at the
same time it's actually really weird he
just wants me to put it is it was really
really Japanese which is a really good
thing for some people and not much for
other to begin with so let's talk about
the actual specifications of the system
itself it will be releasing on March 3rd
which is way sooner than I think anyone
was anticipating and it's going to be at
a price point of $300 a little higher
than I was hoping for that specific the
same price as a ps4 slimmer Xbox one so
it's competitive but it's not exactly
aggress that's not all we learned though
there's a few other interesting little
tidbits to begin with online services
are going to be paid for just like on
ps4 and Xbox one so if you were hoping
to have a modern-day console with free
multiplayer online that dream is now
dead on the flip side though the
Nintendo switch will be a region locking
free system meaning that if you want to
play a game that's from Japan or Europe
or anywhere else it will work on your
Nintendo switch no matter what country
it's originally from which is really
cool now as for the portable aspects of
the system which I think a lot of people
were curious about there's a bit of good
and bad news the bad news is that the
estimated battery life is two and a half
to six hours which really means more
like two and half to three hours because
that six hour mark is based on some kind
of game that doesn't have very much
power draw you're not having to
backlight on and all kinds of other
stuff that isn't really a real-world
application on the upside though you can
charge the system with the wall outlet
not having to use the recharge dock set
up and ask us DC chargers you don't have
to buy any kind of a special Nintendo
only one if you lose it but you have a
charge or some other device it'll work
just fine and the last bit of news
that's really cool about the portable
aspects of the system is that it does
support local multiplayer with other
switches supporting up to as many as
eight of them which could mean
potentially as large as 16 player
multiplayer if each system supporting
two people now after all that they spend
a lot of time talking about the joique
on controllers which personally I'm
still not really sold on they look
really tiny really uncomfortable the
kind of thing that's going to cause your
hand cramp after as much as only 30
minutes of game time on the flip side
though the cool stuff was they revealed
other colors for including red and blue
and it has full-on motion controls and
vibration function which is supposed to
be the highest quality yet according to
Nintendo Utley one interesting thing
though is they didn't spend any time at
all talking about hardware specs which
isn't super surprising there have been
some leaks and rumors about what the
system is going to run on it's more than
likely going to be weaker than the ps4
or Xbox one and based on the gameplay
they showed later in the conference that
looks about right so after all that we
finally start talking about games which
had a rocky start
because in typical Nintendo fashion they
decided to open up with fun motion based
party games because hey it's fun for the
whole family and everyone can use it as
icebreakers and look at this footage
we're showing where people out at a club
playing a tennis game because that's
something a real person would do moving
on we actually talked about games that
were first hinted at the first switch
reveal which were a brand new splatoon
title not just a part of the one on Wii
U and a new mario game called mario
odyssey which looked a little disturbing
because it was mario in new york with
regular proportion people which is
really weird but the rest of the game
looked fantastic
the downside is neither of these games
are launch titles with splatoon to being
sometime in the summer and mario odyssey
all the way back to the holiday season
if it doesn't get pushed back now it was
after these two games that the press
conference took a really interesting
turn because i had a huge focus on
japanese third-party companies focusing
on japanese rpgs or related genres with
games like fire emblem warriors shin
megami tensei 5 you know blade 2 and a
lot more which personally I get super
hyped for those are Sandra's I love but
it's not necessarily the best route to
take if you want to get most of the
world excited its kind of amnesia onra
especially in north america now to
balance this out they did spend a little
time talking about Western franchises
they started off by cutting to a video
of Todd Howard talking about how excited
he is for the switch and that we're
going to be able to play Skyrim on it
because who is excited about a video
game we already played back in 2011 I
guess portable so that is a cool new
thing what was more interesting to me
was when they brought up EA to talk
about FIFA now me personally I'm not a
huge sports game fan it's just never
really done anything for me but the
switch seems like it could be in really
interesting home for that your honor
because of the idea of poor
both local multiplayer so after the sort
of in-depth look at a handful of games
that they went to this kind of wrap-up
highlight reel trailer which I think
took a lot of people off-guard because
most of the games they focused on
weren't in this presentation but
sometimes did get trailers afterwards
posted on YouTube some of these reports
of games like Rain Man and Dragon Ball
we've got some new games too like a new
Bomberman a new tetris game and a new
Street Fighter 2 which I am all kinds of
excited for now say it ended things here
what it's been a little awkward because
so far we have one launch title
confirmed and even spent any time at all
talking about the one game we all want
information on The Legend of Zelda
breath of the wild well thankfully they
cut to a trailer of it that was nothing
short than incredible and confirms the
game will in fact come out on the
Nintendo switch release date of March
3rd honestly who cares once you switch
game of the year 2017</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
