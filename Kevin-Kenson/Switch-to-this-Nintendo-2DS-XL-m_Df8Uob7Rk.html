done putting out new 3d assets and you
would be wrong because Nintendo is now
just released another special edition 2d
s XL they cannot get over this idea and
the newest one is this Hylian Shield
design right here now why are they
releasing this one I don't know there's
actually no special occasion whatsoever
this is not an anniversary this is not a
game coming out they kind of announced
it in line with kind of leading up to e3
that's kind of a setup I guess but it
really just seems kind of like a for the
heck of it design Nintendo wanted to
release a special edition Zelda 2d SXL
and I'm for it because this is a really
good-looking 2d s Nintendo has been
really upping their special editions
lately when it comes to the DS line at
least I mean last year we got the Polka
ball which looked great more recently
we've got the Pikachu and this is
definitely going up there with one of
the better designs let's kind of take a
look at this guy so this is based on the
Hylian Shield from Zelda franchise one
of the more kind of recurring items
across it and the quality in this guy is
really nice not just because of how they
have like the design and how just clean
it looks but you can even see here that
with all the metal bits well you know
metal all the steel design looking parts
actually do have this kind of metallic
sheen to them which gives a really cool
kind of color design to this whole thing
personally I really love the overall
color aesthetic of this I think the kind
of steel silver look they have on the
outside matching with the blue and just
a little bit of red and gold looks
really nice the only part of this that
looks a little off-putting to me is they
also have a couple random brown accents
it's on the shoulder triggers and also
the power button I think the logic here
is that in some depictions the Hylian
Shield does have like a wood and back
behind all the steel so that's where
that Browns coming into play but it kind
of seems like an unnecessary additional
color I think you could have kept those
just being the same kind of blue as all
the accents going on here and it would
have looked better but it doesn't ruin
the overall thing I mean the top
aesthetic here is awesome on the inside
we're still focusing on that blue and
grey we're not using the metallic sheen
of the steel but you're getting that
kind of lighter gray on the buttons
darker traditional grey on the sticks
and then that navy dark blue right here
which looks
really nice you know overall with its
color choices and that metallic finish
on the silver and gold parts I gotta say
this is easily one of the best looking
to DSX nails they've released I'm kind
of debating my head right now whether I
like this or the Polka ball more I
really like the kind of just concept of
the poke a little tedious but this one's
just overall look and feel is fantastic
something about the system I really like
- is that this is kind of a sign of a
recent trend Nintendo's been doing the
special editions where they have very
specific themes in mind because there
have been a lot of Zelda special edition
systems in the past I mean it's probably
the highest number alongside with
Pokemon and normally there's kind of
this default idea of black and gold use
gold trim in places you have the
Triforce did a very sort of generic
approach that's kind of just Zelda
overall where is this one there's a very
clear specific theme in mind which is
recapturing the design of the Hylian
Shield and that's part of what really
works well for anything is because it
gives you this kind of idea of a
specific item because the hila - does a
very recurring item in Zelda's history
it first mates appearance in Ocarina of
Time wears one kind of the first games
that you can actually see an in-depth
look at linked in what he's using they
did have a previous kind of concept art
design link to the past that looks
similar but ocarina of time is really
where this kind of overall aesthetic was
solidified and we've seen it in
basically every 3d Zelda game that has
an adult link along with one appearance
in a 2d game which is a link between
worlds the game this happens to be
bundled with so that works out really
well now the exact design of the Hylian
Shield has varied a little bit game to
game but the general aesthetic is all
here you have the steel outline for the
shield itself little metal accents and
the two most important symbols are this
Triforce right here up top which is you
know one of the biggest symbols from the
series and below that you have the
Hylian crest which in a period of time
it was kind of just a design they threw
together and they're like yeah that's
what the royal family crest looks like
and in later games of the series Skyward
Sword specifically they gave it a little
more meaning by saying that this is kind
of a fusion of two other symbols the
goddess crest which was in that game and
it's based on the red loft wing that you
would ride in Skyward Sword and kind of
formed the basis of what this design
looks like now this did start in ocarina
of time they did not use it in
of the older games there was one like I
said that was kind of similar and linked
to the past but that only showed up in
concept art in the game you just saw
that you had a blue shield not exactly
descriptive and before even that in
older Zelda games you can even see on
our pixel pal right here the actually
features design that had a cross symbol
which of course they kind of removed it
over time for pretty obvious reasons
removing religion from the game and
focusing instead on more just the
hardcore fantasy elements it was really
interesting but the system to me is
kinda what I was saying earlier that you
would think they'd be kind of done with
DS's by now especially with how
successful switch has been and how yeah
there's still some 3ds launches
happening but it's definitely starting
to get near the end of its lifecycle but
at the same time it's kind of smart
really I think Nintendo's really relying
on this idea that if you make a cool
enough looking special vision like this
guy right here you're gonna have diehard
fans that still want to grab one and
you're gonna have those people who
didn't necessarily own a DS got in on
the switch fell in love with some games
like for instance breath of the wild and
they see a design like this see it's a
cheaper system and maybe they want to
tap into that kind of larger older
library especially because this one does
come bundled with one of the best Zelda
games in my opinion link between worlds
which you know is a pretty old game now
it came out back in 2013 but it is an
excellent 3ds title and anyone that's a
fan of Zelda should definitely try that
one out so this is just a cool little
way of celebrating that franchise</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
