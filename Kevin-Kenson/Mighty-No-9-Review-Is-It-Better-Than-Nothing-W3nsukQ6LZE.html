there's a good bit of baggage to unpack
there's a lot of anger and hate on the
internet for this game and for good
reason this is one of the
highest-profile Kickstarter disasters
when it comes to video games a spiritual
successor to megaman a classic series
loved by many that's seemingly been
abandoned by the company that owns at
capcom and after a very successful
Kickstarter all kinds of promises are
made we see push back after push back
after push back poor looking demos a
horrendous launch trailer and now
finally the release of the game that is
far from meeting the hype that was built
up around it and with all that in mind I
have to admit I actually gotta like the
game don't get me wrong it's far from
being a great game it has a lot of
problems including bugs on certain
platforms inconsistent frame rates and
just flat-out bad gameplay design
choices but there's still some good in
here that calls out to me that I just
can't ignore the core gameplay is
undeniably Megaman with an emphasis on
two very simple moves jump and shoot
with an added emphasis and mighty number
nine being the dash something Megaman
could do but has been expanded upon a
lot basically whenever you damaged NMU
enough before killing them you can dash
through them to be awarded points and
you can also sometimes absorb little
benefits from enemies like a usable
healing item or temporary buffs to
attack speed and defense it's kind of a
fun play on Mega Man's basic idea of
absorbing his enemy's powers but now
applied to regular enemies to which i
think is pretty cool and the speed at
which the game can be played is a lot
faster than traditional Megaman games
thanks to being able to josh pretty much
non-stop and freely in typical series
fashion you use these skills to take on
eight different bosses in whatever order
you like each of which gives you a new
power that serves as a weakness to
another boss and might help make some
parts of levels easier based on all this
alone honestly the game does a pretty
good job nothing incredible but about as
much as you'd expect from a game that is
intentionally trying its best not to be
original where the problems come though
is the entire lack of polish thrown in
this game in pretty much every way
possible and an oversaturation of bonus
content promised by Kickstarter stretch
goals that just feels like unnecessary
blow that took time away from important
work that
the single-player story drastically
needed while the game certainly tries
hard to look like megaman with
characters and enemies clearly just
being remixes of things we've seen
before everything just feels super
sterile and boring stages like a lot of
details character movements and facial
expressions appear constantly dead
inside animations like explosions look
horrible and the game has some of the
most uninspiring lazy background music
ever teamed up with painful sound and
character voicing with a few exceptions
here and there there's also a few major
shortcomings in the core gameplay
switching between sub weapons is
annoying and inefficient and levels do a
really bad job of teaching or telling
you about certain little gimmicks one of
the most annoying being a
doughnut-shaped stage where you need to
backtrack every now and then to hunt
down an enemy sniper covering over the
same ground over and over and over again
the most glaring problem by far though
is the performance issues this game
suffers which varies by platform the wii
u version is apparently all kinds of
unplayable while the ps4 version which i
played on suffered from constant dropped
frames which is just silly considering
how underwhelming the game's graphics
are and then there's the bonus modes a
lot of dev time was taken adding these
challenge maps that had a co-op and all
kinds of other little features that
honestly the game just didn't need a lot
of them are just boring in design and
offer a forced way to pad more hours
into the game and we're really only
added because they were stated stretch
goals along with putting this thing on
pretty much every platform in current
use which only really hurt it in the end
the only bit of bonus content I found
worth it was the game's only current DLC
which comes with physical copies of the
game offering a new level of play
through and unlockable second playable
character which makes for a much harder
and frantic game where you're constantly
losing health a gimmick that I honestly
found really fun until you come up
against bosses where you have no way to
gain life and now just have to rely on
never getting hit ever I think the most
important thing to take away from mighty
number 9 is that crowdfunded games need
to not get stretch goal happy especially
when it comes to bonus modes online
content and porting the game to several
more platforms because in the end all
these things add up open up new problems
for development and eventually lead to
the very core of the game suffering from
a lack of much-needed polishing a lot of
good games have come from crowdfunding
but this
harsh reminder the devs need to be
careful what they promise especially
when you're relying on legacy and name
power of classic games that being said
while the game has failed in many ways
to be some kind of Savior and nod to
retro gaming it does still accomplish
its very core goal being a fun super
obvious clone of megaman for 20 to 30
bucks I wouldn't advise grabbing at
anytime soon because there are some very
obvious bug work that needs to be done
especially on some platforms but
honestly I'm not that mad paying 25
bucks for this if you just want knockoff
Megaman you'll find some fun here if
you're looking for the second coming of
retro platformer and goodness just turn
your head and move on</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
