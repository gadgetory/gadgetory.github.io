the cross-section of storytelling and
game mechanics and the designer that's
done a lot of fun ideas but this is Sam
Barlow who's actually got a new web
series called wargames a show that not
only gives you choices over how it
develops but also gives you the chance
at winning up to three thousand dollars
in Walmart gift cards thanks to today's
sponsor echo so what exactly is wargames
and how does it work well like a lot of
Barlow's other work it's very heavily
focused on the idea of viewer perception
how it changes the way the story evolved
in the case wargames
it's an interactive TV show that you
watch and unlike a traditional TV show
where it's just the one screen
everything's happening on there it's
instead told through multiple screens
done through different web cameras
people's phones so on so forth and as
you're watching you choose which of
these cameras you want to focus on and
based on which ones you focus on the
story's going to change it's not
something where you're being handed
clear obvious choices and seeing how
they play out like a
choose-your-own-adventure it's all the
more subtle and interesting that it's
focusing on what cameras you seem to
care about as a viewer which characters
that you're interested in and tilting
all the events to favor those situations
where you're learning more about certain
people's backstories maybe someone gets
the upper hand in an argument because
you're focusing on them or you learn
more tidbits about the history of what's
going on in this setting simply put the
show focuses on what you care about as a
viewer and shifts everything to match
that perception now if you're wanting
about those prizes I'm ingenuity that
you could have a chance to win there's
actually another game tied indoor games
called hash coin which gives you the
chance to win up to three thousand
dollars in Walmart gift cards now I
actually got the chance to play hash
coin early and it is super simple to
pick up all you have to do is sign up
it's totally free and we actually have a
link down below if you want to check
that out and you just start watching war
games on desktop now while you're
watching war games hash coin is gonna be
going on at the same time on the side
asking you all different kinds of trivia
tied in to what's happening in the show
and every time you get a question right
you score points at the end of the
contest period the top 15,000 scores are
going to split a 250 thousand dollar
prize with the top spot getting three
thousand dollars in Walmart gift cards
by the way if you're worried that you're
not the best at trivia
spatula final answer you still have the
chance to win big because you can also
score points by sharing hash coin with
your friends and inviting them to play
too
plus it doesn't hurt that all the trivia
is still tied directly into what's going
on in the show so you'd have to be any
kind of trivia mastermind to get through
it all
once again this is totally free to play
all you have to do is sign up we've got
the link down below in description make
sure to check that out you have your
chance to win a piece of that $250,000
prize often times when games missed the
idea of narrative it's usually just a
choose-your-own-adventure approach where
yeah there's a sort of a basic storyline
but you make decisions and events play
out a little differently depending on
what you do which is fine that's fun but
Barlow's work is a bit more interesting
unique and plays a lot more with the
idea of how players actually interact
with the fiction and kind of messing
with their perceptions of everything a
really good example this is actually one
of his oldest works from way back in
1999 which was this text-based game
called Isle now Isle was interesting
because while it's a text-based game
where you enter a command you actually
will answer one command and that's the
entire game but what happens is every
time you do a different command you get
a different ending and that different
ending can give you an idea of some
other command to try and see what
happens instead and had all these
different storylines where there were
different main characters depending on
commands you do different life
situations different histories all kinds
of stuff that was really weird in a
great way now this idea was explored a
lot more in the game that he's probably
most famous for which is her story now
in her story the entire game is built
around a series of FMV sequences that
are all just little bits of an
interrogation and it's a said storyline
no matter what way you watch it however
the way it works is that players are
given some scenes and then they've to
figure out keywords to use to search for
more scenes and piece the whole story
together so while two separate players
can watch all the exact same scenes
they're not necessarily going to
experience them in the same order in the
order that you watch them in cann
heavily change how you interact with the
fiction and kind of what order different
plot revelations occur to you more games
is another step in the development of
interactive storytelling and I cannot
wait to see where that genre goes and
don't forget if you want a chance to win
a part of that two and fifty thousand
dollars in Walmart gift cards make sure
