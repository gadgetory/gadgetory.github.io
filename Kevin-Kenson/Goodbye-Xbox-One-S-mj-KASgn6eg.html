result we're starting to see a lot of
special deals go on to celebrate the
biggest event in gaming one of them is
the release of this new limited edition
Xbox one s at a discounted price
featuring a custom port night design now
we have two even gotten a special
edition Xbox one s in quite some time
for a while Microsoft is focusing more
on the one X so there's been a little
time since we've gotten something like
this but what's really interesting about
it is that while it is a limited edition
1s its following some design elements
they've been using lately for the one
exits specifically the idea of a
gradient a lot of specialists roll when
X is a feature to kind of color change
from either white to black or black to a
darker black so on so forth and in the
case of this one we have a purple
gradient going from a lighter purple on
this side getting darker and darker
darker which you really notice once you
get to the part where the air vents are
something that kind of tripped me up
about this Xbox as well is that it has a
little bit of a reflective finish to the
mat which is something you've done with
some of the more colorful Xbox bonuses
the turquoise one has a similar shine to
it but combining that with the gradient
really trips your eyes up depending on
the lighting of the Ruhr end you either
see one solid color or a very clear
gradient or just it just looks very
different depending on the lighting
conditions you have it in and actually
took us a little bit time to set this up
to make sure we show it properly you
guys because sometimes it just did not
show up now by comparison the controller
comes with does not have that gradient
design it's one solid dark purple all
around the body while having some
lighter purple highlights for these
symbols on the buttons and of course it
has the four colors in the middle of the
a px wise to show you again you know
wise normal yellow B is red so so forth
now send me much wondering what are the
savings involved in having a bundle with
fortnight this fortnight is a free to
play game well in this case it does come
bundled with some special goodies for
fortnight Battle Royale specifically you
do get 2,000 V bucks which is an in-game
currency so there's a little savings
there but more interestingly you're also
getting a special set of skins based on
dark vertex which is a skin set they had
before but it was an orange
regular vertex this one focuses on the
color purple instead which by the way I
am so happy that an official fortnight
system is purple because we've done a
couple of our own just kind of mock-ups
before of like oh if we got like a
special edition for tonight system what
would it look like and the colors have
always kind of fallen back on our blue
and purple and when we did a switch one
in fact we did purple jewel cones with a
blue back on the switch so seeing an
official one in purple that's just
validation for me that yes we picked the
right color of course the reason for
getting this bundle right now aside from
the fact that fortnight is still pretty
popular it's one of a number of
different deals going on to celebrate
III and there's a lot of other specials
going on for Xbox in particular this
bundle is for 250 which is cheaper than
getting an Xbox 1s MSRP normally at
least they were also taking 50 bucks off
the all digital system for only $200 and
the Xbox one X is a hundred bucks off
making it 400 Xbox isn't the only
company doing deals of course
PlayStation even though they're not
participating at e3 directly are still
holding their days of play sale system
wise this still includes a new special
edition PlayStation 4 slim which is the
days of play metallic design which looks
pretty good I kind of prefer last year's
blue and gold one but this is still a
pretty cool different option on top of
that they're doing deals on systems with
50 bucks off the ps4 pro bringing it
down to 350 there's also a couple
similar deals going on for both
companies Microsoft is offering 10 bucks
off of their controllers but really on
Amazon that translates to being $40
which is awesome and that's the same
price that DualShock 4's are going for
as well on top of that both of them are
offering discounts on some of their more
popular services with both Xbox Live
Gold and PlayStation Plus year
memberships being 40 bucks compared to
the regular 60 PlayStation is also
offering a year membership of
PlayStation now for 70 bucks that's 30
bucks off the usual price of a hundred
and the PlayStation Classic is now at
the low low low low price of $30 so if
you've been waiting for the chance to
strike on one of those that's the time
of course those are just all the deals
going on right now for hardware and
services there are so so so many
different game deals to list way too
many to lists so just just go check it
out there's there's a lot of stuff
you're bound to find something you've
been waiting on now this release brings
up a really interesting question of is
this the last Xbox one
we're actually going to get because
pretty soon we're gonna see the reveal
of Xboxes new system that we don't know
the name of yet and if all the rumors
and theories are accurate it could be
coming out as soon as the middle of next
year probably in the springtime so that
doesn't leave a lot of time left to do
anymore special edition designs now of
course there are still some big
Microsoft games coming out before the
launch of this new system we are
probably getting gears or five later
this year and if that's the case we
could maybe maybe get one last special
edition and in that case I think they
would probably push it to being a 1x not
a 1s so that would still make this the
last in its line for this particular
model it just really makes me think
about how much I didn't really care for
the original Xbox one design and how the
1s really changed everything up and
became a much more beautiful system and
we got a lot of great different special
edition colors and designs for it and
this potentially being the last one I
think it's a pretty strong final note
