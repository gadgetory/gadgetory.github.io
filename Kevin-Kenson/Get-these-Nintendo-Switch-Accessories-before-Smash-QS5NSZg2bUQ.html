anticipated games for the switch to this
year if not the most anticipated game to
come out in 2018 but with its release
comes the same question we get every
time a new Smash Brothers is on the way
can I use a GameCube controller with it
this video war video game war is heating
up tonight Nintendo's GameCube system is
about to hit the store Super Smash
Brothers now thankfully we already know
the answer to this which is yes because
the Wii U adaptors that they made for
the Wii U version of smash now works on
the switch which is great if you already
have one but they are very very hard to
track down and very expensive so you
don't have one already it's a bit of a
problem but good news we did find a
third party option with this little guy
right here now if you're wondering what
exactly this is this is basically the
same thing as the official Wii U
GameCube adapter that Nintendo made
except it's well obviously a third party
and looks like a Gamecube so all it
really does is you can plug these two
USBs into your switch talk plug in
GameCube controller right there and you
should be able to play with it no
problem now if you're wondering why
someone would want to use a controller
that came out back in 2001 on a modern
game well what is it that separates
GameCube from its competitors like Sony
Playstation 2
video game experts tell me it's all in
the control it's cuz it's a really good
controller and there's not really a
modern-day equivalent for this because
the design logic for the gaming
controller is a bit different from most
other controllers we have now with most
controllers today the logic is usually
how do we make the most comfortable
controller how does it work across a
very large number of games whereas
nintendo during the time of the n64 and
the Gamecube we're much more
experimental we're focusing more on well
we already know the kind of games we
make and will release how to make a
controller that fits that specific
experience now their first attempt of
this back in the n64
wasn't quite as successful and that's
this guy right here now the idea behind
the n64 controller was that it gave you
multiple ways to handle a controller to
fit different kinds of games whether you
want to hold it this way this way or
this way and it had its fans at the time
but it's not a controller that I think
is really aged very well I mean you
don't have access to all the buttons
depending on how you're gripping it some
of it is just not very comfortable to
begin with and a lot of it just didn't
into being being used the way Nintendo
thought it would like for instance the C
buttons here were designed to be camera
controls thus the C but very few games
actually did that with that instead made
use of it for extra button functions so
it was a cool idea but didn't really pan
out entirely just right but it did serve
as a base inspiration for what they
needed we're doing with the Gamecube now
the GameCube controller
kind of took some the idea is going on
with the n64 controller but then also
rolled in things from their successful
competitors PlayStation with their Dual
Shock design which is where you have
this more familiar grip going on and a
lot of this is pretty familiar at first
glance I mean you've got a dual stick
setup going on we've got shoulder
buttons where things get weird though
and confuse a lot of people who haven't
really used one before is what exactly
is happening in this area right here now
normally we see a lot of controllers
where we have just four buttons that are
all the same size and they all have
their a little placement but the logic
going on the Nintendo head is well most
of our games you really just need to use
a you maybe need to use B and some games
will use Y in X and different arresting
ways but a comes up the most by far so
instead of having the same real estate
as all the other buttons let's put it
right in the
and make it the biggest and then
everything else is kind of remembered
based on where it is relative to the a
button and it just so happens that one
of the most successful games on the
Gamecube really helped popularize this
as a go-to option because it is perfect
for smash I mean the main two things
you're gonna rely on are a button for
your main attacks and smash attacks of
course B for specials but you can just
roll right into right here and then X or
Y for jumping so it just all comes out
really comfortably does it work across
every single game that comes out no
weights whatsoever but when a game is
designed with this controller in mind
it's awesome so awesome in fact that I'm
really surprised Nintendo didn't really
hold on to this design longer I mean
they basically abandon right into the
Wii where they started doing the classic
controller the Wii U pro controller and
now even the switch pro controller which
are much more conventional designs and
this guy has seen some use since I mean
the major that it was supported on Wiis
the way you had an adapter they did do a
reissue specifically for Smash Brothers
on Wii U which was cool but even then it
was a limited run kind of thing so
hopefully they do that again but it's
not that's where the adapter comes in
handy so let's try this thing out now
from the looks of it I think it should
just be as simple as using the Wii U
game controller adapter so let's try
this thing out now looking at it should
be just as simple as using the Wii U
game controller adapter all I got to do
is take the two USBs plug them into the
switch dock which I've already done and
then just take our gift coop controller
and plug it into here and it should just
read it as a wired controller and it
does awesome so obviously there is no
smash to play on the switch just yet and
that's really kind of the main thing
we're interested doing so I downloaded
one of the few smash clones that's
actually made its way to the switch
which I've never played before so
there's gonna be experience let's find
out let's check this out
know that oh the start button reads is
the home button I guess it does okay
good to know
then what reads is plus because there's
not as many buttons here as there are
unlike the actual switch controllers so
we're gonna be missing some and I'm
really hoping none of those are
important there are some buttons missing
which it seems like for this game is
fine and presumably whenever smash comes
out that's not going to be an issue
either because it should be using
hopefully the same control scheme as the
past games so yeah this is gonna work
once match comes out that's really
exciting it doesn't have a plus button
though so I don't think I can pause so
we figured it out I was able to get to
get me to pause as you can see and that
wasn't using joy Kahn's
actually did use the GameCube controller
so I looked it up on their website and
there actually are ways to make use of
the buttons that are on a switch
controller that aren't on the GameCube
controller it's just not exactly the
most intuitive thing and do you think it
would be in the direction manual for
this adapter it's not from this out by
going to the website and reading about
the product and finding some additional
very useful info there so to make up for
the lack of buttons what this does is it
has the GameCubes z button basically act
as a hotkey for using all the missing
buttons so if you want to do Z L it's
not Z its Z and L at the same time if
you want to do the plus button it's not
well not existent plus button here it's
doing Z and the right d-pad at the same
time so not the most intuitive thing
right out of the box but if you take the
time to actually look at the
instructions it's makes it much more
usable so this is cool girl guys I know
the whole point is to showcase this
controller but this is just make me want
to play like actual smash</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
