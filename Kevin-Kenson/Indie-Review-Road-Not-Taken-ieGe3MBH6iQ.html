guys another indie game review and today
we're talking about road not taken from
spry Fox which is available on PC Mac
and ps4 now at its heart road not taken'
is a puzzle game but there's also a
really heavy emphasis on its
presentation and ambiance to really make
it a much more memorable title right
from the start it's fairly obvious that
one of the game's biggest strengths is
its aesthetic the art while somewhat
simple is incredibly charming and while
it is very childlike it's heavily
balanced out by the mood the game's
light story and music accents the basic
premise is really quite simple and very
grim you take on the role of the village
Ranger a man or woman who sets out to
the woods every harsh winter rescuing
lost children saving them all doesn't it
use some nice benefits but proceeding
only requires that you save at minimum
half of them giving the game a hint of
story in the sense that sometimes
sacrifices must be made or that you
aren't always capable of saving everyone
add in the music that strikes a balance
between wistful and gloomy and you have
a perfect storm of visuals and sound
that really makes this game stand out
now of course presentation alone is not
enough to justify a full purchase for a
lot of you out there so let's go ahead
and talk about what this game has going
on in the gameplay department the basics
of road not taken' are pretty simple to
pick up the game is divided into 15
chapters referencing years worth of time
and each year as I said earlier you have
to go out into the forest to rescue
children in order to do so you must pick
up objects and move them around either
by consuming energy while carrying them
or throw them as far as possible in a
straight line once a child is found you
can rescue them by taking them all the
way back to the puzzles entrance or by
finding a nearby parent to deliver them
to what complicates this whole thing is
the numerous different types of objects
you'll encounter and have to interact
with roads will only open when so many
of the same object are stacked next to
one another and sometimes pushing one
object into another will create combined
effects some of which are desirable and
others which are not some objects move
around the field some can only be moved
under certain circumstances others
transform under certain circumstances
and not paying attention to what you
place where just might end up
accidentally creating dangerous enemies
that can wreck your health now the
important thing to note about all this
is that each puzzle is randomized each
year so that means that what objects you
encounter aren't always going to be the
same and sometimes depending
on your play style you'll get the right
mixture that makes it not that hard to
deal with but at other times
absolutely soul-crushing thankfully the
game does give you some degree of
control to try and manipulate the
dungeon to your advantage as time goes
on you'll unlock various items and tools
to make trips easier including
equippable items that grant some kind of
benefit while solving the puzzle or
being able to ban a couple obstacles
that you find particularly annoying now
the thing about this game is is that
you're going to lose probably quite a
lot up until you finally reach the final
stages of the game and the thing about
it is when you do die you're sent all
the way back to year 1 to start the
whole game over however with each
failure the game does get a little
easier certain data gets carried over
between runs and you have a travelers
log that updates whenever you learn a
secret about how obstacles interact
either through performing them on the
spot or by making friends with local
villagers between puzzles and getting
random secrets from them as a reward
you'll also keep what objects are bana
between runs so with every playthrough
you'll be getting more and more
knowledge and options to make the later
stages of the game less daunting so with
all those mechanics out on the table how
does this all actually end up working in
practice well to be perfectly honest the
game is something of a hit and miss with
me now on the one hand the level of
randomization and the fact that you
accrue knowledge over time does make for
a very fun kind of consistent challenge
where you just do a little better each
time you play the game and despite the
fact that you're basically doing the
same thing over and over again the game
does really feel quite as monotonous as
you think it would the problem though is
that the randomization in this game is
almost too wild at times and sometimes
obstacles appear in just the right way
to make it an utter pain for your weary
and tired ranger after so many attempts
and deaths you almost begin to feel as
though the late game's difficulty has
less to do with your knowledge of how to
manipulate what objects and is more so
based solely around what objects you end
up having deal with in some runs the
middle 5 levels can be surprisingly easy
with other times having the sixth or
seventh level just completely shut you
down because you're stuck with just an
utterly painful mixture of obstacles now
don't get me wrong
difficulty due to randomization isn't
entirely a bad thing but when
randomization alone is capable of
completely stonewalling you then that
becomes a problem especially in the
situation where you need to clear 15
levels in a row without failure to
complete the game now does this factor
ruin the game
no not really but it is something to be
warned about especially for those you
out there that don't like having this
level of random chance affect the game's
difficulty the randomness aside the game
is a great time killer if you just want
to play a puzzle game that can keep you
on your toes and as I said earlier
aesthetically it's beautiful
is it worth fifteen dollars that's
really up to you and your personal
preference when it comes to puzzle games
I enjoyed it and while not singing its
prices super loud I felt I got my
money's worth out of it it's worth
noting too that if you own a ps4 and
we're thinking of grabbing this game for
it
it is currently part of august's
PlayStation Plus membership so if you
remember you can just grab that for free
right now and start playing well that
