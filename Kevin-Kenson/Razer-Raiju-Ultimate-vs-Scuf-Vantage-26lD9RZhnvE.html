resurgence when it comes to pro
controllers for a long time there was
basically just three main options
available but we're starting to see a
lot of these companies releasing new
revised and honestly just flat-out
better designs a couple minutes back we
talked about scuffs new option the
Vantage and today we're going to take a
look at one of the two new options from
Razer the Razer Ryu ultimate
first let's talk about how this compares
to the original ride shoe controller
with the most significant change
immediately being that it is a wired and
wireless controller as opposed to being
wired only now why I say wired Wireless
versus just saying Wireless is that this
isn't a controller that's wireless and
you can just plug it in charge and you
know use wired if you want to it
actually has a specific wired mode as
well as two different wireless modes one
/ ps4 one for PC and the difference here
is that with the wire you're going to
get the lowest lag possible which is
really important for competitive play or
you can switch it to Wireless mode if
you just won't be comfort of a wireless
controller before getting into like
special features and new functions and
everything I want to talk about the form
change on this versus the original rise
you because while at first glance they
look very similar because of the buttons
everything you're in the same placement
there's a lot of changes to the grip
that make it honestly a lot more
comfortable to me first off the grip
design itself is just a little larger
it's also a heftier controller so I
always like a little weight in my
controllers and I find the grip to be
much better for long-term play I will
say that because it is a little larger
it might be a little more uncomfortable
people with smaller hands but everyone
else definitely an upgrade the next big
difference is these stick designs I was
never a big fan of the Ryu sticks and
originally had these kind of rubber
padding's on them that I didn't find to
be very comfortable and I removed them
but then it's not really as grippy as
I'd like it to be so it's kind of a bad
trade-off either way the ultimate on the
other hand has replaced that design
entirely in favor of this kind of hard
foam that I actually found to be very
comfortable it has just enough a little
bit of give because it's that foam but
it's like grip here at the same time
it's honestly what my favourite stick
heads I've used recently they've also
made a big change to the programmable
buttons the top two are still the same
there's located right between the
triggers but on the back we have a big
change with a larger button that kind of
goes a little flush with the grip as
opposed to the original rise you where
they were smaller buttons that you could
remove which was a nice feature but they
were more kind of inside and a little
harder to reach this is much easier to
press but I kind of wish they still had
the removable feature because I also
feel like sometimes these buttons are a
little too easily pressable it's
something I've gotten more used to over
time using it but definitely my initial
first run of this controller
accidentally pressing these quite a bit
that really does it for the major
physical changes there's a couple or
light things as well the d-pad is just a
little bit smaller but it's a minut
enough change that doesn't really change
anything functionally they also changed
the switches on the back for going
between full triggers or half stop
I actually like these ones a lot more
because if you want to change mid-game
for whatever reason it's a lot easier to
do the original risers ones just have a
little bit too much resistance it was
really annoying to try and do mid-game
now that wraps up for the kind of
initial main physical changes but
there's a lot of new functions this
controller has the original rise you did
not the biggest right away is that you
can change the sticks and d-pad on this
controller it's really easy they just
come off like that and actually you
threw me a little off first because most
changeable sticks you actually take the
whole stick off this is just the stick
head and you can replace it with a
longer stick design or concave ones and
they have any different d-pad you can
use which offers a more web design to
can do easier rolling inputs well both
the original rise U and the ultimate
offered the ability to swap between
different profiles for how the buttons
are programmed the original riser we'll
only supported two on board profiles
where the ultimate does a full four and
even has a matching light that changes
to let you know which profile you're
actively on now there is one major
feature from the original riser that is
missing on the ultimate and that is
onboard audio controls you cannot beat
your mic you cannot increase or decrease
your volume you're gonna have to rely on
your headset directly for that but in
its place are two new buttons the first
of which is light controls because this
would not be a high quality Razer
product without chroma lighting to
really show off the second button is a
lock button which you can use that
disables certain functions on the
controller like the PlayStation Home
button options start that way you don't
accidentally hit the share button
mid-game
and throw off your whole match now this
all sounds like a lot there's still
actually one more big feature and that's
fact this now also comes with a phone
app you can use to get further
customization options first it gives you
a much easier way to keep track of all
your different profiles and what buttons
are mapped how and even adds the
additional option to map buttons that
will adjust the stick sensitivity
on-the-fly
for instance holding this button down to
make the stick move at half speed it
also gives you the option to adjust the
intensity of the rumble motors in the
left and right side and more in-depth
controls for what exactly you want to
see for the lights on the chrome outline
right here now before we get to
comparing this to the sky Vantage really
diving into which one's really worth
your money I want to take a second to
talk about the little sibling to this
controller the razor rise you tournament
edition because I think a lot of people
are gonna look at these two controller
side by side and be like oh well The
Ultimates more expensive it must be even
nicer better controller and that isn't
actually necessarily
true yes there are some downgrade
aspects to it but there's some other
things that make it a little more of an
interesting alternative now yes there
are a lot of features you are missing on
the tournament compared to the ultimate
you don't get the swappable sticks or
d-pad you don't get the chroma lighting
which I know is a huge deal for some
people and you're not gonna get on board
profile switching this gives you for the
tournament just has the single one on it
but because you're missing all these
features there is a significant
improvement in the battery life of the
tournament addition whereas this only
lasts about 11 hours on a charge the
term addition lasts up to 19 almost
twice as much and while the tournament
is missing some of the coolest features
of the ultimate I still feel like you're
getting most of the really important
ones you're getting the mechanical
tactile buttons you're getting the same
grip shape that is really comfortable
you get all the programmable buttons and
you still get the app to use with it and
it has the wired wireless functionality
all really big winning points the really
interesting difference though when I
feel like this is something that Razer
hasn't really advertised super big-time
to a lot of people is that the
tournament actually uses a different
stick setup than the ultimate the
ultimate favors the PlayStation style
where you have the sticks at the same
height whereas the tournament swaps them
for the more Xbox one style where the
stick is appear and the d-pad is down
here so depending on your personal
preference for comfort that can be a
huge reason to switch for the tournament
rather than paying extra for the
ultimate so the rise you ultimate and
rise your tournament big upgrades over
the original but is it more worth it to
grab one of these or the new scuff
Vantage well let's start by going over
some of the benefits you're gonna get on
the Vantage that aren't on the rise you
controllers to begin with I really like
the physical modularity of the Vantage
well both controllers feature things
that you can swap in and out there's
just a lot more you can do with the
right who specifically there are more
stick options although you do have to
buy those separately you can change out
the triggers for longer ones and also
from an aesthetic standpoint there's a
whole lot more different color choices
if you want to personalize it I also
really appreciate the fact that while
the scuff Vantage doesn't offer a lot of
programmable buttons they are all
removable so if there's one you don't
personally like the placement of or you
want to change out for a specific game
you have that option it's also worth
noting that while both controllers do
have programmable buttons the event
adjust have more with six I will say the
two in the middle aren't always the
easiest to reach but additional options
are never a bad thing there's also a
couple personal preference things to
keep in mind the Vantage does use the
Xbox one stick layout so if you prefer
having to stick over here versus the
equal
like on the rise you this is a better
way to go it's also a slightly smaller
controller so if you have smaller hands
this is going to be a bit more
comfortable for you one more little
nitpicky benefit too is that while both
controllers have anti friction rings on
the sticks that work very well
the Vantage's are just a little better
honestly I don't think most people would
notice right away but when you have the
two controllers side-by-side there's
just a little tiny bit more resistance
you get on the rise you that isn't
present on the Vantage now that all
being said as far as pure build quality
goes the rise you does feel like the
stronger of the two there's not as much
that you can physically modify about it
but because of that the whole package
just feels a lot stronger and better in
general I like the grip a little more
for bigger hands and I really like the
heft that it has I also think that while
there are fewer stick options to work
with these standard stick head designs
are really good I'm a big fan of the
Meccano tactile buttons they have on the
front facing buttons and while there are
fewer programmable buttons I feel like
in general they're just a little more
comfortable to reach though like I said
earlier these ones on the back can be a
little too easy to accidentally hit
sometimes and while it does lack on
physical modularity there is a whole lot
you can do programmable wise on this
controller there's the multiple profiles
there's the ways you can adjust these
stick sensitivities and the rebel
sensitivity there's just more
fine-tuning you can do this controller
program wise that I really appreciate
directly comparing them side by side
they're both great controllers but I
think I'm gonna have to give it to the
rise you as far as just overall quality
but there is a very important other
factor to consider
and that's price because this is not
actually available in the US you have to
import it and while it's not very hard
to import you're likely gonna be
spending more money because you're
buying from resellers on a controller
that is already more expensive in the
first place the scuff Vantage if you're
willing to buy just the wired version is
as low as 170 bucks if you want it
Wireless it's 200 and a little more than
that if you want to buy more
customization options for it the rise
you on the other hand at list price in
the UK is 200 pounds which translates to
just a little over 250 bucks in the US
and you're gonna pay even more than that
buying from a reseller so it's a really
cool controller but you're gonna pay for
it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
