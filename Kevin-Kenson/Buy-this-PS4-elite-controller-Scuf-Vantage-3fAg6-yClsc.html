Andy Kaufman opening but that's just
where my brain away
when it comes to Xbox one and ps4 one
area they really heavily differed in is
the approach to pro controllers
Microsoft in the Xbox one has had their
own official leak controller and the
only real competition to that has been
scuffs alternative designs where the
real debate there is whether you want to
craft something specifically for you or
by a good one-size-fits-all controller
on PlayStation on the other hand they've
licensed out a lot of different
controllers that have been a ton of
different ro controller designs with
their own strengths and weaknesses and I
think we've actually now finally hit the
point of having one true Pro controller
that stands is like the one to get and
that's the new scuff Vantage now this
isn't me we did cover back at e3 and
kinda went over all the different
functions stuff we're still gonna
overview that but the real focus want to
take here is what this does differently
from past scuff controllers and then
what really sets it apart from other ps4
designs first let's just do a brief
overview of all the functions that are
still in this guy that are kind of
standard across a lot of scuff
controllers brief overview of all the
functions that are still in this time
that's are kind of standard across a lot
of scuff controllers do you have of
course the four back pedal buttons which
give you additional controller options
you can remap front-facing buttons or
shoulder buttons to this or the touchpad
and well you have a better grip design
which is this kind of rubber feeling
which is more comfortable it's better if
your hands to feel sweaty and it just
gives a little bit of give if you're
gripping tightly and then there's of
course all the different little
modifiable bits with the controller you
can add a circle pad attachment to the
front of the d-pad different stick
designs whether you want a domed or
concave head or if you want taller one
and extendable triggers along with
having the ability to modify how quickly
those triggers stop and what kind of
tension you have when you're hitting
them now once again these are all things
that scuff has done before in past
controllers but there is a lot here
going on that's new different and in all
honesty just flat-out better four main
things to talk about as far as how this
controllers have improved over past
scuff designs there's basically four
main things I want to talk about as far
as how this controller has improved over
past scuff designs the first of which is
the fact that this is actually a brand
new built from the ground up controller
cEEP a scuff controllers like these
scuff infinite and the impact our
controllers that were basically heavily
modified Dual Shock Force they use the
same basic button layout but they
exchange things like adding the paddles
giving a better grip so on and so forth
and while they were solid controllers
honestly there was always this kind of
Frankenstein affected them visually that
I didn't find that appealing the
infinite especially the impact improved
on this a lot by adding a different
shell design which also improved the
grip and added extra paddles but in the
Vantage's case it's a whole new brand
new controller it's not modified
anything and it has a grip design and
layout that is much more familiar to an
Xbox one controller which personally I
do find a lot more comfortable it's not
the exact same but honestly I find its
grip even better next to the fact this
controller is offered in both a wired
and wireless / wired model now when I
say Wireless / wired I want to clarify
something I don't mean this is a
wireless controller that you can just
plug in if you want to charge it no this
is a controller that gives you the
ability to play both wirelessly via
bluetooth or you can switch over to
using a cable attachment for
communication instead which is going to
give you that reduced lag time which is
something I really appreciate because a
big problem I had with a lot of pro
controllers is the fact that you buy
them and they give you that awesome
response time when wired but
sometimes you just want to relax and use
a controller wirelessly and yeah you can
just use regular Jewish clock for for
that but if you're gonna pay good money
for an awesome controller why do you
want to not use that this gives you the
benefit of both worlds by being able to
use it wirelessly or wired when it's
time to compete now something that's
really handy about this too is actually
that scuff has a different approach now
to how they're kind of marketing these
controllers as well before you'd have to
buy each controller customizing each
individual area and spend more and more
money with the Vantage they're doing the
option where you can just buy the
standard wired or standard Wireless at a
flat price and you can also even go to
gamestop and just buy it in store
they're in that design and you can buy
separate upgrade packs on their own or
if you order the website you could spend
a flat $30 more to customize it however
you want whether that's using a
different color faceplate different
color sticks different six lines so and
so forth and that leads to the other
thing I really love about this guy the
ease of customization now Pass Cup
controllers you could customize stuff
when you ordered it and there was some
stuff you could do after you've already
received it but a lot of those were
heavily reliant on using different tools
if you want to read map buttons you get
to use a little magnetic key if you want
to adjust how quickly they stop you had
to use a little tool to turn it this
time around they've removed almost all
tools there's only one you have to worry
about which we'll get to in a second but
everything you can do here is super easy
if you want to change the faceplate you
can just lift off with your hand and put
it back off no problem if you want to be
able to change the trigger stops it's
just something you can turn with your
hand if you want to remap buttons it's
just a toggle on the bottom of the
controller all super simplified the only
one that still needs a tool is if you
want to be able to change the tension of
the triggers in which case you have to
lift these off and use a little key
attachment honestly though as far as
customization options go that's probably
one you're gonna do when you first
receive it and you're done pass that
everything else you can do with your
hands
super easily now fourth what I wanna
talk about is all the extra functions
this controller has vs. pass cup designs
but there's actually quite a few first
off one of the big ones is the addition
of a fifth and sixth program will button
and pass controllers they use the four
back paddles but this one also adds its
are calling SI x buttons these little
buttons on the side here which you can
remove if you don't want to use them but
they're really easy to access the idea
is that when you're holding controller
like this and you want to hit them you
just extend this finger right here
really easy to access and just like the
back panels you can customize it to do
any of the face buttons shoulders or
touch pad another thing that's awesome
is that with this controller you can
actually remove the Rumble motors
yourself that is something
order before but you couldn't change it
on your own later with this you just
easily take off the faceplate remove the
motors BAM you either have a lighter
controller if you want it that way or if
you don't like Rumble features you can
get rid of it or put it back in when you
want it another big addition to this
controller is this area right here known
as the slide bar now this is something
that can only be used in Wired mode but
when you're in Wired mode you can use it
as an easy form of audio controls for
instance you can just simply tap it if
you want to meet your mic or you can
slide across to increase or decrease
volume and then one other kind of more
minor change but one that makes a huge
difference once you start using this
controller a lot is the addition of
anti-friction rings on the inside of all
these controllers where the sticks ago
there's a little kind of ring here that
adds extra smoothness it doesn't feel
like rubbing it to anything at all one
problem I've had with a lot of other
kind of off-brand ps4 controllers or
just any controller at all is you get
that extra resistance and friction
that's kind of uncomfortable especially
if to spin the stick a lot with this
feels like nothing at all cut to
Flanders feels like I'm wearing nothing
at all so when comparing to past cup
controllers it's pretty safe to say that
this is by far the best one unless you
really really love the traditional
PlayStation button layout this is
nothing but improvements but how does it
compare to other PlayStation pro
controller options how does it compare
to other PlayStation controller options
now when it comes to pro controller
options let ps4 there's basically two
main options aside from past scuff
controllers and those are the nikon
revolution and the razor rise ooh and
before the big strengths that scuff
controllers had over them was the
customization being able to change out
the different sticks getting the extend
triggers using the control pads so on so
forth but on the other hand with both
the ratio and revolution I found you had
a better grip design and the benefits of
a wired connection but those aren't
really unique anymore in this case the
Vantage is giving you in my opinion the
best grip out of the three now and once
again if you get the wireless model you
can switch between wireless or wired to
giving you the best of both worlds now
that being said there are still some
unique benefits the other controllers
have to offer for instance the nikon
revolution does allow you to adjust six
sensitivity which is really handy it
although you do have to connect to a PC
to use that functionality and with the
rise you you get those mechanical
buttons which are really neat but when
it comes to kind of requirements for a
good pro controller it's not super high
on the list it's kind of a nifty
function that not a lot of companies
have messed around with putting this all
together you know the revolution ride
you are still both great controllers but
in the past where I would have said oh
the ride you does this the revolution is
this scuff has this pic the little it
suits you best honestly with all the
changes the Vantage now has I'd have to
say it objectively it's the clear winner</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
