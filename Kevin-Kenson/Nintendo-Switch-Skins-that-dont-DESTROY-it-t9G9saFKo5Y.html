can customize your switch for instance
shell exchanges which are cheap and can
look really good if done properly but
that's also kind of the main issue with
them if they're done properly
I might even be stripping the screws a
little bit you have to buy a whole lot
your toolkit take apart joint columns
put them back together and there's
always the chance that in doing so you
might accidentally ruin the joint con
someway messing up one of the sensors
messing up the HT rumble or just
breaking the joy con entirely and if you
ever want to change the shell well you
have to do it all over again compounding
the risk so it can be a little scary if
you're not used to doing DIY type of
stuff and then there's paint jobs but
you can also look phenomenal if you get
the right person to do it but that's the
thing you need to contact a specialist
have someone actually take a lot more
time and effort and put into it which
can cost way more than a shell exchange
and once again it's a permanent process
so if you ever want to change that again
you either you need to spend all that
money all over again and getting a new
set of joy cons or you need to do a
shell exchange which we've already kind
of covered the worries of that freaking
plug back in now a third option that we
haven't really talked a whole lot about
yet is skins and the reason for that is
since the switch has come out the only
real options that have existed all right
they're skins that only cover like the
front part of a droidcon which I've just
never found to look really good it's not
a full body wrap or in the case of
higher quality skins like from D brand
they ran into an issue where their
adhesives were actually causing physical
damage to switches where yeah it would
look good while trapped in the skin but
if you ever want to change it or take it
off and like that you're gonna see
permanent physical damage to the switch
that just does not look good
thankfully when they discovered this
back when the switch first came out they
immediately took care of the situation
they canceled all their pre-orders they
were funded everyone their money and
they took a step back and recently they
reached out to me that they finally
fixed it
over the last year they've been working
alongside with 3m devise new adhesives
to use for the wraps that are not gonna
cause any damage to their switches which
they now guarantee and to actually kind
of show you guys they sent me a bunch
ones to showcase which look really cool
so let's take a look at these guys now
before we break down do all these
different colors that we have everywhere
all over this table let's just talk
about what the different skin options
are so first off there are two different
skins you can grab for the dock of your
system there's a faceplate one which
just changes this front faceplate and
leaves gaps for the switch logo and the
word switch and then there's an accent
skin you can get which is going to cover
those up as well and do the sides of
your dock now for the switch main body
there's a single skin you can get which
is gonna cover the entire back the
kickstand and also wrap around to the
front which I love so much that's
something that you can't do with shell
exchanges because that requires you to
actually mess with like the screen and
such it's a lot harder to do and not
really feasible so this is gonna give
you an option that's gonna not only
change the back of your switch which is
cool for showing other people but with
the front covered as well you can have
that confidence of knowing oh yeah I
have this custom color switch that I
designed with the colors I like and then
of course there are the joy cons
themselves now kind of like with a shell
replacement this is doing not only the
front but also the back there is a gap
right here because it would be too
difficult to make you know no bubbles or
cause problems with all these tiny areas
here but it covers all the important
bits of the joique on giving you that
awesome different visual color that you
want aside from the standards that
Nintendo offers and that's one of the
really cool things too is that if you
already own a set of like greyjoy cons
and you decide you really want something
in red but you want to throw down a
bunch of money for just brand new Mario
color joy cons you can get a skin for
just five bucks each one and it looks
great now as far as actual color options
go for these guys there are currently
ten different skin color options for the
switch there are seven different got a
glossy glossy there are seven glossy
colors like the red we have right here
they also do it in blue yellow green
orange purple and pink they have a
single matte option right now which is a
white which I think looks really good
and then they have two different kind of
special options which are both in black
which are a camo and a carbon fiber now
we're cool about these guys is that
they're not only just kind of a pattern
design but they actually
different texture to them as well
compared to all the solid color ones
the camo has a little bit of a roughness
to it which I kind of like and the
carbon fiber is really smooth and of
course an important part about picking
colors for your switch is not just what
your favorite colors are but something a
lot of people in doing is thematic
choices which these open up a lot more
options you normally have I mean there's
some easy ones you can do like double
red for Mario double yellow for Pikachu
double green for link or you can mix and
match some colors for slightly different
ideas like doing a red and white for
more general Pokemon aesthetic or green
and white for Yoshi now of course we
can't have all ten of these guys laying
out and not have me actually talk about
which ones are my favorite so to start
with the normal one for me is the matte
white which actually surprises myself a
little bit too I'm not normally a huge
fan of just straight white for systems
but I really like the way this one looks
especially the fact that there is no
official version of this just yet I mean
we did a shell exchange for one but that
took a lot of work this is a much more
straightforward way which still looks
really great and it's something that you
can't get through Nintendo they've been
focusing on colorful options and the
only kind of grayscale one right now is
plain gray and I think the white just
looks a lot better after that I'd have
to say being a little more cliche for
myself I love the Reds and blues I like
they're actually deeper colors and the
ones you get on the switch I'm not a
huge fan of the neon effect they have on
those ones I like the Mario red ones but
these glossy red look really good too
and I love the blue so I'm gonna put a
link down below for you guys to check
out for yourselves if you're not a fan
of the idea of doing a bunch of hard
work for the shell exchange and you
don't want to spend a bunch of money on
a paint job or buying a new set of joy
icons this is an awesome affordable way
to customize your switch just the way
you want</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
