wired controller you can grab here Xbox
one and one of the companies that has
made a lot of these controllers power a
reached out to me to try out one of
their new designs that's coming out in
just about a month's time the power a
enhanced wired controller so we're gonna
get this guy a spin and compare it to
what power is made in the past and how
this improves upon it or if there's
anything missing from it and then
compare it against my favorite cheap
controller that we tried last time from
PDP yeah oh stop wasn't really a huge
fan of some of the controllers that
power wave released before for the Xbox
one and there's two main ones that I
looked at there's this guy right here
which is kind of like the standard wired
controller they had before it's a very
plain simple one there's not any kind of
special features or anything it's just a
cheaper wired Xbox one controller but
the problem is is that when it came to
the shape and handling of it it just
wasn't very comfortable it's well those
controllers where when you pick it up
and feel it you immediately know oh
right
this is third-party it just doesn't feel
very good the buttons everything we're
fine but as far as the actual grip
design and the quality of the plastic it
just didn't have a great feel now
another one they did that's a little
fancier is this one right here which is
the power a fusion controller now the
idea behind the fusion is that it has
all kinds of additional special features
going on which some of which are cool
but that came at the expense of it also
being less comfortable still it has
these grip designs going on I think the
idea was that it makes a more grippier
for your palms but instead it just feels
awkward
however the upside to it is that it
gives the ability to change out the
sticks so you can do different designs
which was really neat and it has two
buttons on the back that you can remap
really handy so this one had some cool
functional benefits but once again it
just didn't really have the right feel
to it another problem that both of these
controllers have is that while yes of
course they are a wired controller
they're hardwired so you can't this is
just always in the controller which for
storage purposes can be kind of annoying
the balance point of this is that they
do have old-school style breakaway
cables which is kind of neat but
compared to just being able to move the
cable entirely it just kind of seems
like not the best choice so these are
all things that are addressed in the new
controller which I actually really liked
a lot more I mean you can immediately
tell just by looking at this thing that
instead of trying to go for any kind of
crazy futuristic look or something that
looks vastly different
it is much closer to the standard Xbox
one controller design really right out
of the box I could immediately tell this
guy was just a lot more comfortable than
the other Powerade controllers have used
and actually out of all the different
third-party Xbox one controllers I've
used at least on the cheaper side this
one comes the closest to feeling like
I'm just using a standard Xbox one
controller albeit one that's wired and
that is one of the immediate upsides to
compare to the other controllers is like
I said those guys were hardwired all the
time whereas this one has moved on to a
design where you have a removable
microUSB cable which is a gigantic
upgrade now it does not feature all the
additional functions that the fusion
controller had you are stuck with just
these two thumb sticks but these are at
least the kind of standard more popular
design you would use so that works at
least however it does have the two room
metal buttons on the backside right here
which you can set up with this button
right here so you're still getting that
additional feature and of the two that's
definitely the better one to have
features aside when it comes to just how
it feels using it as a controller like I
said this is the closest just feeling
like I'm using an actual Xbox one not
just because the grip design is very
very close but the button and stick
quality is all a lot better to the
buttons feel very close not the exact
same as an official Xbox but very close
to it the only part that feels a little
weak is the triggers there's an extra
kind of sense of roughness that goes on
with the spring where you really feel
the feedback a little too much once
you're getting down on it but everything
else the sticks d-pad all feel great so
out of the powering controllers this is
definitely the best one they've done so
far but the important question is is
this the actual best cheap controller
you can grab for Xbox one by the way if
you want to see some BTS to this video
or some more pictures of this guy make
sure check out my Instagram link down
below previously when we reviewed a
whole bunch of different cheap Xbox one
controllers the guys that came out as
the winner was this PDP controller right
here and a lot of reasons why I really
like this controller are actually the
same reasons why I'm starting to really
like this power a controller it doesn't
have a whole lot of fancy functions or
features or anything but it does have a
grip design that is very close to a
regular Xbox one controller so it's
really comfortable and on top of that it
has a removable cable which is awesome
now this does have one special feature
which is that it has onboard audio
controls so if you're using a headset
you can use the d-pad right here to do
things like increase your decrease your
volume or mute your
which is handy so how does this guy
compare to the power a enhanced
controller honestly they're pretty
comparable they check marker a lot of
the same boxes and that they're both
comfortable they're both very similar to
an xbox one controller and they both
have detachable cables the main thing
that really differentiates them is what
additional function they have whether
that's the onboard audio controls on the
PP controller or the remappable buttons
on the back for the power a one so that
could be the defining thing of which
version you prefer if however you just
want talk about the general covered of
them both there's very nitpicky little
differences where one beats the other
out so let's dive into that starting
with what the PDP controller has going
as far as strength school on the PDP
controller the main two areas are on the
sticks and the triggers now the sticks
are very similar at first as far as the
tension and precision movement where you
really notice the difference though is
in the grips on the stick heads which I
like a little more on the PDP controller
and when you're moving around the stick
in a circular motion you'll feel less
friction on the ring here compared to
the power a and then the triggers like I
already mentioned power raise has this
little bit of extra resistance that I
don't like the feel of when you're
pressing down on it
the bdp feels better it's still not
quite on par with using an actual Xbox
one controller but of the two this one
does have the better trigger feel on the
other hand the power a controller has
the better grip and the better buttons
now like I said they're both very
similar to an actual Xbox one controller
as far as how they feel but the PDP
design has this sort of flat edge on the
inner part here which feels a little
uncomfortable to me whereas the power a1
it's a curved surface that feels much
better now as for the buttons the PD
piece is a bad habit of feeling like
they're sticking a little bit whereas
the ABXY on here feels much closer to an
official controller and in fact probably
has the best feeling buttons out of all
the third-party ones I've used at the
end of the day these are both good cheap
controllers you can grab for Xbox one or
even for using on PC but when push comes
to shove if I have to pick one of them I
think I'm gonna have to give the win to
the power rate controller now the BTB
one is still a solid one you can grab
today but the power a one when it comes
out it's gonna offer the better grips it
has better button feel and why Lombard
audio controls are cool I definitely
like having the remap of buttons right
here more so like I said this guy is not
out yet it's coming out in about a month
we'll
the link down below so you guys can
check it out and I'll see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
