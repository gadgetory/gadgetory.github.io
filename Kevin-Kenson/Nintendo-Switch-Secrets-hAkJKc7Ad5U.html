the switch has been out for over a year
now and whether you've had one for the
launch day or you just picked one up
there might be some handy little tricks
about the system that you don't know
about so let's talk five handy tips for
your Nintendo switch first up now you
may realize that the joy con is just a
Bluetooth controller and in fact there
are products out there that allow you to
do things like hook up a joy con to
other devices using USB there's other
items that allow you to use different
Bluetooth stuff with a switch but when
it comes just the stroke on itself you
can actually just sync this to other
Bluetooth devices on its own really
simply all you got to do is make sure
it's disconnected from your switch hit
and hold the sync button and then just
do whatever setup so necessary on the
item you're using like a MacBook or a PC
to hook it up you might have take a
couple of extra few steps just to
configure properly once you get it
running it's just a really simple
controller you can use so let's check it
out
well actually the best part is to player
but I'm by myself right now
next let's talk something not functional
at all but it is like a cool little
easter egg that also just have that I
had no idea about until I started
researching stuff for this video if you
go to the lock screen we've all seen it
right you turn your switch on hit a
button multiple times makes a little
click noise whatever however certain
buttons make different sounds most time
we're getting it a little basic click
but other times I have no idea what else
to say for this segment secrets by the
way if you're curious about the Pikachu
drug concert going on here we actually
picked these up from Etsy for another
video we did recently if you've missed
out you definitely like check it out it
was a Pokemon snap station switch setup
which took a little bit of work and
maybe had a few problems but looked
really amazing if you missed it make
sure to check it out next up is a super
handy trick for those of you that are
these sole users of your switch you know
of anyone else using it something that's
really annoying and I don't know why
this is even a setting and not just
something that the switch automatically
does but you may notice that even when
you're the only user on a switch and
every time you start up a game it asks
you to pick a user as though it's a
really difficult choice to make there's
just the one so if you actually go into
the settings there's a way to turn this
off by going to the user page and then
selecting to skip user select this
option will only show up if you're the
sole user of the switch because if you
have multiple users registered how are
other people supposed to be able to
actually pick their profiles now joy
cons are awesome little portable
controllers so one of the downsides of
their small size and portability is that
well you can lose them they could be
deep in a bag fold between some couch
cushions all kinds of stuff and
thankfully Nintendo does have a way you
can fix this inside the switch itself
you can actually go to the pairing menu
and there's a section called fine
controllers when you go in this you'll
see a list of all the different joy
konzi you've had it synced to this
switch once you do that you select the
one you're missing and if you're close
enough you should be able to hit a
button and have it vibrate so that you
can hear it
and track it down and in fact we're
gonna demonstrate this because the guys
in the office actually hit a joke on
somewhere up here that I now need to
find so let's go ahead find controllers
I want to find this guy
okay I definitely hear it
we're here
yeah it's either
is it like in the ground back here you
gonna like pull the couch out No
oh there it is hey so yeah that
definitely works all you've to do is
just hold down the button and it'll
vibrate so super handy so if you know
anyone who's like me and loses things
constantly definitely sure to share this
video so that they can know this method
track down their joy cons cuz you do not
want to lose one of these fifty bucks a
pop next up for those of you who
actually show the statistics of what
you've been playing on your switch there
actually is an activity log that's
pretty missable depending on how you use
it if you don't really ever check your
profile page much if you don't mess with
friends if you just spend a lot of time
in single-player games you're gonna miss
out on this and all you have to do is
actually go to this little profile page
in the upper left hand corner click on
the profile you want to check on and
instead of going to friends list ring
like that just go over to your main
profile right here and below you'll see
the list of everything you've been
playing it's organized in the order of
most recently played and it'll list
either a specific time or at least a
good approximate measurement of how much
time you spend whether that's just a few
hours an indie game twenty or more hours
in Supra Odyssey or over a hundred hours
in Zelda secrets</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
