When it comes to weird controllers,
PlayStation has got to have
the greatest library of strange designs.
Because we've already covered a lot
and there are still a lot more to do.
One great one that we've just picked up,
is the ZEROTECH 2 controller for the PS2.
Now some of you might be
looking at this controller
wondering what could this
possibly be used for?
But it's actually based
around a kind of familiar
concept if you've ever
played with RC cars as a kid,
it's straight up an RC styled controller
meant for racing games on the PlayStation.
Now this is actually very
reminiscent of another
strange controller design
we've talked about in the past
which was the Namco NeGcon
which was originally designed
for a tanking game in
mind but end up getting
adopted by a lot of racing game fans
'cause it ended up being a really cool
intuitive way to play racing games
where it felt like a regular controller
but then you would twist the mid-section
to act like moving left or
right on a steering wheel.
And this ends of following a
very similar kind of design
where using this little knob right here,
turning this forward or backwards
acts like going right or left.
And it features all of
the additional buttons
that you would need for
any kind of side features
for the triangle, circle, L1, R1,
directional pads on the D-pad.
These two right here act
as the X and square button
because on PlayStation 1 and
PlayStation 2 racing games,
these would be used for acceleration.
And then, this little tab right here
could act as either the R2 and L2
or the L1 and R1 depending on what games
you'd use for shifting up or down.
So when you wanna shift in the game,
you'd use this tab right here.
Now this is actually
one of two color designs
that are already released
for the ZEROTECH 2.
As you can see, it's primarily red
with a little bit of black and yellow trim
and white for the buttons.
The other option they made
was a more all blackout design
which replaced all the
red here with black,
instead of yellow, you
had red accents here
and still had white buttons.
So like the NeGcon, the main point
of the ZEROTECH 2 controller was to
give you a way to control racing games
in a manner that felt
a little more natural
but added a more affordable pricepoint
than having to buy a full
blown steering wheel.
Because while that's cool to use,
it's a little excessive for some people.
So if you wanted something to just plug
directly into your system and was a more
traditional kind of controller feel,
but was also designed for
racing games specifically,
that's the niche they were trying to fill.
Now whether or not this
actually accomplished this job
let's hook it up and actually
play something to find out.
Before moving on, I want to take a second
to thank Dollar Shave Club
for sponsoring today's video.
Now I know what some of you are thinking,
you have a beard, why do
you need shaving supplies?
Well, if you've been watching
our videos for a while,
you know that I ended up having kind of
a mountain man face for a little bit
and I didn't really care for that.
So it's important for me
to trim and shape my beard
and that's where Dollar
Shave Club comes in handy.
And they do more than
just shaving supplies.
They also have shampoo,
deodorant, toothpaste and more
and right now they have a great deal
where you can get their shower shave
or oral starter kit for
just five bucks each.
Everything ships directly to your home
and the more you buy the more you save.
So make sure to go to
DollarShaveClub.com/KevinKenson
to get your first starter
set for just five bucks.
So like with other times we've demoed
older school controllers,
we're gonna hook this up
to our PS4 adapter and
play something on PS4.
In this case, Gran Turismo and hopefully
this is gonna go smoother
than when we used
that hand controller
thing which, you know,
(laughing) this is actually
made for racing games.
So let's try it out.
So one of the things to
make sure this controller
works on modern game is we have to set the
controls for moving X and
square for accelerate and break
instead of the shoulder buttons
like a lot of modern games use
'cause that's how it worked a
lot on the PS1 and PS2 titles.
Thankfully, Gran Turismo has that
as a baked in profile setting
so we just did that and we're good to go.
So in other news, how the
actual turning mechanic is
is good and bad.
I actually like the way this feels.
If you've ever driven like an
old RC car when you were a kid
this is exactly what that's like.
It just feels like it's a
bit too shallow of motion.
Like I wanna turn it further
than it's letting me.
And in fact, I don't
think it's even reading
as the full extent of how far
you can push the left and right stick?
Yeah, I feel like I should be able to turn
a little harder than
what it's letting me do.
It's only going maybe
45 degrees, if that?
When I feel like it
should be a lot further.
It's just a very small window
of how much I can turn it.
But really, that aside this is,
actually kind of natural.
I also need to remember to shift up,
I keep forgetting that's
an option. (laughing)
It's like why am I not going faster?
Yeah, I gotta say, in the past
of other weird controllers we've tried,
this is a slightly more,
emphasis on slightly,
slightly more successful example
of how a controller like this
could work on a modern system.
It actually makes me really curious on
if we actually saw more attempts to do
alternative ways of making
specialized controllers
for certain games instead of
just straight up racing wheels.
'Cause racing wheels are cool,
but for something that's
a little more low key,
smaller and maybe a little easier
for people that don't
wanna have a full set up,
this is kind of cool.
Either the motor in
this is just really old
and not working as
intended or it's designed
to kind of sound like an old car engine.
Which is kinda cool if that's the case.
I don't think that's what happened though.
I mean, I finished a race.
That's more than I can say that I used
for the glove controller
'cause that was a mess.
Something that's interesting
about this controller as well
is that the steering wheel
actually gives it the option
to change it from reading left and right
to doing up and down for the left stick
which I'm not sure how many situations
where that's directly useful?
I could see certain flight
simulators and things using that
but then those are also situations
where you wanna be able to
do up, down, left and right
all at the same time and not
switching between them a lot.
So it's cool that the option's there.
I'm just not sure when
that would really come up.
You know, I think if I
actually took the time
learning with this controller,
I could maybe get good at this?
Like, actually doing well in races,
not just you know, (laughing)
finishing them with it.
The only thing I'm worried about is again
that range of motion just
feels a little too shallow?
But maybe that's just me being bad.
I could just be bad.
Another interesting choice
with this controller too
is the materials that they used.
You'll notice that on the
handgrip that I'm using,
it's actually rubber which
doesn't age super great
so it feels a little awkward now.
But the turning mechanism right here,
it's made out of some kind of hard foam
which has just a little bit of give to it.
I actually think it's kind
of comfortable to use.
I actually like this better than if it was
like a really hard plastic,
I think it would wear down
on my fingers a lot faster 'cause I'm,
especially 'cause I'm gripping
this thing on some turns.
A unique opportunity that comes up
while talking about the ZEROTECH 2
is that I can actually compare
it to other controllers
that were trying to do the same thing
and see which one actually
did a better job of doing it.
Because what might be a
strange looking controller
at first glance, it
really is a functional,
specialized designed controller
that's just meant to work
for one kind of game, racing games!
Anything else and yeah,
it's gonna be a mess to use.
But that's the point.
It's meant to work for one kind of game.
It's not just simply weird
for the sake of weird
like the slime controller even
though I love him so much.
Another interesting thing is that
like in the demo we were just doing,
there are adapters out
there that will let you use
old school controllers on modern systems.
And so are these actually even worth
still using for some games?
And I think the answer is, kinda yeah.
So in the case of racing games,
we have the argument of
which is better to use?
The ZEROTECH 2 or the NeGcon?
And they both have their own
unique aspects and strengths.
I think the NeGcon is something that feels
just a little more natural for people,
whereas the ZEROTECH 2 does
feature a lot more buttons
which, back in the day,
didn't necessarily matter
quite so much 'cause most
games really just had
accelerate, break, maybe
changing your view point?
But nowadays, racers require
a lot more additional buttons
for different features which you might
not be able to do with the NeGcon.
With that said, honestly, I kinda think
the NeGcon's the better choice
even with using on a modern game.
Sure, if there is a title that needs
all these additional buttons
then yeah, that sucks.
You're not gonna be able to use it.
But in anything where you only need
a handful of buttons to work with,
I honestly cannot get over how
strangely intuitive the NeGcon is.
It is the weirdest
controller to show someone
to be like, yeah this is
great for racing games
and they'll just look at you like,
what are you talking
about, that looks insane.
But it really does work.
The ZEROTECH 2 by
comparison, yeah it does make
a certain degree of more sense.
Especially if you've
ever messed with RC cars
but the limited range motion
on the turning mechanism
just doesn't feel quite as right.
Now I realize this is a little crazy
'cause I'm doing a comparison video
on two controllers that
are about 20 years old
but honestly, I really
miss designs like this
being something that companies went for.
When you look at modern
controller designs,
so many of them are either
just the catch all design
that you see that's normal for a Xbox One
or PS4 controller or something
that's super specialized
and over the top like a
full steering wheel set up
which is cool but there's this
kind of interesting midpoint
that some companies mess with a little bit
but none of them do it
in an interesting way
like these controllers did.
And it's something I think we're missing.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
