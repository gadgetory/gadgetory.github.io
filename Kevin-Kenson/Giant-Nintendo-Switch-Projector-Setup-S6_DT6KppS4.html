(techno melodic music)
- This is how playing
with friends used to be.
A lot of fun, a little cozy,
but honestly, pretty cramped.
Nowadays, the TVs have
gotten bigger, and nicer.
But thanks today's sponsored ViewSonic,
I think we can do even better.
(bright upbeat music)
At it's roots, gaming has
always been simultaneously
both a very social and also
very personal activity.
On the social spectrum,
it's all about community.
Whether that's in the old school days,
where people would take
turns at an arcade,
trying to one-up each other's high scores,
going to head-to-head into a fighting game
at your friend's house,
or even just being online,
participating in a 100 man,
free-for-all battle royale game.
At the same time though,
it's also very personal,
because it's all based on this idea
of being immersed in something else,
getting to the point where,
really, you lose track
of the real world, for better or worse.
But you're experiencing
these other worlds,
soaking in all of these other stories,
and just being drawn
into these experiences.
These two concepts,
community and immersion,
are two of the most
important building blocks
when it comes to gaming,
and when you wanna try and get the most
out of both of those,
I think there's one, very
singular, important answer.
We need the biggest screen possible.
And that's what brings us to ViewSonic.
They reached out to us to take a look
at some of their newest projectors,
which look really cool,
and be great for a gaming set-up.
But the problem is we've
done gaming set-ups
with projectors before, you know?
We really need to do something
even bigger and better.
Two projectors.
And now is the perfect
time to try out this idea,
thanks to the release of Super Smash Bros,
one of the few games left
that really pushes the home
multi-player experience.
Before we get to actually putting
this whole set-up together
though, let's take a look
at the actual projectors we'll be using.
These are the PX706HDs from ViewSonic.
These projectors are perfect for gaming,
thanks to an ultra-low input
latency of 16 milliseconds,
way below any TV you'll be using,
and also offer full HD 3D compatibility,
and work great during the
day, with 3,000 Lumens.
We've been trying it out in our room,
and office during the
day, and it looks great.
With a contrast ratio of 22,000 to one,
you're gonna have nice, deep blacks,
and thanks to Sonic expert technology,
you're gonna get fully immersive sound.
And to top all this off,
it has a Gaming mode to get you the most
out of your console or gaming PC,
and it's future-proofed with USB Type-C.
It is a short throw projector,
so with only a few feet of space
between it in the wall,
you can still get an
image up to 100 inches,
and it has a Zoom feature,
so you can adjust the size of the picture
without moving the projector itself.
So we have our two projectors,
but in order to make this
work for a gaming console,
we need to use something
else called a video wall box.
This allows us to plug our switch into it,
and it's gonna take the
video signal from that,
and split it into multiple parts,
and feed them to the projectors.
If you've ever been to a restaurant,
where you see a sports
game across four giant TVs,
that's what they're using to do this.
Now, it take a little time and patience,
to tie up the projectors just right,
to meet together to
create one gigantic image,
but once you get it, you have
this huge screen to play with,
which for Smash, is utterly insane,
especially with a group of friends,
'cause you can all just sit down,
and see a whole wall covered by the game.
Because we are taking a video signal
meant for a single screen,
and we're splitting it
across two, lengthwise,
it is stretching the
image out a little bit.
You might notice the aspect
ratio is not quite right,
but, it honestly looks fine,
and it's tons of fun, really.
Don't worry bout it.
It's awesome.
Keep in mind that if
you're using a gaming PC,
it'll actually display just
two images, like two monitors.
So that'll work perfectly.
And if you wanna make a
gaming console even better,
just double up the projectors,
for an even more ridiculously huge image.
For PC games, this is gonna
give you that experience
like having an ultra-wide monitor,
where you're getting even
bigger field of view,
and just really sucks you in
to whatever you're playing.
Anyways, that's enough
of all the technical
jargon, and explanations.
Let's play some Smash.
(dark epic music)
I'm gonna be honest with you guys,
after playing Smash on a setup like this,
it's kinda difficult to
go back to just playing
on the Switch screen, or on a regular TV.
Because, just the massive scale of it,
makes everything more hectic
and just so much fun to play.
If you're looking to do
a projector gaming setup,
these are awesome ones to take a look at.
We're gonna have a link down below,
if you wanna check 'em out,
and we'll see you guys later.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
