release we also get one of the most
interesting collector's editions I think
I have ever unboxed and that's the
fallout 4 pip-boy edition now one of the
things I really appreciate about this
collector's edition is how steeped it is
in the fallout theme even the container
itself sports all kinds of little
warnings and references to the universe
such as not containing any radioactive
materials opening the container up it's
a pretty straightforward unboxing right
there at the top is the steelbook case
for Fallout 4 containing not only the
game itself but also a download code for
Fallout 3 and underneath that is I think
one of the other little things that
really shows how much detail they put in
this collector's edition the instruction
manual for the pip-boy which is all
written in universe so the entire thing
is filled with diagrams charts art and
is written as though it was something
you had in the actual Fallout universe
which i think is absolutely freakin
awesome
putting this stuff aside and removing
plastic barrier we get to the really the
one item that comes with this special
edition the Pip Boy this is a replica of
the pitfall you use and fallout 4 it
also comes with a nice little stand so
you can show it off on your shelf like a
statue like most collector's editions
but what makes this truly interesting is
that if you have the right kind of phone
this is an actual functioning wearable
you just open up the pip-boy find the
right little casings and shells to fit
your phone into it
download the Pip Boy app and bam you
have a fully functioning replica of Pip
Boy with this you can enter a demo mode
to just look through all the different
menus and it acts like it does in the
game but if you actually sync it to your
fallout 4 game it'll have all the
information that you have while playing
you can look through your actual
inventory you can look at your actual
stats you can look at the map you can
even play all the different little mini
games you discover while playing through
fallout 4 because well a lot of other
collector's editions tend to focus on
giving you all kinds of show-off type
stuff like oh here's a statue here's a
poster here's lots of little pieces of
paper or things on it this is just a
focused awesome item that is not only
something you can show off but is
actually in a way completely functional
for 120 bucks this thing is completely
worth it especially when you consider
that 60 that is going towards the game
itself so the other 60 is getting you
that pip-boy that hard steel case and if
you somehow missed out on it a digital
copy of fallout 3
so that was my unbox
the fallout for pip-boy edition if you
want to grab a regular copy of the game
because this thing is pretty much
impossible to find go ahead and check

out on any future videos until next time
