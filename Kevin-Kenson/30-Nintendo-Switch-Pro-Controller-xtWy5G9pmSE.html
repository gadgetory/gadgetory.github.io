traditional controller
experience one the Nintendo Switch,
the only official way
to do it since launch
has been to use the
Nintendo pro controller,
that is at least, until now with
the release of the Hori pad.
This is an officially licensed controller
for the Switch, from Hori, which is meant
to be a cheaper alternative
to the pro controller,
costing only $30, versus
the pro controller's 70.
The obvious drawbacks being that it's
a wired controller, and
is stripped of a few
of the major functions such as,
having a built in NFC
reader, motion controls,
or even having HD rumble.
Now these are not the only significant
differences between the Hori pad
and the Switch pro controller.
One of the most noticeable things,
is what exactly is going on
with this D pad right here?
I mean, at the least, it's very odd,
at the most, maybe uncomfortable.
But, it actually makes a lot
of sense when you realize...
That it's detachable,
so this actually gives
you two different ways to use the D pad,
you can either have a
button set up like this,
similar to what's on the Switch Joy Cons,
which is a little odd to use at first,
I mean, it's weird that it's recessed,
but it's not deep enough to
actually be uncomfortable,
it just takes a little
getting used to, or...
you can have a traditional D pad set up,
which I actually like
this D pad a lot more
than the one on the pro controller.
It's larger, it's easier to roll,
and easier to hit one specific direction,
where as the pro controller's
is a little too small,
so you can accidentally do diagonals,
and mess up your game play.
Plus, when you're not using the D pad,
you might be wondering
where you can store it.
It's actually right on the back.
So, really easy not to lose, really easy
switch back and forth,
awesome little design.
Aside from that, there
really aren't that many other
huge differences between
this and the pro controller.
Just a few little subtle things.
For instance, when you
have them side by side,
you'll see that the button layout
is pretty much the same,
the only major difference
is that on the Hori
pad, the plus and minus
buttons are a little more further in,
so you have to reach a
little bit more for them,
tiny bit annoying, but
considering these buttons
are normally just for things like pausing,
or using menus, not a very big deal.
The Hori pad is also a
slightly larger controller,
so if you're someone with bigger hands,
you might find it a
little more comfortable.
It's not huge, it's not
drastic, but, little bigger.
Aside from that though, everything else
is really, really minor,
the button quality
is basically the same, the pro controller
might be slightly better,
but it's not very noticeable.
And the Hori pad is also
a lighter controller,
since it's missing so many of
those additional functions,
which is a little bothersome to me,
I like having a little
heft to my controller,
but it's not a deal breaker.
Now as I've said there
are a lot of functions
and features that the pro controller has
that are stripped from the Hori pad,
but the Hori pad does have one feature
that the original pro
controller does not have.
And that's a good old
fashioned turbo button.
- [Announcer] Turbo A.
- That's a go.
- [Announcer] Turbo B
- Yeah!
- Admittedly, the number
of games that benefit
from feature like this, are a lot lower
than they used to be
back with say, the SNES,
but you're certainly
gonna find some situations
where being able to just rapidly tap
a button as fast as possible is gonna
be really useful, and
possibly borderline cheating,
depending on the game,
and it's really simple
to use, all you gotta do
is hit the turbo button
at the same time as whatever button
you wanna use repeatedly, and bam,
now it's just being mashed like crazy,
to turn it off, just do
the same thing again.
Now I also wanna take a
moment to talk a little
more about the fact that
this is a wired controller.
Now, for some of you out there,
the fact that this is wired means
that it is an immediate no buy,
but for those of you
that are a little more
on the fence about it,
I can say that this does
come with a 10 foot long cable,
which is more than enough reach
for a lot of different set ups.
For some it might be testing
the limits a little bit too much,
or it might not be enough, but for
most modern setups, 10
feet is plenty of reach.
There's also the fact that this uses
a USB A connector, which,
obviously the switch itself
does not have, it only has a USB C.
So, you could actually only use this
with the dock set up,
and if you wanna use it
in portable mode, you're out of luck,
expect for the fact
that we actually tested
this with a USB A to USB
C adapter, and it worked.
You just have to also deal with the fact
that to access that port,
you're gonna need a stand,
or something for the
switch to be sitting on,
so all of a sudden,
this purchase went from
being a $30 controller,
to costing a lot more,
'cause you had to buy a
stand and adapter separately,
but if you have those as well,
gives you a lot more use out of it.
So, is the Hori pad
worth grabbing compared
to the original pro controller, maybe.
I mean, it is cheaper, but it does have
its obvious drawbacks,
some of you are just not
gonna wanna deal with
the wired connection,
it is a lot harder to use
with a portable set up,
I mean, you can do it,
but a wireless controller
is just much better suited to that.
And it is missing some of the functions
of the pro controller, but a lot of those
can also be ignored, I mean, NFC reader,
just use a Joy Con, not a big deal.
Motion controls, I never
use motion controls
with a classic controller,
some of you might,
and if you do, that's
a reason not to get it,
but for me, not a big deal.
No rumble feature, that's
actually a problem,
I do wish this thing had rumble,
so that is something that I miss,
but it's still not a big deal breaker.
I mean, to be honest, if
you're the kind of person
that just plays things in docked mode,
and you don't mind having a cable,
for 30 bucks, this thing is amazing,
and an absolute no brainer.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
