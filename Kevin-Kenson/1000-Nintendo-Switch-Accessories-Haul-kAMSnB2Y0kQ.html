different a day we went out and bought a
bunch of Nintendo switch stuff over at
Best Buy and Target totaling a thousand
dollars and we're gonna go through each
and every single item and just see how
much of our money was actually well
spent
now before we start sorting through all
the stuff we picked up you're probably
wondering what the bins are about so we
have our Halloween inspired treat bin
which is for anything that we think is
kind of cool we're the money worth
grabbing that's gonna go in there Trash
Can speaks for itself now to be honest I
am awful with hand-eye coordination I
cannot throw things at all so I'm pretty
sure nothing I throw is gonna actually
make it either bin but you'll get the
idea as I throw in each general
direction yeah all right so we're
actually starting with something that
we've done before kind of at least this
is a different color for the Horry
joique on with the d-pad now we did a
video on these Zelda one which I thought
was really really nice but they have
another color that's this Mario one
that's kind of all over the place
actually I feel like this is all the one
had like a really consistent theme and
like cool look to it this one kinda like
looks like they just put a print over it
that doesn't make a whole lot of sense
it's just a lot of words I don't I think
this table looks a lot better to be
honest and also I mean if you've seen
our video on this guy I think doing a
shell exchange is just a better idea but
if you're gonna grab one of these I
think go the Zelda route I think we have
our first Hey ooh shiny okay so this is
one of the power a wired controllers but
they always have the detachable cable so
doesn't look wired at first glance but I
didn't actually know these existed until
we were at Target and if they have like
a chrome series I can open it where's
the so they had a couple years from
chrome designs we debated on which one I
wanted to grab I really liked this one
like I love Zelda and Mario and sending
their options that were out there but
the Metroid one the red just looked
really nice and I liked the gold trim
with it I've talked about the power a
wired controller before I think they're
a really good choice if you just want a
cheaper more affordable wired controller
and these just make them even prettier
it actually actually really like the way
that kind of gloss feels on it this
chrome finish yeah you know I think
there are some wireless options out
there that are better if you're willing
to spend more money but at the price
point these are pretty good I think
we're gonna start on the treatment for
this guy
next awesome
so cheating a little bit this
technically isn't switch exclusive but I
picked up Starling on the switch because
why wouldn't I I love Star Fox and
that's really what I'm treating this
game as but you know what I wanted to
have at least a couple other ship
options so we grabbed this one right
here this is the LAN strip so this set
right here you're getting a new ship one
new weapon and one new pilot which gives
you a different ability while you're
playing the game I think it also alters
the story a little bit which person
you're playing as yeah that's actually
really cool I'm gonna be honest I'm
probably still sticking with the arwing
because once again it's a starfox team
as far as I'm concerned but I really
love the detailing I put all these toys
I think the price is maybe just a little
higher that I think is worth it but you
know getting at least one more ship set
I think is a good call so that's a
keeper that's a good one
alright so not to make a bad pun but I'm
a little late to the party on this one
so we also picked up Super Mario Party
while we're at it I haven't played yet
I'm not gonna take the time to figure
out how I feel about it right now but I
got a good feeling we're just gonna put
that in a good bin oh these things so
these are battery extenders for your joy
cons so if you're tired of your drug
cons running out of power all the time
this is a way to give them kind of like
an extra backup power supply or you're
just loading them up with doublea's I've
never had this problem joy cons are
really good on battery life is really
easy to charge them because you just put
them on the dock if you own a ton of joy
cons you're changing constantly I guess
that could be an issue but I feel like a
charger stand is just a better
investment at that point I think I'm
just not a big fan of these I don't
think you really need them and they just
make the grip even more comfortable
because there's bulks them up I'm not
yeah this is this isn't this bin our
first Miss ooh so we just did a video on
these recently this is the power a
wireless controller they just released
it's not quite as cheap compared to the
wired one you're almost paying the same
price is like a switch Pro wireless
controller but these ones have a couple
of changes I really love the buttons on
the back
and the fact that runs of double-a
batteries can actually kind of be a
benefit depending on your personal
preference
honestly main reason to pick this one up
is when we did that video we picked up
every color the store had which didn't
include this one and this is actually
the one I really wanted so I really
think this one's beautiful if you can
find if you want to get the power a
wireless controller this is the best
design right now in my opinion I love
this guy this is dang awesome okay now I
think we did this is what I think we did
a long time back power aides of their
own version of a bag four switches yes
so this is a cases to be able to carry
your switch there's a little extra pouch
right here and then a lot of room to do
things like the dog additional
controllers all kinds of cables pretty
good convenient solution it's a little
bigger than some other bag options out
there but if you want room and to not
feel like it's just all packed tightly
this is cool I'm actually really liked
the idea here of turning the design in
just old-school Mario especially with
having like the undergrad level beneath
it that's cool I like that this is gonna
fit in that bin so I'm just gonna go
past it all right our first not really
switch thing it's I'll light up mushroom
I'm willing to bet this is batteries not
included
I didn't even check ok you know what
batteries not included you go in this
bin next a hybrid cover now we've
covered this before I think a long time
ago because this is one of the earlier
accessories they didn't switch but with
that one we got this like nice Zelda
leather cover one which I really like
this is kind of a simpler design they
have yes so the benefit to these cases
is really easy to slot your switch into
it and it gives you honestly the main
benefit of it a much better kickstand
solution because this is gonna give you
a better way to set it up it's gonna add
a little protection to your switch while
stevia is still giving you a way to see
the switch a big complaint I've seen
from a lot of people about these is they
don't like the fact that you can't keep
this on the switch and dock it at the
same time which I mean it's adds a whole
lot of size to it personally it never
bothered me you know as long as you can
just easily slot in slot out not a big
deal I will say though I think this is
all the ones cooler so yeah you're going
to hear still wired Internet LAN adapter
this was something a lot of people were
kind of excited about at lunch when it
was announced I don't
I'm gonna be honest I don't go online
quite as often as I should for some of
the multiplayer games but I've never had
a big innovation where I'm like you know
what I need
wired land and after for the fast
internet possible and the thing is to it
30 bucks I feel like I shouldn't be
spending 30 bucks on this it just it's
hard for me to just fire myself I'm yeah
we're here next rich I feel like giving
me a back to back of all the worst in
this group we would have some good soon
megalo blocks but for Pokemon no I'm
already seeing a few moving parts we're
good we're good
this is awesome and here something looks
good so these are the Astro eight ends
but it is a branded one for the switch
that features a Zell design which looks
really awesome let's check it out
it depends on what they're doing
specifically but the whole black and
gold design the started getting so Stu
is Elda I thought always look really
good and I really like its handle here I
don't know if you can see from this
distance but like the headset actually
has a little patterning on the back
that's really heavy in breadth of the
wild at the Zelda logo on one side the
cheek symbol on the other Stephanie -
Mike yeah it's actually really
good-looking as far as like getting it
over your headset like a major branded
one this is I think a good way to go
over switch especially glozell stuff I
like it by the way if you're waiting for
the switch were using in today's video
which have this awesome white finish
this is actually a skin that was made by
today's sponsor D brand they have a
whole line of switch skins that are
completely safe to use you can get in
for the switch body itself the Joye cons
or even the dock and they come in a
large variety of colors but you can also
get a nice clean white or even some
special designs like this black carbon
fiber if you're interested in grabbing
any just check out the link down below
in the description okay next we have
wheels oh this is definitely one things
we got from Best Buy because they had
all insignia stuff I think is that their
brand doesn't signe on buy them yeah
that's why you'd like you notice there's
not as much stuff from Power NPDB over
there but insignia is everywhere like
they just have a couple controllers for
the other competitors and it's a wheel
okay look I'm not a huge fan of wheels
for the Droid calls because I feel like
you can just pull the drink on sideways
and you're good and it's such a tiny
awkward wheel anyways I think they're
fun for kids though and I will say that
the pals here are better than the ones
on the official Nintendo one so if
you're gonna go with this route I'm just
kinda like these so well we'll keep them
I'm not gonna throw
on it but you can go miss okay power
pack so this is another charger option
for your switch
well what's finishing with this one it's
actually a little adapter one that you
can use in your car as well now if this
one goes in this bin alright
this was interesting to me because this
is a hard case I've seen lots of
different carrying cases for the switch
I probably own too many carrying cases
for the switch but this is a brand style
that actually I totally missed who makes
this one
Hori alright so what's different is
mostly their cases that are out there
are very soft if they are hard they have
kind of just like a harder layer of
plastic and still soft at the base this
is actually like a tough plastic which
it's kind of cool it looks a little
smaller though let's see what can we fit
in here so it's not as much room as some
of the other cases that are out there it
looks like it's just enough for the
switch itself and then a couple of games
you're not really gonna comfortably fit
the charger other things in here just
because the charge base is as big as it
is but you know for just the games and
the joint or just the games and the
system itself I kind of like this I like
the color design I like the interior a
lot yeah definitely if you're not the
one if you're not that kind of person
almost to carry around like all of your
accessory for your switch I think this
is a good pick up it's a good simple one
anyway this one's a little too festive
for me though let's check it out
how'd it look guys rich yeah like it
should keep it off or there's the video
or at least until if we have another one
yeah alright it's staying on hey be
richer
alright we got another insignia thing
this is a doc kit now I know there's
always the fears of third party Doc's
after what happened with the switch
five-point update I think that's been
mostly resolved but I don't even know if
I want to test this I'm scared a little
portable doc for playing on your TV at
home or on the go yeah it's not really
that much more portable I mean it is
smaller than the switch one but not by
that large of a margin I do like though
that it doesn't have the front plate at
least so your sparing your switch any
potential scratching on the screen still
though I if you're gonna risk their
party box I think they're stronger
options out there let's yeah
all right
armored case the shell for the switch
itself is a hard plastic and honestly
not a super strong feeling one I'm not
feeling so far guys but let's look at
the droidcon it's because the joint cons
are a little weird because this is not a
hard plastic this is more like a kind of
silicon
just a little more rubbery which is
actually a good thing for at least
protecting a joint con because wants
them that can absorb impact and not just
carry it through if you like the idea
I'd like a protective gel cover I do
appreciate these ones are clear instead
of just giving you a whole nother color
that way you can show off what joy cons
you have and if you're ever using any
kind of like other designs or anything
this will help protect it a little bit
at least this one's weird I actually do
I was unsure at first but I actually do
like these gel guards I don't like this
main body so we're gonna go ahead and
just split this item up it's worth it
for these not for those and you can
really find these and learn for cheaper
actually all right we got wall art look
at me else with you guys I'd mix fiends
about this one
I like having little pieces of art and I
love old-school Pixley stuff but at the
same time I feel like there are certain
8-bit images that should not have been
blown up and this is one of them I don't
know a little weird alright okay so we
actually did a video recently talking
about a whole bunch of grip designs but
I did not see this one because this is a
Best Buy thing specifically so let's see
how this one kind of stacks up against
the ones I'm used to using you know I
think I still like the skull and come on
a little better but I wouldn't I
wouldn't hate this one I like this
little lightweight I dig the different
grip design I like that it's actually a
little softer it's not my top favorite
but I think I think there's actually
worth it I think this is not a bad grip
ah Deluxe traveller case yeah you know
it's not the most stylish case it's kind
of a weird balance of being you know Oh
quite a bit bigger than some of the
small portable ones but not the same
kind of convenience factor of like an
actual full bag with a strap
but it's a good mid point if you want
protection and being able to carry
everything compactly this is actually I
think a good one for like well as the
name would imply travel if you're doing
traveling this is gonna take up not a
ton of space in your trunk and carry all
your switch stuff keeping it protected
like it we're gonna go with people all
right Power Core so I have messed with
this battery but not this specific one
this is anchors portable battery that
the main point of it I mean it's a
portable battery it works for anything
not just switch but the specific one is
designed to work for how the switch
likes to charge is giving you the most
efficient way to recharge your switch I
really like this battery I've been using
the samal one still repeatedly and this
is just a higher capacity version of it
so I'm upgrading to this now all right
we have another case if I open this one
first I might have put in the good bin
but I think the Mauryan one it's just a
straight-up better version of this I
like the material better I think it's
maybe more protection if you're gonna go
for a case this small I would rather
have that extra layer defense then
making it stealth yeah that's all right
next all right a plush throw whenever we
get something like this it ends up being
used a bunch at least we're Instagram or
like being in you know just the
background this is really soft I'm not
sure how much we paid for it but you
know what I'm gonna go ahead and say it
was worth it all right more headphones
so these are the HyperX cloud earbuds
like I'm not gonna lie when I'm gaming I
generally prefer over here but if I
wanted in ears especially if I was just
like out and about and not wanting to
have you know a giant headphone
apparatus on my head yeah all right I
take these charging stand there's a lot
of charging stand options out there and
there are ones cheaper than this but you
know what doing for at once and spinning
is pretty cool the only downside to it
compared a lot of other options out
there is that there's no way to just
like put a pro controller directly on it
and kind of middle the road on this guys
I can't decide the this one all right
another case is the slim pouch from
Horry this one is even slimmer than some
old ruling yet earlier but that's the
entire point so I'm giving you a ton of
protection you're really not fitting
anything in here other than the switch
itself okay yeah I think I would still
personally prefer one of the bigger
cases but if you wanted like the
lightest weight option out there this is
this isn't bad for it
okay it's a notebook covered in Pokemon
you have to keep another baby it's a
little snug all right next up we have a
grip which company makes us of them oh
it's the power one I really like the
Powerade grips actually I've talked
about this a little bit before you see
my like grip videos the power a one is
just a lot better than the Nintendo one
it's not even talking about things like
charging like that it's just a much
better grip a little rubbery it's got a
good shape to it I'm not a huge fan of
using the joy columns in a grip design
but if I'm going to use one it's this
brand boo candy why did I get this
earlier I could be snacking on these
little video yep that's cheap trigger
again D it goes in I don't it's gonna go
everywhere this probably it's good so
when we take the total deserves the
ended up in the good bin versus the bad
bin it ends up being basically 640
versus 360 which is a pretty good split
I mean part of the reason for that is
because in the good bin we had a lot of
the more expensive stuff like the
battery the headphones are things where
yeah you're spending more money but
you're getting what you pay for where is
the trash bin had quite a few items that
were on the cheaper side and sometimes
that cheaper stuff was worth it but a
lot of times maybe not so much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
