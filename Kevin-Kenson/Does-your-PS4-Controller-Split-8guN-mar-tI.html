- We've talked a lot about
different weird controllers before
and a lot of them have come from Hori
and this next one is no exception,
although I think it has
one of the most interesting gimmicks
that we've seen them do historically.
This is a PS2 controller
that let's you do this.
This controller lets you split in half
and use each side independently
while playing a game,
although, since it's an
old school PS2 controller
you still need to actually
connect them with a cable.
But it ends up working out a lot
like this old school version
of what we currently have
with the joy-cons on the Switch or
maybe even Wiimote and
nunchuck from the Wii.
It's this very comfortable experience
where you don't have to
have your hands together
at the same time,
or if you prefer,
you can just put them back together
and use it like a regular controller.
Now, of course, I could
test this out on a PS2,
we've done that before with
other retro controllers,
but there's something
else that we're going to
take a look at today with
this that's also interesting.
We actually found an adapter
that allows you to use
PSone and PS2 style controllers on a PS4.
So we're going to take this controller
and try it on a modern game.
There's a few interesting things
going on with this controller
aside from the obvious
fact of how it splits.
Because of the fact you can't make any use
of the middle section of the controller,
everything has been relocated
to this right hand side of it.
You've got the select, start, and analog
switches all down here
and you'll also notice that
the L1 and L2 buttons
have been placed here,
even though we have them over here as well
and the reason for that
is that this controller
actually is three different modes of use.
There's together like
a regular controller.
There's the split design
where you're using a cable between them
and you have this kind
of relaxed controller
on either side of you motion.
Or you can actually play with
just the one right hand side by itself
as a one-handed controller design and
the way that works is still have
the shoulder buttons right here
and then you use this switch to change
what exactly this stick does,
either acting as the left joystick,
the right joystick,
or as the arrow keys.
Now obviously this is not
something that will work
for every game out there
but in the ones that just
need that kinda minimal input,
it's an interesting option to have and
very reminiscent of
another PS2 Hori controller
that we've looked at before which offered
that kind of one-handed gameplay style.
Now this very modular aspect
controller is very interesting
but the part that I
find the most compelling
and really want to talk about is using
the two controllers when
they are connected by a cable
because I really think this
is the most interesting idea
that was very much ahead of its time
because like I said,
it's something that in
practice is very similar
to what Nintendo did with
the Wiimote and nunchuck
or even more so, the pair of joy-cons.
This idea of having a single controller
that is actually one
controller tied together
like we're so used to,
this kind of liberating comfortable option
of just being able to
have both controllers
and you can lay back with them.
So we're just gonna mess around
playing Kingdom Hearts through with this,
I'm just at the very
beginning of the game,
and yeah,
this definitely working.
I'm actually surprised,
more than this controller,
the adapter surprises me.
I really thought this was
going to be a bigger problem
but it's reading all my inputs fine.
I'm going to admit,
it's a little less comfortable
than a normal controller
if I'm doing it like this
but that's mostly for
the benefit of you guys
being able to see the controller.
I think if I could just
play like down here
and just not even think about it,
like I was laying down on a couch,
or just hanging out somewhere in a chair,
just didn't even have my arms up,
this would actually be really comfortable.
By the way, if you guys are wondering
how a PS2 controller
can actually fully work
on a PS4 controller,
well while you're using this adapter
most of the buttons
you need for most games
are on both controllers.
The only thing that a PS2
controller is really missing
is the touchpad and a home button.
So for the home button,
there's actually a hot
key with this adapter
where you just hit the left analog
and start at the same time.
For the touchpad,
there's options for like
pressing down on parts of it by using
a directional stick and start
but there's no way to actually copy
the full motion of a touchpad.
So when a game that actually needs
in-depth touchpad controls,
you're not gonna get that with this.
Otherwise, for the vast majority of games,
this works.
I really gotta say that, so far,
while just playing with this,
I have some complaints about it
as a controller in general
which we'll talk about a little later
but just the basic concept
of having this cord,
the cord itself is a little silly,
but being able to just hold
either side of the controller
wherever I want within reason,
it does add a certain
degree of comfort here
that you don't really get
with traditional controllers.
So I've been messing with it
in the extended form like this.
Let's go ahead and switch back
to it as a regular controller
just for a little bit
to see how it compares.
It's kinda weird going
between these 'cause
it's more comfortable
and it's less comfortable
at the same time.
Like this feels familiar,
I'm used to having a controller like this.
The only time I don't hold a
controller like this anymore
is I'm either on keyboard and mouse
or if I'm using joy-cons.
But most controllers,
this is the experience
and there's something just familiar and
comfortable about that.
Whereas, if I'm using
it in the split mode,
it's different but it kinda
works out better, I think.
Real quick, I just want to talk about
this adapter we picked up.
This is a PS2 to PS3 or
PS4 controller adapter
that's made actually by Brook Accessory,
the same guys that made that
Xbox One controller adapter
that let's you use it wirelessly with
other Bluetooth devices.
And if you're interesting
in checking this out,
I'll have a link down below
but when we first got it,
I actually thought it was broken
'cause I just couldn't get it to work with
any of our PS2 controllers
and then I realized what the issue was
and it's actually really dumb.
The base here, that's
behind the USB port itself,
is just a little too big to fit inside
the lip of the PS4, at least the PS4 Pro,
so it will look and feel like
it's plugged in all the way
but it's actually only 70%
or 80% of the way there
so you actually have to plug
it into the back USB port,
that's gonna give you enough room.
So if you pick this up
and you're wondering
why doesn't this work, try that.
It's interesting to
try out this controller
on a modern system because
it really makes you think
about the approach
companies take to designing
the controllers that
we're currently using.
Because, yeah, look for it's time,
it was an okay so-so controller.
The buttons are whatever,
the stick heads are tiny
and not very comfortable,
the D-pad is very mushy.
It's an old third-party controller
but just the concept of splitting it
and being able to use both ends
is something that I think
modern console manufacturers
should actually take
a look at and clearly,
Nintendo is one of
those companies that has
because that's how joy-cons work.
Don't get me wrong,
I still love the traditional
modern controller design
and that is still a controller
I would prefer to use
for serious gaming.
If I'm doing something competitive
or I'm playing a very difficult game
where I gotta do a lot of
complex input and stuff,
yeah, I'm gonna prefer that
for a pro controller design.
But if I just want lay back and relax
and play some games and
just maximum chill possible,
this is a really intriguing cool idea.
That's why I love the
joy-cons on the Switch
'cause whenever I use it in dock mode,
I don't like putting
them in the comfort grip,
I just like being able to lay my hands
wherever they're gonna be and play a game
and just not have to
really think about it.
To have something like that
for Playstation or Xbox
or even something you can use on the PC,
that's really awesome
and I kinda want it now.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
