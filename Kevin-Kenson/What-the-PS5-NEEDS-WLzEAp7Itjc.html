advances but one area that we're still
hitting a bit of a wall in is charge
solutions for controllers now different
companies have different ways of
addressing this Xbox for instance still
relies on removable batteries because
they last a lot longer but the downside
is you do need to replace them once they
die PlayStation and switch on the other
hand use internal rechargeable batteries
but those don't necessarily last as long
and it's really annoying when you end up
needing to plug them into something
because you forgot to charge them
sometime thankfully though there's an
emerging technology that is going to
hopefully make this a lot easier for
upcoming systems and that's wireless
charging
now obviously wireless charging is not a
thing that is standard in any current
gaming systems but there are some ways
you can kind of start to mess with it a
little bit on the current generation one
that was actually recently brought to my
attention is this little guy right here
this is found by our good friend
completo of Austin Evans Channel I'm Ken
bolito from the Austin Evans channel you
got this Willie was in Japan and it's a
wireless charging battery pack that you
can attach to a DualShock 4 controller
so the idea here is that for a dual fuck
for instead of having to always plug it
into the system make sure that it gets a
full charge or having to buy a charger
stand or something you can just attach
this guy to the back of the controller
and have a wireless charging service
that you can just place it on whenever
you're not playing and that's gonna make
sure it always has a full charge when
you need it so how well does it actually
work I don't know yet because he
actually even even opens Patridge so
let's check it out just get this open
and if she just attached to the back of
our DualShock controller probably look a
little better on black one but the white
give a nice contrast and right away
first thing I notice is that this isn't
as nearly as bulky as I thought was
gonna be I mean looking at the picture I
thought I was gonna be sticking out a
lot more but it's really just enough to
where it's gonna lay flat when you set
it down because the grips on the ps4
controller don't go that far back so
yeah it's really doesn't really impact
the size of it at all
I mean doesn't affect my grip either
that's good so we got this guy connected
and we have a charge surface right here
so let's just set down and
it's charging there you can be seen
light lighting up awesome now I don't
you know how fast this charges we
probably need to read the box I think we
need to translate this
she rode it over to
yes that's 600 milliamps at Butlins
and we will effectively actually oh hey
wait hold on this is actually the charge
five so according to this translation it
takes about three hours to charge up a
ps4 controller which I always take
information like this on boxes with a
little grain of salt maybe add on like
half an hour to an hour to that but even
by that logic if it's as long as four
hours that's not that much slower than a
regular PS port charging controller that
takes about two two and a half hours
depending on condition of your battery
so this is about half as fast maybe just
a little above that but that's still
really awesome for something that's so
convenient the hope here is that with
talk of next-gen system starting to come
up where we have maybe a PS 5 or
whatever Xbox doesn't act and down the
line when the switch is replaced that
companies start to embrace the idea of
wireless charging over these plug in
solutions because it's so convenient and
if they all did it together you can have
great really simple setups I mean
imagine just having your gaming setup or
you have a stand next to you it's a
charging surface and you're able to sit
down your playstation controller your
xbox controller your Nintendo portable
you just have a nice little place to set
down your controllers and they're always
fully charged whenever you need them and
really this is something you can kind of
rig up right now I mean we have this
service right here we're using the ps4
control that we have set up and there's
something we've actually experimented
with before setting up a way to do a
wireless charge switch where you get a
USB C charge pad rig it up inside of a
hybrid case and that lets you charge it
by setting it down now the switch does
demand a lot more power than a
controller does so it's not really as
efficient as the ps4 controller is but
it's a really cool way to show off this
proof of concept now I know we said
earlier that we got this guy from Japan
thanks to Ken but we looked into it and
you actually can grab these on Amazon as
well so we'll put a link for that down
below if you guys want to check it out
it's a really cool way to help clean up
your gaming setup</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
