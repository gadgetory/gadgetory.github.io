games coming out on the Switch
but sometimes I think we
get a little too bogged down
on all the obvious big hits.
Yes that's awesome we're getting
a main line Pokemon game on the Switch.
Yes, we're finally getting
a new Metroid Prime.
There's a new fire emblem on the way.
All awesome stuff,
but let's not let those
overshadow all the other great titles
that are going to be making
their way into the system.
So let's talk about
some great Switch games
you should not pass up.
First on the list and the
soonest one to be coming out
in just a little under a month,
is Katana Zero.
Now this was actually announced
a couple years back for PC,
but at the most recent
Nintendo Nindies showcase
it was announced that
it was making its way
to the switch as well,
and this looks so much fun to me.
It actually reminds me
a lot of Hotline Miami,
but instead of being a top down shooter,
it's a side-scrolling action game.
Now if you haven't played
Hotline Miami before
the big focus there is that
it's an action game where
enemies are very fragile.
It just takes one hit to take them out,
but it only takes one hit
to take you out as well.
So it's very easy to mess up and die,
but every time you do, the
level resets very quickly,
and the focus is just
doing it again and again,
until you get that one
perfect play through to get through it.
Now this might sound a little repetitive,
but honestly, it happens
in such short bursts
that it's just this really
addictive experience.
It looks like Katana Zero
is running with the same basic concept,
but once again, is instead a 2D platform
or action style kind of
game, which I do prefer,
and adds a little bit of time
control mechanics as well.
Honestly, this thing looks like
it's a really cool concept.
I cannot wait to get my
hands on it in just a month
to find out if it lives up to that
same kind of heart pounding action.
Next is the only port on this list.
There are a ton of amazing
ports coming out to the Switch.
So much so that it's probably going to be
it's own video at some point,
but there's one in particular
I really want to talk about,
because I think that
bringing it to the switch
unlocks a way to play it that
was previously not possible,
and that's Final Fantasy
Crystal Chronicles.
Now if you're not familiar
with Crystal Chronicles
it's a sub-series of Final Fantasy,
a spin-off that happened
originally on the Game Cube,
and it's focused on being a cooperative
action-adventure kind of styled title.
The problem is when it
came out originally,
the Game Cube, doing multiplayer
was a massive hassle.
See, back when this
game originally came out
you couldn't just play multiplayer
by hooking up four Game Cube
controllers to a system.
No, that'd be way too
convenient and simple.
Instead, if you wanted to do multiplayer,
each player individually had
to use a Game Boy Advance
that was plugged into the Game
Cube with a specialty cable
that not everyone owned.
Basically it was really, really difficult
to find a full group of friends
to actually play this game in
proper four player co-op with,
which was a real shame,
because in all the later sequels on the DS
that offered co-op, was really fun.
The Switch is the perfect
platform to revive
and re-adapt this style of formula,
because I think one of the
biggest strengths of that system
aside from the whole going to portable,
out of portable aspect,
is that it's really built for local co-op,
whether you're doing it
in tabletop or on a TV.
So being able to do that
for this game finally,
and with cleaned up HD graphics,
is just something I am so excited about.
Sadly, we don't have a
hard release date just yet,
but it is planned to come
out sometime in 2019.
Next up is Hollow Knight Silk Song.
Now if you've not played the
originally Hollow Knight yet,
right after this video go download IT
and play it right away,
because it is an amazing game.
The metroidvania genre is
one that a lot of indie games
have kind of taken a run with,
and there's been a lot of good ones,
but this is honestly my personal favorite,
and I think one of the
best executions of it.
It takes the concept of the metroidvania
where you explore a map,
fight bosses, get stronger,
eventually make your way to the ending.
All well and good,
but then it just adds a
little bit of Dark Soul.
It's not necessarily the
gameplay aspect of Dark Soul.
It's not that style of RPG,
or not quite as crushingly difficult,
but it's the tone.
This kind of very dark world
with just snippets of lore
here and there for you to pick up
that adds this whole air of
mystery to the entire thing
that just makes you want to learn
more and more the longer you play.
So it's no surprise that
because I love this game so much
I am super excited for its
direct squeal Silk Song,
which is getting released
on PC and Mac as well,
but when it comes to consoles,
Switch is the exclusive
home, at least for now.
Now it does share the same kind of
basic concept of metroidvania
the the original Hollow Knight has,
but the gameplay's been
revamped a little more
to feature a faster-paced,
more acrobatic style combat,
which looks really fun.
This one is still technically TBA
as far as release dates go,
but I've got a very good feeling,
or maybe I'm just super optimistic,
that we will get it sometime this year.
By the way, if you want
an easy and safe way
to customize your Switch,
check out skins from
today's Sponsor D Brand.
They come in a variety of
different colors and patterns,
like this carbon fiber.
You can get them for the
Switch itself, the joy cons,
or your dock.
Check out the link down below.
Let's get a little bit
weirder with Windjammers 2.
Now, the history of the
original Windjammers
is kind of a weird thing,
because it first came out
back in arcades in 1994,
and while it didn't have
the best critical reception,
and it didn't have a massive following,
it did develop a cult audience.
And as time went on,
the game started getting
re-released on newer systems
like the Switch,
a whole different generation
of people started rediscovering
and found out wow, this is
actually a really fun game.
Imagine playing air hockey
except it's with a Frisbee
that constantly catches on fire,
and you can throw it so hard
that it smashes into your opponent
sending them into the goal line,
and you still score points for that.
It is a very fast-paced reflex
twitch-based style sports game,
perfect for one-on-one gameplay.
Takes a lot of skill and technique
to eventually get actually
really good at it,
but once you do, matches
get super intense.
Given the series renewed success,
the team responsible for porting
it over to modern systems
is now working on a sequel
that has redone graphics
that has a more cartoony art style,
and still focuses on
so much of that amazing
late 80s, early 90s charm.
There are a lot of classic retro games
getting a second life right now,
and while this isn't necessarily
one of the biggest names in history,
it is not one you should miss out on.
Everyone loves Mario Kart 8 Deluxe.
It is one of the top
selling games on the switch,
and for good reason,
but, there's another arcade
racer coming soon to the Switch
that you should keep your eyes on,
and it's from Mario's oldest
rival; Team Sonic Racing.
The spinoff series of Sonic racing games
is one that I think has not
gotten the love it deserves.
They are fantastic cart racing games
that just don't always
get as much attention
because well, Mario Kart exists,
but they're really good.
And Team Sonic is mixing
up the formula a little bit
to try and do something a bit different.
Instead of being the
traditional kind of racing game
where it's just you as your racer
trying to get to the finish line first,
the game focuses on
racing as a team of racers
and doing your best to get
the whole group through
as quickly as possible
by working together.
Based on early snippets of gameplay,
the core racing mechanics look
really good and a ton of fun.
The only thing that
has me a little worried
is that currently at launch
the game only features
original Sonic characters
whereas, past Sonic
racing games like Allstar
featured a bunch of
different Sega properties.
So hopefully with DLC being
a thing, that will change.
Either way, I look forward
to trying this game out
when it comes to the Switch
on May 21st of this year.
Now I know I already talked about
one metroidvania game in this video
with Hollow Knight Silk Song,
but there's one other one
I really want to talk about
that should finally be
coming out this year,
and it's a spiritual
successor to the original game
that actually started that whole genre;
Blood Stained Ritual The Knight.
This was a very successfully
kick started game
that was led by the man responsible
for making Castlevania
Symphony of the Knight.
And in fact, we've already got one
kind of spin-off type of game
that's already been released
called Curse of the Moon,
which is absolutely amazing.
It's more based on older-school
NES Castlevania style games,
but if it is any indication
of the kind of quality
and just gameplay style that
this game is going to have,
I cannot wait to actually
have it in my hands.
Unlike a lot of other games in the genre,
this one is pushing forward a little bit.
And instead of doing
older school graphics,
or any kind of 2D art style,
it is focused on doing
that kind of 2D - 3D hybrid
while still maintaining that
2D platforming gameplay.
If you have any love for
the Castlevania franchise
do yourself a favor and play
Curse the Moon right now
and join me in waiting for all the hype
that is Blood Stain Ritual the Knight</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
