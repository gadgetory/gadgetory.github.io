Microsoft and I have a pretty good
suspicion this is SIA these related open
this guy up and see what we have inside
it's a shirt I hope it fits
I don't know for this guy
oh wow it's even numbered so that looks
cool this is number 888 over 995 and
guessing our flag yes hey you gotta find
a place to set this up permanently this
mystery bag so it's a little bottle but
the message in it so this is actually
something that's in the game too you
find messages and bottles but usually
like treasure maps and stuff to try and
hunt down oh that's smart okay so this
is actually the code for the game which
I may have already picked up so me will
show this to the camera for a quick
second for you know whoever's watching
to be lucky and in case you were hoping
to use this code and found out that
someone was watching this video already
did it good news for you I am giving
away one other thing really to see a
Thieves a custom xbox we did so I'll
link that video down below and also at
the end this video make sure to check
that out because it's really cool you
want to make sure you have a chance to
win it let's see that's a recipe for
grog so I might not go to the store
after this and try this yep cool as long
as I have been excused to my darker I'm
on company dime that sounds good to me
and we don't have any proper tools for
this is not our product placement by the
way this is what we find I do not make
drinks very often people so Stan skills
I'm just gonna keep shaking it
it's not bad he's good I like it oh cool
it's such otaku so I don't know if you
guys have seen these before
this is kind of a new series of figures
that I've been coming outside a lot just
Xbox but also lots of PlayStation and
just other kind of franchise based
characters and they're just cool little
figurines it's basically a toy still I
figure without the toys to life part
it's just a cool collectible all right
now there's a couple things left it
looks like we've got two books let's go
for the thin one first it's a comic book
okay we have one thing left in the box
and it looks like the fanciest I'm
really excited actually think I saw
about this this morning yes this is the
tales from the sea of thieves this is
like a little I almost wanna say like an
in-game encyclopedia so it's kind of a
mixture of an art book having lots of
concept stuff from the game but at the
same time includes a lot of in universe
information I'm actually a huge sucker
for in-game encyclopedias it's like the
most expensive thing I don't need to
have but I love at the same time this is
I'm really happy this was included I was
actually just looking into this thing
this morning well let's go they even do
like a little effect on the pages to
make them all look kind of worn and torn
a little bit but yeah so it's got
information on different islands items
I'm sure there's stuff like some of the
monsters you run into mermaids that kind
of deal yeah it was really cool and
there's recipes we can make more things
this is all really incredible to be
honest I mean I started playing the game
last night and I'm loving it and this is
only increasing my hype levels even more
I'm really excited this game
just Microsoft just keeps knocking at a
park when it comes to promotional stuff
the brand design here is just so on
point</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
