their showcase of all the upcoming indie
titles going to the switch so let's talk
about the 5 that I am most hyped about
and we're gonna kick things off with a
game that was honestly a throwaway
instant winner as far as I'm concerned
and that is shovel knight king of cards
now something I've really loved about
the shovel knight series isn't just how
the actual gameplay is a great
recreation of some my favorite classics
growing up but it's how with every
single character DLC they've done
they've reinvented the game to almost
feeling like an entirely new title and
that is no different with the gameplay
that we saw for king of cards now
entirely new gameplay and new stages
isn't enough for you something else that
was announced about this game that's a
little more unique
is the addition of a card minigame it
actually looks like something kind of
out of one of the ps1 Final Fantasies
like triple triad I don't know it's just
more gameplay more new stuff shovel
knight is just always a winner to me so
definitely hyped moving on one of the
more unique games that really stood out
to me at the ninh DS was floor kids now
to be honest one of the main reasons why
this game really appeals to me is
because I've accepted the fact that EA
is never doing an SSX in the style of
tricky again I don't really care about
the racing or surviving going down a
mountain but I care about is mixing up
tricks and getting the highest amount of
points possible which well obviously for
kids isn't a snowboarding game looks
like incorporates that kind of mechanic
but with a rhythm style game which I'm
actually really intrigued by on top of
that the game also has a pretty
interesting art style and original beats
provided by Kid Koala so definitely be
something worth checking out later this
holiday season when the game is going to
be a timed exclusive
for the switch back when the switch was
first announced one genre that I
immediately knew I had to have on this
system was co-op beat'em ups and then
Indies graced us with not one but two
new games the one I'm most excited for
being dragon marked for death now this
game is coming from inti creates a dev
team I've talked about before
responsible for other hit retro style
Indies like blaster master zero and
azure striker gunvolt and just in the
same style as those this new game from
them is a side-scrolling beat-em-up that
supports up to full four player co-op
with four very different-looking
playable characters the art style is
simple enough that I think it's gonna
look great even on the portable screen
so it's gonna be the perfect choice for
a portable co-op game using joy cons now
one other game I want to mention really
quick is the other beat'em up they
announced which is kind of a runner-up
to the rest of the games on this list
and that's now
parchments which is also a beat'em up
game but a bit different style it's not
a side scroller it's more like the
top-down gauntlet style where you're
focused more on range attacks where
you're playing a group of wizards both
these games are slated to come out
during the winter dragon marked for
death isn't exclusive for the switch
one-line parchments is currently up in
the air probably at least a timed
exclusive now if before the navy
showcase you asked me if and in my
favorite games would have been a shooter
for the switch i probably think you're
crazy but well here we are now with the
reveal of more fees law now while this
game isn't a true exclusive for the
switch it's a timed exclusive I think it
plays perfectly well and it was becoming
Nintendo's kind of shtick when it comes
to shooters where instead of focusing on
kind of more traditional blow stuff up
modern-day far-future bloody war all
that kind of stuff it's more focused
than kind of just zany weird things
which was made evident by splatoon in
more fees laws case the way the game
works is when you shoot an opponent
instead of them taking damage the part
of the body you shoot gets smaller and
yours gets larger making you a bigger
target and also just results in really
crazy-looking things like people with
giant heads but no torsos and tiny legs
at the same time that you're getting
larger you also have a sort of team
mascot avatar that gets bigger as well
and the winning team is based on which
avatar got larger so you're not actually
killing opponents you're just constantly
morphing sizes and changing in just this
really hilarious looking game that I
think is gonna be a really fun mix up
shooter for the switch's library and
then after all these games and more
there was one more huge announcer for
the nin DS probably the biggest thing to
come for it this is a game that we
already kind of knew was happening but
now we actually of a trailer and a title
we're finally getting a new No More
Heroes Travis strikes again now if
you've never played a No More Heroes
game before or any title from suit of 51
there are some of the raunchiest
filthiest goriest most insane games that
were somehow exclusive originally to the
Wii a Nintendo system and despite all
these other aspects which made it a
hilarious game it still managed to have
a really fun and solid third person
action experience they were great games
that we just haven't seen a new one up
since until now finally and to really
even top this off it's not only a nuna
war heroes game but they're actually
crossing it over with other indie titles
the only witch that we've actually had
confirmed so far is hotline Miami which
makes so much perfect sense we still
don't have a whole lot of info just yet
on how the
well gameplay is the trailer we got was
definitely more cinematic than actually
showing us how it's going to play but
the important bit is then we're getting
a new No More Heroes it is coming out
sometime next year is exclusive to the
switch and I am so so happy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
