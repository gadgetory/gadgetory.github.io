half a week and while the review is
still on its way I thought to give you
guys just a little taste by going
through my top 10 favorite fatalities
walking through each of them and just
how gory or utterly ridiculous each of
them are starting with burrows very
aptly titled peekaboo now this one
initially looks like one of the simpler
ones but it's made infinitely better
once you realize why it's called Pikachu
wood you'll see in just a moment where
does head go there he is now second up
is one I favorite new characters Covell
Khan whose fatality is initially looks
like I just might be a return to one of
the old school friendships but it's a
little more over-the-top violent than
that now third up is a fatality from a
Mac and what's great about this one is
that it initially looks like an old
school one that we've seen him do again
and again and again but then it just
goes an extra step farther with a little
bit of a new twist next up we have one
of Kenji's when my favorite less often
used Mortal Kombat characters and which
really makes this one awesome isn't the
overall concept of it but this moment
right here what starts to slow down and
then everything goes to hell
I'm still a little confused why they
aren't clean slices and just giblets but
we'll go with fifth on the list comes
from series veteran Raiden and it's one
of those ones that just goes a little
too far because I'm pretty sure he's
dead at this point
but just in case necessary now so far
most of these have just been a pure gore
fest but Kyle out does bring us just
something a little more artistic maybe
dead but at least you cannot be
contributed or seven left we've got
another brand new character Cassie cage
with another really unnecessary end of
her fatality not because it's overkill
but well just watch now I have to admit
I'm a bit of a sucker for referential
humor especially when it's not just some
recent meme that everyone's freaking out
about and that's exactly why I love this
fatality from Johnny Cage so much now I
don't think this list has had quite
enough ultraviolence just yet so we have
to throw at least one in from Molina
which
I'm pretty sure he's dead he's probably
dead he now of course no list for mole
combat would ever be complete if it
didn't include at least one reference to
sub 0 or scorpion which brings us to our
final fatality sub zero's I spend which
honestly I really love just res
attention to detail that I just oh well
those are my 10 favorite and if you pick
the game up already or you've already
watched them all online let me know your
favorite fatalities down below in the
