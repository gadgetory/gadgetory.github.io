to exclusively reveal details on the
hardware for microsoft's upcoming 8.5
generation system Xbox one Scorpio and
it's kind of amazing so real quick to
give a little background on this what's
really interesting about the development
of the Scorpio is how it kind of worked
in Reverse compared to past systems
normally when you're making a new gaming
system you just make some powerful
hardware and games we made based on that
usually ylc games get better and better
over time because you learn to make
better use of the resources scorpio
works in Reverse though in that we
already have the xbox one out we ready
have a number of games out so the goal
was to take those games and make sure to
test a system that will actually run all
of them at native 4k and even at 60
frames per second doing so so what does
it take for the Xbox one Scorpio to
achieve 4k console gaming well it has a
custom eight core processor running at
2.3 gigahertz that 30% faster than the
original Xbox one energy view consisting
of core units running at 1172 megahertz
that's four point six times more
powerful in the original Xbox one and
one point five times more powerful than
the ps4 Pro meaning that original stated
goal of achieving six teraflops has
happened
it also has 12 gigabytes of RAM with 326
gigabytes per second bandwidth which is
way faster than the ps4 Pro and once
again this is divided between the UI and
actual gameplay whereas before it was a
5 and 3 split it's now 8 gigabytes
dedicated to gaming and 4 gigabytes for
the UI so we're going to also run as a
native 4k now it's worth noting that
while most game systems do of course
have some custom parts the scorpio has
been customized throughout entirely for
the purpose of having maximum efficiency
in both energy consumption and cooling
including a new vapor cooling technology
now along with this we've also confirmed
that the system will have a one terabyte
hard drive it will have an internal
power supply like the Xbox 1s so no more
giant brick on the cable anymore and
it's going to have these same back ports
as the Xbox 1s including a power port
HDMI IN HDMI out a pair of USB ports
optical Ethernet and an IR port so
there's a bunch of fancy numbers but
what does it actually all mean in
practice well as a proof-of-concept Xbox
showed a stress test demo of 4 to 6
using the same graphs that have
on Xbox one but running at 4k and
according to Eurogamer it ran at a
perfectly smooth 60 frames per second
now of course four to six is a very well
optimized game and it is a first party
game from Microsoft so that means that
while it does work there it doesn't
necessarily hold true for third party
titles but it does prove that 4k gaming
on a console is possible another really
cool thing that was noted too is that
the scorpion is designed to output in
whatever resolution you want regardless
of the mod where you're using so if
you're using a 1080p display you can
still render out at 4k and have it super
sample to the screen resulting in a
crisper image something that ps4 pro had
the option to do but did it now speaking
the ps4 Pro the scorpio is definitely
more powerful for those of you wondering
though they do have very different
philosophies of how to approach 4k
gaming the pro is a sort of affordable
option that went for native 4k gaming
and a small handful of titles but for
the most part relied on techniques like
checkerboard upscaling to make it look
as close as possible while saving some
performance the scorpy on the other hand
is this highly custom souped-up machine
that's going for brute force actual
native 4k gaming and something like that
while awesome isn't going to come cheap
we still don't have a for-sure release
date just yet or if for sure price point
but go away things look we're going to
find a release date at e3 with a price
point probably around 500 bucks maybe as
low as 450 if they're going to be really
really aggressive with it
