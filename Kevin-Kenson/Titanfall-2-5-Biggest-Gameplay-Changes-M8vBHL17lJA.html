the core gameplay may look pretty
familiar there's a lot about this game
that's very very different from the
original and pretty much all of it for
the better so here's a list of the five
biggest changes from titanfall 12
titanfall 2 first off the Titans one of
the most noticeable changes in titanfall
2 is how respawn approach designing our
giant robot buddies in the first game
you had a limited form of customization
picking one of three frames and
outfitting them with whatever weapons
you liked while two restricts your
options a lot more just giving you six
very different Titans to choose from now
this might sound bad at first but it
actually makes each of the Titan options
a lot more interesting and significant
whether it's the fast-moving Ronin with
hit-and-run tactics armed with a shotgun
and a sword or the heavy stationary
Legion holding down the line they play
very different tactical roles and you
still get a little customization in the
form of Titan kits allowing you to
specialize your favorite Titan just a
teensy bit fans building their own mechs
might not like the sound of this at
first but honestly it's done a lot of
good for the game making Titans feel a
lot more balanced against each other and
actually feel distinct number 2 weapon
variety Titans aren't the only thing to
get a makeover while they see fewer
customization options in exchange for
specialization pilots have way more
options than they did before this
includes new passive perks new
activatable abilities like the grappling
hook but most importantly a lot more
guns choose from the original titanfall
had very few primary weapons and mostly
came down to whether you want SMG 1 or
SMG two or the shotgun or the sniper
titanfall 2 on the other hand has this
list filled out quite a bit but
thankfully still doesn't feel bloated
with each weapon category having two to
four options all with very clear
benefits and drawbacks like this SMG
deals the most damage while this one has
the least recoil and this one has the
highest firing rate etc this feels like
just the right balance to me because
titan falls options were pretty bare
bone and needed a little fleshing out
but it's also still a relief to play a
shooter that doesn't shove 30 different
assault rifle options down your throat
third up pilot boosts these replace the
burn cards of the original titanfall one
time use powerup cards that could grant
you special weapon
stat boosts or immediate titan falls
with something more akin to a
traditional kill streak a pilot can
equip one of these at a time each with a
different charge of amount required and
cover some of the more conventional
options of before like damage boosting
summoning a turret or even getting the
smart pistol from the first game which
is no longer a regular loadout option
while this is a step closer to the games
call of duty roots it's balanced really
well by the fact that players only get
one of these without having multiple
tiers and none of them feel super
overpowered especially since of course
everyone still has Titans they can
summon number for progression system
leveling progression has been completely
torn down and built anew the original
titanfall was all very traditional in
this respect gain XP for killing or
winning matches level up and unlock some
new weapons or abilities to equip your
pilot with while titanfall 2 does this
in essence it's all really simplified
now players level up by collecting
merits some of them being as simple as
finish match win a match perform well
etc while others are tied to specific
things like leveling up a gun or Titan
model which grows simply by constantly
using them this rewards trying out
various builds early on since early
level ups are easy to get thus making
your pile level up even faster what's
really great though is the credit system
along with leveling up playing will also
reward you with a small amount of
credits that you can save up and use to
buy and unlock items before reaching the
actual needed level this gives a
terrific balance of letting players
unlock new options slowly while also
letting them fast track to things they
really really want that might be locked
behind a much higher level fifth is
rodeoing Titans one of the more
surprising changes for those of you
going into this game blind is how
rodeoing Titans is way different before
you could jump onto an enemy Titan to
light them up giving pilot set up close
and personal method of dishing out huge
damage but that's no longer the case
into now when you rodeo a Titan you'll
steal one of their batteries which does
a set bit of damage and then you can
give that battery to your own Titan or
an allies recovering some health I'll
admit I kind of missed the badass factor
when you could down a Titan by writing
it but this changes brought a much more
interesting team benefit to row doing
enemy
items and can even serve as a benefit
for those people that get their tighten
a little late giving them time to steal
the batteries off their enemies that got
an early titanfall just don't get too
excited about it it's still pretty easy
for a Titan two SWAT you like a fly for
just jumping around in front of them
trying to steal a battery all in all
these changes of shape titanfall 2 into
something that's maybe a little less
fast but a hell of a lot more
interesting making it a solid
improvement that any fan of the first
game should grab as soon as possible</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
