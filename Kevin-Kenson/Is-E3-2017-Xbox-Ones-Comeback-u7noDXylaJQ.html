the biggest wild card this year is going
to be Microsoft Oh Microsoft
making it easier also now this is not to
say that I think Microsoft is the most
unpredictable company but rather if they
want to build up a ton of hype this year
they need to be the most unpredictable
now there is of course one thing we know
they're going to talk about for sure and
that is their upcoming project Scorpio
then who souped up amazing system that's
going to blow away all the other
consoles but what's really interesting
about this is they were to reveal all
the hard tech specs about that was all
revealed months ago while Eurogamer so
all we really have left to talk about
our release date price point and an
actual physical reveal of what the
system looks like now there might also
be some time spent to things like
looking at UI and multimedia functions
and you know new updates coming to the
Xbox OS but assuming all that stuff
together takes only 20 minutes 30 at
most that leaves a lot of time free to
just talk about brand new video games
now of course there are some games that
Microsoft has talked about at previous
III press conferences that we still
haven't gotten yet so those will
probably make an appearance aside from
of course scalebound and fable legends
both of which sadly got canceled for
instance crackdown 3 had a great looking
trailer years ago which we haven't
really heard anything new since would be
really great to see something new
especially if it's something that could
showcase the power of project Scorpio we
should also be seeing rares upcoming
pirate game sea of thieves which has
been shown often on the last couple
years and had actual full gameplay last
year so hopefully are getting to an
actual release date for that one and of
course David decayed 2 which was
announced at last year's e3 and really
aside from those bigger titles I'm
actually more excited if we would
finally get information on some of the
indie games they've been pushing pretty
much forever at this point for Xbox one
such as cuphead and below so where does
this leave us with possible brand new
game announcements well Tory put a
little bit of a damper on your potential
hype three-for-three Studios has already
said they will not be showing halo 6
this year even though the timing makes a
lot of sense instead they have said they
will be showing something this year
which could be something as small as DLC
for Halo Wars 2 or potentially some
other kind of spin off from the Halo
franchise or who knows maybe even a
brand new IP another semi-annual
franchise that we can probably expect to
see announcement from core
is sortsa we get affords a game every
year all trading between traditional
motorsport games and the horizon series
this time around if they are still
following the pattern we should be
seeing an announcement and trailer for
forts of motorsports 7 so those are
those going to mixed-up horizons the one
that's actually fun a third major
franchise that might make an appearance
but even if it does were probably just a
very minor snippet and just a teaser
trailer is Gears of War user or Ford did
do very well from Microsoft last year
but it's probably too soon to see a
whole bunch of new info on Gears of War
5 just yet unless they want to do some
kind of side game or spin-off title in
its place and that's really it as far as
major first party franchises that
microsoft owns that we could maybe
expect to see this year and that's
exactly what I was talking about earlier
when I said that they need to be
unpredictable
Scorpio is a really cool piece of tech
which could be a very huge push for them
in the console market but it needs
something extra to go with it and we
need some new blood in the system we
need new games we need new IPs
just something surprise people that were
not expecting the older story that's
been going on this generation between
ps4 and Xbox one has been the fact that
ps4 just keeps getting big hit
exclusives and Microsoft have their fair
share but not nearly enough not nearly
as many I mean we even had one game
announced scalebound
which looked awesome it was a brand new
IP coming from platinum for Microsoft it
was going to be this great looking game
kind of a weird mixture of monster
hunter and Devil May Cry that got
cancelled that's gone now so we have to
fall back on all the regular titles we
still know and that is momentum that
Microsoft needs to change so will this
be the year Microsoft really comes back
we'll find out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
