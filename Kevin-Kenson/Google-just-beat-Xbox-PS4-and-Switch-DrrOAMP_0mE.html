presentation that has been very hyped up
and it turns out it's more or less
exactly what a lot of people theorized
though it certainly goes quite a few
steps further so if you guys haven't
been paying attention any of this news
whatsoever Google has been hitting a lot
at something they were doing gaming
related and it turns out it's there an
approach to cloud gaming this is
something that we've talked a few times
about in the past but always within the
confines of Oh Microsoft might be
working on this or here's ways that
PlayStation is messed with the idea but
here this is something entirely new
that's going a lot bigger picture so the
basic idea is that instead of Google
making any kind of Hardware of their own
like some kind of system they instead
are making this platform called stadia
and the way stadia works is you're
playing games remotely connected to a
server using a controller that connects
directly to it rather than in a device
and you can freely move about using it
on different platforms whether that's on
a television on your computer on a
laptop
even on your phone and the pitch the
hope that Google has is that this is
going to give you this very easy
accessible experience where you could
just simply click on a link to start up
a game and it's gonna give you this 4k
60fps HDR visuals that'll run on
anything because it's not actually
playing on it it's just acting as a
display device this is taking a concept
that's been getting bigger and bigger
over the last couple years and
potentially is pushing games into a
brand new future braising the concept of
play anywhere the concept of play
anywhere is something that really all
three major gaming hardware companies
right now have experimented with in one
form or another just in very different
ways for instance Nintendo has by far
the simplest but also strangely
innovative approach of making a handheld
system that docks to a TV if you want to
be able to have that at-home experience
you can go between being at home or on
the go with one system instead of having
to stream anything
PlayStation on the other hand kind of
moves into the territory of streaming
stuff but it's still very focused on
using their hardware initially you could
do things like use a PS Vita to play
PlayStation 4 games on the go streaming
from your system now they've opened it
up a little more and you can use it with
iOS devices they've also messed with
cloud gaming to an extent but again it's
still focused on using their services by
using PlayStation now to play
PlayStation games on your ps4 or on a
computer now Microsoft has messed the
least with this concept so far but they
actually have
one of the ideas in the works right now
that's closest to stadia which is X
cloud and even did a recent example of
this by showing playing forts of horizon
four on an android phone not by the
phone actually running the game but
instead playing it from one of their
servers it's honestly the thing that
Microsoft is very heavily trying to gear
their own system towards I think there's
still a goal in their part of still
releasing their own new Xbox but also
offer Xbox as a service outside of that
so if that you want to play game
streaming on say a computer or a phone
that options there but if you'd rather
use their own console you can do that
too what if everybody in the world could
play Halo what everybody in the world
could play Red Dead Redemption everybody
in the world could play the games what
would we have to do in order to make
that possible now while all of these
scratches the surface of this concept of
being able to just take your games and
play them anywhere stadia definitely
seems like it's pushing it possibly the
farthest with a few little interesting
tweaks of their own I think one of the
coolest ideas that really came out of it
was the concept of using the stadia
controller which instead of smoking up
to a specific device like oh you
connected to your TV or you connect to
your phone instead it just connects to
your Wi-Fi and communicates to the data
center directly that way you can play a
game and change what device you're
viewing it on and have it be one
seamless experience you could be playing
on your TV and then switch over to your
phone doesn't matter the controller
still connected to the same thing
letting you play those games they're
just acting as the display device and
again this is a concept that has been
explored before it's just that the
technology is getting better and better
that hopefully it's going to end up
working really really well there's been
examples in the past like on live and
again with Playstation now where yeah
people could stream games but it wasn't
always the smoothest or nicest
experience and even if it was working
nice and smoothly you weren't
necessarily getting the base-2 visuals
according to Google however stadia is
supposedly gonna be offering some pretty
intense gaming experiences on all these
different devices one specific example
they gave is that the upcoming Douma
turtle will be a part of stadia and that
if you play using it you're gonna
experience 4k 60 frames with HDR in a
seamless experience which is a pretty
insane goal to announce for something
that's supposedly coming out later this
year what's really crazy about this
whole stadia though isn't just the
simple concept of being able to stream
games to all these different devices and
you know constantly change platforms but
all the additional links that Google
wants to take it by
I get into all the other platforms that
they own the idea is to literally change
the way people interact and change with
games the concept they were very heavily
pushing is this idea of bringing players
developers and game viewers all together
in one form and just making the entire
experience different for instance the
concept of being able to watch a trailer
for a game on YouTube and at the end of
the video not only could you click over
to some other video but you could also
just click to open a window and start
playing that game right then and there
another concept is that you could be
watching someone live-streaming a game
and they're doing something that's
multiplayer and you could just click on
a link right there people to join the
lobby and get ready to play with them as
well instead of having to boot up any
other kind of system and have to try to
figure out if you have the right game
loaded installed and ready to go well I
think there's a question hanging in
everyone's heads of how exactly is this
gonna really perform realistically you
can't deny that there is a very very
exciting future mapped out here I think
in a very important debate to have is
not whether or not this is something
that will work but instead when it will
work because honestly I do think this is
the inevitable future that games are
going to reach I mean just look at all
the other media that we have right now
television movies music all of it is no
longer tied to any kind of specific
hardware sure you might have a specific
experience you want to do like see a
movie in a theater but if you want to
watch that on your phone on the TV at
home on a tablet all that stuff is
easily accessible and it just makes
sense that games are going to go that
direction as well and if there's any
company that can pull this off to
actually make this happen it has the
infrastructure for it it's Google now is
it something that's gonna be awesome
when it releases supposedly later this
year I don't know but a year from now
two years from now it's a really amazing
idea to explore
