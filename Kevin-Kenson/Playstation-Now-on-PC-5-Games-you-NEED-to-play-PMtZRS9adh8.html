windows bringing PC gamers access to a
whole library of ps3 games a lot of
which have been exclusive to consoles so
here's five games you absolutely must
play now if you've never had the chance
first up the Last of Us putting you in
the shoes of the weary and bitter Joel
last of us has you go through a linear
story as you try to protect and escort a
young girl named Ellie through a
post-apocalyptic world filled with
mushroom zombies now while the idea of a
zombie survival game isn't exactly
original last of us really knocks it out
of the park thanks to making it zombie
creatures a real threat even in small
numbers and makes heavy use of resource
collection to craft the tools you need
to get by most importantly though is the
game's story being easily the best thing
to come out of Naughty Dog with a strong
opening excellent pacing and deftly
handled ending that sticks with you long
after you finished it it's not perfect
some of the game's minor puzzle like
elements are kind of weak and get
repetitive but it's all worth it to
reach the game's excellent conclusion
now second on the list we might as well
keep the Naughty Dog train going with
uncharted 2 now all three of the
original Uncharted games are fun
adventures worth checking out but if
there is one and only one you need to
experience it's the series excellent
second chapter the core gameplay isn't
exactly deep with simple third-person
shooting mechanics and your linear
platforming but this is all balanced out
by the game's incredibly entertaining
presentation its storytelling it's
dynamic visuals during platformer
segments and the witty banter between
characters makes this game pretty much
the closest thing we have to a proper
Indiana Jones game albeit with a much
much larger body count that almost gets
comical when you really think about it
when you want to take a break from
difficulty and just enjoy a game whose
main goal is good old fashioned pulpy
fun uncharted 2 is exactly what you're
looking for now for number three let's
go ahead and get a little more artsy
with the incredible experience that is
journey journey is one of those games
that might bring some to question what
does and doesn't count as a video game
it is ultimately a very simple and very
straightforward experience journey
across the game's linear world to its
finish line with very very minimal
platformer
and puzzle difficulty but if your
gorilla playing this game based on that
alone you'd be missing out on so so much
journey is one of the most beautiful
games ever made visually and musically
and while the gameplay is simple it has
a few twists that turn it into a truly
unique experience specifically its co-op
it's possible for two players playing at
the same time to encounter one another
during their journey but you will not
see each other's name nor is there any
clear way to communicate with one
another outside of making a few sounds
it creates this odd sense of fellowship
running into one another and potentially
trying to stick through the game
together or try to ditch each other ASAP
it's a short game but it's the kind of
game that really has an impact on you
making PlayStation now a perfect fit for
it
alright so enough with the feelings
bullshit let's get back to a bit of
blood and violence with one of Sony's
biggest exclusive franchises God of War
which one your ask any of them they're
all on PlayStation now though the
original trilogy deserves your attention
the most talk to anyone who's played the
series and their answer for which as
their favorite is bound to be one of the
main trilogy whether it's a love for one
and how it changed the hack-and-slash
genre too for how it expanded the world
and gameplay of the original or three
for having some of the most intense and
cinematic fight scenes in gaming history
they're all excellent games and really
if anything deserve to be played in
order so you get the full bloody
experience as you master your way
through the entire Greek pantheon and a
quest for vengeance
so while PlayStation now is technically
a service featuring ps3 games it also
has ps2 games that report it over and
got remade in HD as you saw with God of
War 1 and 2 and as a result of that it
means you have the option to play one of
the greatest and most influential games
to come out of the ps2 Shadow of the
Colossus now all the other games on this
list have either been pretty eye candy
or satisfyingly difficult and Shadow the
Colossus is both of these while it's
older graphics may look a bit dated it's
dark and furry art style still comes
through pitting players against gigantic
enemies that double is both boss fights
and platforming puzzles this is the game
that introduced the idea of fighting
enemies that dwarfed you in size in a
way that actually kind of made sense
accompanied by a somber story that
accents the gameplay and visuals
perfectly this is one of the most
important games to come out during the
ps2 s generation and if you haven't
played it yet that needs to change
immediately all right so I do have one
bonus game for you guys because it feels
wrong doing a list on awesome
PlayStation exclusive games without at
least touching on one of the many G RPGs
that PlayStation now has and if there's
one I got to talk about it's ninokuni
now if you've never heard or seen of
this game before I know what you're
thinking
it looks super childish right well it is
but in that kind of family-friendly
Pixar studio ghibli kind of way that
will make an adult suffer waves of
childhood nostalgia and probably shed
some tears unless you're a heartless
monster mixing traditional party-based
RPG combat with pokemon style monster
hunting and catching this game strikes
an excellent balance of being both
interesting for adults to enjoy but
simple enough for young upstart gamers
to play through with the story that the
whole family can get engrossed in I
promise you check this one out you will
not regret it
extra bonus acerous wrath screw logic
blow up a guy larger than the earth by
punching his finger super hard do it</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
