the Legend of Zelda, Breath of the Wild,
has been a huge success,
rekindling a lot of love
for the Zelda franchise,
and a lot of people that just
haven't played it in ages,
and spawning all kinds of fan projects.
And, there's one in particular
I wanna draw some attention to.
The Legend of Zelda, Breath of the NES,
an 8-bit remake of old-school-style Zelda
using Breath-of-the-Wild-style
game design.
But first, before diving in the game,
let's talk a little backstory
on how exactly this project came to be.
Back at GDC 2017, Nintendo
did a presentation
on the making of the Breath of the Wild,
and one of the most interesting things
to come out of that presentation,
other than the fact that
they also planned on it
being about aliens originally,
was how they prototyped the
very basic idea of the game.
Nintendo created an
8-bit version of Zelda,
much like the original
Legend of Zelda game,
but approached it with a different idea
with how they wanted
players to solve problems.
Rather than just giving
them specific puzzles
that have one answer, instead,
the idea was to present
situations to the player,
and give them a number of tools
to figure out how they
wanted to do it themselves.
Which is how we ended up with things like
all the mechanics focused
around cutting down trees,
breaking down rocks, and
all of the fun little ways
you can cheat Breath of the Wild puzzles.
Now, obviously, this prototype
was never finished up
and turned into a full game.
Instead, it was scrapped
so they could create
the actual Breath of the Wild,
which ended up being fantastic.
But, when they showed
this concept off at GDC,
it resonated with a lot of people
this idea of a classic
old-school-style looking Zelda,
with more modern mechanics.
And, one indie game
developer took this idea
to create his own demo.
Now, this demo is currently up on itch.io,
it is completely free to download,
you can donate to the creator
if you want to help out with the project,
and it is super, super
bare-bones right now.
I mean, you can even see work in progress
right there on the map.
But, it's just this really basic thing
where you just run around,
killing enemies, picking up items.
But it's really cool in
how it showcases the ideas
behind how you would blend
old-school original Zelda
with the Breath of the Wild.
Even just looking at it visually.
This looks like old-school Zelda,
except Link is blue, like
in Breath of the Wild,
but there's even little changes
like adding shading behind the rocks.
And, it's not just the fusion
of visuals that's interesting,
it's really the mechanics.
For instance, I just finished
this little dungeon area
where I picked up a hammer,
and just like in Breath of the Wild,
I can use that hammer to
destroy certain kinds of rocks.
Now, unlike Breath of
the Wild, it can't break,
so I can use it as much as I want,
and that's a little closer
to old-school tools in old Zelda games.
Now, the really useful thing,
aside from breaking rocks
for hidden passageways,
is I can break this right
here, and get a flint.
And I can use that flint to make fire,
which has even more uses.
So, for instance, a big thing
in Breath of the Wild is,
you could cook your own food.
So, I can drop this
tentacle that I've picked up
off of killing an octorok,
and I also dropped my
other flint on accident,
and then, light it on fire,
wait a second so I don't burn myself,
and I got cooked tentacles that I can eat.
Now, it's worth noting
this is the first version of the demo,
and the creator's already
posted a trailer for version two
showing off all kinds of
upgrades and improvements,
including a day and night
cycle, improved visuals,
and even improved basic
physics so you can do things
like roll logs on enemies to deal damage.
Now, all of that being said, if this demo
is something that would interest you,
you better jump on this thing right away
because it's going to get
more and more popular,
and eventually, Nintendo's gonna notice
and as always, we're about two weeks away
from a cease and desist.
(beep) That's not what I meant to do.
You can also start forest
fires, and just run away.
Oh no, no.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
