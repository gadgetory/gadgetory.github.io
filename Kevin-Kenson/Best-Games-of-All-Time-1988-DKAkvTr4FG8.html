king of gaming at the moment beating out
arcades and other home consoles but a
new challenger appears in Japan not long
before the end of the year the Sega
Megadrive known better in the States
as the Sega Genesis the second console
to be released and considered part of
the fourth generation of home gaming
systems despite this fact though this
year consisted of some of the best games
ever to grace the NES and here are 5 of
the best first off is the original Ninja
Gaiden
don't you mean Ninja Gaiden now what's a
little confusing about this game is that
in 1988 two different games called Ninja
Gaiden were released in the States by
the same company the actual Ninja Gaiden
released on NES and an arcade game known
in other countries as shadow warriors
despite the similar name the arcade game
was a traditional single-player
side-scrolling beat'em up while the NES
game is an action platformer that's not
only super challenging but a ton of fun
the game's difficulty stemmed from
relentless enemies time stages and a lot
of platforming that's made more
interesting by being able to hang on to
walls and scale things vertically what's
most impressive about this game though
is that for its time they packed a lot
of plot into it most action games were
very simple there's a bad guy he did a
thing go kill a bunch of his mooks then
go kill the final boss Ninja Gaiden on
the other hand packed a whole freakin
movie into the game featuring 8-bit
style cutscenes between every level that
detailed a whole story complete with all
the important bits like vengeance
intrigue and a love interest this game
spawned a whole trilogy and eventually
led to a series reboot on the Xbox in
2004 second up is Dragon Quest 3
following the success of the first two
Dragon Quest 3 pushed the mechanics of
the series even further featuring a day
and night cycle an open nonlinear world
to explore and the ability to change up
your party with varying classes while it
forms a trilogy with the first two games
it actually takes place first and works
as a prequel to the original game
allowing players to experience an
adventure that has now
legend in the first game it's also one
of the top-selling NES games in Japan of
all time having sold over a million
copies on its first day eventually
hitting 3.8 million it sold so well on
its first day that there were actual
records for arrests of how many students
were truant to go grab the game and play
it instead of going to school sadly
though it didn't have nearly as strong
of an impact in the States mainly
because it was released four years later
arriving at a time when the game's
visuals sound and mechanics all felt
extremely outdated especially since the
Super Nintendo had already been out for
a whole year the third on the list is
contra on the NES now yes contra did
originally come out in arcades in 1987
but the NES version despite having
simplified graphics and mechanics has
become the most recognizable version of
the game following the footsteps of
Double Dragon contra made for one of the
most memorable experiences of local
multiplayer allowing two friends to work
together and shoot down waves of enemies
all while carefully dodging attacks
thrown at them as a single hit meant
certain death this is also a great
example of how games started to flourish
on home console over arcade instead of
having to pour tons of quarters into a
machine to even have a chance of
finishing the game players just have to
keep trying with a limited set of lives
making it not only a lot cheaper in the
end but also a much more attainable goal
for the average gamer also while it
wasn't the first game in the u.s. to use
it it is the game responsible for
popularizing the Konami code where
players could hit up up down down left
right left right BA on the title screen
to start the game with 30 lives rather
than just three

next up is one of my personal favorites
and that's Mega Man 2 well the first
Mega Man had its strengths it wasn't
quite a fully formed experience just yet
and the changes to made to the formula
led to it not only becoming the most
popular Mega Man game but to this day is
still the best-selling one of the
original series this was all thanks to
an overall improvement individuals one
of the most memorable game soundtracks
to date and a balanced sense of
difficulty that was way better than the
original game featuring a handful of
challenging puzzles as opposed to one or
two insanely annoying platforming
segments it also added the password
system giving players a way to continue
their progress rather than have to
restart the game every time they boot it
up and give you a way to heal yourself
on command with etanks whether than
relying on pure blind luck or grinding
enemies for health this game alone
rocketed the series into success leading
to eight more core games and a ton of
spin-offs and reboots like a Megaman X
and Mega Man Battle Network with Mega
Man to this day still being one of the
most iconic video game characters of all
time last but not least is a game that
should honestly surprise no one and is
to this day still argued by many to be
the best game of all time and that's
Super Mario Brothers 3 honestly I don't
think I even need to try and sing this
game's praises the first Mario game was
a big deal by itself but Super Mario 3
made all the right moves to redo the
core formula in an extraordinarily
addictive way ditching the purely linear
approach Mario Brothers 3 was the first
game in the series to make use of a
world map allowing players to tackle
levels in any order they want and also
introducing levels that were completely
optional for upping your score or
grabbing useful items it also had a
ton of incredible power-ups like the
hammer Brothers suit
frog suit fire flower and of course the
Tanooki suit allowing Mario to take
flight and discover all kinds of Secrets
that would otherwise forever elude
players this game was also a perfect
balance of difficulty challenging
first-time players but also allowing for
insane playthroughs by people that knew
what they were doing and had hidden
little secrets everywhere for players to
discover the original Super Mario
Brothers may have started the Plummers
fame but it was
game that truly solidified him as
Nintendo's mascot and launched the
series into its current fame so those
are the best games of 1988 if you
enjoyed the video hit that thumbs up
button to let me know as well subscribe
so you don't miss out on any future
videos like the best of 1989 as always
guys thank you so much for watching and
I'll see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
