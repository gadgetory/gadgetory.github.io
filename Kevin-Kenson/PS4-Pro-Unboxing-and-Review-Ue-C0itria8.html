offering a more powerful piece of
hardware for console gaming to finally
go 4k at least for some games the
unboxing process here is pretty standard
you've got your branded colorful box on
the outside and on the inside a sturdier
cardboard box actually holding
everything opening that up and putting
some paperwork aside first were greeted
with all the accessories that come with
this system including an HDMI cable
headphones USB two micro USB cable for
charging a controller the power cable
which is a different kind than the
original ps4 and ps4 slim and then of
course the revised DualShock 4
controller all that aside all we have
left is of course the PlayStation 4 Pro
how do you feel about the ps4 Pro being
a club sandwich so when I first saw the
ps4 slim I hated it but once they
actually got one in person it really
grown me and I actually really liked it
so I thought maybe that would apply to
the pro as well and not so much I will
say I don't hate it as much as I did
when it was first revealed but I still
don't think it's a very good looking
system the triple-layer just doesn't
work for me and now that I'm able to
take a closer look there are some other
changes that I'm really not feeling well
the slim moved the originals
front-facing buttons to the inside lip
the pro has put them on the front again
in a new style there's this thin strip
of material almost like a little tiny
flap with the left and right side
pushing in for power and eject now
personally I'm not a big fan of
front-facing buttons that you can push
real easy as rare as it is if you play
games often chances are there's going to
be some really bizarre circumstance that
happens where your system gets shut off
mid game which is always annoying one
thing I do like that's a nice little
touch to help signify this as a more
powerful system is that the PlayStation
logo on the pro is a fully reflective
surface as opposed to the Slim's glossy
black which just looks awesome
as far as other bits about the build we
still have two front-facing USB ports
but the pro also offers an additional
USB port in the back which is nice to
have for something like an external hard
drive or for hooking up the psvr without
clutter
the front of your system everything else
is pretty much the same as the slim
other than the rien clusion of an
optical port and a different input for
power so after a quick and easy set up
we've got the pro running and it's
interesting to me what things are
noticeably different and what are not
people say it's more quiet but is it
really the original ps4 was really
really loud and thankfully it got a lot
more quiet with the revised ps4 and the
ps4 slim and the pro is pretty much on
par with those it's maybe a little more
quiet than the slim but the fact that
matter is as soon as that fan kicks on
you're gonna know now ask for something
that's still the same from the original
ps4 is that the pro really does nothing
interface wise right now to push an
advertise which your games benefit from
the tech you can find out by looking it
up online or reading in depth info on a
game by game basis but just browsing the
interface there's really nothing here to
help denote or excite users over which
of their games can now run in 4k or have
visual updates this doesn't detract from
the good the system does obviously the
fact that games can run better is
amazing it just seems odd that you don't
have a clear identifier while browsing
your games what will and will not
benefit from the pro is it worth buying
if I only play one or two games now this
one depends a lot on which exact one or
two games you're playing because while
the ps4 Pro does support 4k gaming what
that means from game to game actually
varies quite a bit
some like The Last of Us can actually
run a native 4k well there are others
that are just 1440p up scaled like
Uncharted 4 and then there's games that
just flat-out don't have Pro
compatibility which means that your
games are going to run just like they
would on a regular ps4 but with 1080p
upscale to 4k with no extra polish if
none of the games you care about offer
Pro compatibility then there's not a lot
that system is going to offer you over a
slim other than an extra USB port and a
larger hard drive but if those few games
you play do have a pro
then honestly it's a pretty easy yes
it's also an excellent option if you
want a special edition sandwich console</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
