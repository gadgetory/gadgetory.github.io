controller options for the PS4,
there's been two, main
competing companies lately.
Razer, with their Raiju
line of controllers,
and Skuf, with their most
recent release, the Vantage,
but there's a new challenger approaching
that might shake things up a little bit,
from Astro with the C40 TR.
Now, if you're not familiar with Astro,
they're actually known for making
very high-quality gaming headsets,
and the C40 is their first
entry into Pro controllers.
So, it's going to be very interesting
to see how it actually
stacks up to the competition.
So, we're going to take a look at
how the buttons and
controller itself feel,
what kind of special features it offers,
and just how exactly compares
to the Skuf and Razer options.
So, first off, how does it
actually handle as a controller?
Well, the grip design
on it is really nice.
Something that is done
a little differently
from the competition is,
instead of focusing on
making a grippy texture,
where your fingers go, it
instead uses this material
around the whole main
body of the controller,
that's this slightly softer rubber.
It feels a little more slippery, at first,
but it actually performs better
once you hands, maybe, get a little sweaty
from longterm gameplay.
Something that I noticed right
away, too, with this grip
that I really appreciate
is, like the Raiju Ultimate,
the programmable buttons are placed
on the back side of the
controller, near the grips.
But, something about the way
that they're slightly more offset
and have a bit more resistance,
it's a lot harder to
accidentally press them.
This isn't something that
happens a ton with the Raiju,
but when you're first getting used to it,
I find you can accidentally
do that a lot with your grip.
This one, has not happened with me yet,
which I really appreciate.
Now, as for all the buttons and sticks,
as far as the stick quality goes,
there's a couple different
options to choose from,
which we'll talk about a little later,
but as far as the movement on them goes,
it's a very nice, smooth motion.
You don't really feel any
resistance, which is nice.
The D-pad that it comes with,
and again, we'll talk about
what that means exactly later,
is definitely one that's focused
more on a modern day approach to D-pads,
where it's a very clicky one
that hits one of the four
directions, and that's about it.
It's not great for rolly motions.
I wouldn't use it for a fighting game.
But, in an FPS, or something,
where I'm just using it to select items,
or powers, or whatever,
it works really nicely.
As for the shoulder buttons,
the front ones are nice and clicky.
The back triggers are a little looser
than I would personally like,
but I think it is a really good level
and has just the right
amount of draw pull.
You can also adjust them to be short stop,
which is a handy little feature.
The only part of this
controller, honestly,
as far as the buttons go,
that leaves me just a little underwhelmed,
is the front-facing buttons right here.
They're not bad by any means,
but compared to a lot of other
Pro controllers I've used,
they just feel fairly normal.
They don't really have
the right amount of push
back that I like to have.
It sometimes feels like they just stick
for a slight, split second
longer than I'm comfortable with.
So, when it comes to very rapid pressing,
it just doesn't have the
same kind of responsiveness
that you're gonna see
from its competitors.
Other simple features that are located
right on the controller itself is that
you can switch between
two different profiles
that you can customize,
using software for the C40,
and you can switch between
a dedicated wired or wireless connection.
Now, something that this
controller does different
from other options is that
for it's wireless connection,
it uses a dedicated dongle.
It is not something that's
using built-in Bluetooth,
which, on the one hand,
yes Bluetooth does have a
nice simplicity about it,
because you don't have to worry
about plugging something in,
and possibly forgetting or
losing it, but thankfully,
there is a slot to store the
dongle in the carrying case,
so you have a nice place to put it away,
and it's gonna make sure
that you have a nice,
dedicated connection,
instead of having to worry about,
sometimes, Bluetooth
issues that can come up.
For instance, when the
Vantage first came up,
people constantly had issues reconnecting.
That's not going to happen with this.
Next, let's talk customization
and special features.
So, there's two main ways
you can do this with the C40.
One, there's modular, physical changes
you can do on the controller itself,
and two, programmable changes you can use,
making use of the C40
configuration software.
Now, the physical changes
are really I would say
are the hallmark of this thing's design,
'cause it takes things just a step further
than other Pro controllers.
See, plenty of other Pro
controllers out there
give you the option to
change out stick heads,
and even change the D-pad design,
but what the C40 does that
separates itself from the rest,
is that you can actually remove
this entire front faceplate,
and swap the D-pad and stick
locations, so it's your choice
whether you want to use
symmetrical or offset sticks.
Now, in order to do
this, you do need to use
a screwdriver tool that
comes with the C40,
which I'm always pretty mixed
on needing to have side tools
to make modifications to controllers.
But, like with the USB
dongle, I do really appreciate
that the carrying case the C40 comes with
has a slot to put that screwdriver,
so it's not going to be some tool
that you shove in a drawer, forget about,
and it gets mixed in with everything else.
It has a place to stay, so you make sure
it's always within arm's reach
whenever you need to make
changes to the controller.
Along with the ability
to swap the D-pad and stick locations,
the C40 does also come with
a number of sticks to choose
from that you can swap,
as well, including two,
short, concave ones,
like these, which are the stock design.
You get a pair of convex,
short-length ones, as well,
and then, two separate,
long-length sticks,
one convex, one concave.
What it doesn't come with when it ships
is an alternate D-pad design,
which bothers me a little bit.
Because there's a slot
on the carrying case
you can store additional D-pad options,
and Astro has also advertised
that additional accessory
options are going to be available
on their website down the line,
although none are listed just yet.
And, it just seems weird to
me that for a $200 controller,
you don't get at least
one alternate D-pad option
right out of the bag.
Now, while I do wish it shipped
with more options for the D-pad,
I do think it's really cool
that Astro actually shows this concept
for longterm growth and
customization of the controller,
where yeah, here's all the
basic stuff you need right now,
but as time goes on, maybe
new stick options come out
with different stick designs.
Maybe there's more D-pad
options to choose from.
I think that's a really
cool, longterm form
of support for the controller.
As for programmable
changes of the controller,
all of this is accessible
through the C40 configuration software
that you can get for PC.
And, it opens up a lot
of fairly traditional
Pro controller options
that are really nice to have.
You can change stick
sensitivity, trigger sensitivity.
You can remap not only the
programmable buttons on the back,
but also all the front
facing and shoulder buttons,
and stick click-ins, if you'd like to,
as well, and the D-pad.
You can also adjust how
strong the rumble is
on each side of the controller,
how bright the LED light is,
and to really show that Astro
is first and foremost an audio company,
you do have the option to also adjust
the EQ balance of the audio
that comes out of the mic jack,
which is a nice, little touch.
Now, while most of these features
are exclusive to that
configuration software,
something that you can do on board
if you don't want to take
the time to mess with that,
is that you can program,
at least the two buttons on the back,
using onboard controls,
by using this little
reprogram button right here.
You hold that, hit the
one you want to program,
then hit whatever button
you want to map to it,
so you can do that on the fly.
So, all this technical stuff aside,
I know the real question
you guys are wondering
is, is this worth grabbing
over the Razer Raiju, or the Skuf Vantage?
And, the answer I have
for you is, kind of.
I think something that's very interesting
about this set of Pro controllers
is that each of them clearly had
a different main goal in mind,
and they each accomplish that fairly well.
For starters, when it comes
to straight build quality,
the Raiju is the winner.
I think it has the best grip shape.
I think it has the most
comfortable design,
and while you can't really
customize your change too much
on the actual, physical
body of the controller,
you don't really need to, because
it all feels really great.
And, it does still have
some programmable options
for more fine-tune kind of stuff.
On the other hand, the Skuf
Vantage is all about modularity.
You can swap the sticks, swap the D-pad.
It has the most programmable buttons
that you can add and remove,
and you can even rip
out the rumble motors,
and do all of that without
any kind of offhand tool.
You can just do that
right on the main body,
which is super nice.
It's also the most
affordable of the three.
The C40, on the other hand,
kinda walks a middle
path between these two.
All three controllers offer
what I think are some
of the important aspects
that are common across different
Pro controllers right now,
programmable buttons, the
ability to switch between
a dedicated wired or wireless connection,
and just overall, a
nicer, better grip design
versus what other controllers
traditionally have.
When it comes to customization,
the C40 is offering you
both that physical modularity
and programmable customization
at the same time.
It doesn't really hit
either of those notes
quite as hard as the other
competitors, but it does both,
giving it, quite possibly,
the greatest versatility.
I think the biggest thing
that really helps make
this an attractive choice
is that option to swap between
offset or parallel sticks.
Because, if you end up
liking a preferred style,
depending on the game
you're playing, well,
the Skuf is going to have you
stuck in the offset style,
the Raiju Ultimate's gonna
have you stuck in the parallel.
This one isn't gonna force you,
you can use either one you like,
depending on the situation.
And that's a really cool, unique feature.
And, I think the most
exciting aspect of that
is those options are only
going to continue to grow.
If Astro is going to start
offering more stick designs
and more D-pad options on their website,
which we don't have any listed yet,
but if those things start showing up,
this might just, over time,
turn into the best option out there.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
