mean really shitty games the kind of
games that cause companies to go into
millions of debt ruin reputations and in
some cases bring down entire industries
first off is one of the most notorious
games ever to claw its way out of
development hell Duke Nukem Forever the
original Duke Nukem 3d was a big deal
for its time and obviously it needed a
sequel and the one planned was going to
trump the original in every conceivable
way or at least that was the plan
forever started in development in 96
originally slated for a release in the
holiday season for 97 or 98 the game's
first push back happened when the lead
designer realised how the game was
falling behind its competition
technologically and decided to change
from using the original engine from Duke
Nukem 3d over to the newer quake 2
engine this was the first of many
changes that became a vicious cycle
throughout the years as 3d realms tried
to constantly change and adapt the game
to whatever big successful titles came
out eventually the team sunk 20 million
of their own dollars failed to finish
the game in time and almost everyone was
let go and downsized the scraps of what
were left of the game were brought to
gearbox who convinced take-two
interactive to let them finish it
finally releasing the game in 2011 15
years after development first started
and sadly the game we got was well just
awful the years of push backs showed
obvious signs of aging as just about
everything in game was outdated from its
visuals and sound to gameplay mechanics
to even its writing with jokes
referencing pop culture from as early as
2000 is for pussies it was considered by
many to be the worst game of 2011 and
one of the biggest disappointments in
gaming history second up is daikatana
this was another mid-90s experiment that
tried as hard as it could to be the next
huge game only to crash and burn pretty
magnificently the original big push for
this game came from the fact that its
lead designer John Romero was something
of a game dev celebrity at the time
having been one of the leading minds
behind the games that pioneered the FPS
genre like Wolfenstein doom and quake
daikatana was going to be the first huge
game to come from him and his new dev
team at ion storm and his aspirations
for it were pretty lofty planning to
have 24 levels taking place across four
different time periods with huge weapon
variety for the time just like with Duke
Nukem Forever the game hit pushbacks
when the team decided to change engines
Midway
pushing its release back to 2000 along
with releasing a demo at e3 that only
played at 12 frames per second despite
the name power and promises behind it
the game was terrible with one of its
biggest downfalls coming from focusing
on protecting and working alongside a
pair of AI teammates who were complete
idiots and their deaths would cause a
game over it also doesn't help that this
game had one of the dumbest and most
offensive ads ever that even Romero
wasn't a fan of which was a simple all
Dredd page saying John Romero's about to
make you his bitch suck it down because
there is no better way to advertise your
game than to trash-talk your entire
consumer base number three is one of the
most recent failures in gaming memory
now sonic is a franchise that's had its
fair share of ups and downs
starting in its glory days on the Sega
Genesis to a weaker spin-off on the Sega
Saturn a kind of mini revival on the
Dreamcast and GameCube with Sonic
Adventure and then back-to-back
disappointments like Sonic oh 6 and
Sonic Unleashed despite this though the
series has survived
but is now reeling from the abomination
that was sonicboom rise of lyric on the
Wii U this was the result of Sega's
misguided attempt at trying to make a
Sonic game directly pandering to Western
audiences the entire sonic boom
franchise consisting of a TV show Wii U
game and 3ds game was meant to not
reboot the series but rather be an
offshoot that Westerners would enjoy
more and in fact the games weren't even
originally planned to see a release in
Japan but they ended up not being lucky
enough to avoid it the game's
development was outsourced to an
American dev team red button games the
logic being that a Western team could do
a better job of making a game Westerners
would want what we got instead was one
of the glitch iasts and worst written
Sonic games ever with bugs so aplenty
that they were even easily exploitable
like being able to jump infinitely by
just pausing the game sonic boom ended
up being the worst reviewed Sonic game
ever and the least selling with sales
from both the Wii U and 3ds game
combined barely hitting over 600,000
total which is abysmal ehlo for a
franchise so well known next up is a
port of a video game classic that on the
surface might sound as though it did
really well but in fact it helped lead
to the ruin of an entire company and
that's pac-man on the Atari 2600 pac-man
was a huge hit in arcades in the early
80s and as a way to try and cash in on
it Atari got the rights to make a home
console version thinking it would be a
pretty simple task considering the
simplicity of the game development took
four months and during that time one
particularly big problem showed up the
hardware pac-man arcade cabinets ran
with four kilobytes of RAM whereas an
Atari 2600 only had 128 bytes this led
to the Atari version of the game cutting
all kinds of corners and doing weird
tricks to work on the system this
included replacing the game's white
pellets with orange blocks the same ones
used to create the game's walls and only
displaying each of the game's ghosts
at a time each and every frame causing
them to flicker rapidly needless to say
the game wasn't received well by critics
but did go on to sell really well being
the biggest selling game on Atari at the
7 million units sounds great right well
the problem is Atari made 12 million
copies of this game meaning they only
sold a bit over 1/2 which is especially
bizarre when you figure that at the time
only an estimated 10 million Atari 2600
s were in active use the company assumed
the game would easily sell to every
current owner and drive demandin
purchases for new systems and coupled
with the licensing fees to Namco and the
marketing for the game Atari ended up
losing a lot of money and this goes hand
in hand with number 5 on the list easily
the most well known financial flop and
one of the worst games ever made bTW the
video game the entire project was doomed
from the start
with the CEO of Ataris parent company
Warner making a deal with Steven
Spielberg that the game would be a huge
hit due to the movies success and could
be made in as little as five and a half
weeks to be ready for the 82 holiday
season it's been estimated that the
license for this game costs twenty to
twenty five million dollars and even
Atari CEO Steve Ross thought this was a
bad idea from the start the lead man in
charge of development Howard Scott
Warshaw took the short dev time as a
challenge and was convinced he could
build an epic movie based game in time
with all kinds of grandiose plans like
searching a planet for collectible
pieces avoiding obstacles and solving
puzzles fun story spielberg himself
didn't think this route was a good idea
wondering why they just couldn't make a
simple fun game along the lines of
pac-man Warshaw ignored this criticism
pushed forward with his plans and the
rest is history et only sold 1.5 million
units of the estimated four to five
million made and a lot of those copies
ended up getting returned as scathing
reviews and disappointed customers
acted years later an urban legend
surfaced that Atari buried unsold copies
of the game in the middle of the desert
which actually ended up being proven
true in 2014 when the landfill in New
Mexico was dug up stuffed with copies of
ET and other games and systems pac-man
and ET combined did so much damage that
Atari reported a quarterly loss of 536
million dollars which adjusted for
inflation today comes in at just under
1.3 billion while not the only causes
these two games played the largest hand
in the game crash of 1983 in which Atari
was split up into multiple smaller
companies and home console market was
basically dead for two years until
Japanese companies like Nintendo and
Sega started bringing their systems and
games over so those are 5 of the biggest
failures in gaming history if you
enjoyed the video hit that thumbs up
button to let me know as well as
subscribe and as always guys thank you
so much for watching and I'll see you
later</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
