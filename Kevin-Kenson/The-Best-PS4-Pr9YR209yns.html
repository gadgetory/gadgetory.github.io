started and by far one of the coolest
things about this is the limited edition
ps4 slim
you gotta say when I first saw pictures
of this thing my immediate thought was
that looks really good this is the
best-looking ps4 slim and possibly even
just the best-looking PS where they
released so far and seeing it in person
just further confirms it
last time was just one solid color
where's this time we're doing this blue
design which looks really nice on top of
it you're getting this gold symbols on
the top which look
even when I'm kind of noticing certain
things about it that I'm normally not a
huge fan of like for instance I know
I've told you guys a bunch times before
I don't like how Sony is obsessed with
doing gloss tops on their special
editions and while that normally is true
it works really well here you know
especially because they're using a
mixture of a matte color and a metallic
where we have the gold just all together
on the gloss looks really nice
if I want to be nitpicky there are some
little things about it that do bother me
mostly having to do with the controller
and a part of the system you're never
going to see for the controller the blue
looks really nice personally I'm just
not a huge fan of when on the controller
touch pad they do this sort of
patterning design where they just put
the symbols over and over and over again
personal I'm just not a big fan of that
I would have much rather just seen you
know in bigger letters each symbol once
across the middle I think that would
have looked better but you know personal
preference as for the system this is
super nitpicky and minor but if we're
gonna talk about negatives it's on the
back side right here so the feed designs
they always have the couple of rubber
ones mixed in and normally while they
are a different color than the other
feet it's not that noticeable because
it's usually pretty dull tones but with
how vibrant this blue is you really
notice the gray on the circular and X
feet right here super nitpicky thing I
know but yeah so other than just those
two things though honestly this is an
incredible looking system by the way
guys I'm gonna be taking a lot of still
shots of this thing to put on my
Instagram so if you guys want to see
more of it make sure to check that out
now so you may be looking at this system
the design on top with the square
triangle X and circle a might be
wondering why are those things that
PlayStation uses well it's actually
really interesting it was talked about
back in 2010 in an interview with the
guy that designed the original ps1
controller TEI you Guto i hope i
pronounced that right and it's really
interesting how this came to be so at
the time when the ps1 was being designed
the biggest competitors were Nintendo
and Sega and for them their controllers
all use the same kind of basic design of
using just letters like a B X Y so and
so forth and somebody's using colorful
buttons as well they wanted to do
something different to help
differentiate their controller and so
the idea was to use symbols instead that
represented different things that might
be used in game it's not always
that actual direct comparison but that's
the idea so for the triangle the ideas
that associates with point of view the
character's head what direction the
cameras looking at that kind of idea
with the square it's supposed to be a
piece of paper or a menu something that
brings up an option select for in-game
menu stuff aside from traditional
options the X and O are by far the
simplest ones which are simply yes and
no X being no cancel whatever circle
being yes except so on so forth which is
really funny because I always get
confusing with American ports of games
because X is always one for select so it
gets really confusing sometimes and
really fun fact about this to by the way
is that the designer also picked what
colors he wanted each one to be and
apparently had arguments with other
co-workers over the fact that he wanted
the X which is decline to be blue and
the circle which is accept to be red
because everyone's like doesn't that
make more sense feel around he's like no
this is what we're doing this is what I
want so that's how those symbols came to
be and honestly I think they've been
incorporated beautifully into the
systems design I know I said earlier
that when I first saw this thing I
thought was like oh wow this is one of
the best ps4 slims they've done and yeah
I definitely still think that I mean
they have some other ones that your
mileage may vary where you might like a
certain color more but as far as
incorporating a great color choice with
a cool design definitely best looking
slim and probably the best-looking of
all poise for designs even compared to
pros I think maybe the God of War one
gives it some competition but yeah this
is definitely the best-looking one of my
opinion these are showing up in stores
right now it's really hard to do any
kind of like online rugger ones because
those went up earlier but you might have
your luck in a store we'll put a link
down below just forget to check out and
I'll see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
