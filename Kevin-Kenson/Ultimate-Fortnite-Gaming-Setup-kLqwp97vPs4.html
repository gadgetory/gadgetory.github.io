games right now okay let's be honest the
biggest game right now is for tonight
and to celebrate that we wanted to do a
gaming set up based on it now in the
past we have done a couple of their
gaming themed subs before we did a Zelda
switch when did a CSU's Xbox in those
cases we took the extra pup doing a
painted system which can look really
great but is also not very cheap and as
in fact just super expensive so we won't
do something a little different this
time that was much more affordable the
first step is to get a ps4 and the right
color we want to celebrate for a night
the problem is is that when it comes to
colors and Playstation well right now
there's not really a whole lot options
in fact there's really none because
they're all different just shades of
white black or metallic doesn't really
have a colorful vibe to it like in
fortnight's so we decided to get a D
brand skin in this case won't for a blue
system party doesn't really have any one
singular strong color it kind of changes
with the seasons but blue is one that's
always kind of stuck with me as being
part of the game so let's set that up
right now
I did so we now have a blue ps4 which
I'm really surprised I didn't mess up
other than missing the inside of the
four here
well it's gone what we're just gonna
ignore that we have a blue ps4 which on
its own doesn't exactly scream fortnight
yet we still have to add one more thing
and that's decals we're just gonna add
the real flavour now there's a couple
ways you can go with this we've picked
up a couple options but there's only
enough room to fit one of them first
we've got the big obvious guy big ol
fortnight logos sticker so this is gonna
cover up most of the ps4 it's definitely
gonna give the idea a four-night right
away but personally I've always said
many times before I don't like shoving
the name of stuff on the systems I want
to be a little more subtle than that
plus with this sticker we're actually
cover up the PlayStation logo which I'm
not really feeling either so instead
we're gonna go with hang gliding onto
the mat now with this guy it's small
enough that we actually have to choose
which part of the ps4 we want to put it
on since the energy of kind of floating
down the hang glider's going this way
I'm feeling the upper right-hand corner
right here so let's put that on
so as you can see we have gone with a
desk set up for our for tonight ps4
theme and the reason for that is that at
its heart for Knight is a competitive
game and when I think of competitive
gaming I think of a desk setup you know
living room setups are great and all but
I usually think of that being more
relaxed like back you're doing some
single-player gaming for something
competitive though I think desk setup
it's all tight it's your battle station
everything's all together so along with
the ps4 that we've customized we have a
couple of things on here that also still
celebrate for at night first off there's
a little replica of the Boogie bomb
which is really cool actually because it
comes with a little remote where right
now we have it set towards shifting
through all the different colors but you
can also do it to where it's just one
solid color or it's blinking all the
colors a lot faster than is right now
the other thing we got which is actually
my personal favorite I'm blocking right
now it's this guy it's just a little
light-up sign that uses LED lights below
to create the fortnight logo in a really
cool-looking way it's kind of like that
dock dock that we have for the switch I
just think it looks really awesome and
really ties the whole setup together now
of course with four denied being a
competitive game we can't just talk
about aesthetics with this setup we also
got to talk about what kind of
accessories to outfit your ps4 with to
give you the biggest edge in the game
and the two biggest and most important
are of course a headset and a controller
now starting with headset we've got this
guy back here the arctas Pro Wireless
this has become my favorite head so that
I've been using i use it on ps4 and pc
all the time it has great audio quality
great sense of direction doesn't come
cheap but it is worth it now they do
make a wired version of this that's a
little cheaper which could work in this
desk sap but I really wanted to keep the
whole thing looking clean and so I went
with the wireless to keep that look next
let's talk about controllers now of
course you could just stick with the
standard Dual Shock 4 like I've gotten
display right there but you want to
about pro controller options there's two
that I really liked for PlayStation
first if you want a wired option for
that super low response time I love the
Nikon revolution this is actually one of
the first pro controllers they did for
the ps4 and it's a really good one I
like the fact that it uses the higher up
left stick like an Xbox which I just
think is more comfortable and it uses
the mix up of concave and convex heads
most importantly for for tonight though
is that
gonna give you remapping buttons on the
back of the controller which are really
easy to access and hit now if you
instead want something that's wireless
to maintain that nice clean look here I
really like the scuff impact this is
basically just a heavily modified ps4
controller which is why it's still
wireless but you're gonna get a much
better grip design and once again you're
getting those back paddles for more
control options so there you have our
fortnight ps4 setup if you want to get
some more luxe to this thing check out
my Instagram we're gonna put up a whole
bunch of pictures of it there if you're
interested in the stuff that we featured
in this video we're gonna link that down
below as well and I will see you guys
later hey why don't this thing being
used in the final</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
