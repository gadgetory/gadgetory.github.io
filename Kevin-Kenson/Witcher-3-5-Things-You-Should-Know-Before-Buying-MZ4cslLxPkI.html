week and before you throw all your money
down on a pre-order or try to pick it up
on launch day here's five things you
should know before grabbing it starting
with just how big it's going to be now
of course this wouldn't be the first
time that a developer inflated or
overestimated just how long their game
is but if CD Projekt Reds play testers
are to be believed - the game can be as
long as twenty-five hours when you're
speedrunning it actually taking your
time and doing all the different quests
you can can supposedly take as long as
200 hours now of course that probably
isn't going to be the average play time
but with a number that high hopefully
that means that the game can be a
healthy hundred hours for the average
gamer now there are a number of reasons
why this game is supposedly going to be
that long the first of which is the fact
that this is the first Witcher game to
take place in an open world and this
actually leads on to the second point
because it's not just how large the
world is but the fact that it's also
supposedly a living one now this is
something that we've heard a number of
different devs promise time and time
again that has sadly left a lot of
gamers jaded but if it's proven true
could be really awesome about Witcher 3
and that's the fact of this game is
fully alive this includes a living
economy where what you do in the game
affects the prices of things you can buy
and sell and the fact that all the
monsters beasts and people live their
own lives outside of what you do as the
player not to mention the fact that the
game is promising one of the most
realistic senses of time including the
fact that as you adventure your beard
will actually grow now as far as other
cool new additions to the series go the
third point is the fact that this game
will be the first one to feature a fully
playable second character in the form of
Geralt foster daughter ciri now as far
as the full extent of what this means we
don't actually know yet we don't know if
she's going to handle that interestingly
different from Geralt if it's just going
to be a few side quests or her own full
story or if you can even do the full
free room as her but the fact that you
actually have a full other character to
play house is always a fun new addition
to any game especially when it's done
right now of course not everything we've
heard about this game leading up to
launch has been good news starting with
our fourth point the fact the game has
had a graphics downgrade if you compare
how the game looks and recently revealed
gameplay and leaked footage to what it
looked like back during the original III
announcements it's clearly worse there's
not nearly as much detail or as good of
lighting now
on the one hand this is something that
the devs did reveal before launch it's
not some kind of big nasty surprise and
supposedly this is due to the fact they
wanted the game to be more stable not
because they want to achieve some sort
of console parity where the PC version
doesn't look leagues better than its
console versions now hopefully this is
true and as long as the game plays solid
I'm happy but if this ends up being
another watchdog situation where after
the game comes out we find a hidden game
files that make it look better and
doesn't affect the gameplay at all well
that's just going to be disappointing
but hopefully that's not the case now
last but not least is something that a
lot of people have gotten used to with a
lot of other games but I'm just a little
disappointed to hear about it being
integrated into the Witcher 3 and that's
paid for DLC the first two Witcher games
offered a lot of free DLC that was added
over time and eventually accumulated
into an enhanced edition where even if
you bought the game back at launch
you're going to get all that bonus DLC
completely free this time around however
while Witcher 3 will have free DLC as
well it's also going to be the first
game to have paid for DLC 2 which are
basically expansion packs the first one
costing $10 and the second costing 20
you're going to be able to buy both them
together in a season pass already for
$25 now supposedly the content from
these is actually going to be rather
sizeable the first one being as long as
10 hours of content and the second being
20 which if that's true that's awesome
I'm always down for proper expansion
packs that actually add diverse and new
content worth what you're paying for but
a company that before was trying to
avoid any kind of paid for DLC and now
offering it that's just something that
makes me just a little disappointed and
hopefully doesn't start them on any kind
of slippery slope now of course these
are just things the developers have been
emphasizing up until launch there's a
whole lot more about this game that I am
excited for that will hopefully be
returning from previous games including
a really detailed world great monster
hunting mechanics and most importantly
moral choices that are a lot more
complex and interesting other than just
do you want to save a baby or kick this
puppy how much of this holds true and
whether or not I'm happy or pissed about
it I'll let you guys know after the game
gets released next week as always guys
