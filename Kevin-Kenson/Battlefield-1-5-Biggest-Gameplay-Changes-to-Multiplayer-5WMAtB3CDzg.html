the movement to World War one comes with
some noticeable and some subtle
differences to the battlefield formula
so for those of you planning to grab it
here's five of the biggest changes first
up slower pacing to reflect this older
era of war weapons I'll handle a bit
different from what you might be
accustomed to in past battlefield games
it's nothing super dramatic and is
definitely more stylized than actual
history but it does affect the flow of
the game reload times and rate of fire
are a bit slower with fully automatic
weapons having less precision this means
that it takes a little more work to kill
enemies and slows down the overall pace
of the game it also brings down the
scale of skirmishes a bit even in large
maps with large open areas you'd be
surprised how often mid and close range
combat will occur with melee attacks
being an option much more often this
helps to keep the battlefield feeling of
huge sweeping landscapes with vehicles
while still giving players a bit more of
an up-close visceral experience though
sniping is still aplenty so no running
out in the open like moron number 2
weapon variety guns now have multiple
designs each gun has a stock version
that's the baseline with two different
upgraded versions available offering
different focuses for instance one might
offer improved handling accuracy whereas
another reduces your damage a little in
exchange for a higher rate of fire or
maybe even better hip shooting accuracy
so it's easier to use in close quarters
combat and when you want to melee
someone this makes your options a little
simpler while still giving you some
choices that are more fine-tuned your
play style keeping the total list of
guns kind of small but still have
variety next up elite classes every map
offers specialist kit drops that
temporarily change players into a
special elite class in some ways
reminiscent of what dice did in Star
Wars Battlefront with the hero power-ups
doesn't matter what class you're playing
as at the time or what weapons you're
using as soon as you pick up one of
these kits you get armed with a
devastating weapon like the flamethrower
or a chain gun with heavy armor making
you a much more powerful unit that can
tear apart whole squads of players
though you still got to be careful while
powerful these elite classes each have
some pretty exploitable faults such as
the flamethrower having low mobility and
no long-range options or the chain gun
that doesn't allow you to wear a gas
mask so you're super vulnerable to
chemical grenades these classes give you
a whole lot of firepower but a smart
player is
gonna know how to counter him forth up
dynamic weather weather plays a much
larger role in this game maps now have
various different weather effects that
can change mid-match and can directly
impact gameplay for instance strong
winds and sandstorms can make it really
difficult to fly airplanes while dense
fog can make vehicles and longer range
options not the greatest of ideas
forcing players to rely on close
quarters combat even if the map is
usually wide open which is a great idea
because it forces a degree of
unpredictability and randomness on
players that requires adaptation not to
mention it ups the immersion factor in
the game considerably adding all kinds
of stuff like mud forming in the rain
and players vision getting obscured and
then of course we have behemoths each
map features one of these beasts in
conquest or operations mode where once a
team is losing by a significant enough
margin one of these monstrous vehicles
will spawn for their side as a comeback
mechanic these include an armored train
a dreadnought warship and the most
iconic one they've been pushing the
airship these vehicles offer multiple
gunner positions for players to mow down
their enemies and can deal a pretty
massive blow to the enemy if the team
doesn't come together and take them down
maps do offer numerous weapon
installations for dealing with these
threats and there's ways to cripple
their offensive power immediately if you
act fast enough so it's on insta wind
card but definitely a painful
distraction and put the brakes on the
winning team's momentum
this makes one-sided matches a lot less
likely as any early on losing streak can
turn into a powerful comeback thanks to
one of these monsters also there's a
part in the campaign where you fly as a
pigeon game of the year</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
