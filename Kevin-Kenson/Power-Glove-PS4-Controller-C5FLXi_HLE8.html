when it comes to this idea of
revolutionize and control the usual
driving forces to make something that's
more comfortable more ergonomic
something that's very intuitive and a
very classic concept for this with a
very infamous example is the power glove
a controller that you can wield
single-handedly and control a whole game
with gestures alone now the power glove
is a very popular example of this but it
wasn't the last controller to do it in
fact we actually found a very weird
option that came out later the reality
quest controller this PlayStation
controller is one of two models I was
able to find that uses the reality quest
name the other one being an n64 designed
and what's interesting about how it
differentiates self-empowered glove is
that it's not so much a glove really as
it's more of a brace a cast or even just
kind of a grip the very basic concept of
it is actually really interesting
because it's not quite as ambitious and
it's a design but it's kind of smart at
the same time so you've got buttons here
that your fingers able to rest on for
the main-floor front-facing ones also
buttons for the front shoulder buttons
on a Playstation controller on the side
here you're able to access again the l1
and r1 as well as l2 and r2 now this is
meant to emulate an original playstation
controller so it's not worrying about
dual analog sticks it's only worried
about the d-pad and the way it
stimulates that is this little swivel
hinge right here so based on how you
actually move your hand while you're
wearing the grip that's doing the deep
now I wasn't actually able to find too
much information on these the only thing
I could find for the PlayStation version
is a single archived article written
back when this was first shown off at e3
what year I'm not quite sure and the
information there is somewhat helpful
but still leaves a few gray areas in its
design for instance this button right
here is actually designed to access some
configuration options like being able to
invert the d-pad for certain games like
if you want down to be up and up to be
down usually useful things like flight
simulators as well as sensitivity
options for the swivel that's all the
article says it doesn't actually say how
it works or what buttons used in
conjunction with it so not really sure
how to wield it specifically but that is
what that buttons for now on the
underside of the grip is a little switch
with three little letters and what that
stands for is digital
or simulated analog and what that means
it is changing the way that the movement
on the wrist right here how it's read by
the system whether it's being read as a
digital control which is the standard on
PlayStation controllers or being read as
an analog input for more precise control
as for what this controller was actually
designed for well that's not quite as
clear and the one single article I was
able to find there was some talking with
the reps behind it
discussing what kind of games it would
necessarily be better for and a lot of
the lines up with the kind of logic
we've used before with other weird
controllers for instance raising games
are pretty easy because you only have to
worry about hitting one of two buttons
accelerate or break and you can turn by
just moving controller left and right
that's all I got to worry about on the
other hand something that's more
advanced or crazy like an action game or
a sports title this is gonna be a bit
more of a nightmare one of the
interesting things to me that stood out
though was the argument that this would
work well for fighting games which I'm
not really sold on just imagining having
to do things like DoubleTap the d-pad
sounds like a nightmare because you're
just very quickly doing this and that
just seems more annoying than useful and
not to mention keeping track of where
your fingers are on which buttons and
they're trying to input combos so it's
not really clear this was meant to give
you any kind of advantage in a
particular game my best guess is that
the lead benefit of this is for
situations where you only really have
great use of your right hand it's
something that would be very useful for
any one kind of handicap issue where
you're only worrying about using one
hand because you control it if you need
to use your left hand not so much but if
you have a good right hand this would
give you a way to control with only one
hand in a way that's a little more
feasible than past one hand to
controller options we've looked at I
think it's also worth noting that
something the article didn't talk about
is that it would be a really good fit
for an RPG something like an old-school
fun a fancy game because in that case
you're not really worried about complex
inputs at all you're just wearing the
glove and doing movements you need to
select different menu options giving you
a free hand to I don't know play a cell
phone game at the same time or something
it's it's a bizarre cell after getting
the reality question missing rows a
little bit we realized it's kind of
important to have a power glove to talk
about the history of this entire design
style
I loved power glove
it's pressing Lee enough we actually
haven't picked up a power glove yet so
in fact today we actually went out and
hunted one down my local games try they
normally go to didn't have any in stock
since it was so short notice but he
actually recommended me another guy in
the area the store called what up games
were able to find one complete in the
box to check out and we actually have it
right here which is in awesome condition
so the power glove compared to the
reality quest is really interesting
because in a lot of ways it was much
more ambitious in terms of how it worked
now of course you do have just the
regular controls up top of the
controller here kind of like the reality
quest has with where your fingers go you
have access to a d-pad a and B start
slices so on so on but where it gets
weirder is the programming buttons up
top right here so with these you could
do things like a just having a turbo
function or changing out things are red
but you also do actual full programmable
macros which was weird for its time
what's really intensive but the power
glove though is how it handed a little
motion controls number two ways it did
this the first is by having fiber-optic
wires running through four of the five
fingers it didn't have one of the pinky
because a lot of people it's really hard
to move that independently without also
moving the ring finger it just relied on
these four instead and it ran
fiber-optic cables in each of them where
based on how much you were closing your
fists with that finger different light
would travel through it that would make
it read one of four positions either
being completely open being closed all
the way or to mid points the other way
would work is with these pair of sound
emitters right here at the top of the
glove so these would actually send out
an ultra high-frequency sound that
people kid hear and do it as beeps that
would then respond to three microphones
that you would place around your TV now
the way this worked is the microphones
would pick up the sounds and it would
figure out based on the time traveling
distance between them it could figure
out the relative location of the globe
so we're gonna set up the power glove
and we realized that since all of its
sensors and such are based on its own
attachments and it's not relying on
something like using a CRT like the
light gun would we could just use it on
a modern system so we actually brought
out the analog to hook up to a modern TV
and play with power glove
it's something look a lot of stuff going
in this glove was pretty expensive for
its time and so in order to save money
and cut down on costs to make it more
cheaply available to consumers they cut
around a lot of corners and as a result
it didn't really work as well as it was
meant to the tech was there for things
like the motion controls and moving the
fingers but none of it was exact enough
to really give you a real sense of good
control it also doesn't help that while
they cut costs it was still pretty
expensive this was a hundred bucks for
its time and to top it off it was just
for this by itself none of the games
that were specifically designed for the
power glove which there are only two by
the way were included with this so if
you wanted to actually have a game that
made use of it in an interesting way
well you had to buy that separately it's
really interesting to think about the
fact that this even was able to hit the
market with the problems it had when at
the time Nintendo was very controlling
about the concept of Quality Assurance
with any kind of product connected to
their system now to be clear this was
not made by Nintendo Nintendo's name is
attached was actually developed and
produced by Mattel in the US and that's
part of why it was rushed so quickly
because they wanted to get it to market
as quickly as possible the results of
this rush production made the power
glove something that well very cool and
concept was just considered a terrible
controller and it didn't do very well
after the initial response however it
doesn't change the fact that it ended up
having a pretty important part in pop
culture I mean again just the concept of
a controller you could wear your hand
was really cool and doesn't hurt that at
the time was being pushed as many
different ways as possible including
having a featured part in the movie the
wizard
what is that
powerglove it's no surprise than that a
control that had such an ambitious idea
of how to do virtual reality controls
back in that day didn't really continue
on in the future and why in the case of
the reality quest while it's still
approaching this concept of controls of
your hands it's a much simpler mechanism
on that note let's actually get back to
the reality quest and try it on some
games so we have the reality quest all
hooked up and while we could just play
it on a regular PlayStation to try it
out
the way it was meant to be we decided to
make a little weirder and broke out the
same adapter we used on another weird
controller so we can play this on our
ps4 whether or not it's going to work
great I have no idea I've made sure that
at least reads that I'm hitting buttons
and stuff and I haven't tried playing
any games yet so to start we're gonna go
with what was recommended back in little
Oracle by playing a racing game so thing
is pretty simple where we just have to
worry about going forward and turning so
moving the glove around left to right is
working for selecting stuff on the menu
I do have it on simulated analogue right
now let's go ahead and just do a single
offline race and see what happens I can
already tell there's already a little
bit of drift with us though because the
menu is freaking out if I was just like
a little bit too much this way it's
pretty sensitive that might be
adjustments I can make with this button
right here like I read earlier but I
don't actually know what the inputs are
to make those adjustments so okay so
when you change it to the other settings
it looks like it actually changes what
everything else gets read as as well I
mean you go to full analog this now acts
as a d-pad at least that's what it seems
like it's embrace let's try this again
with remap controls so something about
the way this is programmed is that when
you go into the other modes for the way
the stick is read or the d-pad in this
case it also changes the configuration
all the other buttons I don't know if
that's who had this glove prior was the
upper program goes a certain way which I
don't know how because the instructions
are lost to time so what I'm doing
instead is I'm changing the in-game
controls to make us the d-pad is used
for steering and X is used for
acceleration because it when I'm in
regular d-pad mode every button seems to
work as intended
so
they will do that okay so one more time
I've had to redo this a couple times
because when I'm changing modes it seems
to also mess with the button
configurations of what button acts as
what and I never seem to be able to have
both the option to steer and accelerate
at the same time in a given mode the
only one that seems to be lining up with
what button should be what is the
regular digital mode so what I'm gonna
do is I've changed the settings in game
to treat d-pad for steering which should
still be this motion here and then X and
circle for accelerating and braking that
should fix all of our problems let's see
it works yes okay
okay this isn't too bad now now that
buttons work hasn't ended I certainly
can't do any fancier moves right now
because I don't remember what any other
button is mapped to but for right now I
can accelerate and go forward and turn
it's a success I gotta say there isn't
something vaguely intuitive about this
control scheme but at the same time I
can already tell that constantly moving
my wrist like this is just gonna get
painful like there's no this this is
already annoying me yeah that's how you
get carpal tunnel right there if you
want carpal tunnel get this controller
so most of my time was spent just trying
to figure out how to get the controls
map just right to use an old ps1 fish
puller on a ps4 game but in the end yes
I can play a game with this it's just
not a great idea
alright so loaded up Soulcalibur and
let's see how this goes I can't imagine
this being a good idea actually
alright this actually this isn't this
isn't too bad uh double-tapping is
definitely annoying I gotta say I think
the biggest problem with this controller
is that it's a little more intuitive
than you would think I still wouldn't
recommend it for anything with complex
button inputs but if you can get the
right just few buttons down it really
isn't that bad the biggest problem is as
you keep playing you're just going to
hurt your wrist it's unavoidable the
entire way this works is by just
constantly flexing this around and
that's not that's not good like you
should not do this like if you play any
game for more than 10 15 minutes this is
which I'm doing right now it's not a
good feeling I already want to stop
shooting this and hey guess what it
disconnected so there's a sign right
there the concept of a gloves controller
is still something we think about today
a lot of it comes from the idea of
eventually when VR is at its most
refined while having a full controller
that's just having a hand in a virtual
realm makes a lot of sense but
historically trying to do that before
the tech was really here definitely had
its problems whether that's the power
gloves lack of refined control or the
virtual quests very uncomfortable
reliance on moving your wrist around
like a madman there's a reason stuff
like this just didn't work out at the
end but they were necessary stepping
stones to establish where we're going in
the future with more controllers the
standard a gamepad is still the main way
to play games but as we get further and
further in tech we might see something
like this be a more direct ancestor</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
