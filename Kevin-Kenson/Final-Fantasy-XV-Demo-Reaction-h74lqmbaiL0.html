past week was the release of final
fantasy type-0 HD which I did pick up
and i'm planning on reviewing but
there's another reason why a lot of
people rush to pick this one up right
away and that's because it comes with
the demo for the much-anticipated decade
long awaited final fantasy 15 so for
those of you who haven't grabbed the
game yet or don't even have the option
to because you don't have a ps4 xbox one
just yet I want to give you guys my
reactions to the demo which honestly I
don't entirely know how I feel about
what I just played there's things here
that I want to praise but there's a lot
of other things that just aren't sitting
right with me and to be fair this is
just a demo so a lot of this can change
or isn't indicative of the final product
so it's all got to be taken with just a
grain of salt so first off just looking
at what the game hits you with right
away the visuals are somewhat of an
awkward cluster scenery wise it looks
great but I'm not entirely sure on what
kind of aesthetic they're going for here
most Final Fantasy games have been a
mixture of traditional fantasy with some
Asian influence with later games adding
a bit of far future styling whereas this
one Lucas I have a very heavy focus on a
near future feel the demo itself
literally takes place in a countryside
area with a freeway running through it
that you get stuck in because your
classic car breaks down your party
dresses like your members of an emo punk
group while everyone else is in some odd
twist on modern-day country clothing
it's definitely a new direction for the
series and not one I'm entirely sure I
like the feeling of so far and it
doesn't help that in the demo at least
the visuals are accompanied with a
painful frame rate that is constantly
dipping whenever combat goes down now
speaking of the combat that's another
area where I'm kind of mixed now back
when this game was originally announced
almost a decade ago as vs 13 it was said
that it be partially based round kingdom
hearts which is fairly accurate you
control the lead character and only the
lead character while working alongside a
group of party members smacking the crap
out of enemies in real time though the
whole thing is a little slower in pacing
Noctis his fighting style consists of
summoning and switching between five
different weapons for attack combos with
you equipping them in different slots
that will determine what weapon you use
for what situations such as which one
you use for an opening hit repeatedly
attacking or countering an enemy each
equipped weapon gives you a different
special tack you can use most of which
in the demo our series traditional
physical attacks like a dragoon jump or
life drain with a
sword it feels a little clunky at first
and timing Perry's is a little awkward
but once you get the basics down it's a
fairly smooth system what I don't like
about it though is this well it's a fair
point that this game is based on the
same basic idea as kingdom hearts to me
at least the core final fantasy series
has always been about teamwork older
games were traditional turn-based combat
systems where you control to everyone
and while later games moved to real time
like in 12 and 13 they still featured
teamwork by either letting you control
the AI of your allies switch your
controlling on the fly or in Thirteen's
case at least let you change party
tactics repeatedly to fit different
situations from the looks of this demo
though your party members look more like
assistance than actual teammates most of
the combat roles around you solely
beating the crap out of enemies while
your allies do the same occasionally
getting a heal from the one magic
casting a lie and if anyone hits 0 HP
you walk up to one another and give a
little pad to make things all better no
switching control of characters no
issuing the orders for team tactics the
whole thing just feels like an action
game more than an RPG where you really
rely on NPC assistance here and there
which granted on its own isn't
necessarily a bad thing but it's a shift
from something I personally loved about
over final fantasies that here I just
don't like now one other thing that's
bothered me deeply is the demos approach
to side quests the main quests you
perform require you to explore a little
fight off hordes of enemies take down a
big boss monster all fairly traditional
enjoyable things while the side quests
consist of the all-time busy time filler
fetch quests the thing is they're not
even interesting fetch quests you
literally are told to go find this item
which is then highlighted on your map
with a quest marker so you just have to
walk up to it and pick it up that's it
the entire quest read a sign walk up to
a thing pick up a thing so yeah there
are a lot of things about this demo that
bothers me but it'd be unfair to say
that I hated the whole thing all around
because there were a lot of things I
also really liked the combat is pretty
smooth once you get used to the hang of
it and while it's not but I'd like it to
be for the sake of the series it still
works I also really love the approach
they've made with adding a day and night
cycle it has this really cool old-school
approach to character leveling or you
can gain all the XP you want while
adventuring but you won't actually level
up until you call it a day and make camp
eat some food and rest making camp puts
all that XP into effect leveling your
team up and depending on what dish you
make for dinner will grant you bonuses
for the following day like increased
crit rate or immunity to certain status
effects now one last thing I think was
handled really well and probably my
favorite part of the demo is the way
they've handled summons instead of just
a powerful ability you can just make you
so freely and Rec enemies with someone's
are these big ridiculously powerful
attacks that will more than likely insta
kill most of your enemies which you can
only use as a last-ditch effort when
you're at zero health the downside is
though using them is basically
considered pulling an instant win card
that you didn't have any direct hand in
so you don't get any XP for the
encounter what I like about this is that
it lets summons be these really cool
awesome powerful things but at the same
time it's not an ability you're going to
be spamming every chance you get it
makes them cool memorable and useful
when you're in a pitch but not a thing
that's going to be regularly occurring
especially if you want to keep leveling
up so yeah I definitely have my
misgivings about the demo overall I'd
have to say I'm leaning towards the not
so excited side but it's not without its
merits admittedly a good part of my
problems with it come from my personal
preference and being a long time series
fan and not necessarily with everything
it does being objectively bad though
there are definitely some things in it
that are weak as I said at the start
this is after all just a demo and not
everything is exactly like how it's
going to be at launch there were a lot
of features clearly being held back that
just might change my tune when the
actual game comes out so that's all
really I just wanted to let you guys
know my thoughts on the demo so far if
you have it yourself and you want to let
me know your thoughts or you have
questions about it make sure to hit me
up down below in the comments or on
Twitter at Kevin Kenton as always guys
if you enjoyed the video hit that thumbs
up button subscribe if you haven't yet
I've got more great content on the way
until then though I'm Kevin kensun and
I'll see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
