just ended so I've got five more kick
ass iOS games to you guys check out this
month list contains a couple simple
titles with a few getting a little more
complex jumping into puzzles word games
or just a nostalgia fuel but before we
get to any of those we're gonna start
one of the simple titles block shot
revolution block shot is by far the
simplest game on this month's list it's
a straightforward arcade design we're
all you're really trying to do is get
the highest score possible by shooting a
bunch of blocks before they hit the
bottom of the screen causing a game over
it's not quite that easy though because
the game isn't as simple as just aiming
at a block and firing instead the whole
thing is based around centripetal force
you have to hold your finger on the
screen to make your laser spin around
and your release to have it fire out in
whatever direction it was currently
spinning towards now the game does help
you out a little bit as you get better
at it because once you start getting
combos you'll get power-ups things like
having a triple shot or chaining from
one block to the next it's definitely
frustrating to try picking up at first
but once you get the hang of it it's a
really great game to try and compete
with your friends over getting high
scores not to mention it has great
visuals in a solid soundtrack the game
is initially free-to-play but it does
have pop-up ads so if those bother you
you can remove them for the fee of a
dollar ninety-nine now next up is
another game that's initially
free-to-play but you can pay to remove
ads it's one of the weirdest games to
come out this past month and really one
of the weirdest games ever put on one of
these lists before and that's silly
sausage initially this game looks like
it might just be a snake clone you know
something where you're not supposed to
touch the walls or yourself but that's
not the case at all touching walls is
actually a very smart thing to do
because while the earlier parts of the
game may seem a little simple just
navigating your way from point A to
point B it starts to get a lot more
difficult really quickly once the game
starts adding a lot more obstacles
things like saw blades lasers you have
to time yourself jumping through or even
buttons you can press that make blocks
disappear or reappear which can work to
your advantage to be perfectly honest
initially I didn't think much of this
game but I kept pushing through it a
little bit because the reviews looked so
good and I don't regret doing that at
fault it shapes up to be a really fun
puzzle style game the only complaint I
really have is that it is very add heavy
even if you remove the ads for a dollar
ninety-nine the game still has ads you
can watch in order to create checkpoints
now you can also make checkpoints by
using gems you find
through all the different levels but
there never seems to be quite enough
gems for every single checkpoint so if
you want to have a checkpoint every time
you can get one well you're gonna have
to watch some ads at one point or
another third up is letter craft now
this is very similar to a game I put on
one of my other passed list for top five
which was all centered around trying to
make words as quickly as you could
before some of them blew up and got
destroyed well this takes a similar
approach where it's a scrabble style
board and if you take too long letters
start to disappear but that doesn't
start the game over what makes the game
end is if you run out of word options so
the whole idea is to just constantly
meet words as fast as you can while
trying to vary which blocks you use so
you have as many options as you can as
long as possible now the game does have
a couple different modes try there is
just a straight-up endless mode there's
also a campaign mode where each level
has different restrictions things like
you have to only make words that have
the letter A in it so on so forth and it
also features a multiplayer option as
well now while the game is initially
free to download if you want to play
through the entire campaign you do end
up having to spend 2 99 but it's
completely worth it now fourth on the
list is the only game this month that I
put down that does require you to pay up
front and that's card crawl card crawl
is this really interesting fusion of a
sort of solitaire approach to card game
design but by adding an RPG elements the
idea is you get Delta number of cards
and you have to make use of them either
by equipping them picking them up or
using items to destroy enemies the
initial goal is simple enough that all
you need to do is get through the deck
but after that if you really want to
challenge yourself you want to start
trying to get high scores which forces
you to sell items to make higher gold
profits which counts as a high score but
also means you're going to end up
winning by the skinnier teeth and it can
get really dangerous the game does offer
a couple different game modes you can
just play the regular mode we have a
mixture of different weapon shield and
power up cards but there's constructed
deck mode as well where you can unlock
different special cards and pick 5 of
your favorites to put in the deck some
of which are unlocked by just winning so
many rounds others you have to save up
your coins in order to purchase this
game is a fantastic time killer for only
two bucks and if you're a fan of just
killing time with solo card games this
one's a great option to pick up now last
time on this month's list is a style I
don't really do too much on these top 5
lists and that's final fantasy
record-keeper a game that is initially
free-to-play but does have a lot of
in-app purchases to get gems to unlock
better equipment sooner the thing is
it's really not all that necessary now
admittedly a large part of the fun for
this game comes from whether or not
you're a fan of the final fantasy series
and if you are this thing is one
gigantic really fun nostalgia trip the
entire idea is that you revisit a bunch
of the major battles across the entire
series but not only do you get to
revisit those battles but as you
complete them you start to unlock more
characters that you can add in and out
of your party coming from games across
the entire series in which characters
you use aren't just purely cosmetic they
all have their own special abilities you
can craft different items that some of
them are restricted to using different
special attacks so you can really make
an interesting party formed out of some
of your favorites and it's going to
actually show beyond just being purely
cosmetic as I said earlier the game does
have in-app purchases where you can buy
gems to get special weapons and things
like that but all those really do is
make the game infinitely easier so you
can feed it even faster they're not
really all that necessary if you take
your time going through each level
you'll always be just powerful enough to
handle things which I really appreciate
the game does also use that really
annoying powered timer thing where every
battle uses up so much power you have to
wait for some of it to recharge over
real time but fights take long out
toward really never actually becomes an
issue if you're a fan of final fantasy
than this game is an absolutely must
grab just for the nostalgia alone it's
absolutely free to try out definitely
worth looking into well there you guys
