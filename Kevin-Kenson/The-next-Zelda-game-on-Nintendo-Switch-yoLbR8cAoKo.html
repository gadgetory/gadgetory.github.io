of Link's Awakening I've been thinking a
lot about The Legend of Zelda franchise
it's a series I grew up with and well
it's always been popular the last few
years have been particularly really
great for it thanks in no small part to
of course the switch and breadth of the
wild so with the classic like Link's
Awakening coming back I got to think
what's after that if you've played
Link's Awakening before you'll know that
it's kind of one of the weirder entries
in the Zelda franchise in a really good
way it's an amazing excellent game so
for Nintendo to actually pull all the
way back to that title and bring it back
and this really honestly I think super
cool art style even though I know some
people work out more about it it's a
really cool move and I think it's also
pointing to where this trend with
Nintendo where I think we're gonna see
as l de game every year at least
depending on what you count as a Zelda
game I mean let's look at the years so
far so in 2017 when the switch first
came out we of course got breath of the
wild big main entry Zelda title huge
lots of substitute great awesome a year
after that in Japan and a couple months
later in the u.s. we get a port of
Hyrule warriors sure that's a crossover
with another series and it's not exactly
a normal Zelda game but it's still a
zelda game and now later this year we're
gonna see Link's Awakening 1 a year so
far
I think you could take a look at what
games they've released so far and
there's the full history of the Zelda
franchise and what they've done I think
there's kind of a pattern you can see
coming with future releases this year
we're getting a remake and next year I'm
willing to bet we're gonna see some kind
of port what that ports gonna be I don't
know because they have plenty of options
to choose from they've already ported
Twilight Princess and Wind Waker to HD
back on the Wii U they could bring those
back again Skyward Sword could certainly
use a better version and remake and
there's of course the n64 classics
Ocarina of Time and Majora's Mask
which were on 3ds but could it get
cleaned up even further for the switch
this allows the intended to have this
really cool flow with the franchise
where basically every other year we're
having some kind of biggish main entry
or at least an interesting take like
with the Link's Awakening remake or we
just have the return of a classic that
we can now play on the go and sure a lot
of these games we've all played before
but they're good games at having in
handheld would be awesome all of my
oldest memories in gaming have to do
with The Legend of Zelda series I grew
up in new Nintendo household my older
brother had an NES and while I wasn't
exactly good at the game yet I did try
playing the original game we never
actually had legend as loved to in the
house but as I got older and more games
started coming out like Link to the Past
Ocarina of Time Majora's Mask I started
being able to actually you know play
through them properly and it's just a
series that's always really resonated
with me I've done my best to really keep
up with most of it I've played all the
big main line ones like I mentioned
earlier through the n64 and after that
going into Wind Waker Twilight Princess
Skyward Sword which was a little more
rough but then also a lot of the
handhelds in fact honestly some of my
absolute favorites in the series go to
the older Game Boy ones with Link's
Awakening again super excited to have a
new version of that come out the Oracle
games which are so good I actually did
skip out on some of the DS titles that
are based in Wind Waker I started them
and just didn't click
for whatever reason but I did go back
for link between worlds which is one of
the top ones for me
I admit I
have a bit of a soft spot for the more
classical style I really like the 3d
adventure stuff that happens ocarina
time is a big deal I get it but there's
something but that classic top-down
feeling where your imagination plays
with you a little bit more and I just
love it I think there's something really
to be said for how the series has kind
of done the same concept over and over
again but it's done it so well I mean
don't go wrong there are different
obviously breath Awadh remix things
really heavily and there was the leap
from the 2d games to the 3d but the very
basic core concept has always been the
same you start off as that young kid who
doesn't really know what he's doing yet
you start amassing different items and
leveling up getting more hearts
exploring and getting stronger until
eventually you can destroy the big bad
guy and save the princess it's one of
the oldest stories not just in gaming
but just oldest stories in general but
there's something about the way the
Zelda franchise is one of the earliest
games to do it and just continue to do
it so well I admit that part of this is
definitely nostalgia I mean again this
is one of the oldest franchises to use
this formula but they keep doing it
right and after how well breadth of the
wild just basically bought a breath of
fresh air to the entire series I'm just
really curious to see where they're
gonna take it next it was also just such
a huge game during my childhood that it
was pretty much impossible to find
someone who wasn't a fan of that series
in one form or another I mean you
whether it was someone who loved Link to
the Past while they were younger or were
actively playing Ocarina of Time
Majora's Mask it was just that game that
everyone knew there's a lot of places in
Nintendo could take the Zelda franchise
in the next couple years and using what
we've seen so far as a blueprint I've
got a couple of different ideas I think
2020 we're gonna see some kind of port
whether that's multiple games from past
generations or maybe just a single one
probably Skyward Sword especially if
they made some light adjustments to make
it a little friendlier and not quite
overbearing you with tutorials every
five seconds
but after that is the really interesting
question because if you look at how
often big mainline titles come out it's
usually about five years with how well
breath of the wild did they could be
trying to rush one a little sooner maybe
have one come out in twenty twenty-one
but I really doubt it I think we're not
seeing another big mainland entry till
probably twenty-two so what's in between
those well with the games we have so far
Zelda's kind of a big franchise and
there's a lot of different styles of
games within that we've got the big 3d
ones we've got the old-school classical
top-down ones you have the ones that are
kind of genre-bending
and one that we haven't seen quite yet
on switch that I think would be a
perfect fit is a four sword style
adventure I mean really think about it
the whole point of the switch is that
it's a handheld portable it allows you
to also easily share controllers with
other people and make multiplayer happen
anywhere so the concept of four swords
where it's just multiple links working
together to solve different problems
fits really great now
given that particular type of Zelda game
doesn't have the best history lately
because the latest one 3ds wasn't quite
as good but if it was given the right
love and attention I think a really good
one on the switch would be a perfect fit
and after that of course would be
another mainline Zelda and what is that
gonna be like I honestly have no idea
breath of the wild was amazing and while
I would certainly love to have another
game in that same vein I don't
necessarily know if that's how they're
gonna take it they might want to focus
on a more traditional route or do
something entirely different all over
again because remix thing has certainly
worked out in their favor whatever it is
though I'm definitely in a plane rolling
okay so what are we actually recording
oh I didn't know that I thought I didn't
know we'd cut or something okay hi guys
