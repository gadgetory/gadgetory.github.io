- I am extremely lucky and fortunate
to have the chance to
be a gaming YouTuber.
The fact that I can take something
that I grew up loving
and channel that passion
into an actual job
has just been super awesome.
(upbeat music)
And there's a couple different things
that go into making all of this work.
A large part of it is definitely hard work
with a little bit of luck
because sometimes you
spend a ton of hard work
and effort on a project
and it's your little baby,
this art thing that you're working on,
and you're super excited to release it.
And sometimes it goes amazingly great
and you get a million views
and you're super happy about it.
And sometimes it doesn't.
But, again, that's where
the hard work comes in.
But also really importantly
the tools to get the job done.
Tools like a high-power
laptop from Best Buy,
something that's gonna
have the portability
and battery power to let me use it
throughout the entire day,
at different locations to get all kinds
of different work done.
Something that has the ports necessary
and a powerful 9th Generation
Intel Core Processor
to get important work projects
done like video editing.
And of course something that's
gonna have the graphics I need
to play as much games as
I can during my downtime,
which sometimes I'll say is for work,
if people aren't paying
attention too hard.
The first step to any video
is not actually working
on any direct video.
Instead it is a lot, a lot of planing.
Now something that some of you guys
I think have kind of
come on to and realized,
but not everyone has figured out yet
is I actually work as part
of a larger company
called Sun Squared Media,
where I get the chance to work
with a lot of awesome people.
And the way most of our videos start is
we meet together, get together
and just talk about well what
do we wanna shoot this week?
Going hand in hand with that,
it's also a lot of reading Emails
and a lot, a lot, a lot
of studying analytics.
Looking over every single video
we've ever worked on
and seeing how they did,
and trying to figure out
why they did how they did.
So that way we can learn
what we should keep doing,
what we should avoid,
and what stuff just well works.
Doing these things I'm actually
traveling around quite a bit.
I'm not doing it in just one location.
Sometimes I'm working from home,
sometimes I'm at the office, studio,
someone else's studio.
I might be off site at some
brand new location we wanna shoot at.
And so it's a lot of traveling.
It's really important
to have a work station
that's gonna be easily
portable to come with you
and have the battery life
to last the whole time.
And that's something really
nice about a laptop like this.
They're optimized to give
the best battery performance possible
to make sure that it's gonna stay alive,
and at the same time offer
the performance you need
whether you're working or gaming.
So once we figured out what videos
we're actually going to
be shooting for the week,
of course the next step
is well, making them.
Now normally when you guys see my videos
you see this kind of tight little area
of well where I want you to see stuff.
But in actuality the whole set around me
looks like this.
There's a lot more microphones
and stands and things blocking light
and light sources and Rich
standing off to the side,
listening to words I'm saying
to make sure they don't sound too weird.
There's a lot more going on
than you guys normally see
to make sure that instead you see this.
Once we finish shooting a video
it's time to take that hour of footage
and condense all of my mad rambling down
to a concise and logical
sounding five to 10 minute video.
And because we're filming 4K footage,
it's important to have
a system powerful enough
to allow you to effectively edit it.
And that's where a 9th
Generation Intel Core Processor
comes in handy.
It packs the power that you need
along with having additional features
that further enhance your experience.
Features like Intel Quick Sync Video,
which uses hardware
acceleration to speed up video
encoding and decoding.
And thanks to having a USBC port
we're able to connect
and move vast amounts
of storage all at once,
or connect to 4K displays.
Well making videos is fun and all,
but at the end of the day the main thing
I'm always looking forward
to is playing games.
I mean it's why I started doing
YouTube in the first place
so I could make that the focus.
And so having a system that's
able to support playing
awesome, great looking games
on the go is super important,
especially for me, 'cause
like I said earlier,
I'm moving around all the time,
sometimes I'm home,
sometimes I'm at the office.
Its great to be able to sit down
and play the game I wanna play
regardless of whether or
not I'm nearby a desktop.
For instance, one game that
I'm finally get back to
on my backlog is Far Cry New Dawn.
And that is a demanding game.
So I'm not gonna be able to play it
on just any other PC.
I wanna make sure I have
something that's powerful enough
to make sure that it's gonna look great
and run smoothly all at the same time.
And thanks to having a 9th
Gen Intel Core Processor,
I'm able to not only play
games like this on the go,
but even multitask by being able to stream
or even record them all at the same time.
And maybe even duck out of the window
and do something else productive
if someone's in the room
seeing if I'm working.
With up to eight cores
and 16 threads for seamless multitasking,
and Intel Dynamic Tuning,
which adjusts your PC power
to make sure you're getting
the right performance
without overheating your
system at the same time.
So that's all the work and fun
that goes into making videos.

if you're interested in
grabbing a high-power laptop
like this from Best Buy,
and I'll see you guys later.
