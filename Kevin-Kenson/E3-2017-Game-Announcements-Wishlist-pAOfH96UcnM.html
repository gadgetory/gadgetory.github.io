and I wanted to get a jump on it by
talking about the games that I would
love to see announced these are not
games that we already know about these
are not games that we're waiting for
information on these are titles that are
completely unannounced and in many cases
probably won't be sadly to be in with
let's talk about the one game that
actually is likely although I actually
don't know what that is yet
and that's whatever from software is
working on right now they just wrapped
up Dark Souls 3 they did the last DLC
for it and they've talked about wanting
to kind of get away from that formula as
much as I would love to see another one
or blood-borne 2 probably not going to
be what we see it this year but they
have talked about going back to one
older franchise that is very close to my
heart
armored Corps I love giant robots I love
building giant robots I love blowing
stuff up as giant robots so the idea of
then going back and doing it hopefully
better than the last one I would just
love to see next let's talk about games
coming from the big three starting with
Sony specifically sucker punch Sucker
Punch hasn't been doing anything
officially since 2014 with infamous
second son and it's about time that we
got back to it there has been a lot of
love recently for open-world games but a
lot of them have focused on just being
extremely huge with tons of stuff to do
well infamous had a much simpler goal of
giving you an open-world to run around
and have simple dumb fun with
superpowers and it's about time that we
did that again next let's talk Nintendo
now Nintendo has had a very good year so
far with the switch there have been some
great games on it there are a lot more
awesome ones on the way and they've been
giving a lot of love to some of their
biggest franchises like Zelda and Mario
and we're getting great ports of someone
we use best games still holding out for
Super Smash Brothers as well but there
is one student franchise that we've been
waiting here and here again to see come
back and that is Metroid and it is time
no Federation force does not count sure
it may have been an okay game if you
forgave it for not being Metroid but it
still was not Metroid and I'll take
anything at this point it can be a
stylized 2d game in the style of classic
Metroid or it could be another one like
Metroid Prime just some way we gotta
bring this franchise back for the switch
going back to third parties let's talk
about Ubisoft now I'm a big fan of
stealth games but sadly they're one
the more ignored genres and we were
lucky enough last year to get both
Dishonored 2 and Deus Ex mankind divided
but with those gone there's not a lot of
my horizon right now so Ubisoft I need
you guys to bring us another Splinter
Cell blacklist was fantastic we can get
something similar to that or you can
change it up a little bit
I just need new Splinter Cell in my life
I also need spies vs mercs do not let
that community die as fast as it did
last time if we don't get that and I
have one other request although I know
this one will never ever happen no
matter how badly I wanted to mike magic
flashier heroes if you haven't heard of
this game it is a fantastic fusion of
puzzle game and action elements that
came out on the DS back in 2009 I got a
remake in 2011 incredible game please do
that again now I do want to reiterate
one game that was on my wishlist last
year and I want to talk to cats um about
this Capcom you did a great job with
Resident Evil 7 you took it back to its
roots but you did something different at
the same time and now it's time to take
that treatment and give it to some of
your other franchises and the main one
I'm thinking of right now
Devil May Cry Devil May Cry was one of
the most influential franchises on
third-person hack and flash games and
three is still one of the best games do
the formula but you lost your way a
little bit
fluor was kind of okay the remake of it
was better and then do you reboot DMC
let's just pretend that did happen and
resume with my cry 5 just please think
about it let's redo it and do it better
admittedly there is one of their
franchise that I would love to see go
back to its roots and done right even
more and that's Mega Man but based on
how mighty number 9 wins and then
screencaps of it upcoming cartoon and
just I've come to terms of the fact that
that dream is dead</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
