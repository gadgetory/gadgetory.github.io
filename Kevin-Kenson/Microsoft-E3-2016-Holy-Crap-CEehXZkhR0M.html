we've gotten since ei has been getting
better and better and Microsoft's this
year is one of their best they've ever
done there was a lot of great
information this year and there's really
two main fronts that I think they really
knocked it out of the park with first
off just like last year's e3 they did an
excellent job of focusing on games games
and games we saw a lot of gameplay for a
lot of titles we already know about but
was much more extensive and in-depth
than we've seen at a lot of other
conferences this year so far we finally
got some gameplay for record that looked
amazing we got to see that same trailer
for battlefield one again filefast c15
looked awesome but at the same time was
kind of about the best gameplay demo
ever live Tekken 7 looks fantastic sia
thieves was this great montage of lots
of people experiencing it for the first
time and actually made it look like
legit a bunch of fun and the game played
for scalebound was incredible showing
four players riding dragons tackling a
huge boss to top this off we got a lot
of new game announcements as well Forza
horizon 3 which looks beautiful
Dead Rising 4 which was leaked ahead of
time but still looks fantastic we also
got the state of decay - a dedicated
went card game from CD Projekt RED and a
new indie title by the name we happy few
which looks really interesting but what
really made this a successful and very
strong press conference for Xbox is how
they spun the news about the fact that
pretty much every game that comes out
from now on isn't going to be just on
the Xbox one it's now going to be Xbox
one and Windows 10 exclusive which when
this was first announced a lot of people
were pissed because it basically means
why should I on Xbox one if I could just
get a high end gaming PC and the way
they countered it was by really focusing
on this idea of play anywhere this very
optimistic viewpoint of you can just get
games you want and play them on whatever
platform you like the idea being that if
you get a game on Xbox one you can also
play it on your PC or vice versa
sharing save data achievements all that
information as long as that game is
exclusive to Xbox one and Windows 10
which is really genius because it's
basically saying yes we understand that
the Xbox one is no longer going to be an
exclusive system for any games but if
you still like the simplicity of a front
room home call
you can still do that and games you're
gonna run both that and your PC if you
have a dedicated setup we also got a
handful of other announcements that
weren't directly related to just
hardware or games I think my personal
favorite being the announcement of the
design lab where you now have the
ability to customize your own Xbox one
controller for 80 bucks or 90 bucks if
you want to give it h with your name on
it now one thing I did find a little odd
about this conference though is how much
competition Microsoft was kind of giving
itself we got two new hardware
announcements which we all basically saw
going in which was the Xbox one slim
which is already up for pre-order and
project Scorpio which basically just
gave us a lot of hype talked and
promised it's going to be a more
powerful Xbox one and will be due out
this holiday 2017 and what's so weird
about this idea to me is that since they
focused so much on the idea of games
being on Windows 10 and Xbox one
they basically simultaneously said to us
hey there's a new Xbox one you can buy
now there's a more powerful Xbox one
that you can buy a year and a half from
now or you can just focus on PC gaming
and leave the entire economy alone so
they're giving people a lot of choices
all at once which I'm just curious how
it's gonna affect sales of each
individual platform which really isn't
by any means a bad thing it's just that
Microsoft is giving us a lot of options
which it's kind of awesome so all in all
it was an excellent conference easily
one of the best ones they've had
definitely on par with last year and
it's been really interesting to see what
Sony does later today to try and
counteract this height</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
