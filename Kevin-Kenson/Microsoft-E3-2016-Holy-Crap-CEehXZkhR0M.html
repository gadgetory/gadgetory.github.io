we've gotten since EA has been getting
better and better and Microsoft's this
year is one of their best they've ever
done there was a lot of great
information this year and there's really
two main fronts that I think they really
knocked it out of the park with first
off just like last year's e3 they did an
excellent job of focusing on games games
and games we saw a lot of gameplay for a
lot of titles we already know about but
was much more extensive and in-depth
than we've seen at a lot of other
conferences this year so far we finally
got some gameplay for record that looked
amazing we got to see that same trailer
for battlefield one again Final Fantasy
15 looked awesome but at the same time
was kind of about the best gameplay demo
ever live Tekken 7 looks fantastic SIA
thieves was this great montage of lots
of people experiencing it for the first
time and actually made it look like
legit a bunch of fun and the game played
for scalebound was incredible showing
four players riding dragons tackling a
huge boss to top this off we got a lot
of new game announcements as well forza
horizon 3 which looks beautiful dead
rising for which was leaked ahead of
time but still looks fantastic we also
got state of decay to a dedicated went
card game from CD Projekt RED and a new
indie title by the name we happy few
which looks really interesting but what
really made this a successful and very
strong press conference for xbox is how
they spun the news about the fact that
pretty much every game that comes out
from now on isn't going to be just on
the Xbox one it's now going to be xbox
one and Windows 10 exclusive which when
this was first announced a lot of people
were pissed because it basically means
why should I on Xbox one if I could just
get a high end gaming PC and the way
they countered it was by really focusing
on this idea of play anywhere this very
optimistic viewpoint of you can just get
games you want and play them on whatever
platform you like the idea being that if
you get a game on xbox one you can also
play it on your PC or vice versa sharing
save data achievements all that
information as long as that game is
exclusive to Xbox one and Windows 10
which is really genius because it's
basically saying yes we understand that
the Xbox one is no longer going to be an
exclusive system for any games but if
you still like the simplicity of a front
room home console you can still do that
and games are going
on both that and your PC if you have a
dedicated set up we also got a handful
of other announcements that weren't
directly related to just hardware or
games I think my personal favorite being
the announcement of the design lab where
you now have the ability to customize
your own xbox one controller for 80
bucks or 90 bucks if you want to get it
edged with your name on it now one thing
I did find a little odd about this
conference though is how much
competition Microsoft was kind of giving
itself we got two new hardware
announcements which we all basically saw
going in which was the xbox one slim
which is already up for pre-order and
project Scorpio which basically just
gave us a lot of hype talk and promised
it's going to be a more powerful Xbox
one and will be due out this holiday
2017 and what's so weird about this idea
to me is that since they focused so much
on the idea of games being on Windows 10
and Xbox one they basically
simultaneously said to us hey there's a
new Xbox one you can buy now there's a
more powerful xbox moment you can buy a
year and a half from now or you can just
focus on PC gaming and leave the entire
economy alone so they're getting people
a lot of choices all at once which I'm
just curious how it's going to affect
sales of each individual platform which
really isn't by any means a bad thing
it's just that Microsoft is giving us a
lot of options which it's got awesome so
all in all it was an excellent
conference easily one of the best ones
they've had definitely on par with last
year and it's me really interesting to
see what Sony does later today to try
and counteract this height</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
