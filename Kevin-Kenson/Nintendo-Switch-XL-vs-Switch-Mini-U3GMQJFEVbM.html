revisions that are hand held,
Nintendo has had a habit
of doing one of two things.
Either making them smaller,
- [Announcer] All the power
and excitement of Nintendo
right in the power of your hand.
- Or the opposite direction
and make them a lot larger.
- [Announcer] With a bigger screen
and longer battery charge,
your gold grabbing adventure
will feel larger than life.
- In exchange for having a larger screen,
which is really beneficial for some games.
It kind of raises the question that,
if we're getting any kind
of revision for the Switch
in the near future,
which way are they gonna go?
(upbeat music)
Why don't you get inspired by an idea
we saw from another
YouTuber, My Mate Vince,
who made the Vincendo XL,
which was a larger screen 1080P Switch.
And so, working off that idea,
we're gonna make something
a little more ridiculous
but also something smaller.
Let's check it out.
Guys, I'm gonna honest here.
When the idea was pitched
of doing like an XL Switch,
this is um, a little more
excessive than I was thinking.
So if you're wondering
how we got this all set up
by the way, it's not that crazy actually.
We basically took the
opened up dock that we have
and rigged that up with this
monitor and a portable battery.
So this actually a perfectly mobile setup.
I mean I could roll around on
this chair and keep playing.
It's just not practical at all.
Oh whoa! I think I'm actually
motioned sickness from this.
This was not a good game to
pick for this particular test.
Look, I get the idea is
that we wanted to test out
the idea of a Switch XL.
I just think this is a little
more beyond what, well,
if such a thing were to happen.
This is probably a little more
than what Nintendo would do.
Tiny bit.
So next, lets try things
in the opposite direction
with a much smaller screen.
Now, for this setup, we just
hooked it up to our small HD,
which is a five inch screen,
putting it at just a tiny bit bigger
than the upper screen of the 3DS XL.
So that's kind of the range
of what a smaller system would look like.
Now at the same time,
while this is a smaller screen
than the regular Switch,
it's actually a higher resolution.
This is 1080P instead of 720.
So, one of the things
I'm noticing right away
is this is a much crisper image.
I mean, its tiny, but,
it looks really good.
Now, if they were to
make a more compact one,
Well, I like the idea of
Joy-Cons being used across all systems.
It would make sense that a smaller one
would probably have smaller
Joy-Cons to match with it.
Otherwise, its not flushed
like you can see here,
which looks kind of funny.
I will say
this is actually almost a
little more comfortable.
Like I'm more used to having
a smaller handheld like this.
Really what this is telling me
is that I like the size of the Switch.
But I would love if it
actually supported 1080P
when it was undocked.
I mean the battery would die immediately.
But maybe that's just an excuse
for us to have a better battery too.
Now of course,
the main benefit of making
a smaller design like this
isn't so much because we
want to have more power,
or anything like that.
The idea is that with the
smaller size like this,
you could actually, more
comfortably carry around a Switch.
Which, the Switch isn't that
bad for putting into bags
and stuff and you can kind
of fit one in a pocket.
But it's a little ridiculous looking.
This would definitely be friendlier sized
And even though its a better resolution,
I think I prefer
having a larger screen
on the regular Switch.
Something that is making me think too
is that it wouldn't be that
crazy if, down the line,
Nintendo wanted to offer sort
of like a Switch Mini option
or something.
Just a smaller handheld that
still gives you a lot of power,
but is a lot easier to carry around.
Because, yeah, the
smaller screen isn't bad.
The real takeaway from this is that,
honestly, I think that size the Switch
has had is just right.
I mean, there's so much
talk about whether or not
we're gonna get a new model Switch
some time down the line,
and if we do, is it gonna be an XL?
Is it going some kind of mini option?
I don't really want it
to be either of those.
I think the Switch as it is,
is just the right size.
It is small enough that's
gonna comfortably fit in a bag
or even a pocket sometimes.
And at the same time,
has a large enough screen
that's giving you a much better
experience that other
handhelds have in the past.
Yeah, it's a little larger than normal,
and it could be even bigger,
but I think this is just
the right sweet spot.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
