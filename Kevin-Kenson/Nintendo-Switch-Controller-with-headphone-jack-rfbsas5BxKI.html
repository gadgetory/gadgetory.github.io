Entry and that is the wired face off deluxe plus now
This is the newest addition to their wired face off line of controllers
Which I actually found to be one of the best options out there for a cheap wired controller and the deluxe plus builds on what
Made that controller great with some great new additions including one that is completely unique to this controller
this is the first switch controller to have an actual audio port
by the way PDP sent a bunch of these so we're actually going to give some away over on our instagram. So make sure to check out link down below for more details on that
Now if you're not familiar with the audio issues that happens on the switch when it comes to in-game chat
You have to rely on an app that's on your phone and plug it in that way, but then you're not getting game audio
So if you want both in the headset, you have to use a splitter
It's a whole annoying process. But thankfully some games have started making use of in game chat a key example being fortnight
In fact the team responsible for making that in game chat on the switch 5ox has made that technology
available to other developers to hopefully add it to their games as well
So any game that has in game chat like that on the switch you can use this controller
Wired your switch and plug it headset into the jack and have in-game chat with game audio. No problem
Well, that is certainly the biggest and most noticeable improvement from past faceoff controllers
There are a couple other little changes to this one that separates them one thing
I really like is that the ZL and Zr. Buttons are just a little bit bigger
There were very thin on the deluxe and the original faceoff controller made them a little awkward to hit
There's a lot more surface area and these ones so it's much more comfortable
One other change they made is that they changed these stick heads from having a rounded kind of edge to instead having a very hard
Flat one this changed up a little more hit or miss on. I think it still works really well
I just don't know if it was a necessary change
But it does make sure that your fingers stay nice and tight on the thumb stick
It's not going to slide off during intense gameplay now like the previous faceoff controllers
It does have the programmable buttons on the backside right here
Which you can map any of the front-facing shoulder buttons or even clicking the sticks in and the function button that you use to program
That has some additional uses as well now
Thanks to the built-in audio if you hold it and use the up or down of d-pad
you can adjust headset volume by going up or down and you can double tap the function button to mute or unmute your mic
And of course it would not be the face off line of controllers if it wasn't for the fact that this faceplate here is
completely removable
Now when you order one of these deluxe blesses they do come and either this red camo or a purple camo
But if you own any previous faceoff controller, or you could track down those face plates
you can switch it out for a
Number of different designs including ones inspired by Mario and Zelda which look really great and actually on that note
It's something that PDP did that was really awesome with sending this in advance for us to check out
They even included a custom faceplate with our logo on the top, which was a super awesome gift
Now well, the main advertised feature of this headset is the ability to use chat for games that support in-game chat like fortnight
It does have the extra benefit of just being useful if you ever want to do docked gameplay with a headsets so you're not bothering people around you
so for instance
If you're just playing say Smash Brothers and you want hear audio and not blare throughout the entire house
You can use this in docked mode and still connect a headset and hear it all there
Now it is worth noting that one of the kind of weird quirks of the switch.  Is that it only outputs audio to a single source
So if you're using a headset like this plugged in with the switch
you're not gonna get any audio out of your TV whatsoever because it's
Prioritizing pushing it to the headset over anything else and I meant to to earlier when I said that
PDP makes my favorite of the wired controller options because while a lot of the other companies offer some cool interesting wireless ones as far
As the wired designs go the PDP one offers the additional programmable buttons on the back
which is really handy
as well as having I think just overall the better balance of butt designs and something that's a little weird about them too is they
Put the home and capture buttons kind of far away
which I actually like because I hate every time I accidentally take a screenshot or go to home when I don't want to because they
Just get in the heat of the moment confused by which buttons which and I do that way less with this controller
I'm dying right now. I gotta say well the audio out is definitely the main selling point of this controller
I really do like the other minute changes they made compared to the other deluxe models
The shoulder buttons are a lot more comfortable to use. Thanks to the larger design
The sticks I'm a little more hit and miss on I think it is better
But it's also just a little weirdly different to feel that kind of just stiff inner wall right there
Now again when it comes to that idea of in-game chat sport, the only major game that has it built in right now is fortnight
However It is a service that is plan to come to more games in particular
Hi-rez studios to spoken up regarding adding vie box support to their games for things like Paladins
I think one of the biggest arguments for this controller though is just the
Value that you're getting in total because the audio feature again is something that is currently unique to this controller is the first switch one
To offer that audio port which is really handy, but they didn't increase the price as a result of this
This is selling at the same price that previous faceoff deluxe controllers sold at of 25 bucks
So that's less than a half a switch pro controller. Sure. There are a lot of awesome wireless options out there
But as far as just getting something for 25 that's gonna have good quality and that unique feature. It's an awesome deal</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
