and for a lot of gamers that means that
we're going to finally see a lot of
tripoli games we've all been waiting for
come out back to back to back the thing
is whether or not those games are
amazing or end up disappointing us I
feel like a lot of people at the end of
the year when they talk about their five
favorite games or top ten games of the
year they tend to focus a lot more on
titles that come out in that last
section because the hype train is so
strong for all of them and completely
forget about the first two thirds of the
year so I want to talk about my five
favorite games that have come out so far
in 2015 starting with blood boil now I'm
a real big fan of the soul series so
falling in love with this game was not
hard for me but even then standing on
its own there's a lot this game does
that's worth praising and while I don't
agree with every change that it made
from the soul series i think a lot of
them were good steps forward most
importantly i like the fact that it's
much much easier to co-op with friends
intentionally being invaded by other
players is now a special challenge of
certain areas rather than just being
ever present which makes those specific
areas really common to get invaded in
but also means that when you're first
starting the game you're not just going
to get your face blown off by some
random player that's decided to troll
low level characters and third and
really most importantly the fact that by
removing shields and adding the ability
to heal by attacking enemies this game
has put such a heavy emphasis on speed
and offense that just changes the whole
rhythm of the game oh what's that you
don't like a game where you have to die
50 times in order to get the idea of
what you're supposed to do well too bad
because this game is absolutely amazing
the fact matter is that no other series
really has the ability to give you the
same adrenaline rush when you finally
beat that difficult boss because it took
you so many tries and needed you to
perfect the gameplay that much I
recognize that blood-borne and really
all souls games aren't for everyone but
if you're willing to tackle the
challenge this is one of the best games
to pick up of the year so far now second
up is the one and only portable game on
this list and that's monster hunter 4
for the 3ds now monster hunter has
always had its cult fan base but I feel
like Ford did a really good job of
opening it up to a lot more new players
while there are some weapon choices that
are definitely better than others
they're all pretty viable so no matter
how you want to play the game you're
never going to end up having a situation
where bosses are impossible because you
just picked the wrong
choice the main thing that really made
this one great though was the addition
of actual online co-op without needing
to use any other systems or having to be
in the same room as people so you can
play online with your friends or random
people whenever you want to tackle all
the games different interesting gigantic
monsters and hey if none of your friends
like monster hunter or you just don't
have friends well hey in single-player
the game gives you a cat companion so
everything's gonna be alright admittedly
the control scheme is still not the best
even if you're using a circle pad pro
but if you're able to get the hang of it
the content this game has to offer is
well worth the uncomfortable thumbs
third up is mortal kombat x now to be
honest when this game was first released
I did have a problem with how well the
online matches could work and I'm still
not really a fan of how WV games
approaches DLC content but those issues
aside Mortal Kombat X is still a really
damn good game you know the room studios
has done a great job of making I think
one of the better fighting games that is
accessible to new players but still
offers a decently high skill cap for
those that want to take things a little
more seriously I don't think it really
approaches the level of say street
fighter but as far as a casual fighting
game player is concerned this one is
just a ton of fun it's also one of the
few fighting game series that actually
offers a solid single-player story mode
that well it doesn't exactly offer
award-winning writing it's just fun
cinematic and is actually worth playing
over just some kind of arcade mode that
gives you a 10-second final cutscene the
addition of interactable objects from
injustice and the three fighting style
system that was added so each player
plays three different ways just help to
set this one apart from its predecessor
and make it an absolutely fantastic
fighting game experience fourth up is
the only digital-only game on this list
and the only one that is a microsoft
exclusive only available on Xbox one and
PC and that's Ori and the blind forest
to begin with in my opinion this is
hands-down the prettiest game to come
out this year it has the perfect balance
of charm lighting vibrant colors and
detailed backgrounds but it doesn't hurt
that the gameplay is really really good
this has some of the best pacing and
challenge in a platformer in recent
years aside from Rayman legends and it's
another excellent example of a game that
can have a heart wrenching touching
story line with minimal use of dialogue
it's the prettiest game of the
year it's the best platformer of the
year in my opinion and to make things
even better by the end of the year we're
getting a definitive edition of the game
that will add lots of new free content
for people have already bought the game
or just add more stuff for new players
to experience now the last game on this
list should come as no surprise to
anyone and that's the witcher 3 the Wild
Hunt you know putting aside and not even
talking about how much content this game
has to offer it just hits so many things
right at the same time great pacing
great storyline good graphics solid
gameplay great music great sounds
everything comes together just so well
and if it only lasted 15 or 20 hours I'd
still think it is a great game but no
it's worth 80 to 100 easily if not even
more if you're a hardcore completionist
there is so much to do in this game that
like I said in my review it puts to
shame any other release that comes out
for sixty dollars when you compare how
much content and how many hours you can
get out of it you know I've loved all
the games i mentioned on this list but
this is the one that easily earns the
title of being the singular game of the
year and while there are some great
titles coming up that could give it a
run for its money it's not going to be
an easy one to the throne now I know I
said I was gonna talk about five games
but there's one more honorable mention i
want to make because while it's not
exactly my cup of tea personally it's
such a well-designed game and is
exploding in so much popularity last
month and deservingly so that i think it
would be a disservice to leave it out
and that's rocket League this is a style
of game that i think is becoming
increasingly rare in recent years where
instead of focusing on formula that
everyone knows and love and just
refining it and making it better and
instead mixes together different ideas
to create a new experience that is
simple straightforward but more
importantly tons of fun even if you're
not a fan of car focused or racing
focused games or soccer all the elements
just come together to create this
fast-paced competitive game that even if
you're not great at is still easy to
have a lot of fun with it may not have
the greatest variety or the largest
amount of content but the singular
experience of the game's multiplayer
mode makes buying it a no-brainer for
its relatively low price tag well those
are my favorite games of 2015 so far
like I said there are a lot of titles
coming up this holiday season worth
looking forward to including metal gear
solid 5 star wars battlefront halo 5 and
just too many
more to list so at the end of the year
we'll see how many of these games still
make it to being the best games of 2015
