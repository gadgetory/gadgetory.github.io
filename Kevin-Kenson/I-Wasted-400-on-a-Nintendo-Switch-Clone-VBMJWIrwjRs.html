success so it's no surprise that is
beginning to inspire a number of other
devices like this guy right here the
morphus X 300 this is a Android gaming
tablet which at first glance you might
think is any other tablet out there but
where you begin to see the inspiration
is with these right here attachable
controllers which don't exactly use the
same kind of mechanism as the switch but
the idea is there now obviously this is
not the exact same thing as a switch it
doesn't have its own library of games
and it's not exactly as easy to use
right from the get-go it is mainly
primarily a tablet this just kind of
adapts some of the elements the switch
along with a couple other things too one
of the other things that this ink pushes
is that it supports naked-eye 3d meaning
you don't use any glasses or anything
and you're able to view some 3d content
and it'll actually look 3d from just the
screen itself now on paper this all
sounds kind of cool so far and you might
be thinking oh this thing must have a
lot of power to do all this
not really spec wise it's actually
weaker than the switch pretty much
across the entire board and despite
being a larger tablet and screen it's
actually basically the same resolution
they advertise that it's Oh a million
pixels which sounds cool and all but
that's just 800 P it's barely better
than 720 to the naked eye basically the
same thing so with all that on the table
let's go ahead and set this guy up to
play some games and see what the
experience is like while we wait for
this guy to start up I will say one
thing right away I'm not actually
playing any games yet but these
controllers are not comfortable at all
it's like the kind of general idea of
how a joy con works except they're a lot
larger and doesn't really have any kind
of comfortable grip design to it at all
like it kind of goes in a little bit
here but you kinda have to weirdly grip
it almost like a vise where you can get
your thumbs to reach all the buttons and
everything so we're running into
technical difficulties because I can't
even connect to our Wi-Fi because for
whatever reason the keyboard does not
want to show up great start before we
get to any games let's go ahead and try
out the 3d stuff on this guy
like that Jets really flying at me it's
kind of the same ideas like a 3d s where
it just adds depth to the screen
basically like there's almost two layers
it's weird just keeps getting confused I
think between which controls to use with
the touchscreen and which controls to
use of the controllers like it wants to
override you think you were just allowed
to use both controls at the same time so
you can switch between them you know
fluidly alright I think I'm an infinite
loop of the video not working cuz it'll
freak out for a second after hit play
and then just goes back to the same
stalled screen whose idea was this that
was John's there we go alright I got a
play but it's just giving me two images
side by side it's not actually from me
3d you know let's just play some games
first let's check out a game that was
one of the ones it's actually from like
the morphus store like they have a
dedicated store for what games that
recommend you play this with so here's
some Cartoon Network soccer game so it's
currently telling me to put the tablet
in landscape which it is it's also
playing the music for the game I think
it crashed or I think it's just stuck
let's try dipper game and let's start
with sonic that's the name I know are we
so cheap that we didn't buy the add free
version of Sonic I can jump but I can't
move oh I can't use the stick I have to
use the d-pad that's annoying also the
stick is like that PlayStation like the
PSP style we're just kind of slides
around it's not very comfortable
all right hooray I'm at least playing a
game now that's that's a much this is a
significant improvement okay so I mean
once you actually get through a lot of
layers of things not working at all once
you're actually able to get a game to
work as simple as Sonic is I mean this
works pretty well so far like I said the
controllers aren't great but I am
successfully moving Sonic and doing
things that's step the right direction
so another way that the thing is kind of
like the switch is that it does support
being able to hook up to a TV it just
has a mini HDMI at the bottom so if we
hook it up it should go to our TV screen
let's try that out oh my god it actually
works okay
I actually didn't I have expected that
enough to happen all right let's try it
seems a little more weird like there's
definitely a delay
and that's not it's not like a switch
where it's going into a different mode
and like runs better it's just taking
the same image which is still being
shown on this screen and blowing it up
on here so it works just just still not
great by the way if you're curious about
this awesome white and blue switch
you've had in the background of today's
video this was actually made possible by
D brand they've released a whole bunch
of Awesome skins you can get for your
switch for the doc itself the joy cons
or the main body and a number of
different colors or in this awesome cool
white so obviously trying this guy out
didn't go super great and that's just
the stuff that we were able to record on
camera because some things took a little
too long we hit the power button quite a
while ago one of the things about this
guy that gets really annoying is the
fact that well yeah it's kind of cool
that it has these attachable and
comfortable controllers is the fact that
none of them actually come preloaded
with any kind of configurations for
popular games so instead of buying say a
popular Bluetooth controller which might
have firmware updates to support certain
titles or games that have you know
gamepad compatibility game vice where
you can hook it on the sides of a tablet
and it's designed for specific games
this guy just kind of asks you to do all
the work yourself so you have to launch
this special app close it open a game
switch back to the app put controls over
it and it's just this whole really
convoluted process that there's not
actually any explanation for anywhere
you just kind of have to figure it out
and it wasn't fun and yeah once you're
able to actually get anything mapped out
it works pretty great for a specific set
of games where on-screen controls are
that easy to just copy over and do but
compared to the ease of using really any
other product designed to do this with a
pre-existing tablet instead of an
all-in-one system like this it just it
was a lot of work for
it's still not that great of an
experience especially when you figure in
the cost of this thing like I said
overall it is not as powerful as the
switch although it does offer the 3d
which is cool I mean has all the
functionalities to tablet yes it does
more things but for $400
spending $100 more than just getting a
switch it's yeah it's not great</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
