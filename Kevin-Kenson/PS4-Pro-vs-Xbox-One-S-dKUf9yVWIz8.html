since the ps4 pro came out and even
longer for the Xbox one s and ps4 slim
so I think it's about time we have a
little update on what's changed and we
have to look forward to coming soon
first let's take a look at the Xbox one
app now when this first launched it was
going for $300 but now you can find it
as low as 240 for a 500 gigs bundled
with Minecraft or pay a little extra if
you want a different game or larger hard
drive now one of the biggest ongoing
strengths of this system is focused on
being not only a gaming system but also
a multimedia device having an HDMI IN 4k
video support and UHD blu-ray support
something that neither the ps4 slim or
ps4 pro have and the largest number of
streaming apps to choose from when it
comes to actual gaming one of the
biggest strengths the Xbox one has has
is actual backwards compatibility with
select 360 games the list of which have
gotten pretty large and has a lot of
respectable great titles on it it also
has the more comfortable controller now
one of the interesting aspects of the
Xbox one that's either a big strength or
weakness depending on your viewpoint is
the idea of play anywhere basically any
game that you want an Xbox one you can
also play on a Windows 10 PC or
vice-versa and share save files between
them the downside though is that this
means that there are no longer any true
Xbox one exclusive as those are all
going to be on PC as well meanwhile with
the ps4 there are currently two
different models to choose from the ps4
slim that originally went for 300 but
you can now get as low as 260 bundled
with Uncharted and the ps4 pro which
still comes by itself no game bundles
just yet at $400 now while the Xbox one
has been focused on being an all-in-one
multimedia device the ps4 has been much
more focused on just gaming it does have
some additional services like
PlayStation View for watching TV
channels or PlayStation now which allows
you to stream play ps3 games though they
have announced ps4 games will be coming
in the future but the real focus is on
the fact that both the ps4 slim and Pro
are more powerful than the Xbox 1s while
it doesn't have UHD blu-ray support like
the Xbox one it does support 4k video
and games on it that are patched
specifically for it do offer native 4k
resolutions or at least closer
resolutions that are up scaled using a
variety of techniques the mileage which
does vary by game now since my last Xbox
one vs. ps4 update there have been some
changes mostly
for ps4 thanks to the recent
four-point-five software update the
biggest things being that you can now
use external hard drives with both ps4
slim and ps4 Pro something that was
originally strength just for the Xbox
one and more importantly for the ps4 Pro
boost mode if they did include a couple
other benefits such as being able to add
your own custom backgrounds and a
cleaner UI in some spots especially the
notifications tab meanwhile there hasn't
been any major software updates for the
Xbox one recently but there has been a
lot of talk for ones that will be coming
sometime in April including removing the
snap feature which will free up system
resources and hopefully boost the
performance of the Xbox one making the
UI snappier and an interesting new
feature called co-pilot mode where two
players share two separate controllers
but act as one the idea being that if
someone has a disability and has
problems using controller on their own
they have a way to get a little help
making the Xbox one the more accessible
system for them now of course ultimately
the reason you're thinking of getting a
gaming system is well gaming and so
always one of the big questions you need
to consider is exclusives this is in my
last video Microsoft has had some pretty
good games coming out including Gears of
War for Halo Wars - Forza horizon 3 and
Dead Rising for though due to
Microsoft's play anywhere approach these
are all available to PC players as well
meanwhile the ps4 is been pushing a lot
harder for games that are completely
exclusive to it with titles like King of
Fighters 14 Yakuza zero Last Guardian
and of course horizon zero dawn with a
handful of games of exclusive to ps4 but
also on PC like near automata and neo
and if you look at a full list of
exclusive since launch it's pretty clear
the ps4 currently offers the larger
catalog as of right now ps4 has been
outselling Xbox one at about a two to
one ratio but there are a lot of
interesting things on horizon for Xbox
one that just might turn the tide as I
mentioned earlier there is a big update
coming in the future that will add some
new features and up the system's
performance also cleaning up the UI but
also beginning news later this year at
e3 for their console upgrade the Scorpio
a system that if early spec reveals are
true will definitely beat out the ps4
pro in performance as well as brings vr
gaming to Xbox one really interesting
thing to me they've talked about
recently though is Xbox
pass a service similar to PlayStation
now and EA access giving players access
to a library of a hundred games that
rotate in and out the interesting bits
though are that the service would only
be ten bucks a month half the price of
what Sony charges for PS now the games
would be downloadable not stream played
meaning a smoother experience and any
games currently on game paths will also
have a 20% discount if you like the game
enough that you want to buy it and own
it permanently there are of course also
future exclusives to get excited for
like crackdown 3 CEO feeds cuphead and I
swear someday below will come out on
this system I've been talking about it
in every single one of these Xbox one
versus ps4 videos it just needs to come
out sometime soon eventually please on
the other hand Sony doesn't really have
much in the form of upcoming hardware or
major software updates that's all
happened pretty recently what we do have
though are a lot of major games coming
out a lot of which do still have pretty
unclear release dates though for sure
this year we can at least look forward
to persona 5 Uncharted Lost Legacy the
crashing same trilogy and maybe Detroit
become human with big future names like
God of War 4 Last of Us 2 and Final
Fantasy 7 remake coming out someday in
the future as things stand right now my
previous conclusions about these systems
remains pretty much the same the Xbox
one is the superior multimedia console
and has an excellent small handful of
1st and 3rd person shooters while the
ps4 is the much more dedicated gaming
system with an excellent library of
exclusives that should not be missed
that being said though ps4 is pretty
much gotten to the point where we're
just waiting on more games come out
while Microsoft has a lot of interesting
wild cards on their way
including Xbox game path and of course
the Xbox Scorpio which we'll learn more
about this coming III</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
