get me wrong joy counts are great too
and in fact I still use those most of
the time but there are some games out
there where once the gameplay gets a
little more intense it's a lot more
comfortable to have a more traditional
controller design the only problem is
when it comes to having choices and
variety and kind of being a blowing
setups and stuff you don't have a lot of
choices color wise there are so many
different colors for joy cons but for
these you basically just have the
standard black one and then everything
else they've released so far is kind of
a more special edition collector's
edition kind of approach like we have
the one for splatoon too or xenoblade
chronicles too and then of course we
have Super Smash Brothers on its way but
if you just want a blue one a red one a
white one that's not actually a thing
right now then until Nintendo handles
themselves there are a few ways that you
can try to customize them on your own
there of course skins you can buy or you
can trade you paint jobs then get very
expensive if you go to someone else or
very messy if you try to do it yourself
and you're kind of professional but
there is of course another option that
we've done before for our joy cons and
you can switch back and that's a shell
exchange
now I haven't actually done one of these
just yet personally I've looked into how
to do it and it looks like it's kind of
a midpoint between the switch shell and
the joy collins in that it's a little
more difficult and time-consuming than
doing just the switch back but it's a
lot easier than joy cons at least I
think it's gonna be so let's go ahead
and do an exchange and see how it goes
so for the shell exchange we actually
the same company that made the shells
that we used on our previous joy con and
Shellback exchanges and for pro
controllers they have five different
options you can get into white that we
already showed they've three different
ones that are kind of a transparent
color option that's very reminiscent of
some of the older game boys like the
atomic purple but we went with the fifth
option which is this awesome looking
SNES inspired design now once we started
doing the actual shell exchange it is
really interesting to see how an instant
have built the pro controller because
it's done in such a way that the shell
is actually pretty divorced from the
inside parts there's not a lot of stuff
you really have to mess with you just
have to remove a lot of layers which is
pretty easy to do is just a little
time-consuming but thankfully very
simply you just start by unscrewing a
screw that's at the bottom of each of
the handles of the pro controller and
then once that's out you can just take
the grip off super easily
after that you just have to started
screwing the whole bunch more to take
off the backplate and then another layer
to remove the front plate now this one
is where it gets a little bit trickier
because you'd have to apply a little
pressure to kind of snap it off and
where things might look a little scary
at first is there are some parts of the
inside that are directly attached to the
front plate it's not actually that bad
though it's very similar to kind of the
final steps you have to do for a joke on
shell exchange which are super simple
and sexy the easy part of that one where
all you have to do is take out a couple
screws and then just very carefully lift
out all the different buttons and stuff
and place them in the new shell in the
same kind of way and then just basically
put it all back together at this point
you're just Reese crewing everything in
yours doing everything in reverse order
and bam you have a brand new looking
awesome SNES which pro controller with a
joy con there are so many different
risks you run while doing a shell
exchange you could accidentally cut a
ribbon cable you could scratch something
up you could mess about something's
plugged in you could destroy the battery
there's a lot of ways that you could
brick the joy cleanser.you the
exchangeable with these it's honestly
pretty hard to do because you're never
really messing with any of the deep
inside bits now as a result this is not
a complete perfect shell exchange there
are some parts of the original design
that are still visible on it for
instance the lights down here still have
that same black body it has the same
d-pad the same sticks although honestly
the d-pad and these buttons wouldn't be
hard to have alternate designs if they
wanted to release new color buttons
where you're really stuck though is on
the top here with this black base right
here you're still gonna have that design
right there and I'm not sure if it's
possible to maybe do an exchange with
those in the future but there's a lot
more going on because this is directly
connected to all the different inside
bits and that's where it gets a lot more
dangerous that being said though as long
as you're cool with keeping the black up
top everything else is a new shell and
looks like a completely separate
controller and honestly it's really
awesome like I said it was really safe
and easy to do worse with the Joye cons
I would urge a little bit of extra
caution and say you know hey if it's
something you're confident doing go for
it this honestly super easy as long as
you have the right kind of screwdriver
on hand you can do yourself no problem
at all if you're interested checking
these out I'll link it down below
they've got this SNES design and white
design like I said they're also some
really great looking transparent color
cloth
I was actually really debating for a
while whether I want one of those or
this one but you know I'm pretty happy
with my choice</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
