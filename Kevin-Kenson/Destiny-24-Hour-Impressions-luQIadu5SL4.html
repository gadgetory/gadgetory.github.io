I've told you guys before I don't get
stuff in advance so it's pretty much
near impossible to get a full review out
for a game on release day or very
shortly thereafter but I also know that
really soon early content is important
to you guys because you want to know
what I think on games especially for
really big name titles for instance
let's say oh well destiny so I'm going
to start doing more of these sort of
first day impression videos now where I
just sort of play the game a little bit
and give you guys my thoughts right away
on release day but instead on the
following day after release I'm gonna
let you know all my experiences have
been like for my first full 24 hours
with the game so that's we're gonna
today let's talk about my first day with
destiny so first off just to be clear
all the gameplay are going to be seeing
here and my experience with the game is
based on the Xbox one version now before
you guys start yelling any kind of
console war stuff in the comments just
to be clear the reason why I picked Xbox
one is because I have more friends that
play on that system and of course I want
to play a co-op game with my friends
that's why I got that particular version
of the game so I started up yesterday I
create an EXO hunter as my first
character i'm planning on trying all the
classes at some point down the line
blush what I picked first and I played
throughout most they really just
focusing on the story mode and
cooperative aspects of the game I really
haven't spent any time on the crucible
mode just yet and I ended the night at
around level 12 now if you guys haven't
looked too in-depth into the games
character creation just yet the way it
works is you pick one of three races
which are purely cosmetic you've got old
fashioned humans awakened which are like
giant colorful Smurf humans and EXO's
which are robots but more importantly
you pick one of the game's three classes
which are the Titan the warlock or the
hunter now as I said earlier I went with
the hunter first which is the most agile
class it has the highest agility stat
which affects movement speed they also
had get a double jump or even triple
jump ability down the line and their
special moves are the most focused on
just pure dps so it's kind of the
roguish class flavor-wise as opposed to
the Titan who's just a walking tank and
conventionally even erect barriers or
the Warlock that has a mage flavor going
on with AOE moves and even a healing
power later on so after you've made your
character you get thrown into destiny
story mode which has you as this long
dead person that's been brought back to
life as a guardian to help save the
universe again
darkness and protect humanity and blah
blah blah that holy traditional stick
lots of terms are going to get thrown at
you right away in this game even makes
kind of an inside joke right away by
saying you're not really going to
understand a lot of the things you see
you right away the game really takes
almost no time introducing a lot of the
backstory to it you just kind of get
thrown into the action a lot and have to
piece together things bit by bit from
what little you understand which
normally would bother me a little bit in
an RPG but this is an FPS game as well
so there's a much heavier emphasis on
the action so it doesn't bother me quite
as much but I still would have liked a
little more of a slower introduction to
who all the different races are and why
we're fighting different enemies and
just the backstory to everything aside
from just the fact that you're a
guardian of light and darkness equals
bad so playing through the story is a
really straightforward experience when
you check out a planet to go to you'll
have your choice of either tackling a
specific story mission right from the
get-go or you can do a sort of free roam
option where you just run around on the
planet finding extremely simple fetch
quests in order to get a little extra
experience or find loot one thing I
noticed right away is that just doing
story quests is not going to provide
enough experience for you just go right
from one quest to the next you have to
take time on occasion grinding some
extra XP either by doing those fetch
quests I mentioned earlier or by
accepting bounties which are a more FPS
style quest system things like needing
to get a hundred head shot kills or by
taking down so many tougher enemies
bounties generally end up taking a lot
longer to complete than fetch quests but
you can just do them in the background
as you progress the story or free roam
and they give you a lot more experience
for your trouble they also come in
crucible themed forms so if you want to
take time playing the competitive modes
a lot then you can still get rewards
that way to you can also replay any
story mission as many times as you want
if you just want to grind experience the
old-fashioned way and you can also reach
a caliph achill T mode featuring higher
level enemies so you still have a little
bit of variety going on in terms of how
you want to grind up your XP so when
destiny was first revealed a lot of
people were starting to build buzz for
it a lot of people were throwing around
the term that it was going to be an
MMOFPS hybrid which isn't really that
accurate in fact even Bungie one
destroyer away from using that word
because well it does have certain
similar characteristics there's not a
lot that you can really directly compare
it to for real MMOs likes a world of
warcraft or Final Fantasy 14 it ends up
having a lot more in common with
something like save Borderlands the big
difference being that
rather than having straight up drop in
drop out co-op the game does give you
the chance to run into other players on
the field and maybe even join up with
them on the spot but each instance area
normally doesn't have that many players
active all at once I've seen that most
seven other people in one fairly large
region and as soon as you enter any kind
of major instanced part for a quest
they'll disappear very quickly so it's
all still very much a more personal
smaller scale co-op focused game that
just gives you more ways to encounter
and interact with other players but
doesn't go to the same full scale as
what many people would think of as a
traditional MMO so as for how I've been
enjoying the game so far I'd be lying if
I said I wasn't completely sucked into
at the moment but to be fair I do have a
habit of doing that with any game that
has a leveling system just cuz it gets
so hooked I'm trying to reach the next
level and a lot more and more abilities
to mess with and on that note a similar
tangent i wanna talk about real quick is
how they integrated experience into
weapons basically when you find rarer or
magical weapons in the game the way
that's handled is that they have their
own experience bar so when you use them
often over time you unlock a new special
abilities and upgrades for them it might
be something as simple as more damage
for your weapon or passive bonus to
reload speed Szohr max ammo or might
even be something changeable like what
kind of site your gun uses which as I
said I like leveling up and that adds
just another thing to try out and
develop now another thing I'm liking so
far is the way they've approached
environments each planet just has one
large area that you can explore and
tackle quests in but they're all
appreciably pretty large and each one
has offered a very different kind of
world so far I've tackled the first
three major locations which are the
Earth's specifically old Russia the moon
and most recently Venus which is just
all very yellow so for now at least I'm
pretty hooked on the game but of course
that doesn't really mean much since it's
only been a day I will say that the one
thing I'm really curious about is how
the endgame will work out for this or if
there will even be an end game stuff to
do outside of the crucible you know once
a character hits max level what is there
to help drive you to keep doing
cooperative missions or is it just about
competitive at that point which I plan
to find out by just playing the game a
lot more so I'm going to go ahead and
get back to work and just keep playing
destiny and once I feel satisfied that
I've tried out all of its different
aspects I'll bring you guys my full
review hopefully sometime in the middle
of next week now if you guys enjoyed
