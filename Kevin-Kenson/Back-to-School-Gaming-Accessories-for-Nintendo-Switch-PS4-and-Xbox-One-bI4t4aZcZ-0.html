doubt you guys are seeing plenty of
videos and all kinds of different cool
little gadgets that are going to help
you with your studies that's not what
we're doing here today today instead I'm
going to show you some great accessories
to help you with the number one halftime
to distract you from those video games
question is it fair to blame juvenile
delinquency on the video game craze
kicking things off we're going to start
with a back school classic backpack
specifically though ones that will also
carry around game systems now one that I
absolutely love and have talked about
before is the switch backpack it carries
around a switch all the accessories you
need and enough extra room to also carry
a MacBook or a small laptop but we've
been to context of being from back to
school I actually don't really recommend
this one for a couple reasons
it's a little on the small side not
really going to carry extra stuff you
need like maybe textbooks but more
importantly while it is a good-looking
backpack kind of advertise it to people
that is probably carrying around a hard
to buy system that would be great for
someone else to feel and sell on eBay or
Craigslist not a great idea
so instead I highly recommend this CTA
backpack this is one I've talked about
before it is specifically designed for
carrying around things like an Xbox one
or ps4 giving you a safe and secure way
to bring it around and take it to say a
friend's dorm room or something but at
the same time being nice and subtle so
it's not screaming I'm filled with games
systems it's also larger this can be
better to actually double as a useful
functional backpack as well for
textbooks or other things you might need
to get by now of course having a way to
safely protect systems your transferring
around is a good idea but there's also
those systems that you want to protect
while using them at the same time
specifically portable the big one right
now being the switch hello it's not the
best idea to walk around campus playing
game at the same time but I know a lot
of you're going to do it so if you are
invest in a protective of hard case like
this one right here what's great about
this one it's actually made out of
rubber so it's just a little pliable and
bendable at the same time so if you drop
the system walls in it it's actually
going to absorb the impact it not just
transfer the whole thing into the switch
now it actually snaps really easy to
place and it's all one package those
going to keep the joy cons on so if you
do drop the system it's not going to
protect it but it's going to keep these
very cons from flying off in the
distance great idea now speaking of
switch well it does make a great
portable it's no secret that the dock
has its problems there have been
scratched screens some switches have
overheated to the point of actually been
a little bit it's just not nearly as
portable as the switch itself which can
be a problem
if you want to bring it over to someone
else's place and hook it up to their TV
and that's where a portable dock
solution comes in handy
turns out the actual functional parts of
a switch dock aren't very large and
don't need a lot of space so a lot of
third-party companies have started
popping up with these portable docks for
the switch they are just small enough to
easily fit in your pocket or a small
pocket of your backpack making an easy
way to be able to impromptu set up on a
TV in a friend's dorm room or a common
room anywhere you just want to use the
switch on the spot this is on hand for
you now a lot of these have been coming
from companies that are doing
crowdfunding and they're having fairly
high price points but there's actually
some more affordable options coming up
soon for instance fast mail is coming
out with one later this month for only
30 bucks just in time for the school
year if you're going to be living that
dorm life an important part of any kind
of gaming setup is a headset because you
don't want to be that jerk that keeps
your roommate up all night with the
sounds of explosions and gunshots and
chances are if you're in college you're
probably going to want something a
little more on the lower budget side so
you can afford the pizza and ramen diet
that's where the cloud stinger from
HyperX comes in this is an awesome
headset at the low price point of fifty
bucks for the great balance of sound
quality mic quality and comfort levels
you can wear it for prolonged periods
it's also the line to work across pretty
much any gaming system Xbox one ps4 PC
Mac it'll even work with switch although
if you want to use both game audio and
chat audio you have to buy that terrible
adapter system so if T's your phone for
some reason the point is is a great hit
so that will work on any system you've
got sure there are better headsets out
there but only if you're willing to
spend two 300 even 400 bucks
30 bucks good things and absolute steal
but of course no gaming setup would be
complete without a monitor if you're
living that dorm life you don't always
have very much room to work with and
that's why having something like a full
size TV isn't really a practical idea
that's why even if you're playing stuff
like Xbox one ps4 or switch you're
actually better off picking up a gaming
monitor rather than an actual TV might I
suggest one of these ones from BenQ
they're designed specifically with the
gaming in mind to give you a great color
depth crisp image super fast response
time is only 2 milliseconds and low blue
light so you can actually play it for
long periods of time without getting
your eyes all tired out this one in
particular is their 27-inch model which
is a 1080p longer with 60 Hertz refresh
rate and only a hundred and sixty bucks
if you want a higher resolution the
options are out there but you're going
to be paying more on a low budget this
is the perfect choice so there are some
awesome gaming accessories to pick up
for back-to-school you've probably also
heard of a lot of other useful things
like external hard drives battery banks
I've got some of those I'd recommend as
well I'll put links for those down below
along with all the stuff and I will see
you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
