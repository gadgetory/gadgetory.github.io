So big, in fact,
that it's getting really difficult
to maintain an entire
library on one gaming console
without having to
constantly delete things.
And with games getting larger,
and with new gaming
systems on the horizon,
a very important question is to be asked.
How big do their hard drives need to be?
Or, maybe, just maybe,
they won't even need them at all.
(electronic music)
Right now, the kind of go to storage size
on Xbox One and PS4 is one terabyte.
When they first came out,
we were seeing smaller sizes like 500 gigs
which wasn't useless at launch,
but it's gotten certainly
more difficult to work with
as time has gone by.
Because not only have more
games been coming out,
but games have been
getting bigger and bigger.
And with the release of
4K models of systems,
if you own those,
well 4K versions of games
take up even more space.
As an example,
Red Dead Redemption II on a 4K console
is 111 gigs.
If you're working with
a one terabyte system,
that's over a tenth of it right there.
Now obviously, not every
single game out there
is that large,
and in fact,
some of them are very, very small.
But the fact of the matter is
that this is a problem that's only going
to literally get bigger and bigger.
Now as far as current
consoles are concerned,
there are some ways to work with this.
You can, of course,
use an external hard drive or SSD.
There's a lot of ones that are
themed even for the systems.
There's even specialized accessories
like this one right here
which actually attaches
to the body of your Xbox
and in this case,
can get as high as 12 terabytes of storage
which might be actually
a little bit of overkill,
but it's certainly useful.
And, if you're willing to put
in a little bit extra effort,
you can even just exchange the
internal hard drive itself,
that way you're not adding anything
to the outside of the system
while still getting a little
bit more room to work with.
So let's break down how big exactly
the average game is
and how quickly that would
fill up a hard drive.
So again, game sizes vary a lot.
They can get as large as over 100 gigs.
Like with Red Dead Redemption II
or Gears of War 4 when they're in 4K mode.
There are other games, like indie titles,
that take up almost no space at all.
And then the kind of middle sweet spot,
I think, for a lot of major AAA titles
is somewhere between 30 and 60 gigs
depending on the type of game.
Whether it's open world or very linear.
And how much DLC they get.
So let's be even a little conservative
and say the average game is about 50 gigs.
If every single game you
owned was 50 gigabytes in size
and you had a one terabyte hard drive,
that means you could fit about
20 games for every terabyte.
Although, with that hard drive size,
you're probably going
to have a little less
because some of that
is going to be taken up
by your system's OS.
So 18, maybe 19 games.
And to put in perspective
how much larger games
have grown over time,
if you took the entire NES library
of just over 700 games,
for the licensed ones at least,
that totals to about
230 megabytes of data.
We're going to do a little
bit of heavy rounding here,
but the numbers are still
going to get pretty ridiculous.
So if you took that much data,
and put it on a one terabyte hard drive,
you could put that library
in there 4,350 times.
That totals to over three
million games you could fit.
And now we're down to 19.
Now obviously the size
difference in games right now
to the next generation isn't
going to be that significant
of a boost,
but as time goes on,
games are just going to
keep larger and larger.
So one terabyte for 18
games, and not even that,
once more and more of them
are going to be 4K supported
and probably hitting
that 100 gigabyte mark
is just not going to cut it.
And it's interesting, really,
to see how these changes in sizes
have effected development
of games over time
because it's effected whether
or not you even need a hard drive
and how that works.
For instance, old school
systems just kept everything
on the cards for games.
That was it.
Hard drives weren't a thing.
Eventually we started
getting memory cards,
but that was really just to store any kind
of save data you had.
It had nothing to do with
the game data itself.
And once we started using hard drives,
20 gigs was enough at first.
And then it blew up to
needing 100, 150, 500.
And now we're at the stage we're at
with one terabyte and above.
Now, while hard drives have
gotten really important
for this generation and the
last generation of systems,
there is the small possibility
of all that changing
with the next generation.
To the point where we might
not actually need hard drives
the way we at least currently do.
When talking about the next
generation of consoles,
there's some potential new technologies
that make the entire debate
about hard drive size really interesting.
At least for Xbox.
For Playstation,
I think currently they're plan
is to be fairly traditional.
I think the next system is just going
to be more power, more storage,
very straight forward.
Which, hey, if it works,
why stop?
But with Microsoft,
I think there's a
slightly different debate
we can be having.
I think that there are two
different new Xboxs in the works.
On the one hand,
there's the very premium,
very expensive one.
Something along the lines of what we have
with the Xbox One X right now.
And something that can still play disks,
it will be able to play games from
the hard drive directly,
and it's going to be something
that's very powerful.
But, on the more affordable
end of the spectrum,
is the concept of focusing
on streamable games.
We've talked before a bunch about
the concept of whether
Xbox wants to embrace
a post-ownership version of gaming
where there's things like Xbox game pass
that gives you access to games.
But there's the other idea of focusing
on all your gaming
experiences being streamed,
rather than something
that's being played on
the system itself.
And this is cool for a bunch of reasons.
First off, it makes making
the system itself way cheaper.
Provided you have a good
enough internet connection,
you're going to be able to
play really awesome games
without having to worry
about your system actually running hot
or needing to buy something that's fancier
than something else.
It's just going to be a
basic little streaming box.
And to top that off,
the only real storage issue
you would have is save data.
If all the games you're playing are from
a remote location that's
not where you are,
well you don't have to worry about how big
of the game in question is.
Microsoft's already got
that handled on the server.
On your own system,
you just have to worry about
all the save data you do,
and that's it.
Which compared to how big games are,
is nothing.
Now is this something that's
going to happen for sure?
Maybe.
I mean this is all based on just theory
and things that Microsoft has been doing
and I think it all
points towards this kind
of post-ownership future they want to do.
And there's more tests going on right now.
We're already seeing, in the near future,
a supposed disk-less Xbox One.
And if we're going to
have something like that
that focuses on digital only,
it's not that far of a
leap to move even further
and get rid of the hard drive.
Or at least have a
significantly smaller one
and focus on that
streaming future of gaming.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
