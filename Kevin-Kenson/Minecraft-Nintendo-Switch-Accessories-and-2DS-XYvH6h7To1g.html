a lot of different special edition DS's
in Japan we saw the animal crossing
design there was also a Mario Kart that
was just a black and red and most
recently they released this minecraft
edition which I one note it's kind of
weird to have a Nintendo box product
where on the back it actually says
Microsoft Studios but in celebration of
its release we're gonna open up check it
out as well as go over some awesome
minecraft themed Nintendo accessories
this design actually surprised me a
little bit because normally when you
think of how a creeper looks in-game
it's usually that cube voxel design
where it has the multiple shades of
green squares on it kind of like what
you can see on the box you've got the
little different shades of green going
on whereas on this design instead
Nintendo went for just one single shade
of green which is this kind of light
lime-green almost neon kind of like with
you with their joy cons and to create
that square effect for the face they
created just little tiny shaved off
levels there's just a little bit of an
evenness to the front that up-close is a
really cool little detail this really
rolls into a lot of what I've been
saying lately about Nintendo when it
comes to special editions lately is that
at least for the DS line they've really
been learning how to start nailing down
different special ascetic designs I
think it was a really good call sticking
with the one color because it allows
them to focus on a very simple and
straightforward two color design you the
main lime-green going on over here we've
got black for the face for the buttons
on the shoulder as well as all the text
in the back which it does say minecraft
as well and then on the inside the black
plays really well with the d-pad and the
buttons along with the screen to create
this really good - color design you get
a little bit of grey with the sticks but
that's pretty ignore well compared to
some other special edition designs
they've done in the past where there's
always like an unnecessary third color
or the things playing with it no this is
just a nice simple tubular design that
looks really sharp and clean now this is
not the only special edition minecraft
system that has come out last year
Microsoft had their own Xbox 1s design
that was really intricate and I think
it's really interesting to compare the
differences in how these two were
tackled because that design was very
very intricate there was a lot different
colors going on lots of little details
that I really loved this in the other
hand is a much more simple
straightforward approach I do like the
detail that one to the Xbox one but I
think this is a really good job of just
nailing the aesthetic without doing just
too much extra if you're a fan of
Minecraft this is an awesome little
click will pick up sadly however
they are currently only available in
Japan and while isn't too difficult to
import DS's our regional ops so yeah
have fun with that but if you wanted a
collectible it's great pick up now there
are a lot of other minecraft themed
Nintendo stuff you can grab a lot of
things for the switch let's take a look
at some awesome accessories just kind of
fill out your Minecraft Nintendo
collection first off we've got a game
card case from power a that can hold all
of your switch games now me personally I
love grabbing as many mice which games
physically as I can so this is a really
handy way to carry games around
something to that I think a lot of
people don't realize is that these are
designed to not only carry all your
switch games but they also have little
smaller slots to where you can also add
SD cards in case you use multiple ones
and I do have a lot of different designs
aside from Minecraft one but this one
just blends in perfectly especially
considering well shared themes going on
here oh yeah totally well it's like this
green kind of matches this lighter one
but yeah next let's take a look at
another part and power a their grip
designs and I have talked many times
before about how I am NOT a big fan of
Nintendo's official joint hug grips I
just don't think the comfort grip is
well very comfortable power raise is a
huge upgrade though it might look a
little similar at first but the grip
design is a little more contoured and
shaped it's more comfortable for your
hand and it's made out of a softer
rubber but what's really cool for this
video is they have done a whole bunch of
different designs including a Minecraft
one featuring a diamond sword on the
front and what I think is a really nice
touch is actually matching that diamond
coloring on the grip which looks so good
by the way if you're curious about these
white joy cons that we have in the grip
right here these are actually skins made
by today's sponsor D brand they've made
a whole line of switch skins that are
totally safe to use for the system you
can get them for the dough the dough
icons the dough cons D brand new icons
forgot to say hey you can get it for the
joy cons the switch itself or even for
your dock and get about a whole bunch in
your colors for today's video we're got
the Minecraft thing going on I really
like the way the white looks in this
grip or if you want something for the
switch itself I think the green does a
great job of giving that feeling of a
creeper if you want to buy them make
sure check out the link down below now
if you want a more proper controller
design a really good choice and this is
gonna seem weird at first but trust me
so long and that's Xbox one controllers
they've made two really cool minecraft
themed designs with the creeper and pigs
there's lots of cool little details on
these now there are a lot of accessories
out there that allow to use an Xbox one
controller with a switch a couple of big
options are you can grab the 8-bit Doh
retro receiver which is a really easy
way to set it up the only downside is
you need to have a USB port to attach it
to so it's really only good for dock
mode it's not gonna work for a tabletop
setup so if you all something's gonna
work on both I really like the Brook
adapter this is something that attaches
to the Xbox one controller itself and
allows it to be used as a Bluetooth
controller across a number of different
devices the switch included really easy
to set up just don't put it in the right
switch mode plug it in the do an initial
set up and bam you have an Xbox one
controller that works seamlessly on the
switch personally as far as monitoring
controller designs go I find the Xbox
one to be the most comfortable so being
able to use it across the number of
devices especially the switch is just a
major upgrade heart out which is dead</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
