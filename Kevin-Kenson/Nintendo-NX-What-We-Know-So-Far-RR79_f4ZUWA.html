news but Nintendo's upcoming new console
the NX so I thought now would be a good
time to take together what we know for
fact and what rumors are at least based
on some evidence and might give us ideas
of what the system is gonna look like to
begin with let's talk about what we know
for fact the NX is scheduled to come out
worldwide in March of 2017 and the only
game confirmed for it is the zelda game
that was originally planned for just the
wii u and this is something that's
surprised and even pissed off some
people because the usual assumption is
that a console comes out during the
holiday season when people are buying
stuff left and right and Nintendo
actually addressed this in a recent Q&amp;amp;A
about the 2015 fiscal year where they
basically said well yeah the holiday
season is important but what's more
important is making sure the system has
a strong launch lineup to make it
appealing to consumers which I
completely agree with I mean obviously
if you could do both that would be best
but if the choice is between launch of
the holiday season with no games or wait
a couple months and have titles that are
going to make people want to buy your
stuff seems like a pretty obvious choice
to me now another bit of information we
got out of that same Q&amp;amp;A is that
Nintendo is not planning on selling the
NX at a loss which is their usual mo
outside of the wii u and while this
doesn't give us an exact price point it
does give us a bit of a general idea i
mean if they want the NX to have
hardware that's going to compete with
the ps4 and xbox one it's probably not
going to be selling for very cheap
you're probably not going to see a price
point of 250 or maybe even 300 it's more
likely we're gonna see 350 or even as
high as 400 although it's starting to
get to a dangerous territory where it's
not exactly competitively priced and
that's really all we know for a fact
everything else that you're seeing on
the internet is just the basis of rumors
based on little bits of evidence or
information or hearsay now among those
rumors we do have some ideas of what
kind of games we can expect out launch
for the system there has been word that
we're gonna have a smash brothers game
right at release according to a
consultant that has worked with Nintendo
in the past although he has said that
he's not sure if it's a new smash
brothers game or just a port of the wii
u version considering how far away the
launch of the NX is and that we've had
no information more than likely is just
going to be a part of what we have on
wii u and 3ds Square Enix also mentions
they're planning on bringing Dragon
Quest 10 and 11 to the NX though they
later backpedaled saying this
something they were thinking about and
had under consideration now for Hardware
once again we don't have any hard info
but what we do have is patents now
patents are by no means a guarantee of
what we're going to see in the final
system and they may not even be things
that Nintendo is filing in relation to
the NX but they do give us a clue about
what kind of ideas Nintendo has been
mulling over while the NX has been in
development first up is a patent for a
system that makes use of cloud
processing the idea being that you have
a main game console but then you also
have a separate supplementary system
that allows for boosted processing power
and one of the weirder things about this
particular patent is that it also shows
ideas for a reward system where an owner
can get benefits by allowing other
gamers to make use of their
supplementary device for processing when
they're not using it now the second
patent is the one that interests me the
most because it shows designs for a
system that is entirely diskless and
would instead use a digital library and
maybe even cartridges and the cartridge
idea actually has some recent evidence
because a major manufacturer of ROM
chips that works the Nintendo announced
that they're expecting to see a boost
and profits are on the same time the NX
releases now you might hear this
thinking cartridges that sounds really
old dumb and outdated but it actually
makes a lot of sense in fact disc
reading technology is what's outdated
optical drives take up way too much
space inside of a system and actually
act as a bottleneck to system
performance because you can process
games so much faster than you can read
discs on top of that ROM chips and SSDs
are cheaper than they've ever been so
the idea of having a modern new console
that uses carters instead of disks
actually makes a lot of sense now the
last patent is probably the most
well-known which shows designs for a
full touchscreen controller with a pair
of analog sticks which got a lot of
attention when there was supposedly a
leaked image of the final controller
that looked just like it did in the
patent but that just ended up being a
hoax so looking at all this information
if these patents end up getting used it
actually looks like the NX might not be
a traditional home console setup but
instead a handheld portable system that
has an at-home docking set up for
improved performance and another recent
rumor that actually gives a little more
credence to this idea is that supposedly
the NX is going to be making use of the
nvidia tegra processor which is designed
for mobile systems and this is
really interesting and kind of
intriguing idea to me because it sounds
really awesome I mean a place to
Nintendo strengths when it comes to
handheld systems and using the first
party IPS but it also sounds like it
might be a tad bit expensive I mean if
we're expecting the system to have
hardware that's going to compete with
ps4 xbox one they're not planning on
selling it at a loss and they're
planning for it to have a full
touchscreen system and separate device
that doesn't sound like it's going to be
cheap that doesn't sound like it's going
to be something that can be sold at a
competitive price point to the other
major systems right now I mean obviously
hardcore dedicated fans are going to
grab it either way but for those people
that have kind of drifted away over time
because they didn't care for the wii or
wii u i'm not sure if this is going to
be something that's going to have them
come crawling back but once again this
is all just conjecture based on what
little evidence information we have on
hand right now and the fact of the
matter is that Nintendo is not going to
give us any more hard info any time soon
they've already said that the NX will
not be at e3 so more than likely we're
going to have to wait until tokyo game
show in September or they might not even
do it there but instead wait to do their
own Nintendo Direct conference sometime
during the holiday season to help build
hype for the system when it comes out in
March of 2017 so let me know what you
guys think down below what does the NX
going to look like what kind of games do
you want to have at launch is this a
system where interests in grabbing and
if not what does Nintendo have to do to
change your mind as always guys thank
you so much for watching the video if
you enjoyed it hit that thumbs up button
to let me know as well as subscribe and
I'll see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
