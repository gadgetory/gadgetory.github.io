now and what we did cover some of the
best accessories to come out on launch
date there have been a whole lot more
they've been released since then so
let's go over five of the best to begin
with just like last time we're going to
start with an accessory that isn't
exactly the most fun but it is very very
good to have on hand and that's a
scratch proof case for your switch this
covers the entire thing covering
services make sure that no damage can be
done to it
it's going to leave openings for all the
important stuff though like your
kickstand vents and it still leaves the
droidcon separate so you can't attach
them while they're still covered and
protected now personally I am the kind
of person that just likes to take really
good care of my stuff and keep it
somewhere nice and safe but if I were in
a situation where I knew my switch is
going to be used by kids this is an
absolute must-have to keep this thing
protected and in mint condition as long
as possible next up we have a contender
two one I favorite accessories from last
time and that's a different controller
grip for your joy cogs first off I'm
just a fan of color matching it's just I
like the neon controllers having
something actually looks like it is no
no no Oh a were you saying no because
you want contrast yeah like I said
before the joy con is a lot more
comfortable than I thought it would have
been to use at first glance but still
could use a lot of improving and that's
where joy Congress come in handy now
what makes this one better than the one
I've talked about before is to begin
with
it actually has full-blown grips instead
of just slight angled one so it's a lot
more comfortable and these ones are
shaped and fitted so you can use either
joy Condon which one you would prefer
rather than having one that is an exact
one-to-one match best of all though
these ones actually come in colors that
match the joy cons so you can have one
that matches or by superior stances to
mix and match now the switch has been a
huge success for the most part but since
its launch people have begun noticing
certain major problems with its core
design among them the built-in kickstand
is absolutely terrible and well it's in
kickstand mode there is no way to
actually comfortably charge the system
since the port is on the bottom now the
easy fix for this is a tablet stand now
there is an official Horry one that's
out that has all kinds of switch
branding on stuff if you like but
honestly if you just look up on Amazon
for tablet stands that work with switch
there are all
lot of easy cheap options that you can
pick up it completely solves the problem
by giving you a way to hoist the system
up in a much better way in the kickstand
would at least places open for you to
charge it and best of all if you want to
take your switch on the go they're all
collapsible so it's easy to put away and
store with everything else
speaking on the importance of
portability as I've said many times
before the switch to me is a portable
system I rarely ever use this thing in
docked mode except maybe for a
multiplayer Mario Kart right now and the
big downside of that is the battery life
on the switch isn't exactly the best
lasting only about two and a half to
three hours with some of the more
intensive games so an absolute love to
have is a battery bank now I've talked
about battery banks before for the
switch and it's a little weird a centric
issue that it only accepts a charge if
it's going at 2 amps nothing above so
the best charge you can get is actually
a brand new one from Ankur that has 15
volt out at 2 amps so it's going to give
you the fastest charge possible and has
a really high capacity to boot now if
you saw my last accessory video my
absolute favorite thing I covered from
that was the switch backpack and carries
everything you need the switch a doc
cables pro controller additional joy
cons with enough extra room to fit
things like a laptop but if I'm a big
fan of backpacks there's a new option in
the form of a messenger bag now it's
really cool about this one is that it's
a lot more compact if it's everything a
nice one neat place get the doc cables
place for a pro controller or grip and
you can even remove these dividers if
you want to customize the shaping and
room one last really cool feature too is
it actually comes with a hard case for
your switch with the backpack there's
just a sleeve you put the switch in and
well it's probably safe party you might
worry could get scratched by dust or
dirt or other things in there with this
you have a nice very safe way to protect
your switch while also carrying around
neatly in this messenger bag so there
you have some of the best no accessories
for the switch if you want to grab any
of this stuff I have a link down below
