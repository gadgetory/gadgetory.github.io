amnesia Dark Descent a game that had a
huge impact on the horror game genre it
wasn't the first game to make use of a
powerless protagonist that has to rely
on hiding and running away from monsters
rather than fighting them head-on with
guns and weapons but it was one of the
best ones to do it and we haven't had a
new game from frictional since then we
did get a sequel to amnesia but that was
done by a third party company nothing
directly from frictional until now with
so much now I think it's important to
note that there's a bit of a difference
between how amnesia and soma approached
the horror game genre vs. a lot of other
games that have been coming out lately
where a lot of titles tend to revolve
around jump scares you know something
leaps out at you out of nowhere makes
you freak out for a little bit and then
it's all done amnesia and some will rely
a lot more on ambient horror where there
might be some jump scares here and there
but they rely a lot more on visuals
sound and just a lot of little weird
environmental tweaks to really give you
a more constant sense of pressure and
this is something I think soma does a
really good job
first off visually I love the aesthetic
it's clearly based on Japanese cyberpunk
where you've just got lots of pieces of
jagged metal coming out of everything
coming through the walls growing out of
organic things and just gives everything
this very disgusting deformed non
symmetrical look to compliment these
visuals the game also has fantastic
sound effects which i think is one of
its biggest strong points alongside just
the numerous machine noises happening in
the background you'll also have things
like monsters wailing in the distance or
more subtle effects to freak you out
just a little bit for instance a
dripping sound that also kind of sounds
like footsteps in a puddle on top of
these two senses of sight and sound the
game also just has a lot of nice little
effects that just mess with the
environment to freak you out a little
more for instance there's the constant
screen glitches that happen whenever an
enemy is nearby or something freaky is
happening there's also lots of little
weird occurrences like you might find a
body that's in one room and that has
moved later on when you come back or a
door that you know is sealed but now is
open to just a little bit it's little
things like these combined with these
sound effects and visuals that just make
this game give you a nice constant
of Terror now the thing is all this
ambience is a little ruined though by
the game's monster designs I found it a
little weird that someone was really at
its best when I never actually saw a
monster but instead just heard
descriptions of them heard sounds of
them and had all these kind of sense of
unknown fear running through me until I
actually confronted a monster and lost
all sense of terror because they're all
designs that were familiar with and to
top it off the mechanics in this game
have removed a lot of bite from monsters
but just doesn't make them very scary
and instead just boils down any part
with him and to just an awkward
cat-and-mouse game where you would track
them in one direction just to go around
them and keep the problem is is that
soma has removed any sense of difficulty
that was present in amnesia see enemy
Jie you have to worry about resources
gone you had matches that were very
precious and in fact you might even get
midway through the game only to realize
that you may have wasted too many so you
want to start over there was also one
singular monster that was fairly creepy
and would one-shot you if it got too
close that isn't present in soma to
begin with there are no resources
whatsoever you can lose health but
that's replenished by finding these
little healing spots that come up fairly
often and monsters don't even one shot
kill you instead they just knock you out
where you wake up they're nowhere to be
seen and you were critically injured so
if you get attacked again it's game over
but since there's no monsters around you
can just crawl your way to whatever
healing spot is nearby and be perfectly
fine and this can even be abused let's
say there's a part in the game where
there's a monster standing in front of
an item you need to interact with to
move on well you can just walk right up
to it get killed
wake up grab the other green weed - and
go about your business towards the next
area to heal now that aside there's a
whole lot this game still does really
well like I said I loved the ambience
but they also did a great job with the
story I don't want to go into specifics
cuz one of the big things about horror
games is not knowing what the hell is
going on and trying to figure it out but
the basic idea is that you're trapped in
this underwater sci-fi hellhole filled
with murderous machines and you have no
idea how you got there in the first
place
concept wise the story focuses a lot on
the philosophical ideas behind
artificial intelligence and
transhumanism and it does a great job of
approaching these subjects because it
doesn't really try to give you any
answers it just provokes a lot of
questions to make the player think I
also think they did a great job of
pacing the main storyline because they
give you just enough plot to understand
if you just want to blitz through the
main bits but if you take your time
reading different journal entries
listening to recordings there's a whole
lot more to uncover regarding the game's
backstory and finding out a little more
about the philosophies it's trying to
impart all that al Souma is a great game
while I do have my complaints there's
still a lot of good in here and really a
lot of the changes while they do make it
for a less challenging and less scary
game does make for a much better story
told and it does to have it's scary
parts it's just that it doesn't impart
that same level of numbing fear that
amnesia had one last note is that I do
think the game was a little further than
I would have liked it to be it lasts
about eight hours long from start to
finish and with that reduced difficulty
I was talking about it didn't take long
to get through everything the game had
to offer there's enough here for it to
be satisfying but you just want a little
more I think this is definitely worth
picking up for horror fans especially if
you like sci-fi stuff and it's also a
great choice to look at if you want
games that focus on philosophy on the
other hand if you want something that's
just more focused on the action and core
mechanics not so much well that was my
review of soma if you guys enjoyed the
video as always make sure to hit that
thumbs up button to let me know as well
