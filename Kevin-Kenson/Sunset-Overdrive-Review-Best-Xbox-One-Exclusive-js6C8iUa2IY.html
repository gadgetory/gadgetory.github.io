buchen some teddy bears straps CNT how
about using a firework launcher while
grinding on a rollercoaster have you
ever wanted to fight an energy drink
spewing mutant dragon by chasing it
through city streets grind on its spine
and jab a crowbar into its head okay
maybe that last one was just a little
too specific but that's the kind of
stuff that the Xbox one exclusive sunset
overdrive sets out to do combining fast
travel grind mechanics with hordes of
mutant creatures ridiculous weapons
over-the-top aesthetics and a lot of
intentional forth while breaking and
referential humor kind of a finely tuned
fusion of Dead Rising in Saints Row with
just a pinch of Jet Set Radio and punk
music flavoring the basic idea is that a
major super-powerful corporation
accidentally made an energy drink that
turns people into horrid monsters
basically think that monster took things
a little too literally so of course the
logical approach to protect their
profits is to quarantine your city seal
everyone and blow it up and cover the
whole thing up you take control of your
own customized hero choosing between a
couple different body types and a great
array of faces hairstyles and clothing
options and basically take it upon
yourself to band other survivors
together to find a way to survive and
escape the city now honestly the story
isn't the reason you want to play this
game it's very 2-dimensional nothing too
original but you will get a good chuckle
every now and then thanks to referential
humour or if you just enjoy a lot of
cursing now the reason you do want to
play this game though is this core
gameplay and its art style which is
phenomenal
far from being a realistic looking world
everything is vibrant colorful and at
times absolutely gorgeous
more importantly though it's amazing how
smooth the gameplay looks despite how
absolutely insane it can get visually
with not just how many monsters
right but also with things like shooting
waves of roman candles or sound effects
getting spelled out like every time a
popper explodes as for the gameplay
takes a lot of simple core building
blocks of a couple different genres and
smashes them together for a pretty damn
fun experience
grinding while running and bouncing
provides the game's sole form of faster
travel forgoing even a simple sprint
button and players combine these various
forms of travel with ridiculous weapons
to stay away from enemies and bring a
lot of pain it's not just as simple
though as grind on stuff and shoot
things the game also includes these
equippable little things called amps and
what they do is unlock powerful upgrades
mid combat as a reward for fighting with
style sure you could just do the same
thing over and over again and be fairly
efficient but if you actually push your
character style you'll find yourself
doing way better things like shooting
fireballs from your melee weapon causing
your guns to create a Chain Lightning
effect or send out shockwaves from
ground Slams basically the cooler you
fight more badass you become which is a
great idea because it rewards stylish
gameplay with something a lot more
physical than just a numerical point
value for saying good job now there is a
problem with this gameplay though under
the hood and that's the fact that a lot
of the customization options are a
little more daunting than they really
feel like they need to be the game
rushes you at the start with a lot of
information at first it's just really
simple stuff like yeah here's how you
equip the weapon but then you get into
amps which are equipped to multiple
different slots as well as having slots
dedicated to every individual weapon you
have equipped and to top that off
there's also OverDrive's
which are on an entirely different set
of slots dedicated to equipping constant
passive bonuses you unlock for favoring
certain play styles like grinding often
or using automatic guns alot it's not so
much that it's completely overwhelming
but just feels on
necessary the gameplay itself is so
intuitive and free-flowing but the
customization is just slots galore that
need updating every time you get a new
overdrive or amp now I'm not saying that
customization is a bad thing that's an
argument that I'd almost never really
make but there is such a thing as having
more streamlined customization that's
friendly and having something that's
needlessly complex that just bogs down
the otherwise really fast-paced gameplay
now one thing I will praise about this
though is the fact that every single
area you can upgrade has its own unique
resource and they can all be gained by
just simply playing the game requiring
very little forced grinding making
quests and monsters will give you money
and overcharge used for buying clothing
and guns respectively while amps are
earned for collectables you find pretty
often by just using the free running
mechanics smartly and OverDrive's are
literally just from playing the game
grind long enough and you'll earn badges
that can go towards buying one so while
there is a ton of stuff to equip
unlocking it in the first place really
isn't that big of a chore so the core
mechanics in this game other than being
a little bit much at times are pretty
solid overall but how does the game make
you use them well as is common amongst
most free roam games the game is mostly
divided between main story missions and
side missions its core missions are for
the most part really good there's a
decent variety in objectives and special
rules and while the story isn't that
great enough silly crap happens to make
the whole thing entertaining with its
only downfall really being that I wish
it were longer side quests are on the
other hand way more tedious 90% of them
boiled down to just scouring the city
for items to collect or certain
creatures can weigh them out which is a
shame smooth these missions really are
how you get a lot of the game's more
ridiculous clothing options on various
items now once you're bored with the
single-player the game does also offer
one multiplayer mode called chaos squad
which is basically just eight players
competing to complete a couple different
objectives better than the others then
working together
hold off waves of mutants in a horde
mode using traps guns and rails galore
the basic idea here is cool and this
fund dabble in on occasion but there's a
couple of problems with it most notably
the fact that the mode can only ever be
played at a difficulty setting
appropriate for it which made players if
you just have three friends and Xbox
ones and you want to play something
exclusively with them too bad go online
and play with randoms as well chaos war
on its own is still fun to play with but
I just really wish the game offered some
alternative multiplayer modes for
smaller skills even though it's just
something as simple as having poor
players do a longer version of the Horde
mode or even just having two players
work cooperatively in the game's main
missions overall sunset overdrive is a
great game whose biggest flaw is just
how fast it can burn you out the
gameplay is fantastic but can only
sustain itself so long considering the
length of the main campaign and while
chaos squad can be a fun diversion
without a more personal friends focused
option it's going to lose some of you
from being able to play it long-term
that being said it's still definitely
one of the strongest titles and if not
the strongest Xbox one exclusive
currently out it just could have been
that much more perfect had there been a
little more tweaking to what options
were available well that was my review
