that's really into video games so much
so that they already have a ton of games
and you don't think they need one more
just yet so here's some great gift ideas
for the little gamer that you know first
off we got to go with a classic right
away Mario there is a whole line of
officially-licensed mario plushies that
come in just about any character you'd
want from the series now me personally I
had to grab Luigi for the best mario
brother and a Yoshi in my favorite color
red these things are soft so if you want
to grab them for a super little
youngster they'll be just fine they're
strong The Price is Right and most
importantly they actually look like the
characters and not some weird warped
ripoff now the next item is something I
invested most of my time into as a kid
Legos Legos are freaking awesome and
sadly there aren't a lot of video game
franchises represented in them with one
gigantic exception minecraft there are a
lot of Minecraft sets out there to
choose from all varying in size and
complexity you can build these sets
using the included instructions to make
things just like they are in the box but
like with most LEGO sets this is more of
a suggestion and starting point than
anything just be worried that by buying
this you are guaranteeing you will one
day accidentally step on a lego and
forever regret it for our third item
let's take a break from fun things and
talk functional for a second 3ds cases
the 3ds is the most popular handheld
gaming system lot to get to have them or
maybe getting one this holiday and the
last thing you want is for them to break
it now you can find basic plastic shells
for 3ds like this one pretty easy but
honestly I'd argue that what's even more
important is a full carrying case for
the system and games like this one it
not only gives you a place to store and
protect the 3ds when it's not in use but
it also has a little compartment for the
charger and any additional little
accessories like headphones the biggest
benefit though is it gives you a place
to store up to 24 3ds or DS cards the
last thing you want a kid to do is throw
their games in a bag that end up getting
lost as though or a black hole or keep
stuffing them in their pockets so that
one day they accidentally go through a
wash cycle it's also a nice little touch
that a lot of these cases use little
mesh nets for the games so you can still
visibly tell which are which without
having to pull each one out one by
one next up is the latest big official
toy to come out of the Pokemon franchise
the Z ring this was released as a sort
of combo toy with the latest Pokemon
games Sun and Moon which are fantastic
by the way also a good gift idea and
it's a recreation of the Z ring that
players wear in game basically in
Pokemon Sun and Moon you can use the Z
ring in combination with elemental Z
crystals and a little dance which causes
Pokemon to use super-powerful moves once
per battle so in copying that the toy
comes with three crystals to get you
started and you can buy separate packs
to get even more crystals if you like
now the obvious use here is for kids
role-playing as pokemon trainers it even
lights up and stuff if you hit this
button but a really cool function too is
that it'll actually connect with the
Pokemon Sun and Moon game so that every
time a Z move is used it'll light up and
activate at the same time it reminds me
a lot of when I was little and had one
of those morphers from Power Rangers
join me now this last toy is a bit
simple but honestly it's the kind of
thing I wish was around when I was kid a
foam master sword when you're a kid
before things like taxes paying rent or
dealing with soul-crushing debt could
grind down your sense of imagination one
of the most fun things you can do is
pretend to be one of your favorite
heroes from books games or TV and any
proper hero of time isn't complete
without a trusty Master Sword this one
is based off of the sword from Wind
Waker where link is always a kid so it's
sized perfectly for any young aspiring
hero now am I saying you should buy a
toy that is effectively arming your
child with a weapon kinda but that's why
I'm recommending something made from
foam it's soft
trust me I've done thorough testing
it also looks good enough that if you do
need to take it away doesn't make for
that bad of a display piece hanging
around in the background which is this
one's life now forever</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
