veteran and is one of the minds
responsible for one of gaming's largest
survival horror franchises resident evil
well he no longer works for Capcom and
resident evil has gone in the direction
of an action series mikami has now
collaborated with bethesda to bring a
new IP that's trying to recapture the
classic action horror game the evil
within does it live up to the task and
bring about that great combination of
lack of resources and impending fear of
strong enemies well let's take a look
first off the game's plot evil within
takes place in a modern-day setting
though it's hard to place it at any one
location as the game constantly shifts
you around rather suddenly not because
you physically travel a lot but because
a ton of trippy shit begins to happen
ranging from old villages to insane
hospitals ruined cities to abandoned
mansions the game covers a number of
different popular horror game locales
all under an initially very unclear plot
the game throws you into the action
rather suddenly with little to no
introduction for its cast something that
is initially bothersome but does get
addressed and made up for in the later
stages of the game I don't want to go
too far into specifics in order to avoid
spoilers for a game that is so heavily
reliant on secrets and revealed
backstory but the main just you need to
understand is that a lot of weird stuff
is happening and a lot of really crazy
looking monsters are out to eat your
face now if you played the resident evil
series then some of this gameplay is
going to look very familiar it's
extremely reminiscent of the last
resident evil the commie had a hand in
Resident Evil for making use of a third
person camera focused on the characters
back shifting to over the shoulder when
aiming your gun gameplay is mostly
focused around evading or killing zombie
like monsters and other nightmarish
creatures while guns are your main
option for combat you can also perform
really weak melee attacks burn enemies
that are knocked to the ground using
matches perform a stealth attack that
may or may not instantly kill depending
on the enemy and make use of a number of
different special crossbow bolts that
you can craft from parts you find and
collect you can try to avoid enemies
simply by sneaking by or just by running
as fast as you can though in some
situations that's just an awful idea
because there's some kind of switch you
need to activate that does take time to
use now monsters aren't the only
challenges the game throws at you either
the game makes extensive use of a couple
different kinds of traps all of which
can be disarm
and sometimes avoided though the earlier
might occasionally require a quick mini
game that failing will lead to a bunch
of damage taken disarming traps rewards
you with parts to create different
specialty bolts for your crossbow but
leaving them intact can sometimes be in
your best interest as enemies may
trigger them as well as you get through
the game along with picking up a moment
items to use you'll also collect green
gel that works as a form of experience
allowing you to buy passive upgrades
that improve your base statistics like
health and melee damage upgrade your
guns or you're carrying capacity for
ammo and other useful items there are
also a number of times when progression
isn't just as simple as kill some
enemies and avoid some traps the game
does have a few minor puzzle segments or
impossibly difficult enemies that take
some strategy to dispatch adding a good
bit of variety to keep the core gameplay
from feeling too stagnant the game's
most consistent form of difficulty
mostly comes from how it restrains your
resources most enemies are relatively
slow and while you can occasionally miss
it's not too common the big problem
though is that enemies can be rather
plentiful at times and even with
headshots or stronger weapons it can
take a few hits to bring each one down
and all of this the fact that melee
attacks are pathetic until you
practically max the stat and you'll find
yourself running skim on supplies pretty
often throughout the game I will make
note though that this issue mostly
exists at the very beginning and end of
the game as the midpoint suffers from a
little bit of overabundance of supplies
the game has a habit of giving you a
couple rooms to get a bunch of readings
to stock up for an upcoming boss fight
or just a new area of enemies plus there
are a few items you get during this
midsection that are extremely abusable
against early on bosses especially the
freezing bolt which just makes some
bosses completely laughable the very
start though does leave you with very
few weapon options and late game starts
to really bleed you dry of ammo while
throwing enemies left and right which is
really when the game is at its best one
interesting way the game does try to
help you with a degree of randomness to
is collectible hidden keys that can be
found throughout the game which can then
be used to unlock lockers that contain
healing items ammunition and experience
though unless you're using a guide you
won't know what you get until you open
it sometimes getting just what you need
or sighing at the sight of ammo that
you're currently maxed on though
thankfully the items do stay available
until you're able to grab them to be
perfectly honest my experience with the
evil within was something of a
progression while the very very
beginning was okay I found myself
dislike
a lot of the early on content there are
a lot of very odd jumps between
locations and timing there wasn't very
good explanations or destroyed
conveyance going on and add on to the
fact that very early you get both the
shotgun and the agony crossbow making
early on opponents just really pathetic
making it feel much more like an action
game rather than the survival horror
genre it was meant to revive but as time
went on monsters began to get more
diverse and while having a variety of
weapons ammo started to come by a little
less and less and the story begins to
become exceedingly more clear not only
explaining but effectively balancing out
the games rocky start an introduction
the game definitely has its bumps in the
road and the overall experience isn't
perfect but at the end of the whole
thing I found myself having only fond
thoughts of the game and in many ways it
did recreate much of the classic
survival horror action hybrid ranking
close to its very clear relative
Resident Evil for a single playthrough
takes somewhere between 12 and 15 hours
of gameplay depending on how much
trouble you have with it though it can
be considerably less if you're a veteran
of the genre or skip a lot of the game's
cutscenes if you're the challenge
smashing type the game does offer to
higher difficulties unlocked after a
single playthrough potentially giving
you at least a second helping of the
game if you're a fan of older school
Resident Evil this is a title you simply
must check out and even if not and
you're just a fan of horror action games
in general like dead space then this is
still worth the effort it doesn't start
off on the right foot but trust me it's
worth pushing forward to get to the game
