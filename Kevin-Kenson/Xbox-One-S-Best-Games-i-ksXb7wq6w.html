until you saw the slip you broke down
you pre-ordered it and now you're
thinking to yourself what games do I
need to get well good news for you I got
a list of the best Xbox one exclusive
that you have got to play now first on
our list is for you zombie lovers Dead
Rising 3 now don't expect this to be one
of those games where it's you versus one
or two zombies at a time like we've seen
in Resident Evil we're talking about
literally hordes and hordes of zombies
so I know I've been using the word
zombie a lot which usually gives the
feeling of a survival horror kind of
thing but really this game is more of a
jackass simulator zombie the myths are
really nothing more than just obstacles
for you to steam rule I mean really just
look what you can do in this game you
can put on a dragon costume and fly
around breathing fire on stuff or if
it's more your thing you could dress up
like a schoolgirl and just tear through
enemies with a chainsaw and on top of
that the exclusive DLC is completely
ridiculous with an equally ridiculous
name in this insane arcade mode you get
to play some of your favorite capcom
characters like being able to piledrive
bombs as Hagar and if that's not your
style there's more characters to choose
from from games like Street Fighter
Megaman and more making this game a
great pick for your Xbox one second up
halo 5 now before you scream at your
monitor and prep those angry comments
about how terrible the story was it's
true the single-player campaign was
completely hit and miss with some of the
weakest writing in the franchise but if
that's why you didn't grab this game
you'd be missing the point
multiplayer 5 nacht multiplayer
completely out of the park
bringing the series back to its arena
shooter roots so instead of borrowing
things like killstreaks and level
unlocks from call of duty which is
recorded 5 got rid of all essentially
putting players on a level playing field
where all that matters is skill and map
knowledge not only that but the online
modes are fantastic offering classics
like capture the flag infection and good
old team deathmatch and for something
new
warzone mode where two teams as well
fight it out on massive maps filled with
AI enemies capturable bases and
tuple objectives for winning the day if
you loved the older halo games you've
got to check this one out
for our third game we've got the rare
replay collection now if the name rare
doesn't ring a bell
they're responsible for some of the best
games to come out on the n64 NES and
arcades I'm talking Killer Instinct
banjo kazooie Perfect Dark Battletoads
and of course Conker's Bad Fur Day you
don't know what Conker's Bad Fur Day is
here's a taste of what you've been
missing I am the great mighty oh and I'm
going to throw my shit at you yeah
that's a family favorite keep in mind
this isn't just one awesome game we're
talking thirty classics you get to climb
the mountain of bullshit beat them up
difficulty that is Battletoads you get
to experience banjo kazooie one of the
silliest and greatest platformers to
come out on the n64 Perfect Dark which
is basically golden eyes amazing little
brother that a lot of people missed out
on and once again Conker's Bad Fur Day
more than anything I just love how you
can tell how much care they took in
putting this collection together I mean
it's really easy to just take a bunch of
games and throw them on a select screen
but in this collection everything is set
up like you're in a theater with all
kinds of extra goodies like developer
interviews and behind-the-scenes if you
never played these games you owe it to
yourself to grab this now for one of the
most underrated games on the Xbox one
sunset overdrive this game cares about
just one thing bringing the fun you know
who doesn't like the sound of grinding
on Rails shooting teddy bear strapped
with dynamite at giant mutant freaks no
one it's bright colorful and never drops
an energy it also doesn't hurt that the
soundtrack kicks ass I'm saying moving
on to one of the most beautiful games on
the Xbox one Ori in the blind forest in
this 2d platformer you play as already
navigating your way through a gorgeous
forest filled with beautiful landscapes
wonderful creatures and a fantastic use
of lighting that sets the tone for the
whole game and if that doesn't float
your goat don't worry because the game
mechanics are just as amazing it starts
off like a simple platformer until you
start unlocking a lot of really
interesting abilities and powers take
bashing for example this allows you to
redirect enemy projectiles in one
direction sending you flying in the
other allowing you to both kill enemies
and reach new heights
you also get to create your own check
points using resources which is genius
because it makes the game a lot more
difficult because you have to plan
saving carefully pacing where and when
it's used this game is beautiful
inventive and challenging do not let
this one pass you by I can already hear
some of you right now
what about Forza horizon 2 the best
racing game of this generation and
you're right it's a great pick but
here's my flawless logic unless you
really got to get your racing simulator
fix right away horizon 3 is just around
the corner coming out in September and
we'll also be taking advantage of the
Slim's added function of supporting HDR</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
