such a thing as console exclusives well
that's something that a recent rumor
might suggest we're finally taking the
first step in so normally I don't like
talking about rumors on this channel
when there's not really any kind of
heavy factual basis for them but this is
something I've talked about a lot on the
channel and it's really exciting if this
is real what's up everyone so today we
have some news to break over the last
few days there has been some teasing
which imply Microsoft and Nintendo are
working together on some exciting things
this rumor comes from a channel called
direct Heat games and they have a
history of getting some rumor and
speculation and future leaked stuff
correct and what they're talking about
is the concept of future relationships
between Xbox and Nintendo and there's
two main parts to this rumor the first
part is the concept that games that are
published by Microsoft and that are
traditionally Xbox and PC exclusive are
going to start making their way to the
switch and the first main example it is
given is Ori now this rumor by itself
honestly isn't that shocking to me this
is something that you know I think
there's this kind of weird tradition
thing in gaming where people like well
no this is a Microsoft game that can't
be on this or oh no Mario is always a
Nintendo it can't be on anything else
except phones now and so people don't
always necessarily think of this as a
possibility but there's a lot of history
and precedents for software made by one
company to make its way to other
companies hardware and platform because
at the end of the day it's still money
that's going to them and there already
is a precedent for Microsoft and
Nintendo working together in this kind
of way after all
minecraft while it didn't start off as a
Microsoft exclusive is owned by them now
and still got released all the Switch
and even gave people access to Xbox Live
with recent functions opening up like
allowing people playing on switch to get
Xbox Live achievements so yeah games
like Ori and maybe even some other
personal favorites like cuphead coming
to switch are an awesome concept but
it's the other part of this rumor that's
really intriguing one of the things that
Microsoft has been pushing very heavily
about Xbox is game paths and if this
rumor is true it might be making its way
to swish now what exactly does this mean
well the rumor doesn't really specify
just that game path is making its way to
the switch and the assumption that a lot
of people are making is that this has to
do with
the future of X cloud the idea of making
Xbox games available via other services
to unlock console quality gaming on any
device this is an example that Microsoft
has given in the past of playing for
instance for its on a phone well if X
cloud works you could stream all the
games on xbox game pass straight to your
switch now this is definitely the ideal
future where you break down this concept
just being able to play whatever games
you want streaming through the switch
but for something like X code to work
it's gonna take a lot of groundwork and
honestly I'm a little skeptical at the
concept of something like that coming to
the switch as soon as this year if we're
looking at something much more short
term where game paths in some form makes
its way to the switch what I think is
more likely for now is that any games
that are available on both switch and
Xbox and are on game paths
you'll be able to access on the switch
for free with your game pass membership
think of it this way you own an Xbox you
ready for membership a game pass and
some game you really like some game pass
you'd really rather play handheld on the
go
well since you're a member you can just
download it on your switch find and play
it's so kind of like Netflix you're a
subscriber you have access to all this
content but you're only able to play it
on the platforms that it can actually
run on the reason this rumor interests
me so much is because it plays exactly
into what I've been saying for the last
year about Microsoft in a lot of ways
video games are kind of falling behind a
little bit compared to other forms of
media so many of them have focused on a
pure digital front and also going post
ownership music people basically just
use streaming services movies and
television streaming services and the
occasional individual digital purpose
gaming however we're still focused a lot
on this concept of well these games are
on this platform this is we have to play
on this is what this is on and I think
they're really pushing towards getting
past that stage I think right now Xbox
is working hard behind closed doors
trying drag gaming into this more
digital post ownership future where you
know instead of focusing on Hardware
which I think they'll still do they want
to focus more on the content of Xbox as
a service they'll still release some
kind of new system Xbox - whatever you
want to call it but that's not the focus
the focus is Xbox as a platform buying
into Xbox game past being a member and
being able to play those games on
whatever platform you want whether
that's on your xbox on your switch or
even on your phone in order to do that
we believe we need to build a game
streaming service I think we're building
towards this future where the
console wars and even console versus PC
is just completely meaningless and
instead you just play whatever games you
want on whatever control you want on
whatever platform you want that makes
the most sense for you or then again all
this is based on absolutely nothing and
I just have to live with the fact that
I'll never play cuphead on the switch
and this really isn't that insane of a
thing to think about I mean again with
gaming I think there's this weird sense
of traditionalism where oh these things
are all divided into their consoles and
that's how it has to be but we don't
really have that kind of same sense of
dedication when it comes to other
divides of software and hardware I mean
Microsoft makes Windows OS and it works
on more things not just products that
they physically make Apple has Apple
music in to work on Android phones it's
not just an iPhone only service and look
let's be honest the last generation has
not been super kind to Xbox I think
they've come a long way in terms of
improving the hardware and the software
the Xbox one but game sales haven't
always been the strongest and as a
result I think they're really Stern look
for more ways to really capitalize on
the concept of what exactly Xbox needs
to be to remain profitable in the future
and making all the cool stuff they make
available on other platforms like the
switch is a genius way to do it or then
again this is all based on absolutely
nothing and it's book</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
