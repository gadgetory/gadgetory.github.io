when we're coming up with video ideas is
to just look for weird or cool or
ingenuitive stuff that's on Etsy that
people have come up with and admittedly
normally we focus on the weird stuff but
today is a little bit different today we
want to talk about something that I find
really interesting we've talked a few
times before about how one of the really
cool things about the switch is that the
joy cons are these nifty little
controllers that can attach to a large
variety of different kinds of
accessories and so far there's been only
light experimentation with that like
regular controller grips they've
announced like a fishing or others
there's a few things out there but they
can definitely get weirder than what and
that's what brings us to old purchased
for today's video this doesn't exactly
tell you much just by looking at it it's
pretty bare-bones and basic I know but
really all this is is just a simple
piece of plastic that's designed with
two rails on it for joy cons to attach
to now normally when there's gripped
designs of the switch it's putting the
joy cons side by side to create kind of
a traditional controller in this case
though it's designed to put the droid
cons back to back allowing you to use
them with one hand now if you've been
keeping up with this chain you'll know
that a couple of weeks ago we tried out
a one-handed playstation controller
which had kind of mixed results across
all the games we used it on but in its
defense it was something that was
advertised specifically for just RPGs as
a simple controller where's this is a
very different kind of design with how
the buttons are gonna be arranged so I'm
really curious to see how it's gonna
work out so we're gonna test it on a
bunch of major switch titles and just
see how viable it is okay so start we're
gonna go with Mario Kart because I feel
like that's gonna be a really easy one
because I really have to worry about
accelerating maybe breaking on occasion
and turning and like using items one of
the weird things right away is I'm not
really sure how I'm supposed to hold
this controller I'm sure it's gonna vary
with each game I think I'm gonna go with
my thumb on this controller these two
fingers on the shoulders and then ring
finger on the stick maybe I don't know
let's try that out
this is already a mess oh God so
applying pressure with one hand or one
finger makes the rest of this feel
different weird oh and it's reversed
because I'm holding this controller
front that's bad so the problem we're
having right now
is this is the joy come first for
steering and because I'm holding it
backwards with my brain reads as left is
actually right and vice versa
can I hold it this way okay this doesn't
feel as intuitive but it's much better
for the game so I flipped it I got my
thumb now using for turning and I'm just
pressing down accelerate the whole time
I can still hit the shoulder buttons for
using items holding it this way I'm not
entirely sure when I'm applying enough
pressure to be hitting the button
because this weird claw grip the thing
I'm doing so sometimes I'm letting up on
accelerate what I don't mean to you just
really have to grip it a lot and it's
not very comfortable on my hand but it's
working I'm in first place right now on
the easiest map 100cc I hit someone at
the green show okay this could work for
racing let's let's try something
different though um you'll do dog Kong
next for a side-scrolling game reaction
you like jump on enemies and not die but
to go easy on myself you do funky Kong
mode also it's funky Kong so I wouldn't
I
so starting up one of the biggest things
I'm noticing is just like with Mario
Kart I have to get used to flipping some
things in my head because with Mario
Kart when I was holding it this way
initially left was right where I was
left and it's just definitely better
rolled this way but now when I have it
this way when a game is like oh press B
I'm like yeah that's this one right it's
not well actually okay that is B but a
and Y are flipped which gets annoying
yeah this is actually really this is
actually easy to the Mario Kart now that
I'm doing it up and to like of course I
get to hit when I start saying that yeah
this actually this we're gonna pretty
well I'm not I'm not you know running
through the stage nearly as quickly as I
would normally but that's just cuz I'm
kind of learning how to use this guy
comfortably but it works when you're
using detach joy comes make sure using
the wrist strap yeah that's not
happening
chemicals are actually the main thing
that I'm worried about so oh that's
weird yeah okay so I need to use my ring
finger on the stick middle finger on
these buttons this for shoulders and
then thumb for movement right like I
just need to let the automatic following
work and then just mess with the camera
when I really need to
I kept landing directly in front of
enemies which seems like a dumb thing
that shouldn't be affected by this
controller but it happens three times in
a row so maybe I'm just bad oh I did it
again
no camera back down so with donkey hyung
you know it was more difficult but I
could totally see you know getting
through the whole game using it Mario I
can already tell just there's a little
more nuance with the control and where
you want to move and as a result
especially with camera controls this
could get really annoying it would take
a lot more time with this controller and
just kind of getting the full hang of it
like I'm pretty sure me playing mario 64
back as an actual kid was better than
how I'm doing right now all right last
but far from least we're gonna do breath
of the wild because like Mario we don't
only have to worry about camera angles
and moving around in a 3d space but
there's a lot more button combinations
happening where if I want to change
weapons or if I want to aim and use a
bow hold down this button and then use
this stick which that's weird that's
really weird about aiming a bow let's
try anything a bow
nope still no because I think for bowing
you did there we go
I haven't just played Zelda in a while
so I'm also forgetting with the controls
are no don't do that
okay but no no pick the sword back up
okay so I have to now motion controls
are terrible for this I need to turn
those off this is a disaster anything
that requires using both sticks at the
same time is really really annoying with
this grip because you could maybe get
used to controlling both at once but the
way you're holding controller makes it
pretty awkward to try and hit any other
button not just because of you know what
fingers you have wear but just the way
you're moving your hand doesn't really
feel natural and I'll just start
cramping up which definitely into game
for here my hand is cramping bad from
all these games so I'm just gonna go
ahead and say right now that for Zelda
this is a no-go like if you're one of
those people that wants to say like oh
yeah I beat this game using this kind of
controller great good for you but if
you're just wondering if you can use a
one head to control like this to play
Zelda no not a good idea at least not
for me this is not working
so yeah this isn't exactly a perfect
solution but it does work a lot better
than I would have anticipated and it
makes me really curious about whether or
not Nintendo could pursue something like
this in the future because especially
with other big companies like Microsoft
investing in ideas like the adaptive
controller for helping people with
disabilities the idea of
Kahn's getting a similar accessory tube
use them with a single hand seems like a
great idea</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
