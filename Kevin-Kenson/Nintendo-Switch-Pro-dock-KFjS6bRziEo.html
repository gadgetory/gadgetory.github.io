is sponsored by RAID: Shadow Legends.
While there are plenty
of rumors going around right now regarding
a new Switch system
coming out sometime late
this year or maybe even
sometime next year,
that hasn't stopped Nintendo
from actively improving
the current Switch.
Now there's been a lot
of news traveling around
the idea of a Switch Boost Mode
which is a slightly misleading term,
but it does get the idea across
of what exactly is
happening with the Switch.
Now what a lot of people think
about the idea of Boost Mode,
they think of the PS4 Pro's Boost Mode
where it takes the
added power of a PS4 Pro
and uses it to improve
games in ways beyond
of just simply increasing the resolution.
For instance, maybe giving you a smoother
or better frame rate.
Or adding some visual affects
the game didn't originally have.
When it comes to using the
Switch in handheld mode,
the system is basically
handicapping itself.
It's still capable of
doing the same resolution
of frame rate and everything
that we see in docked mode,
except if it did that on the screen,
well first off it wouldn't be necessary
'cause the screen can't do
that high of a resolution.
But on top of that,
it would drain the battery
system significantly faster.
Not to mention getting
really warm in your hands.
So something that Nintendo
and different developers
have begun supporting
is the idea of overclocking
the system specifically
when it is loading up games.
And this is evident in titles like:
Legend of Zelda, and Mario Odyssey,
after some recent updates.
As well as in more recent
intensive titles like,
Mortal Kombat 11.
Basically all it's doing
is leveraging the power
the switch already has
and overclocking it just
during low times of games
to ensure that those low
times happen much faster
than normal.
And because it's only doing it
for those very brief periods,
it doesn't really impact
the battery at all.
So as a result, you're seeing
what is basically improved
performance in handheld mode
without actually impacting it
in any kind of major negative way.
This is honestly a genius idea
and has done a great job of improving
the handheld experience of the system.
And this is something that
generally happens over
the lifetime of different systems,
where developers over time learn
how to better make use of what's on it,
to give us a better resulting experience.
And thinking about how
Nintendo's been leveraging
the power of the system two
years into it's life cycle
it makes me wonder,
what if we're thinking about the idea
of a new Switch product wrong.
What if we are getting
maybe a Switch mini,
but what if Switch Pro isn't
exactly what we think it is?
Before moving on,
I want to take a second to thank
RAID: Shadow Legends for
sponsoring today's video.
RAID: Shadow Legends just came out
and is one of the most
ambitious RPG products of 2019.
And best of all, it's completely free.
RAID has all the features
you'd expect from a new RPG.
An amazing storyline,
awesome 3D graphics, giant
boss fights, PvP battles,
and hundreds of champions
to collect and customize.
And to top it off, it is an
incredibly gorgeous mobile game.
Just look at the awesome
detail on these champions.
RAID's special launch tournament
is happening right now
and it is growing super fast,
so check out the link in my description.
Download RAID only through my link
to get 50,000 silver immediately.
You'll get automatically entered
into their special launch tournament
where you'll be competing against me
and other players for
crazy in game prizes,
and physical prize packs.
Good luck and I'll see you there.
Now when you're talking about
having incremental upgrades
to a system generation,
a lot of times lately
people will think in terms
of the point five systems
that we've had recently,
like the PS4 Pro, or the Xbox OneX.
Or even with Nintendo and the new 3DS.
Now what's interesting
about these examples
is that they act as brand new models
that act as just kind of upgrades
to what we already have working.
In the PS4 Pro and Xbox OneX's case,
there's not any kind of unique games
or anything that's
blocked off just for them.
It's just that, oh, if
you want 4K support,
or just having a better
frame rate or visual effects
in some select games,
that's what it's gonna offer you.
The new 3DS is an interesting
counterpoint to that though
where that's a system that was a new model
that has specific games
that won't only work on it,
and even some games that
while not advertised to
be unique to the new 3DS,
run so terribly on the original one
that you just shouldn't even bother.
So this is the concept
that people have in mind
when they talk about having upgrades
to modern generations before going on
to a whole new cycle of systems.
But if you go further
back in gaming history,
there actually are examples of consoles
that had incremental upgrades
in the form of add-ons.
Where instead of having
to buy a whole new model,
you just bought something that
upgraded your current system.
At least in some very specific way.
Specifically for Nintendo,
a key example would be
the N64 Expansion Pak.
So there was a pack you could
buy separately for your N64
that came bundled with some games
that went in this slot right here,
that effectively doubled
the RAM of the system;
going from four megabytes to eight.
And this was necessary to
play a handful of games,
kind of like with the new 3DS.
But also offered a number of upgrades
for pre-existing games.
Similar to the PS4 Pro and the Xbox OneX,
this is things like improving
the resolution of some games,
offering improved textures that
you wouldn't have otherwise.
Or even doubling the frame rate
in a couple specific cases.
And again, there were some games
that just outright required
it to work in the first place.
Specifically, Donkey Kong 64,
Legends of Zelda: Majora's Mask,
and Perfect Dark.
Though Perfect Dark did offer
a side mode you could play
if you didn't have the expansion pack.
Of course there are also examples
to look back on that didn't end very well.
And one very good example of this
is Nintendo's key
competitor back in the day,
Sega, with the 32X.
♪ All right ♪
♪ Baby ♪
- This was an attachment that went
onto the top of the Sega Gen System
and offered a more powerful solution,
making it a 32 bit system.
And could play very specific games
that were designed for it.
It just didn't go very well.
Now part of this has to do
with marketing and timing.
The entire idea behind the 32X was,
hey, if you can't afford to
buy a brand new Sega Saturn
which is coming out really soon,
well we have a cool midpoint
where if you a Genesis--
♪ Sega Mega Drive ♪
♪ (Japanese) ♪
♪ (Japanese) CPU ♪
♪ (Japanese) ♪
- You can buy this to do
this kind of mid-step.
And people didn't really
react well to that.
While it was cheaper than
buying a whole new system,
the amount of money you're
paying to close the gap
was still quite a bit
and none of the games that
were released alongside it
were very strong arguments
for why you needed to buy the upgrade.
Causing 32X to go the same way
as it's other attempted
attachment, the Sega CD.
Where again, cool idea,
it just didn't work out.
So what does this have
to do with the Switch
and having a Boost Mode?
Well, the reason I bring it up
is because I think it
gives a good past example
of how systems can approach
a more modular version
of approving their performance.
And when it comes to the Switch,
well there's something we haven't
really talked about a lot.
And that's the idea of a pro dock.
See, a lot of people have
talked about a Switch Pro,
where we're gonna get a
new system down the line
that has a bigger screen
or better resolution.
More power, whatever.
And that is a distinct possibility still.
But something that came
up before we even knew
when the Switch was called, the Switch,
was the idea of it hooking
up to an external GPU.
Way back when the Switch
wasn't officially unveiled yet
and we still knew it just
as simply, Project NX,
there were a lot of wild
theories and speculations
about what exactly that
system was going to be.
And a lot of those theories
were based on patents that Nintendo
had filed shortly before
it's official reveal.
Looking back on those patents,
there are a lot of them
that you can see clearly played a role
in what the Switch is,
and there were others that
ended up not happening.
And among the ones that
didn't really play a role
that's really interesting and plays into
what we're talking about right now,
is the idea of the Switch having
a secondary computational device.
Now a lot of these early patents,
the picture was, hey, we
have a mean game console,
there's a secondary device it plugs into,
and that plugs into your
TV to create a thing.
So that kind of creates the basis
of what we thought the dock was gonna be.
So much so, that when the
Switch actually came out
we were surprised to find that the dock
basically doesn't do anything.
So this brings up back to the idea of,
well what if that's what
the new Switch product is?
What if we're not getting
a brand new Switch model
that adds power to the main system itself,
but instead we get a new dock
that actually acts as an
external GPU for the system?
Now with this idea in mind,
there are certainly some limiting factors
to what it could and could not do.
Because while it is possible
they're making a system that
adds more power to the Switch,
it would likely be more
something along the lines
of a PS4 Pro or an Xbox OneX situation,
where it's not opening a
whole new array of games.
It's not a new generation.
It's merely a bump up
in power for the system
to be able to achieve graphical intensity
that it previously couldn't have.
Adding things like 4K gameplay
and maybe even stabilizing
or adding a little more
frame rate to select games.
So pushing that idea of it being
a full generational gap aside,
the idea of a dock acting
as a point five system
instead of being a whole
new model of Switch,
actually makes a lot of sense.
Because it's making it a way
so that people who currently own a Switch
can buy this upgrade
that's gonna give them
that better TV situation.
Where you're gonna get the 4K resolution,
or whatever kind of performance
increase it's going to add,
while maintaining the same handheld mode
allowing you to have the same games across
the regular Switch library.
Or, for people who own a Switch
and this new Switch Pro dock.
Again, this is all very theoretical
and based on patents that Nintendo
has yet to make use of.
But going with the narrative
of what we're seeing
right now with Nintendo
it actually kind of makes a lot of sense.
There's been a ton of
rumors about them working
on something new.
Something that's Switch
related and more powerful.
And while we do seem to have some degree
of confirmation that there
might be a Switch mini
on the way,
Nintendo has been very
adamant about the idea of,
we're not releasing a Switch 2.0,
we're not working on a
new Switch right now.
We're just focusing on what we have.
And that's basically true
if what they're working
on instead is a dock.
'Cause they're not releasing a new Switch,
they're releasing a way
to make your current Switch even better.
Is this for sure what I
think they're going to do?
No. I think this is a really neat idea
and something that I've
honestly been theorizing
ever since the Switch first came out.
I always thought the idea of having a dock
that actually supplies external power
would be really cool and
a great way to leverage
the balance between
having a handheld system
and one that you can use on a TV.
But again, it's just theories.
There's a whole lot Nintendo
could be working on.
They've been keeping everything
very close to the chest
and so we're just gonna have
to wait and see right now.
We've got E3 coming up
and it sounds like they probably
won't actually announce anything.
But they could always surprise us.
Only time will tell.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
