And, as it always goes this time of year,
some games are getting leaked.
And the big one right now is
Ubisoft's next Assassin's Creed.
Supposedly titled
Assassin's Creed: Origins.
Now, a couple weeks ago,
we did see a screenshot
supposedly for this game
that made it look like it would
take place in Ancient Egypt.
Well, now, we have a very
short, very poorly recorded
trailer for the game
that does specify that
it takes place in Thebes in 1354 BC.
Now, this particular time and
place makes a lot of sense
for an Assassin's Creed game
for a few different reasons.
It's near the end of one of
the more prosperous times
for Thebes under the
rulership of Amenhotep III.
There was a lot of
construction and expansion
going on right now.
And a lot of major monuments
and landmarks are built,
such as the Luxor Pyramid.
So, it perfectly fits
the Assassin's Creed love
of taking place in very large cities
with lots of stuff to climb.
Another reason this is a really good fit
is that the Assassin's Creed franchise
loves to focus on times in history
when there's a lot of turmoil.
Whether there's a war going on,
some kind of political infighting,
or a change in power structures.
Now, like I said earlier,
this is near the end of
Amenhotep III's reign.
Four years after the time
posted in the trailer
is when his son, Akhenaten, takes over
and stuff gets a lot darker for Thebes.
He outlaws worshiping any of
the traditional Egyptian gods
in favor of monotheism.
And much of the expansion and building
that was happening under
Amenhotep III has stopped.
So, how does this fit into the rest
of the Assassin's Creed franchise?
Well, to begin with it's very, very true
to the name Origins, if
that's actually the title,
because, currently, the
oldest Assassin's Creed game
on the timeline is the first one,
which is in the 12th century
during the Third Crusade.
This is over 2,000 years before that.
Which is really interesting, too,
because the original game kind of set up
an origin story for Assassins.
But this would then set up an
entirely different reasoning
that might be very closely
tied into the gods of the time.
One of the really kind of
big weird overarching themes
of the Assassin's Creed storyline
is that there's this sort
of precursor ancient race
that a lot of popular
mythological gods are named after.
So far, it's mainly been Roman-based ones,
like Jupiter, Juno, Minerva.
But, during this time that's actually when
many of these mythological
deities are being worshiped,
it could be possible
that we're throwing some
Egyptian gods into the mix
as part of how the
Assassin's Order was founded.
Aside from specifying the time
and place for the setting,
the trailer did have a little bit of
opening dialogue, as well,
that was very, very vague.
It references Abstergo, which
is the modern day Templars.
Basically, the main recurring
bad guys in the franchise.
But it also alludes to
there being something
bigger and badder than them,
which is probably Juno.
One of those demigods I mentioned earlier
that's been causing problems for everyone
since Assassin's Creed III.
Now, this trailer is not the only thing
that's been leaking a little bit of info.
There is also a t-shirt recently
that looks like it's showing off
the main character of the game.
He's wearing the traditional
Assassin's Creed-style robes
that are all white with the hood.
It has the Assassin's
Creed symbol in the corner
that's mixed with that
and the symbol for Horus.
And it shows off the
name of the character,
which appears to be,
and I think I'm pronouncing
this right, Bayek.
Now, aside from these two little leaks,
there have been a couple other rumors
circulating about the game that
actually make me a little hopeful for it.
I kind of have a bit of
a like-hate relationship
with the Assassin's Creed franchise.
The first one was okay.
It was very bare bones,
but had a cool concept.
Two was really good.
But then I played it two more times
with pseudo-sequels that got annoying.
Three was an actual dumpster fire.
Four was really good but was more about
pirates than Assassins.
Five was Dumpster Fire Part
Two: Electric Boogaloo.
And six is probably the best one
that's actually about
Assassins and not pirates.
Now, if you're a superstitious person,
this would make you think that
we're probably screwed on this one,
because it's an odd numbered entry.
But there's two reasons why I'm actually
kind of hopeful that's not the case.
First off, I really like the fact that
they're moving to a more
ancient civilization.
One of the things that's
really bothered me
about later Assassin's Creed games
is it just doesn't make sense
in the context of guns existing.
You can take several bullets before dying.
Aiming them is always annoying.
So, moving to something
that's actually using
simpler, more primitive options,
or even just a bow and arrow,
just seems to make a lot more sense.
The other reason is, supposedly,
the lead dev for this game
is going to be the same one
that worked on Black Flag,
which was the fourth game.
As I mentioned earlier,
best one in the franchise.
So, this one might actually not suck.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
