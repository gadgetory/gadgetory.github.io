Witcher 3 has been out for a few weeks
now and I did already do a sort of
little mini review called a week with
The Witcher but there's so much this
game has to offer either I just had to
spend some more time on it before I
brought you guys my final thoughts
because there's things I just didn't
know about yet so there's gonna be just
a little sort of addendum to that video
reiterating what my main points were for
things that I liked but I didn't like
and covering stuff I just didn't know
about yet mostly concerning the game's
late game story so back when I did the
week with Witcher 3 video I said that I
thought I was about two-thirds ROI for
the plot which nope I was really only
about halfway through and even a little
less than that which is absolutely
fantastic because it's just even larger
than I originally thought
and the CD Projekt RED put this game at
being as long as possibly 200 hours
which is totally possible if you're a
hardcore completionist the main story
can be tackled alone with just a few
major side quests totaling only about 50
hours but there's so much more to do
that if you prefer taking your time
there are tons of options like doing
which are contracts to kill monsters or
crater hunts for better gear the game
pieces the main story with an F XP that
if you just want to blitz that alone you
can but a higher difficulties taking
your time with side quests is definitely
handy so you can amass a little more
wealth and supplies as well as over
level yourself a little bit during the
game's first half it maintains an
excellent sense of pacing as you can
take your time simply searching and
doing as many side quests as you want
while the second half of the game picks
up the pace and urgency a lot more the
whole plot is super well done with a
fantastic cast of new and returning
characters though there are a few
missing phases that I really hope to see
show up in the game's expansions
Nataly though the game's plot does have
one major weakness which is the ending
which just left me feeling a bit
disappointed there are three different
ones in the wall the one I got wasn't
bad it was very brief and quiet
considering all the build up the rest of
the game created for it it wasn't a
particularly bad ending just wasn't as
good as I was hoping for the postgame
clayey flog scenes do help to give it a
bit more satisfying finish but the game
just feels like it's missing a major
climactic moment near the end so this is
basically one more weakness add-on to
the very small pile that I mentioned
back in the week with The Witcher video
and honestly all of them together still
do very little to detract from all the
things this game does right like I said
before sometimes wrote responds and
really dumb places sometimes which makes
it really annoying to get to your horse
I wish the game gave you a little more
freedom with what you could
put into your quick item slots because
you're limited to only using bombs or
pocket items which to me would make a
lot more sense if you do things like say
put additional potions or three bumps
you out of multiple ones or no bombs if
you want make room for other items it
just seems silly to give you the
restrictions the game currently has
speaking of which by far the game's
silliest downside is the falling damage
which is absolutely ridiculous you can
fall off of something that's maybe ten
feet high and take a little damage but
if you follow something that's about 15
feet high you'll instantly die which can
just get really annoying it's almost as
if Gerald's legs are made out of really
thin glass or something last up my only
other small complaint is the fact that I
wish the games main card a minigame
Gwent was just a bit better because they
put a lot of effort into integrating it
into the rest of the game I mean there's
whole side quests are wrapped around
either challenging major players two
games of Gwent collecting rare cards and
there's even parts in the main plot
where while you're waiting for something
like an ambush you can play Gwent with
other characters to pass the time it's
such a central part of the game but to
me it's just not very interesting and I
ended up skipping it more often than
actually playing those things aside to
though pretty much everything else in
this game is amazing combat is smooth
and fast-paced I highly recommend
playing the game on it's higher
difficulties as this is one of those
titles where the feeling of victory over
a boss thanks to proper preparation and
tactics is absolutely phenomenal the
crafting system has been simplified a
bit from past games and that you don't
have to recraft every potion you
discover and I think it makes a perfect
compromise between complexity and user
friendliness and while it's not truly a
completely open world in the traditional
sense when compared to games like Elder
Scrolls or later Fallout games it's
close enough and covers what matters
giving players to huge areas to explore
along with a view smaller ones as well
even better these areas feel alive and
like actual real world environments and
they're dense enough with interesting
side content like finding bandit camps
hidden treasures and monster dens to
clear out so it's never just one big
open area that you spend tons of
mindless time running through like I
said before while the ending does fall a
bit flat it's not bad and every other
piece of the story is handled really
well the choices in the game vary
between morally difficult or fairly
clean cut with a mix of some rewarding
you just as you might think and others
coming to bite you in the ass later
which is perfect for those you
interested in doing multiple
playthroughs to be perfectly honest this
is my favorite new game I've played so
far in 2015 with just a couple others
coming close
I can't possibly recommend this game
enough especially when you consider that
for 60 bucks right now you can easily
get well over a hundred hours of
gameplay without any paid for content
which just puts a lot of other current
games to shame as always if you guys
enjoyed the video hit that thumbs up
button let me know subscribe if you
haven't yet and follow me on Twitter
I've got more content planned and on the
way we've that III and just another week
so there's gonna be a lot of news coming
out of there you're not gonna want to
miss but until then I'm Kevin Henson and
I'll see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
