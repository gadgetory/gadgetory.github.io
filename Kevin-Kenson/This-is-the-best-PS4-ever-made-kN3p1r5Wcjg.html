always try to do a tradition of
excellence with exacting values and
design and engineering
sony has sold over 500 million
PlayStation systems in their entire
history and to celebrate that they've
released this super limited super
beautiful ps4 Pro I actually want to
talk about the packaging with it because
that's something that I think really
shows how much care Sony put into this
design and that a lot of the limited
edition ps4 s they've made they all use
the same kind of stock packaging not
this time now once this box is opened
its divided pretty cleanly into
different components you can see the
system right away wrapped up and rice
little cloth wrapping and next to that
is where we have the DualShock 4
controller the PlayStation Eye camera
and various boxes that hold all the
little extra bits like cable in
construction mode some very beneath all
of that is the stand for the ps3
well that's special and different about
this bundle aside from just the fact
that it has different packaging first
off this is one of the few
limited-edition bundles that actually
includes a PlayStation Eye camera
normally don't get one of those the main
reason I think is because since this is
such a special super limited kind of
thing they wanted to make sure that
people would have a full set up in
matching colors and so well a lot a lot
of games still use the PlayStation Eye
camera specifically it is a required
component of psvr which Sony is still
pushing so if you're using that system
you need the camera to go along with it
this is also currently the only
PlayStation out right now with a 2
terabyte hard drive sony no baloney so
far all PlayStation 4s have been either
one terabyte or the older ones you get
500 gigabytes they have not really
experimented with anything larger this
is the only model right now that at
least stock comes with 2 terabytes now
all that stuff is fine and cool but
obviously the really big selling point
here is the design the color just the
unique look of this system this is
currently the only transparent design
ps4 and more importantly it's just a
really interesting use of it because
it's not like a regular clear shell
you've seen some of designs like that
they've done with controllers like the
crystal series but those are all usually
brighter colors this is a very deep dark
blue that almost has a solid appearance
when you're looking at it from far away
but once you have the right light on it
or you get closer you can start to see
all the little mechanical bits inside of
the system which is a really cool detail
this also extends to the controller that
comes with it which like I said before
there are the crystal series Dual Shock
Force which this is very similar to at
first glance but once again it is a much
darker slightly less transparent blue
than the other crystal blue that exists
and more importantly all the trimmings
different - like for instance the
buttons don't use the traditional
PlayStation symbol button colors instead
it just uses an off blue that kind of
matches with everything and then on both
the system and the controller itself we
have that beautiful copper trim place is
just for all the lettering and stuff
which goes really well with the blue
color now of course the other thing
about the system is like I said it is
very limited and one of the ways they
show that is that there's actually a bar
right here on the bottom of the front of
the system which shows which specific
unit production number this is out of
50000
fifty-thousand might to some of you not
sound like actually that limited but
when you consider worldwide and how many
systems there are that is a very very
small number there have been systems
that are more rare than that but it's
usually because they're weird one-off
situations like a giveaway a tie-in with
some game or only tenor made it's a
contest for something that actually went
to retail and for a store 50,000 is a
very small number
now while the system itself is super
limited they have made some accessories
in the style still available with
separately sold products that are a
little easier to get you can get the
DualShock by itself as well and they've
also made a separate gold headset that
doesn't come with this at all normally
that is in the same style so it has that
same dark blue and all the leather kind
of cloth bits but it also has that
transparent blue on the ear cups
themselves something that's really
interesting too about this bundle that I
didn't know until I knew we got one I
started researching stuff to talk about
when we opened it up and this isn't
actually the first time Sony has done a
bundle like this it is the first time
it's come to the US but before with the
ps2 they actually did another limited
run only in Japan of what they called
the 50 million ps2 s and that was to
celebrate the ps2 specifically selling
50 million units worldwide and unlike
this one which is the single really hard
to get one they actually had three
different colors made available which
were a metallic silver Sakura pink and
aqua blue and I'm not actually sure how
limited those editions were outside of
being only in Japan the only data I can
find is that well they exist and are
pretty tough to track down these days
and you know seeing the system in the
translucent color just how good it looks
it really makes me wonder why gaming
companies have really experimented with
this design as much lately at least four
systems we've seen them in controllers
and stuff but this is something that's
been experimented a lot with different
systems in the past but it hasn't been
used lately at all I mean Microsoft did
it with the original X boxes you can get
those in a transparent green I think
they also did a clear one Nintendo of
course famously had all the different
handhelds as well as the n64 s and The
Fantasticks they're fun testing
check out the eruption of Cutler with
the new and 64 fantastic series of
consoles and Sony's even messed with it
a little bit with the ps2 they had a
clear blue one but it's not something
we've seen in any of the recent
generations and that's really shocking
to me because I feel like now is the
best time to do designs like that
because there are so many more intricate
interesting things going on the inside
they can kind of just get a little
glance at now another thing with this
system being transparent that I'm really
curious about is how much the power
lights on the system are going to affect
how it looks so let's go ahead and start
it up and see what happens
oh that's actually really cool
honestly this all just comes together
really beautifully and I know I've been
a little harsh in the past about a lot
of ps4 special editions not that I
haven't liked any of them I just think
they're usually good but could be better
this is the best one
like just without a doubt in my mind as
far as special edition ps4 is go right
now and I don't want to just be like oh
it's so limited it must be great no like
this actually is a really beautiful
system and it really makes me wish that
Sony experimented a little bit more with
this kind of color scheme you know I
really did the transparent look and I
hope it's something that doesn't stay
unique to this bundle</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
