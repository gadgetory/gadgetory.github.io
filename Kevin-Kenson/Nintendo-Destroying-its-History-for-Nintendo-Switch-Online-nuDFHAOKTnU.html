the gaming world that's kind of a big
deal is Nintendo is suing a pair of ROM
websites love retro and love roms for
posting a lot of their games something's
been going on for well quite some time
but they are asking for a lot of money
specifically they want two million
dollars for legal use of their trademark
and an additional hundred and fifty
thousand dollars for every single game
which adds up to an insane amount of
money so much that there's not really
any way these websites can actually pay
that but it's accomplishing another goal
of instilling a lot of fear and other
websites in fact emu paradise another
very old rom website has decided to
close down in response to this because
they've decided it's just not worth the
risk anymore versus dealing with the
occasional cease and desist order now a
lot of people have been talking about
this for a lot of different reasons but
what I really want to focus on here is
the fact that well look in this
situation Nintendo is in the legal right
there's nothing great about this there's
been a lot of argues before that like Oh
emulation is kind of legal because of
these reasons shoplifting is a
victimless crime it's really not the
distribution of a large number of roms
like this is just straight-up illegal
and there is nothing wrong with a
Nintendo pursuing action against it but
at the same time while it might be
legally fine there's kind of a
questioning here of is it actually a
good thing to do
now look I'm personally not a huge
advocate of piracy or you know
downloading a lot of games I think that
if there is a convenient and legal way
to purchase an old-school retro game you
should take that course of action
instead of any kind of piracy but that's
not really the option for a lot of
titles that exist out there and it
brings up this big question of what's
gonna happen to a lot of these old
historically significant video games
that the major companies really are
putting any effort into preserving and
if they're not going to do it who is
sure there are certain games that are
pretty safely being be released often
like Super Mario Brothers legends oh the
link to the past numerous Mega Man games
these are games are gonna get released
again and again and again but the number
of games that are safe like that are
miniscule compared to the full library
of NES SNES and other system libraries
out there now you could argue that well
if the games not being released
digitally in any form you just have to
go ahead and hunt down
physical copies which yeah you can do
that but there's a few problems there
first off some games are just
exceedingly rare and hard to find at the
point where just playing a certain game
is gonna cost you over $100 because you
have to find one in the first place and
someone's willing to sell it the other
issue that comes up though is that
physical copies like that aren't
permanent in fact some of them are
already starting to die off and is just
going to get worse and worse as years go
by there are games that if there is no
digitally produced version of them they
are going to just straight-up disappear
copies are going to go bad batteries
will die things will get ruined and
destroyed until eventually there's no
trace of some of these classic titles
and this isn't just an issue of
preservation it's also accessibility
making sure that some of these games
that can become really rare and really
expensive but are at the same time
really really good are something that
people can still get the chance to
experience a good recent example this
would be something like earthbound for
the longest time
earthbound on SNES was worth a bunch of
money and was really hard to get a hold
of but now thanks to things like Virtual
Console in the 3ds or picking up an SNES
classic it's something people can play
more easily today and not all the games
get that opportunity and beyond that
there's also an argument for things that
roms can open up like translations there
are so many amazing games that are
released only in Japan that aren't
available in any other language and if
you want to experience those titles
there's not really another way to and
I'll admit that I am you only did a
bunch of games when I was younger and a
lot of the ones that I really fell in
love with were games that were never
made available in the US and I would
never bet any other way to experience
them by the way this isn't a problem
that's unique to Nintendo they just got
the limelight right now because of the
lawsuit and look at other companies like
Sony Sony was doing a pretty good job
for a while until the ps3 where they had
backwards compatibility but then kind of
dropped at mid-cycle and then with the
ps4 they just dropped it entirely and
they kind of brought it back with
PlayStation now where you get some ps3
games and a small handful of ps2
greatest hits but there's a lot of games
that are missing and some of those are
available on ps1 to the PS Vita but then
there's a rear generational gap and it's
just gotten really confusing and then
you've got Sega who don't have their own
console anymore but they've kinda had
some attempts with doing classic
collections and re releasing some
Genesis games on iPhones but once again
there's a whole lot of titles being left
out really the only company that seems
you
doing anything about preservation is
Xbox which to be fair they have the
youngest library but there's the heavy
push for the Xbox one to support 360
games original Xbox games where you can
use the disk but also download them and
the library is growing and being
optimized which is really cool and I
hope it's something they continue to do
with future systems and the thing that's
really cool about that too is that with
Xbox it's all in one platform as to
being kind of all over the place which
is going on right now with all the other
companies made with Nintendo there's the
Virtual Console which now isn't on the
switch there's classic conditions
there's re-releases of stuff it's just
all over the place instead of being one
convenient solution and here's the thing
the lawsuit taking that as web sites and
scaring others it's not like your arms
are going to permanently disappear
they're just gonna be a lot harder it
again and it raises the question of why
now is Nintendo doing this because roms
aren't exactly a brand new problem for
them and they've dealt with it for a
long time now they are working on a
system for the switch or they're gonna
have the online service and they've
talked a little bit about having retro
games on there but the full extent
hasn't been talked about and so there is
that optimist at me the hopeful part
that wishes that the reason they're
doing this is because they're getting
rid of competition and they are actually
going to start doing something where we
have full libraries is that what's
happening probably not but I could hope</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
