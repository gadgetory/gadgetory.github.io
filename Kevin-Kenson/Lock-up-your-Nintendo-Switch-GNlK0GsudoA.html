switch accessories in the past and one
place that we've gone for maybe some of
the weirder options is ed seen over the
years we have amassed quite a few so we
want to go over some of the most
interesting ones we've picked up some
we've talked about before in some we
have and for instance the doc lock are
you tired of people stealing your switch
right out of the doc or do you have kids
and you just want to be able to tell
them when not to play and they can't
just grab it and hide it away somewhere
well this is the solution for that this
is a little slot that you can put the
dock inside of and has this cover flap
that has a couple of different areas it
can do attach to in one set up like the
one we have right now it just locks the
dock in place while still letting it
vent properly and you can't remove the
switch from it however if you also touch
to this one and cover this side it also
blocks the game card slots you cannot
add or remove games to it it also has an
additional back security loop back here
and there's even just holes in the
bottom of it you can drill it down to
the surface if you want to make sure
that this whole thing is just not going
anywhere now obviously just the setup
itself alone wouldn't actually wok
anything so you've got a little key lock
right here as well you could change it
out for you know some kind of number
lock if you want but this is a pretty
sure fire way to make sure no one's
getting in other than you so we've
talked about the dock lock but we also
have the dock sock get it anyway so this
is actually one of the few items on this
list that is not 3d printed is instead
sewn and it actually is really useful
because an issue that some people have
with the switch is that if you're
constantly putting it in the dock and
taking and outputting and taking out you
run the risk of accidentally scratching
the screen which is not good so this is
a little handy way to protect your
switch but just placing it over the all
right a key
and boom it gives a little customization
to your dog so it's not just the plain
black logo it honestly is pretty boring
and it has a nice little padded surface
to make sure that your switch is nice
and safe every time you put it in and
this is just one example that we have
found there's actually a lot of these on
Etsy so if you want something instead of
Mario or just a different Mario design
there are so many different ones to
choose from for the pokemon fan one of
my absolute favorite pickups we've
gotten is actually this little Pokemon
game case it's one of the best-built
things you've gotten even those three
you printed the whole things assembled
together really nicely and just open
this little flap right here which does
have little magnets to make sure it
stays nice and serial closed and it'll
perfectly hold for little game cards now
yes there are official game card
carriers out there that hold way more
than four games but I mean just look at
the style of this thing it's just a nice
little piece all together that if you
love Pokemon and want something that you
can actually justify to carry around
that actually has a purpose as well this
is awesome it also has little rails on
the side so you can touch joy kant's and
treat it like a controller grip and I
got to say I just love the fact that
this is based on the original pokedex
design as someone who grew up loving
Pokemon just always watching the show as
a little kid you know there's been a
couple different designs for the Pokedex
electronic pokedex for master trainers
but this this is the original in fact I
even remember as a kid I owned I think
was a calculator or something that was
designed to look just like this so it's
tag rate blast from the past one of the
things I love about the tour cons is how
you can slot them into different things
to make different kind of controllers
and probably one of the most infamous
examples in well very recent switch
history that we had to pick up once it
started making rounds a joy con knife a
switchblade if you will what purpose
this serves not really any but just the
image of slotting your joy Kahn's in
life and you know if you want to play
Mario Tennis in an extremely dangerous
way but don't but
this next item is something that we
actually bought a long time ago it was
something I was so excited to find on
Etsy and we actually never found a
justified reason to put it in the video
and this might now be a video that still
exists so we could finally talk about
this but a way to hold your drink while
you're playing your switch so you could
just be mid game and as soon as you have
that little you know little need to you
know well thirst just in all seriousness
what I really love about this product
idea is just that the joy cons are such
an adaptable concept I think Nintendo
doesn't fully realize they've talked
about I mean we've shown examples of
this before and I've talked about other
accessories that third-party companies
have made but there is so many more cool
ideas that you can find on Etsy like
this sure it's not necessarily like the
simplest most safe idea Nintendo could
do but I'd buy an official version of
something like this if it actually you
know was really nicely put together
there's so many cool ideas there that
Nintendo is just leaving money on the
table</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
