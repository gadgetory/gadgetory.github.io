gaming setup the goal here was simple a
functional but good-looking setup filled
with everything you need for gaming on
this dynasty of systems whether you
wanted to go back and play an old
favorite on the ps2 or enjoy the latest
releases on ps4 in 4k and the place to
start is the right piece of furniture to
date there's four major iterations the
PlayStation along with the portable
console spin-off PlayStation TV so this
entertainment console is perfect or
fitting all five and showcasing them
with this you'll be able to play just
about any game ever released on a Sony
system with a ps1 ps2 ps3 the brand new
ps4 Pro and the PlayStation TV for
playing any PS Vita games or any PSP
games that are available digitally now
simply setting up the systems in each
little nug is pretty easy but doesn't
quite do them justice especially at
night time you got to do something to
really make them pop out that's why we
rigged up some hue strips to give a nice
dispersed glow of light on each system
this did take a bit of troubleshooting
and if you want to do something like
this choose your light source carefully
the wrong kind can create a spotlight
effect on your system which doesn't
light up the whole thing very well and
can get pretty distracting gaming
systems aren't enough to complete this
setup though there are some accessories
we're going to need as well first of
course is the number-one necessity for
playing games online with friends or
just for playing late into the night
without making a ton of noise a headset
so we've grabbed the PlayStation Gold
wireless headset and set it up on a
little headphone hook right next to the
TV meanwhile on the other side of our TV
is a very different kind of headset the
PSV are sadly VR isn't exactly a clean
Wire free tech yet so instead of having
a mess of cables always plugged in we've
opted to get a stand specifically for
showcasing and holding the headset when
it's not in use along with giving us a
nice place to store our pair of move
controllers and a single duel
for now everything here has been a
little too functional and tech-heavy we
got accent with something that's got a
bit more life to it and that's where
Tiny Nathan Drake comes in now of course
none of this works without the very
important centerpiece to the whole set
up the TV and to take full advantage of
the ps4 Pro we've gone with this Sony 43
inch 4k HDR TV it's the perfect size for
this setup big enough to give you a
clear and large image for gaming but a
small enough size with a minimal frame
to fit perfectly without crowding things
up we've also added a sound bar to the
front
this particular one fits our needs
perfectly as it projects sound forward
while lying completely flat in front of
the TV and helps to hide a lot of
cabling going on in the back I will say
setting up a ps4 pro with an HDR TV is
not quite as simple as I'd hope though
this problem is more rooted in the TV
than the system different companies have
different names for HDR and chances are
if your TV has an HDR mode it is not
enabled by default so you're going to
need to do some menu surfing to find it
don't let your ps4 scare you with output
info like your TV does not support HDR
if you know you have an HDR TV then
chances are you just haven't found the
right option yet and you know it's one
thing to hear on paper all the terms
that have quickly become buzz speak in
gaming the past few years 4k this HDR
that but to actually sit down and enjoy
a game with the right TV and set up I
gotta say it does make a big difference
it varies by game but the crispness of
4k or at least near 4k resolution with
the color depth offered by HDR mix for
living-room gaming experience that is
quite simply amazing especially in games
with a focus on color and aesthetics
like the witness which is gorgeous on an
HDR enabled TV making the world even
more surreal a good night of gaming
deserves an awesome set up to play on
and it's important to balance out
function with great looking design to
keep things looking clean so you can
just kick back and play in perfect
relaxed</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
