consoles a lot but based on price point
and current evolution of gaming hardware
is it really advisable to get the Xbox
one S or the original ps4 ps4 slim in
2018 so there's a lot of variables that
affect whether or not you should get a
system right now and it's kind of a
weird tipping point because we have
these newer sort of mid generation
consoles with the ps4 Pro and Xbox 1x
which are more powerful and you know get
more out of having a 4k TV but not
everyone needs that but at the same time
we're also getting to this point where
we might be seeing new consoles another
year year and a half and that brings up
the question is if there are new systems
are they gonna be backwards compatible
if they come out and they're not
backwards compatible are the current
systems gonna have a price drop there's
a lot of stuff that can affect whether
out you wanna buy one my advice right
now and this honestly comes from a part
of me that just is all for having fun is
if you want to get a system right now
still go for the 1s and the ps4 slim are
still great systems if you're able to
afford and bump up to one of the pro
level systems and you have the TV to
make use of it great but at the end of
the day the main reason to grab one of
these systems is to play great games
that are sometimes exclusive to one of
them like if you want to play God of War
right now I don't think you should wait
a year and a half just because you think
maybe a price drop will happen down the
line or maybe a new system will be
backwards compatible I'm all for just
grabbing it and having fun right now so
you don't miss out who's better at
collector's editions Xbox or Playstation
well first off we have to talk about
what we mean by collector's editions
because if we're just talking about
games it's a little one-sided at the
moment because there's just a lot more
exclusives on Sony's side and even when
Xbox does have exclusive games like Co
thieves they didn't even do a
collector's edition for that but if
we're talking about systems Xbox
hands-down just whatever it comes to
aesthetics in general I think that's
something that Microsoft has really
nailed down that Sony hasn't fully
gotten yet you know I think that there
are some good-looking Sony special
editions I like the monster hunter one
the God of War one really grew on me but
you compare that to what Xbox has done
with say the Minecraft design one or
even just the different colors and even
just the design of the system and
general just micro hop is so much better
when it comes to aesthetics so
collectors decisions on games
PlayStation collector's edition systems
Microsoft no question I'm undecided so I
ask do you prefer getting the game's
digital or physical okay
so here's the thing hard logic I already
get looks I'm already getting looks no
but wait for me the answer wait for me
is there okay so cold hard logic just go
digital you can get the game right away
as soon as it launches you'll have to go
to a store you don't the wait for
something your ship you're able to play
it right away and if you want to switch
between multiple systems as long as the
games installed everywhere your save
data is gonna be able to move with you
really easily but on the other hand I'm
a dinosaur there's a dinosaur and I
probably have a bad habit of collecting
things so personally I do still buy
pretty much all my games physically I've
given in a bit on the Xbox one if I'm
getting like a big triple a game but
anything on ps4 where it's like a series
that I love and I've been you know
building up a collection of over time I
still buy physical which I admit it gets
a little annoying sometimes cuz I am
switching between systems often so I
have to carry discs back and forth back
and forth but I'm stubborn so I'm
sticking with it what is your favorite
Nintendo game ever on any Nintendo
console so I grew up on the Super
Nintendo
I have very vague memories of the NES
but that was more of something where
like it was in the house my brother
played it the Super Nintendo was the
system I really have really clear
memories of actually like first time
playing games firsthand and to this day
when I absolute favorite games from that
console is legends all the link to the
past it's still my favorite Zelda game
has ever made it's just this really good
balance of it had some aspects of the
original Zelda where it's kind of
open-ended it's a little nonlinear you
don't have to do things in the exact
order and kind of encourage to walk
around and explore and do stuff at your
own pace but at the same time it was
still a little more structured than the
original game and gave you at least a
few more hints and backstory and kind of
fleshed out the world a lot more I still
enjoyed the Zelda games they came after
I mean I loved breath the wild Locke Ram
time also great games but there's just
something magical about the right
perfect balance that link to the past
hit that I just
can't get over its to this day still my
favorite like first party Nintendo game
what is the best game of 2018 so far so
I haven't beaten this game yet cuz it
just came out on Friday and I've been
multitasking a lot but I put a lot of
time in a God of War and honestly I can
still confidently say that as long as
the ending isn't totally messed up it's
definitely best game of 2018 so far I
mean I hit the same kind of thoughts
about Far Cry 5 until the ending but
that was a mess I've at least heard that
god of war ends better so as long as it
maintains the same momentum I am loving
it the combat is fantastic I really love
the shift in plot and game style it's
just overall a huge improvement for the
franchise now as far as games I've
actually finished this year radiant
historia on the 3ds is really good it's
actually remake of a game that came out
back on the DS but is one of my absolute
favorite JRPGs if you're a fan of the
genre and you haven't played this game
yet check it out I love it
what is the thing you want the most from
e3 2018 Elder Scrolls 6 I have been a
huge fan of franchise ever since number
three more one which is basically one of
my still top favorite games ever and
while I didn't enjoy 4 and 5 quite as
much they're still really good they've
kind of deviated a little bit from what
I love about morrowind but they're still
awesome games I mean clearly Skyrim did
really really well and so we've been
waiting awhile for 6 to happen in some
form I mean we got an MMO we've gotten
Skyrim we released however many times
with new modes and VR and portable
whatever it's it's just it's time even
if it's not coming out till 2019 or 2020
I just want news info a snippet
something cuz I just I need that to
happen I need to be weird again and it's
the biggest problem I had with 4 &amp;amp; 5 as
they went to more traditional kind of
medieval stuff that we've seen in all
kinds of fantasy morrowind was weird and
there are other weird settings in the
ellow Scrolls universe so we need 6 we
need to be weird
I want that info now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
