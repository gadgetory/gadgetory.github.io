the signature defining feature of the
Nintendo switch is its ability to go
between being a portable handheld system
or an at-home big-screen TV gaming
console but this isn't the first time
Nintendo's actually messed with this
idea they had a similar concept way back
in the 90s which brought handheld gaming
to your TV with the super Gameboy
the super Gameboy was the first will
publicly at least made available way for
people to take handheld games from the
original Gameboy and put them on a Super
Nintendo system using this little cart
attachment right here now this looks
just like a regular Super Nintendo cart
but inside is actually a lot of the same
guts as a Game Boy which run the games
on the cart and put them on your TV
that's important oat that this only
plays the same games as the original
Gameboy meaning you can do regular Game
Boy games certain very specific Game Boy
Color games that could run on old
systems and surprisingly even the Game
Boy camera but anything beyond that
point that was Game Boy Color dedicated
will not run on this now well I've had
those limitations there's what's still
actually a little more powerful than a
traditional Game Boy and so it could
leverage that strength and a couple
different ways for you to the games
first off obviously the Game Boy style
screen is not their same dimensions as
what you have on a TV so it would add a
border line around it which for some
titles would just be a generic Gameboy
one but for a lot of more popular titles
like Pokemon you can get dedicated
unique borders going around it in other
cases there were some games that even
offered actual performance upgrades
although oftentimes something very
specific or minut for instance a few
different titles would have improved
audio files offering sound effects and
music quality that wouldn't normally be
possible with a traditional Gameboy it's
also interesting note that because this
was a little more powerful a lot of
games also ran ever so slightly faster
on the super Gameboy than they would on
a normal one you wouldn't be able to
notice it normally but side by side
there is just that slight increase in
speed now this one we have here is the
original super Gameboy and it's the only
one that made its way to the US there is
however a super Gameboy 2 that was
released only in Japan that featured a
much fancier looking clear kart it
offered a couple of different changes
one of which was that did run games at
the exact same speed as a Game Boy
instead of the slightly increased like
this one but by far the most interesting
feature of that one is it allows you to
connect a game link cable so you could
do multiplayer game boy stuff which you
cannot do with this one before moving on
I want to take a second to think today's

and give audible a try by visiting
audible.com slash Kevin Kenton or
texting Kevin Kenton to 500 500 now the
Superboy is not the only system from
this time that messed with the concept
of bridging the gap between portable and
TV games for instance something we've
talked about before is the Sega Nomad a
sega system that instead of bringing
portable games to tv's brought TV games
to handhelds allowing you to play sega
genesis games on the go and even
supported an AV out so you could still
play on TV which is really close to the
concept of a switch when it comes to
nintendo the super Gameboy isn't the
only example of this either by the way
was the first one made publicly be able
to be a retail but before that they
actually had another peripheral called
the wide boy made for the Famicom in
Japan that allowed people to use the
gameboy games on the Famicom the whole
goal of this was that so developers had
a way to test and mess with games and
see them on a large screen instead of
having to constantly strain their eyes
looking at a tiny gameboy screen all the
time after the super Gameboy there were
a couple of other peripherals that kind
of walked that line as well the n64 had
the wide boy 64 again something not made
publicly available but it was also used
by members of the media to give them a
way to capture footage or screenshots of
games and there was a very limited
option for n64 in the form of the
transfer pack something that was used
specifically from a Pokemon Stadium that
would allow players to also play
specific Pokemon games on their n64
now the last peripheral of this style
that Nintendo actually released was the
Gameboy player now this one was another
one for retail and it was designed for
the Gamecube plug the new Gameboy player
in your GameCube it was really
interesting because it actually had an
attachment that went on the bottom of
the system allowing you to plug in a
gameboy games including all the way up
to Game Boy Advance and then you had to
play an actual specific disc in the
Gamecube to make it work fun fact
because of this two-part system if you
look for these on eBay right now the
attachment alone is only
about 20 bucks but if you want the disk
it's actually a lot more because people
kept losing them or breaking them the
full combo can go easily over a hundred
bucks another fun fact about the super
Gameboy is that since it is basically
just a Super Nintendo card it'll work
with anything that runs Super Nintendo
games for instance if you want a really
ridiculous round by way of playing
gameboy games on a larger screen than a
regular Gameboy you can use it with a
super boy or you can use it with a super
analogue NT to play on a modern TV so to
demonstrate actually working we right
now have it booted up with pokemon red
and since that is one of those games
that was kind of the midpoint between
the original Gameboy and the Game Boy
Color you get some little additional
effects on the super Gameboy namely
there's actually some different color
options so we can even open up a
settings menu and in there we can do
things like change what colors we want
to get the game to be displayed in or we
can change the different border lines in
fact pokemon is one of the handful of
titles that actually has its own unique
border but if we wanted to we could
change it to one of the more traditional
ones like the Gameboy surrounding screen
or just a bunch of cats being lazy
so with this setup we are able to just
play old school original Game Boy games
featuring a little bit extra color in
this case and play it just like a home
console game on Super Nintendo and it
surprisingly looks really really good
and what's interesting about this too is
how for its time this gave you the
ability to switch between the two
methods however you like just like now
with the switch I mean the way the
switch does it is this one unit that you
know either connects to a TV or has it
on its own in other cases like with Sony
there's things where cloud saves you're
uploading downloading those in the case
of this everything is saved right on the
card itself so everything you do in
Pokemon here on the super Gameboy you
just put that same card in your Gameboy
and you're good to go and really when
you look at something like this you kind
of realized this might actually be the
starting point or even the inspiration
for Nintendo to explore the concept of
switching between two methods because
they've done it before it's just
nowadays you have the awesome idea of
bringing the console experience into a
convenient handheld as opposed to taking
little GBA graphics and putting them on
a big old TV</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
