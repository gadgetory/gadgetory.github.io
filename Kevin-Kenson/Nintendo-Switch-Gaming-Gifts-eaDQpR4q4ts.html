you know that means it's time for gift
guides and today we're gonna focus on
stuff that is Nintendo themed Nintendo
has had a huge year thanks to the switch
so let's check out the best stuff you
can grab for the Nintendo fan in your
family
kick things off around do something a
little different from the usual calm
products we feature you may have noticed
that the channels taken on a little bit
of an 80s vibe and something that I
think plays perfectly into that and
makes a great accompaniment to a lot of
setups is neon lights like that poke a
ball back there or this controller right
here now these are actually a line of
neon lights created by a company called
fan fit gaming they have a whole bunch
of different Nintendo themed ones like
these here also a Zelda Triforce a fire
flower from Mario and if you want more
options they also do a bunch of stuff
that's themed on overwatch or just
general pop culture stuff like Batman
lots of really cool designs that just
spice up a lot of different setups or
just a little addition to your room they
look awesome definitely worth checking
out next up is one of the news releases
from one of my favorite third-party
companies 8-bit dome they make all kinds
of cool accessories and different things
that are kind of retro themed inspired
but work with monetary systems and what
they just released are their pro SNES
style controllers now in the past they
have made SNES controllers like these
that are Bluetooth but they're like just
straight-up reproductions of the
original controller these are pro models
which feature additional buttons and
clearly analog sticks which yes destroy
a bit of the old-school shape but
actually makes them usable on a lot of
modern systems now they come in both a
Super Famicom and SNES color style you
can use these with PC tablet but one of
the coolest things is that they've
actually also patched these to where you
can use them with the switch so if
you're looking for an additional
wireless option to use with your switch
aside from the pro controllers that
Nintendo has these things make an
awesome alternate choice now speaking of
the switch there are a whole bunch of
amazing different accessories you can
gift people I've done a couple lists in
the past that I'll link to at the end of
this video but one thing that I haven't
talked about before that I want to
feature is this faux leather folio case
from powera this is designed to protect
the switches main body when you're using
it in portable mode it's also got a way
to cover the screen when you're not
actively playing and one of the best
things about it is it fixes one of the
switches biggest design flaws giving you
another way to use it in tabletop mode
instead of using that terrible built-in
kickstand that's just constantly
breaking constantly making the Stoics
fall over not worth using this is a huge
upgrade
to top that off it's still just small
enough so that the switch is gonna fit
any portable case no problem and it's
got this awesome killer's lttle design
which is makes it look even better next
up is something that I'm actually still
can't believe I'm really pitching right
now because I hate monopoly I think
monopoly is a game that just takes way
too long to play and all the paper money
to deal with is just so annoying but
monopoly gamer
is actually really really fun it
basically takes all the things that are
fat about monopoly and heavily
simplifies and changes it up to make it
a much faster paced game that actually
ends and you have a lot more fun playing
it during basically the main differences
of the fact that instead of all the
paper money you've got coins to work
with it actually incorporates some like
Mario Kart style stuff or you can hit
opponents of the shells causing them to
drop coins you can pick up later and the
main thing that keeps it nice and short
is every time someone lands or passes on
go you deal at a boss card you guys
fight the boss and once of the bosses
are gone the game is over and just kind
of points so in the end it only takes up
maybe thirty at most forty minutes to
play a game and the whole time it's
gonna be way way more fun than original
knobbly next up is honestly my favorite
item on this list and that's a Legend of
Zelda breath the wild Link Nendoroid
there's no doubt that legend Zelda is
one of the biggest hits this year and
there's no more awesome way to really
celebrate this game that I think than
this collectible right here I'm talking
about this company a couple of times in
the past they make a whole bunch of
different figures like this mostly anime
stuff but lately they've been getting
into a lot more video games and those
ones are way easier to get in the US for
the link one particularly like this
there's a regular one that's made
available but if you're willing to spend
a little more you can get a deluxe
version which comes with a lot more
little accessories to style them with
and even a little miniature horse and if
you're not into Zelda there's a whole
bunch of other ones they've made they're
doing a lot of overwatch ones lately in
the past they've done a Mario one that
even did an uncharted one for Nathan
Drake which honestly looks a little
weird to me but still they're all
awesome little collectables worth
checking out so there's all of our
Nintendo themed Gift Guide stuff links
for all the stuff is gonna be down below
if you want to check them out and I will
see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
