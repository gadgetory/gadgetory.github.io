socializing at the arcade only to be
replaced by nerds running to lock
themselves in doors to the warming glow
of their NES this is also the year that
some of today's biggest gaming companies
got their start like Bethesda and
Ubisoft and while we didn't get a ton of
NES games in America just yet some of
the biggest franchises to come out of
Japan saw their first entry this year so
here's the best games of 1986 first off
is the original Metroid on NES putting
players in control of the space bounty
hunter Samus Aran as you hunt down
dangerous aliens and a parasite known as
Metroid now this game was a big deal for
two different reasons first off this is
one of the first really big video games
to feature a female protagonist even
though it wasn't revealed until the very
end of the game and second it was one of
the first side-scrolling games to focus
on a nonlinear form of exploration in
fact it even forces you to do this at
the very start well wait what the hell
where am I supposed to go I can't get
under this holy I can go to the
left second up is Dragon Quest which was
known in the States at the time as
Dragon Warrior now this game gave
players a very familiar quest of having
to create their own self-titled hero
going on a journey to save a princess
from an evil dragon now admittedly this
game was a bit rough around the edges
for its time it definitely had some
problems that needed fixing but it laid
the groundwork for the entire Japanese
RPG genre introducing a lot of concepts
and ideas that either are loved now or
were things that we just hated until we
finally got rid of them such as grinding
non-stop enemies finally I killed 600
slimes actually have enough money to buy
a shield now next up is the only arcade
game on this year's list and that's
Bubble Bobble allowing up to two players
to control a pair of brothers whose
girlfriends were kidnapped by Baron von
baba and transformed into Bubble dragons
and then have to delve a hundred level
deep cave to rescue them now I made this
game cool is that it was one of those
titles that really tried to do some kind
of interesting new mechanic and it
actually worked involving a two-step
process in killing enemies capturing
them in a bubble and then popping it
afterwards which also made two-player a
lot more interesting because you could
assign each other roles now one of the
 downsides of this game is that
it actually punishes you for not playing
it in two-player by making you slave
through a hundred levels only to get a
straight-up bad
ending I did it I'd be a hundred level
but the number for getting back
on the NES train is the first
Castlevania in this game players control
Simon Belmont a vampire hunter on his
mission to kill the evil vampire Lord
Dracula now not only did this game kick
off the Castlevania franchise it was
also a great game for its time thanks to
an incredible soundtrack precise
controls and a much more adult darker
storyline compared to most games of its
time not to mention it also introduced
this asshole of a boss fight for the
rest of the series also giving you the
incredible revelation that the healing
items you desperately need are hidden
inside the game's walls wait this has
been hiding in the wall this whole time
this whole damn time I could've been
getting food from the walls and last but
not least we have to talk about one of
Nintendo's biggest franchises that got
its start this year The Legend of Zelda
taking on the role of the now very
iconic link players are tasked with the
goal of collecting these magical
triangles in order to rescue the
princess zelda this game took real-time
exploration to a whole new level giving
players the ability to take their time
tackling each of the game's dungeons and
exploring its overworld area including
things like finding hidden passages that
you could blow open with bombs to get
useful items or health upgrades it also
introduces the ability to have a special
range attack as long as you're at full
health only to take it away and piss you
off immensely the first time an enemy
hits you this game set the foundation
for a series that would later have some
of the biggest games of their time
including a Link to the Past on the SNES
and Ocarina of Time on the n64 so those
are my favorite games of 1986 if there's
one you guys loved that you didn't hear
mention make sure to let me know down in
