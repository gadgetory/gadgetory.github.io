there's one problem that it has that's
shared with all the line of new 3ds
systems and that's this little annoying
guy right here little guy
I wouldn't worry about that little guy
the right C stick which is barely even
that it's basically just a little
plastic nub that you apply some pressure
to and magically it counts it as
left-right up-down it's just it feels
very unnatural not comfortable at all to
use and thankfully there's actually a
way to pretty easily mod this to
something different if you don't mind
doing a little bit of damage now this is
not an idea I can take credit for this
was originally discovered I think on
reddit by user by the name of spent the
day on reddit and it was recently
brought to my attention by our good
friend Jimmy champagne yes that is
actually his real name yes that's his
legal name and on the form they show
that you could do this with the new 3ds
excels where you basically rip this nub
out and replace it with the slide pads
from the PSP now all those tests back
then were on the 3ds XL and I haven't
actually read up on whether or not it
works with the 2d s XL specifically I
don't see any reason why not but while
it might be an easy google search to
check I kind of want to take the risk
and see what happens now from what I can
tell this may be an irreversible process
because you basically rip out some stuff
that keeps that nub in place so that's
why I bought a brand new Pikachu to TS
excel we're gonna open up and rip apart
to do this change I'm just joking that'd
be a terrible idea
no we're gonna do it on the basic 2d s
Excel so let's see how this goes okay so
as I said the process is actually pretty
basic the first thing we need to do is
rip out this little nub and there's
nothing really sophisticated about it
you basically just pry it out and maybe
if you want to be a little more careful
you can cut some of the plastic and
strings that help keep it in place so
let's see how this goes
okay so this already went kind of a
little wrong I was able to get the nub
out but I actually left the plastic
constraints in there which I don't think
is gonna actually cause any problems for
the rest of the process it's just before
at least in the tutorials I've seen that
they're able to get the little loops out
but shouldn't be an issue and this is
actually the reason why this is kind of
irreversible because yes you could just
jam this thing back in and it'll
probably be okay but it's never gonna be
secured quite the way it was when you
bought it brand new so this process is
kinda reversible but there's definitely
some lasting damage you're kind of doing
to the system the next step which is
also once again really simple is to just
take a psp-1000 analog stick it has to
be a 1000 specifically they changed them
on to 2000s I don't know the specifics
as to why that messes up this mod but it
does matter for this so we've bought the
little black ones you can give them in
other colors and you're supposed to just
be able to kind of just shove it in
place and it should work yeah see
there's protecting the back this looks
kind of a diamond shape so we're gonna
kind of put it diagonally so yeah you're
not getting the same kind of feeling
that you would on a PSP or actually
slides around a little because this is
still based on just having that light
pressure but this definitely feels loads
better than that little plastic nub it's
almost like you're kind of just pressing
a little applying pressure to it now of
course just messing around on the menus
just lets us know that the stick is
registering up-down left-right but we
really want to test it how it works in a
game so I've booted up the opening part
of Monster Hunter stories there's gonna
look around a little bit to see how it
feels and it's actually really natural
like this actually feels like this is
how the system was meant to be I mean
it's a little getting used to because
I'm used to the PSP and I'm expecting
this thumb stick to actually slide
around but just like the nub you just
apply a little pressure but grab it a
rest your whole summonin and it just
feels way more comfortable nice and
responsive too yeah I mean just feels
natural
so yeah not a very hard mod to pull off
and I think it's really impressive to me
about it is the fact that for how basic
the technique is where we pretty much
just ripped out one part of the system
and shoved something else in its place
it looks like that PSP stick head
actually belongs here blends in really
nicely and in fact you can actually buy
these in a couple of different colors
such as white so if you own a different
color TDS excel like the white norwich
one you can grab one of those which is
gonna match a lot better and not only
does it fit in that way but it doesn't
interfere with any of the functionality
of the 2d s at all in fact it's just
enough to where you can still close the
system perfectly fine so yeah awesome
little thing you can do really you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
