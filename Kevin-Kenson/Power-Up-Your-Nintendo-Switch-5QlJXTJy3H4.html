the Nintendo switch is the ability to
use it in portable mode in fact Nintendo
has even published statistics before
talking about how half their user base
regularly uses it in portable more than
duct and I'm one of them I really like
using it as a handheld more than a home
system but whenever you're using a
portable system there's one big issue
you always run into and that's battery
life which with the switch can be a lot
more annoying and I think a lot of
people realize because sure you could
carry around the AC adapter and plug it
in any outlet you can find but that
isn't always an option and the switch
when it comes to charging is a little
more fickle than a lot of other
electronic devices and so while you can
use some third-party solutions and
battery banks it doesn't always charge
as quickly as it should
thankfully the accessory market for the
switch has been booming and along with
that we are now seeing officially
licensed and marketed batteries
specifically for the Nintendo switch and
this is one of the first one we have
right here comes from Ankur now they
actually have two different models of
this this is the smaller one you can
grab and these are designed to
specifically work with the weight the
switch receives a charge in order to
give it the fastest charge possible
while still giving you a high capacity
now before we dive in depth on this guy
something I want to talk about really
quick is whenever we talk about charging
solutions for the Natuna switch I get a
lot of people asking questions about
whether or not using something like this
is going to cause any damage to their
system or possibly even brick it and the
reason why people are worried about this
is because back in March when Nintendo
released their five point update for the
switch it caused a lot of systems that
were using a third-party Doc's to brick
now since that has happened a lot of
people are worried about anything that
supplies any kind of power to the switch
but the fact that matter is is that that
particular issue is really only tied to
when the switch is being used in a doc
mode there has been no discovered
problems when using battery banks or any
other kind of charging solution if
you're just using it as a portable
you're fine when it comes to Docs though
right now you want to stick with
official Nintendo Doc's now there has
been some news from Nintendo saying that
you should also be careful what kind of
charge cables you use but as long as you
use the kind of chargers that come with
the Nintendo switch or any cables that
are supplied with officially licensed
and branded Nintendo stuff you're gonna
be fine anyways back to this guy right
here so like I said this one is
officially
licensed by Nintendo so it's safe to use
and it's made by Ankur now part of the
idea is like I said it is optimized to
charge as quickly as possible with the
switch but these are also just high
quality high-capacity batteries this one
in particular is their smaller design it
carries I believe thirteen thousand four
hundred milliamp hours which on the
switch translates to about 1.7 charges
so it's not gonna give you too full
extra charges but close they do make
another design that's more elongated
shape and that one is a much higher
capacity at 20k 100 that one's basically
two-and-a-half extra charges so it's
gonna give you over three times the
battery life and of course on top of
working really well with the switch it
does have actual Nintendo switch
branding on it so behave your whole
collection accessories this is gonna fit
right in and while it is designed to be
optimized with the switch you can still
use it with anything else that you want
to charger with a formal battery bank
whether that's your phone other portable
gaming devices whatever this is a good
still gonna work for all those just fine
now of course all the stuff sounds
awesome on paper but let's actually give
this thing a try we've got two dead
switch back here right now so we're
gonna go ahead and hook this guy up and
see how much of the battery were able to
charge in the next hour
so after charging the switch with this
thing for an hour we got it to 43%
basically meaning that in about two and
a half hours we can get a full charge
putting on par with other Nintendo stuff
making it an awesome option for charging
on the go top that off with its awesome
build quality Portability and this is a
must-have accessory for any switch owner
now right now you cannot get these on
Amazon they're only available on angers
website and even then it's just a
pre-order system so we're gonna put that
down below and link you guys to check
out and I'll see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
