accessories on the market,
tons of them, so many that
it's hard to keep track of them all,
but the thing is, as many things
that are marketed for
the Switch there are,
there are so many more things out there
that'll work for the system just fine
while not actually being
really meant for it
in the first place, so
we're gonna take a look
at some secret Switch accessories.
(uptempo electronic pop music)
To start with, we're gonna take a look
at a classic example of this,
and one that we've talked
about a few times in the past,
and that's a tablet stand.
There so many cheap tablet
stands on the market
you can grab that'll work
perfectly for the Switch
and act as another way to
set it up for tabletop mode
because as I have said time
and time and time again,
I hate the kickstand on the Switch.
It doesn't do a great
job of supporting it.
It's not always the most stable,
and after you've used it a bunch of times,
it just starts to break
really, really easily,
so this is gonna give you a way
to have a nice sturdy way
of setting up your Switch
when you want to play in tabletop mode,
not to mention it raises it up
and leaves a little section open
so you can actually plug things
into the bottom of the
Switch and charge it up
instead of just blocking that port access
from maybe trying
sitting it up on its own.
Again, there are tons
of these on the internet
that are really cheap to to pick up.
You can get one like this.
It's just a nice
straightforward form design,
or you can get one that's also collapsible
so you can get a little more portability.
There are so many to choose from
and they're way cheaper than anything
that's gonna have a Mario
or Zelda logo on it.
I'm gonna need you guys to
stick with me for a second
on this next one because
it's a little weird.
It's kinda dumb, it's a little silly,
but honestly this is a great cheap way
to add a little extra
protection to your Switch.
One of the problems
that people can run into
is if they're switching their Switch
between the docked and
undocked modes really often.
You run the risk of scratching the screen,
because every time you're
slamming in it there
and taking it out, if you're
not really angling it right,
you can just end up
scratching it a little bit,
and that's not something
you want to have happen,
so to add a little extra protection,
you get some rubber bands.
I am 100% serious about this.
All you gotta do is take two rubber bands,
put 'em on the outer edges of the Switch
just slightly covering the bezels,
and it's gonna give a little extra spacing
between the screen and the
front part of the dock.
You are gonna feel more resistance
when you're putting the
Switch into the dock,
so you can't really do
it as fluidly or simply,
but that's gonna make sure
your screen is nice and safe.
(electronic music)
Now at the start of this scene,
you might have some questions.
Specifically, what is
Kevin wearing, and why?
Well, this is a beanie,
and I wear it for reasons
that I'm never going
to explain to you guys.
As for the next product on our list,
this is a tablet holder that's designed
just to work with a variety
of different smaller tablets
and the usual idea is it's so you can
watch a TV show or something on it
while keeping your hands
free and staying mobile,
but for the Switch, it is a revolution
in how to play games on the go.
Now, normally, if you want to walk around
and play your Switch at the same time,
you have to keep it in handheld mode
and that requires you to
be in a very specific setup
and it can kinda feel cramped
and just over time not super-comfortable.
With this, though, you're gonna
be able to play the Switch,
see it at the same time
and keep your hands free
just to have two Joy-Cons freeform
or use other controllers if you like,
like a Switch Pro Controller.
Now, will you look completely
ridiculous doing this?
Yes, I am not going to lie to you.
Is it comfortable?
Yes. By the way, if you're
wondering about the Switch
we're using in today's video,
this is actually a skin I got
thanks to today's sponsor, dbrand.
They have a whole line of Switch skins
that are totally safe to
use on the Switch itself,
on the Joy-Cons or even for the Dock.
There's a large variety
of different colors
and designs to choose from.
Right now I'm really in
a big Spider-Man mood
after seeing the latest movie,
so I went for a red and
blue look right now.
There's a whole lot of choices out there.
If you want to take a look,
check out the link down below.
One of the accessories we're
talking about a lot this year
is Bluetooth adapters, and
the big one for the Switch
is the GENKI, which is an
excellent awesome choice.
However, it's not exactly
super-easily available right now.
You can place orders,
but it takes some time,
and it's just trying
to get out to everyone,
so if you're really impatient
and just want a wireless solution
for your Switch right away,
there are a lot of Bluetooth adapters
that plug right into an aux
cord that work perfectly fine.
One example we have right here
is the AirFly from Twelve South.
This just plugs into the
aux port of the Switch.
It's gonna give it
Bluetooth compatibility.
It supports aptX, so if
you have aptX headphones,
you're gonna get that low
latency, which is so important.
Otherwise, you're still gonna
get great quality audio.
The reason why we're talking
about this one in particular
is that while there are a lot
of different Bluetooth
adapter options out there
aside from obviously the
GENKI like we've talked about,
a lot of the cheaper choices out there
are actually cheap, not in the good way.
Like, they feel very flimsy.
They don't look great,
it's not very stable.
This is something that's
gonna plug into the Switch
and it's nice and sturdy and
just really looks good, too.
Now you might notice that
a lot of items on this list
have one thing in common,
and that's tablets.
Look, the fact that the Switch
is very similarly shaped
to common tablets means there's a lot of
really useful stands and holders
that are designed to work with that shape,
and this next item is another
great example of this.
Now you might be wondering
what actually this is.
This is actually a tablet stand
that attaches to the headrest of a car
so that way you can set up a little screen
in the backseat area. This
makes it so that instead of
trying to steady yourself in the backseat
holding onto a Switch or if you're trying
to share with someone
or go back and forth,
you can just set up
one screen in the back,
and that way people can play multiplayer.
You just have one screen to look at,
and it just generally allows you
to be a little more comfortable in the car
not trying to find the
right way to hold the Switch
and not get carsick at the same time.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
