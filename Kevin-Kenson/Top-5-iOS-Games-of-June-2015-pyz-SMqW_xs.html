for my favorite iOS games of the month
this particular installment includes two
really high-profile titles that no one
should be missing out on as well as
three indie titles worth taking a look
into to begin with this game that
probably doesn't need an introduction if
you've been paying attention to the app
market this past month and that's
fallout shelter this game was announced
and released during the test as press
conference as part of hyping up fallout
4 and it did a pretty damn good job of
doing it the game is completely free to
play and it does feature some in-app
purchases but they are pretty much
entirely ignoring the entire idea is
that you are building up and protecting
your very own vault you invite who ends
up living it what their tasks are it's
kind of this very interesting mixture of
XCOM and sins as your vault gets larger
and larger you'll start to unlock a lot
of different specialty rooms and you'll
be able to send out your vault dwellers
into the wilderness to see how well they
survive and how much cool loot they can
bring back for a completely free to play
game the amount of time you can get out
of this game is absolutely massive and
it's high quality to boot it does get a
bit tedious near the end of the game
unless you've played it for so long but
for how much fun you get out of it for
how little you had to invest this is
easily one of the best games to pick up
that has come out in quite some time now
getting rid of the slightly more India
SH games we've got blades of brim now
this is a very very obvious entry and be
very dense genre of iOS games that are
endless runners all based on the Temple
Run formula but this one does quite a
bit to help make itself a little more
different now as you'd expect with an
endless runner most of the game is built
around just simply going down a hallway
that never ends while trying to avoid
death and getting some cool loot along
the way
this game introduces a lot of other
elements however including things like
wall running finding mini dungeons with
their own little objectives to collect
treasure and of course having to fight
off waves of enemies and encountering
special enemies that might take certain
tactics and timing to take down properly
this game has a whole lot unlocks you
could find including armor that can have
your defenses weapons stop your damage
pets that you can summon and ride to
gain temporary bonuses and of course
different playable characters to choose
from what's great about this is that
while the game does have in-app
purchases and is very susceptible that
you just pouring a lot of real money to
get easy unlocks it's never really that
required you can get through
to this game and take your time
unlocking all the different stuff
without ever having to resort to your
credit card the options there but you
don't have to do it as I said this does
come from a very dense genre but blades
of Grimm is definitely one of the best
games to make itself stand out as
something a little bit more than just
another clone third up we've got a bit
more of a slower paced and really
relaxing game and that's lines now this
is a puzzle game where the very simple
idea is all you're trying to do is make
your colour beat out all the other
colours for filling in lines however how
you accomplish this is done a couple
different ways some puzzles early on
will have you just simply place dots
where you want to spawn colors other
areas will have you erase dots of the
opposing type to try and get an
advantage and others even have you
create your own lines in order to create
shortcuts for your lines to fill in for
colors with now the base puzzle concept
is pretty solid but what really makes
this game appealing is the aesthetic
it's not only really great looking but
it's got a wonderful soothing soundtrack
and the music reacts to what you do in
the game whenever you add a point reduce
a point it makes a tone whenever your
lines clash with other lines it produces
a note so everything that happens in the
game the music will react - which just
makes it a lot more engaging it may be
very simple but there are plenty of
puzzles and it's also easily replayable
with how each of the puzzles is slightly
randomized every time you do it so if
you're just looking for a game to pick
up and play every now and then you want
to pass time very calmly this is an
excellent choice now fourth up and the
last of our more Indias titles is war
Miriam now this is one of those games
where when you first pick it up it looks
really really simple and honestly very
kiddi but it ends up being quite the
opposite once you get not that much
farther into it the gameplay is actually
a lot more complex and difficult than it
first appears when you start off it
almost looks like just a simple worm
game where all you have to do is go
through tunnels and eventually fill the
whole thing however you've got this
annoying little worm chasing you while
you do this and the worm doesn't just
simply follow you it'll actually
sometimes diverting take different
courses try and cut you off now while
you can make turns to go down different
corridors you can never completely
reverse your directions so a lot of
times you'll find yourself thinking
you're safe
then it'll head you off at one pass and
completely screw you over because you
just watch yourself slowly go towards it
in a head-on collision this game takes a
lot more time
and thinking than you would initially
think which made me absolutely fall in
love with it it's a great looking game
really fun appealing to both adults and
kids and really really hard one to get
into later stages now last up is a game
that I absolutely could not leave off
this month's list it was one of my
favorite games to come out on PC and ps4
in 2014 and that's transistor the port
job for this game was done excellently
not only does it run smoothly and look
great but the control scheme really
makes sense all you have to do is tap
where you want to move choose what moves
you want to actively be using when you
attack enemies and then tap on enemies
to attack you can of course also pause
time to queue up several moves
back-to-back which is really how you're
gonna spend playing most of the game so
it works out perfectly on iOS the only
real thing that ends up being a slight
issue compared to playing it on other
systems is that if you want to do really
tricky fast movements like weaving back
and forth that can get a little
difficult with tap controls it is
something you can do it's just not as
easy and intuitive as it would be with a
controller that minor gripe aside though
this port has been done beautifully if
you didn't get a chance to play this
game on PC or Mac and you don't have a
ps4 this is a game you absolutely must
pick up and try it is a little pricey
for an app game but completely worth it
well those are my favorite I Oh s games
of June 2015 as always there were a
whole lot more games that came out that
didn't make the list so if there's one
