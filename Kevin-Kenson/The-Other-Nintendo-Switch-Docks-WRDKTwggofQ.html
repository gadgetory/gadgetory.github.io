don't get me wrong it gets the job done
and there is a certain cool factor about
the way that you dock the switch into it
where you slide it in and remove your
joy Kahn's it's all very pretty but
there's a lot of stuff about this things
design that could just be well better
for instance it's much bigger than it
needs to be especially when you realize
that all the actual working parts of the
system it's just this little square area
right here and then there's the way that
the switch just sits inside of the dock
where the front plate can actually
scratch your screen and there's not
really any great way for it to ventilate
the heat coming out of the switch so as
a result some people that play for a lot
of hours and dock mode are seeing their
switches lightly warm and because of all
this there's a lot of third-party
companies that are making alternative
options for people that might fix some
of these issues so let's take a look at
them first one of the simplest solutions
is to take the switch talk and downsize
it as much as possible or you get a
little guy like this pretty much all
these companies have done is take the
important working parts of the switch
which is this one main board inside
right here and build a shell around it
so you're still getting all the
important bits you're getting all your
ports on this side and this side right
here and you're freeing the switch
because you're not building this kind of
crazy encapsulated thing around it so
you're realizing the heat actually
properly dissipate and there's no risk
of scratching your screen or anything
like that and because it's so much
smaller it's way more portable you can
put this in a bag backpack maybe even a
pocket it's just a lot more convenient
now well that first dock is much smaller
than the official Nintendo switch one we
can go even tinier and that's where a
design like this comes in now this
pretty much just abandons the idea
entirely the switch dock is well a dock
and instead just turns it into a cable
so you're getting it as small as
possible or this could easily fit inside
of a pocket but there are some downsides
to this redesign first off you are
losing some of the ports instead of
having access to all three USB ports
you're just getting one right here but
you're still getting the most important
bits with the HDMI and USB si+ since
it's now a cable design the switch isn't
really designed to easily sit down on
its own with a cable like this so you're
either gonna have to just lay the switch
down next to it where you're plugging it
in or create some kind of secondary
setup where there's a mount the switches
going into and you plug this
either way the main takeaway here
awesome portability at the expense of
some functionality now maybe you want to
go in the opposite direction maybe you
don't care at all about the
functionality of the doc instead or a
little bothered by the fact that it's
pretty plain and simple looking and you
want something flashy there's a couple
options for that as well first off we
talked about this item a little bit it's
the doc dunk
it's a doctrine PvP that you put the doc
inside of and it adds these cool
light-up face plates which make it way
more animated and cool looking this is
the Zelda one which I personally like a
lot more but when you buy it you also
get a Mario Odyssey design that's pretty
cool too now the lineup dock isn't far
enough for you and you want to do
something a little crazier you can find
all kinds of homemade custom jobs that
are insane dock designs like we found
this one at sea which is based on the
ship from Super Mario Odyssey which is
clearly 3d printed but really freaking
cool especially the fact they actually
put a little place here you could set
down your favor me bow which you know we
got to tie in something here now there
are some eccentric things that come with
finding stuff like this though for
instance because this is designed just
to look cool and not actually be well
functional you're still running into the
same problems the dock has where you
could risk scratching the screen if
you're not careful it doesn't really
vent heat very well and because this is
designed to look like the ship and not
actually match the dimensions of the
switch it might take a couple tries to
actually dock it properly also this
isn't actually a dock instead just plugs
into an extension cable that you have to
plug in to the regular dock so you kind
of to build a setup around it and takes
a little extra work and it's a little
odd design but at the same time this is
really cool to show off now if you're
shopping around online for a dock and
none of the ones you're really seeing or
fitting the bill there is always the
option to just do it yourself it's
really surprisingly not that hard to do
with the switch dock and if you're
looking around online you'll see all
kinds of people Shelley shelling selling
different shell designs that's a
seashell situation right there different
shell designs that you can just take the
dock you already own open it up take out
the insides and put them into or you
could do something like we did where you
just find something that can fit the
dock parts and actually make a cool
unique design like this Legend of Zelda
cart that we put one into now if you're
thinking about doing this and it sounds
really intimidating because like oh no I
have to take the dock apart it really
isn't that tough the only barrier to
entry is owning the right kind of
screwdrivers so you can open it up
that or you could just be very careful
and very precise with the hammer and
pray you don't break the insides</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
