now you're wondering what accessories
need to grab to complete your setup well
here are some must head now to start
we're going to talk about something that
isn't exactly the most fun item on this
list but is a lot more important that a
lot of people realized it was going to
be and that's a screen protector sure
the switch has a touchscreen but not a
lot of games use it yet and yet the
handheld is long ago stuff happened it's
good to keep the screen nice and
protected so as it turns out one thing a
lot of people didn't think about is the
fact that the dock that you're going to
constantly be putting the switch in and
taking it out of doesn't actually have
any soft protective padding on the side
of the screen so over time unless you're
being super super careful every time you
put this thing in take it out put it in
take it out put it in take it out it's
going to very lightly scratch the screen
over time and so screen protector is
going to prevent that from happening a
second on our list is actually a small
collection of items including these
screen protectors we were just talking
about and that's official starter kits
from Nintendo these are going to have
everything you need for basic use of
your system beyond just simply playing
this it's going to include a protective
carrying case you can carry your switch
around as well as a place to store all
of your games and cables it's also going
to come with these little grip so you
can attach to the joy cons if you find
that they're just a little too small to
fit comfortably in your hands a few
other little things that come with it
are some some stick grips that are a
little better than what the joy comps
have but they're still not great there's
also a couple different starter kit
designs that are all themed after
different popular Nintendo things for
instance a Mario set where everything is
red or a Legend of Zelda set where
everything is blue next up on the list
is probably one of the most sought-after
accessories right now for the Nintendo
switch and that steam Tendo switch pro
controller the Joey cons are well and
good but some people really just want to
have that traditional controller
experience and this is going to give it
to them and there are some important
benefits and upgrades to using one I do
think the button placement is better the
buttons are further apart which is nice
it has better triggers the analog sticks
are a little taller so it's going to be
better for certain games and most
importantly for some people is the fact
that you have an actual d-pad instead of
those forward little buttons on the joy
also a really really cool thing that
people discovered recently is there's a
hidden message inside of the pro
controller iris won't open so you guys
can get a look at it right here it says
thanks to all game fans now the fourth
item on this list is actually the only
thing here that is not an official
Nintendo product and I have zero regrets
about buying it and it's this little
plastic grip for your joy cons when
you're playing certain games especially
ones that emphasize local co-op or
multiplayer like Bomberman or shovel
knight you can use a single joique on
sideways but it's not the most
comfortable experience this is going to
make it much closer using an actual
controller and even comes a little thumb
grip that works a lot better than the
one that's on the joy con one of the
things that did worry me about it too at
first was the buttons on the shoulders
and sides they felt a little weak before
I put a joy come in but whoops there
they're actually really snappy now for
our fifth item I have something that I
try to include in pretty much every
accessory list I've ever done because
it's something I get a ton of use out of
and that's a storage solution for
carrying around your system and all your
accessories and thankfully Nintendo has
made a really awesome official product
for the switch which is this backpack
right here if you look at the inside
there's actually dedicated pockets for
everything you've got six slots for
individual joy cons you can fit two more
joy cons attached to the switch tablet
here there's a pocket for the docking
station down there pretty much there's a
pocket for everything you can use with a
switch right now and even after putting
all that in there there's room to add
other stuff even like a laptop now I do
have one bonus item on talked about it's
cheating a little bit because it's not
really an accessory in traditional sense
and a lot of you guys probably already
know about these or have them but I love
them so much I got to talk about them at
least a little bit amiibos there are
already a handful of games Linden tennis
which that have amiibo support obviously
one of them is going to be the legend as
though the breath of the wild where you
can scan them to get some free bonus
items but there's other games too like
shovel knight which unlocks a little
helper fairy now the benefits they give
you in game are cool but honestly I love
these things just because they're fun
little collectible and they really
really jumps in quality over the years
if you compare some of the most recent
ones like these breast wall designs to
the original smash amigos the difference
is night and day the only thing that is
a little weird about them is that they
don't have a consistent sense of scale
so when you start to buy a lot of them
and put them next to each other you
begin to notice certain things like
little tiny link reading a little tiny
horse</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
