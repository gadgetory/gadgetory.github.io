on this channel which ones are best for
your gaming setup rather you're looking
for the best response time possible for
multiplayer games or if you just want
something that's gonna give you the best
cinematic feel and today we're gonna
talk about a mantra that's a little bit
more of an interesting choice and that
comes from LG with the very
tongue-twisting name of the LG 43 UD 79
- B now this is primarily meant to be a
Productivity monitor but it does have
some uses in gaming as well to be
upfront the one limiting factor for
gaming is the fact that this is a 60
Hertz monitor so if you want to do any
gaming that is over 60 FPS this is not
gonna be the choice for you but there
are a whole lot of other features that
it does have to offer primarily it has
an awesome viewing angle it has a non
reflective coating so you're gonna have
less glare issues than you would with
other screens and does have a great
response time but there's one feature in
particular that really stands out about
this and that's the sheer number of
inputs it has and the ability to do
picture by picture and picture in
picture displays now when I say a lot
inputs it has a lot of inputs it has
four separate HDMI two of which are 1.0
so it's going to limit it to 30 Hertz
but two more for one point for which
you're gonna get that 60 Hertz
performance also a USB C port and
DisplayPort and with all of those
combined we can do something dumb like
this
the theater is simple to make use of all
the inputs on this monitor to do a
gaming desk setup that supports as many
systems as we can hook up so right now
we are using every HDMI port on this
thing to hook up a PlayStation 4 Pro an
Xbox 1s a Nintendo switch and to add a
little variety I also hooked up the
analogue NT to play some old-school NES
games in 1080 and along with that we
still have an open USB C port so I can
occasionally plug in a MacBook Pro if I
want to actually get work done and not
just play games as much as I hate having
to do that and we also have an open
display port so we can hook up a
high-power gaming PC and the thing is
it's really easy to switch between all
of these because not only do have
controls on the monitor itself but also
comes with this handy little remote so
you can switch between them just like it
were a TV now this alone is handy but
it's not the real reason why we want to
do this setup because there's something
about this monitor that allows this to
be particularly ridiculous and fun and
not at all a logical thing to do but it
just seemed like a great idea at the
time
and that's making use of 4 screen
split-screen to play all of these
systems at the same time
now the reason we went with a desk set
up for this build is that it's all based
around the monitor and the usual logic a
lot of people have is oh I have a gaming
monitor I use it in my desk setup but
really it's a larger monitor at 43
inches and the way we're using it but
we're having this whole setup of using
multiple game systems this could also
very easily work for a living room
entertainment center now I'll be honest
when I first had the idea of doing this
in like a living room setup I was aware
that this monitor might just be a little
too small you know maybe getting used to
you know 55-inch and above but honestly
with the right entertainment console
this looks really great now this is when
we've actually used before for an
ultimate PlayStation setup and it works
perfectly for this because it allows us
to show off multiple systems that are
all being plugged in and used on the
monitor at the same time so there we
have two different ways you can make use
of this monitor to create an all-in-one
for system setup is this something that
I think a lot of you are going to do no
not all this is a terrible idea why
would you do this but it's kind of cool</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
