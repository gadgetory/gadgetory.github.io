No.
It's also the worst condiment.

What do you think of
the latest PS5 teaser?
Look, I don't really put too much stock
in any PS5 news outside of
the one published article
interviewing Cerny on WIRED.
Everything pass that is
rumor, hearsay, leaks...
There's just a lot of
information out there
and I don't believe 80% of it.
And this goes to a lot
of different things.
There's different mock ups of controllers
that have video screens on them.
There are talks about all the kinds
of additional features or crazy things.
There's people doing mock
ups of the system itself.
The only stuff I really put full belief in
as far as PS5 news so
far is the kind of specs
they were talking about, the fact that
they're going with an SSD
instead of a regular hard drive,
the increased power and the
fact that it is going to be
backwards compatible with at least PS4.
Any news past that one
official actual publication,
I (pause), grain of salt.
(reading from screen)
What first party games that
haven't already been announced
will come to The Switch from
now 'til the end of 2020?
Well that's actually pretty tough
because there's a lot of
stuff already in the pipeline
for Switch for the rest of this year
and probably through next year
that they've already announced
at least by giving us a title,
there is of course, Metroid
Prime 4, Bayonetta 3,
we have a new Zelda coming
out later this year,
Fire Emblem's coming out very soon,
the only series that might have
a little bit of a gap right now is Mario,
only because there are so many
different Mario spinoffs that exist,
there could be some
more that we don't have
quite yet coming to the Switch later.
Now as far as things that
aren't announced at all,
(sighs) yeah, I really don't know,
because there's so much
we already have going on.
I think probably the biggest possibility
aside from another Mario game
is maybe some other kind of Zelda title.
The remake of Link's Awakening
is a really interesting
kind of side thing, they
don't do remakes like this
super often, especially where
it's not just a port job,
it's like actually a full remake,
but I think it does leave the door open
for a more thorough Zelda experience
possibly next year, but more
likely gonna be announced
next year, and that will be some time
past that 2020 window.
(reading from screen)
Thoughts on the Pokemon press conference?
What do you think will happen at E3?
It was kind of a slow boring one
Look, some of it is
good news, I think a new
Detective Pikachu is awesome,
the idea of Pokemon home
is cool, it's just - I
don't know if we needed
a whole press conference
to set up and talk
about that, I still don't
entirely know what is going on
with Pokemon Sleep,
I've read a few people's
basic descriptions of
what they talked about
it certainly seems like
an interesting idea
and then a new mobile game
that's more focused on
Pokemon battles instead
of catching Pokemon
like Pokemon Go, I've
reserved judgment, it's
something that I'm kinda curious about
I think we need to see
how the game is actually
monetized cause we know
it's going to be monetized
and just kinda see what
exactly the experience
is for that game
So overall, it wasn't a
press conference that I was
like super excited by the news of
I think Pokemon Home was
probably the biggest thing
aside from Detective
Pikachu 2, yeah I'm more
excited for the Direct
coming up to focus on
Sword and Shield, that's really what I'm
interested in seeing
(reading from screen)
Alright, from Twitter,
are you excited for the
Final Fantasy seven remake?
I don't know anymore honestly, I was
so amazingly hyped when
it was announced for
the first time at that
one PlayStation press
conference, I can't even
remember how many years
it's been now cause we
all kept asking Newport
for so long and it finally happened
and now that it's finally happening
I don't really know if I want it
and it's not just the
matter of whether or not
it maintains like the
actual tone of the original
games cause I think
there's gonna be a lot a
changes to the plot,
there's certain scenes
in the original game
that I know for a fact
will just not fly in
modern game development
and they're changing the
game play style as well
which can work, it's
just at what point is it
exactly what we're looking for in a remake
You know I really liked
the Resident Evil 2 remake
because while it was
a different play style
it still maintained that
same kinda core experience
of being a survival shooter
with the shooting aspects
and was just better cause
it was over the shoulder
instead of fixed cameras
But with Final Fantasy seven,
it's kinda turning into
something completely
different, then there's the
whole rumor of it being
episodic and just - I don't
know guys, I'm doing my best to not think
too hard about it and
just try to play it with
an open mind when it
releases and maybe it'll
pleasantly surprise me
(reading from screen)
What game or games are you looking forward
to seeing at E3 2019?
I will say the same
thing I've been saying to
everyone on this question
even though I know
it's not happening, I
want Nintendo to finally
announce new Golden Sun, just do it
- (in a loud voice) Just do it!
- As far as things that
are actually gonna happen
this year, I'm hoping
to see maybe a playable
demo for the new Fire
Emblem, I know that's only
like a month and a half
away but I'd still like to
learn a little bit more
about it cause currently
there's very little
actual hard info about how
it's going to play, we
basically have a couple
magazine articles and one
big trailer to go off of
Aside from that, I think
one of the biggest things
actually is I'm very
curious what Ubisoft's doing
Ubisoft is a company that
has games that I really
like, and games I really don't care about,
and it's, I'm pretty
strong in both directions
and so I think one of
the really big rumors
going round is that
we're finally gonna see
a new Splinter Cell, and
if that is true I want
to see and possibly maybe
even play a demo of that
because that would be
fantastic, I need more
stealth games, it is a
genre that needs a lot
more love than it's
been getting and that's
the one last major franchise kinda still
kicking around that can do that
(reading from screen)
Do you think there'll
be an Xbox portable console
like the PS Vita or 3DS?
Honestly no, not really, I
don't think that's something
that Xbox is really interested
in especially because
it's a space that's kinda full right now
I mean, while Nintendo
doesn't really have any
dedicated portable in
the sense of how like the
3DS was, the Switch
basically fills that niche
and PlayStation, well the
PS Vita didn't exactly
work out, so I think for
Xbox they're not really
interested in trying to
branch out to new hardware
I think they want to focus
on just doing what they
do best with home console
units, and instead
the focus is on making
services available so that
you can use other mobile
devices to play Xbox
games on the go, a really
good example of this
is of course Project xCloud,
which is the whole idea
of you being able to
streamplay games onto your
phone, there's also of
course lots of rumors
and hopes that, that might also happen to
the Switch as well, fingers crossed
So yeah, I don't think
Xbox is really interested
in making their own hand
held, I think they're more
focused on the idea of
making a streaming service
more so, and that's
the way you get to play
on the go instead
(reading from screen) Are you going to E3?
Yes
(reading from screen) What
is your fave dbrand skin?
(silence)
On that note I'd like to
thank dbrand for sponsoring
today's video, they have a
whole line of Switch skins
that are totally safe to use
on the joy cons, the Switch,
the dock itself, and my
favorite option right now
is actually their new
matte black skins which
look amazing on joy cons
If you wanna learn
more, check out the link
down below
(reading from screen) Do you
think that Witcher 3 will
actually be ported to
Switch or are those rumors
just wild speculation
I wouldn't say its wild
speculation because
it isn't something that's based on nothing
there have been little
bits and pieces here that
kind of implied that
that is a thing occurring
but it does seem pretty crazy
And it's not just a
matter of whether or not
the Switch can run that
kinda game, I think that
the right sacrifices can
be made, the right lower
framework can be targeted
and it's something that
could run on the Switch
The biggest thing about
that that seems crazy to me
and I was actually just
talking about this today
on a little discussion
with some other YouTubers,
is the fact that Witcher 3
is a big game, really big
to the point of which a regular sized card
for the Switch isn't going
to carry the whole data
and then you're gonna
need a really big install
and anyone that's not using
an SD card, probably isn't
going to be able to fit
all that information either
So it's something that I
think yes, it's possible but
I'm curious how we're
actually going to see it be
accomplished from a development standpoint
And if it does happen,
that's awesome cause I can't
wait for another excuse to
play that game on the go
instead of reinstalling it on my computer
(reading from screen) What
do you think of Pokemon
Sword and Shield?
I don't know what I think
yet, we have very little info
to go on, at least right
now there is a Pokemon
Direct coming up that's
going to give us a lot more
information, what I will say
about this is that the way
that Pokemon series has
been going its something
that they keep making
games, and I still play them
and what I mean by that is they haven't
necessarily gotten
better, it's just always
the same formula that I enjoy
and I'm gonna go back to
And I hope that this time
around it's something that's
gonna be a little more
different, that maybe just
rekindles something, I
don't know, especially
after the release of
Pokemon Let's Go which yes,
I know is not exactly a
traditional Pokemon experience
but it gave a different
vibe and feeling that
I really liked and I want
to see more exploration
like that, just something
that tackles the formula
a little bit differently
So hopefully we'll some
more details at that
upcoming Direct that
will maybe change my mind
a little bit which
direction, hopefully good,
hopefully bad, I do know
right now that I'm currently
stuck between choosing either Grookey or
Scorbunny as my starter,
we'll see what their final
forms look like and then I'll decide</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
