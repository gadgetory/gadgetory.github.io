anticipated games to come out for the
Xbox one is finally here and while I'm
working on the review I wanted to bring
you guys a quick unboxing of the limited
edition halo 5 Xbox one console taking a
look at the Box on the front side we've
got an image of the limited edition
design system sporting that black and
grey left with that nice little light
blue trim and on the back side we've got
the regular cover art for the game
meanwhile on the sides you've got a
listing and picture of all the stuff
that comes in this box which not only
includes all the stuff you'd regularly
get with an Xbox one and a downloadable
copy of Halo 5 but all the contents of
the limited edition which normally runs
for a hundred dollars opening the box up
were greeted by two items right away
first off there's the steelbook case
which includes all the different goodies
that come with the limited edition halo
5 and the other is the specially
designed controller that sports the same
design of having that grey with cobalt
trim now underneath this stuff is all
the things you normally get when you get
an Xbox one HDMI cable AC adapter
headset stuff you don't really care
about right now what really matters it's
what's underneath those the limited
edition halo 5 Xbox one now I gotta say
I've been boxed a few limited edition
systems in the past but this is by far
my favorite I love the half black half
grey design I like the fact that there
is some itching on the system but it's
not overly intricate but at the same
time not too plain and I absolutely love
that cobalt blue that's on the disc
reader as well as a line on top of the
system now that being said I do have a
problem with this bundle but it has
nothing to do with the system but
instead has to do with those limited
edition contents see when you open up
that steelbook case you're gonna find a
whole bunch of pamphlets for bonus DLC
for getting the limited edition stuff
are pretty used to buy this point but
the bigger problem is the statue it
comes with because it's not a
preassembled statue instead it's one of
those metal craft things we have to put
together a whole bunch of tiny intricate
pieces which I don't think a lot of
people were expecting when they bought
this bundle or the limited edition now
given if you're into this kind of stuff
great you've done this before it's not
gonna take you a lot of work I'm sure
but for anyone that's just a fan of Halo
and wanted to get a cool statue that
they saw in the Box this is a bit bigger
of a problem because I tried putting
this together when I first opened this
up and I gave up after about an hour of
trying because I did not have any of the
proper tools nor was I mentally prepared
for the amount of work it
take which sucks because all the mock-up
images of how the statue should look
once you've put it together look really
really cool
but it's gonna take a lot of effort and
time that I don't think a lot of people
are prepared for when they just buy the
box not knowing it's something they have
to put together themselves now with that
in mind all in all I think for 500 bucks
this is still a frickin awesome
limited-edition system as a fan of halo
growing up where I loved halo one and
two and have kind of gone back and forth
with every game since then even if five
disappoints me I'm still gonna be happy
with this system because like I said I
think it's absolutely gorgeous yes I am
frustrated by the metal craft statue but
ultimately that's not why I wanted to
get this bundle so it's something I'm
willing to forgive but if I was getting
a limb addition by itself I would
definitely be salty about it now don't
mind me I'm just gonna go ahead and
disappear and play Halo 5 non-stop the
next few days to get that review done
for those you already interested I do
have a link posted down below where you
can grab the game or this bundle as
always if you enjoyed the video hit that
thumbs up button to let me know as well

future content and until then I'm Kevin
Kenson and I'll see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
