of the best accessories you can grab for
your ps4 today we've got a mixture of
some really nice expensive stuff and
then some cheaper cool but also kind of
weird stuff first let's talk about one
of the weirder things on this list it's
also kind of cool and I don't just mean
that in a bad pun pen aways you're about
to find out and that's a cooling fan for
your controller now to be honest I
originally picked this guy up for our
worst ps4 video because I just want to
find some silly looking accessories
stuff that sounded maybe kind of dumb
but after using it I kind of liked it
it's actually really simple all you do
is hook on to your controller it doesn't
plug in to anything it just has its own
battery source you can charge right here
and you just flip it on and bam you have
cool air going onto your palms and the
idea is that when you play for long
periods of time your hands are gonna get
sweaty that's why there's so many pro
controllers with special grips and stuff
so what this does instead of worrying
about the grip on the controller it just
keeps your hands nice and dry the whole
time you're playing now it is a little
blocky but honestly it doesn't really
mess with the grip of that much I'm
still able to hold the controller pretty
comfortably and while you can hear the
fan I play with the headset a lot and it
doesn't bother me at all so let's go
ahead and stress test this guy
next let's keep talking controllers but
instead of modifying the wrong one you
have let's talk about a pro controller
option with the scuff impact now I've
talked about a few different pro
controller designs before and while all
of them still have their merits their
strengths all that good stuff
there's one thing that's undeniably kind
of knowing about them they're all wired
except this guy right here the scuff
controllers are all heavily modified
regular ps4 controllers so it still has
the same wireless connection you get
with your official ones but with all the
added benefits of a pro controller
including these paddles in the back the
changeable sticks extendable triggers
all kinds of that you can customize just
a little bit another cool thing too is
that you are able to actually customize
them made-to-order for the colors you
like so this is one we actually got
Valentine's Day but you could make it
design whatever colors you want they've
available which all look really good now
to be honest I wasn't actually a huge
fan of the stuff infinity which was
designed before this and this has been a
big improvement over it in two main ways
one it's doubled the number of paddles
on the back and to actually replace the
main body design of the DualShock for
which I love this design so much more
it's a lot more comfortable and just
looks better too by the way guys this
video is obviously aimed at PlayStation
folks and if you're a big PlayStation
fan chances are you might not own an
Xbox one if you want to have an Xbox one
I'm actually giving away one right now
which is themed off of cieth East as a
custom design we knew that looks really
awesome
if you don't want to miss out on that
the giveaways ending actually really
soon so make sure to check out the link
down below in the description next let's
talk headsets with the artist Pro
Wireless now I did a dedicated video
talking about this guy and its wired
version but I really want emphasize what
a great pickup this is for ps4 owners if
you're willin to dish out the money for
it because this is honestly my favorite
headset I have ever used it's super
comfortable it's got a great sound
quality and grease of directional audio
as well which is important for
multiplayer games what's really cool
about this thing too is that while it is
marketed specifically for ps4 PC which
it is great for thanks to this little
guy right here which helps with the
audio quality but it also allows use a
Bluetooth connection so you can use it
with your MacBook or a phone giving it
way more versatility as you're gonna use
it across all your different devices and
what's awesome about that as well is
that you can actually do both those
signals simultaneously so you keep in
work little cheats like using this on
Xbox as long as you use your phone for
chat and well it does its job as a
headset really well something it also
stands out about a big time is its
battery solution they're really hate
using wireless products or have to plug
them in to charge it up every now and
then for this guy instead what it does
is you can actually access the battery
really easy right here and it's actually
swappable with the battery inside this
which is constantly charging so whenever
you're a little battery you just pop it
out pop the other one in switch them so
you always make sure you have one that's
fully charged super convenient now you
might be wondering since I'm talkin bout
the wireless one is the wired one worth
grabbing for ps4 it's a good headset and
it is more affordable than this guy but
the downside of the wired one is its
cables are very short so it's really
more appropriate for a kind of desk
setup which if you have that for your
ps4 great but most ps4 owners are going
to be living room setups so the Wireless
is definitely the way to go next let's
talk something isn't really an accessory
but an awesome collectible that just
started coming out these little guys
right here
totaku now this is actually something
that's currently exclusive just Game
Stop I think it's actually made through
thing geek where they've made a whole
line to different little collectible
figures that are pretty clearly inspired
by what Nintendo's been doing with
amiibo but instead of having an actual
function game they're just cool little
collectible statues and honestly for the
amount of quality going in in terms of
just the design and how it looks and the
price there
scheme for which is just ten bucks these
things are freaking awesome now they're
not exclusively just Sony they do have a
couple designs that are from Microsoft
or third-party companies like their say
Hashi from Tekken but as far as like
density of companies go it's a lot of
Sony stuff there's obviously the hunter
right here from blood-borne which I had
to pick up but along with that the
releasing one for Kratos they've done
one for Sackboy all kinds of different
Sony properties that you can now grab as
cool little collectibles and personally
I just love it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
