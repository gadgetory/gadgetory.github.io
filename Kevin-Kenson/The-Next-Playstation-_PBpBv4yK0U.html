a while back why honestly I don't really
have a simple answer for this one so I'm
gonna leave it to the wise words of Rick
and Morty get your shit together
thoughts on the neo PS 4.5 will Sony
make it reality oh yeah definitely for
sure I mean when there was first rumors
of this thing I was very skeptical but
as time has gone on there's been more
news it's looking pretty for sure in
fact I think it'd be even more
surprising if we walked away from a Sony
press conference with no word about a
new system at all I think a lot of
people would just walk away going wait
but I thought but there was going to be
winter spring 2016 Game of the Year
shortlist so it's kind of messed up
because when I think about what games
that I really loved playing this past
year all the main ones kind of popping
up or what I've played in the past month
so part of the problem is the hype for
those hasn't fully died down and we just
yet in particular uncharted for doom at
least for the single player and most
recently overwatch which I'm still
playing if I'm reaching further back in
the year the one game that really stands
out to me right now is the witness but
that is a much more niche game there are
any news about Kingdom Hearts 3 nope
think we will see more fallout 4 style
announcements aka games that are going
to actually still come out in 2016 get
announced oh yeah for sure I mean even
looking at fallout 4 that wasn't
announced at e3 that had a reveal
trailer about a month before and that's
really what's going on with titanfall
right now where we got a reveal teaser
for titanfall - about a month ago it's
gonna be at EA's press conference where
we'll get an official announcement and
it's probably gonna come out this
holiday season and there's a couple
other games where that's a significant
possibility as well I mean Bethesda
could have something up their sleeve
Ubisoft is going to announce new watch
dogs which could be this year or early
next there's all kind of games that
could get announced this year that would
actually be released in 2016
what's up with the NX so I actually did
a video about this about two weeks ago
and the simple answer is not much that
we really know of the only things we
know for a fact are that it's planned to
come out in March of next year there's
going to be the Zelda game on it that's
also coming out for the Wii U and
they're not gonna sell the console to
loss that's it for hard info I mean
there's all kinds of other rumors
patents and people just digging for
information I go over those more in
depth in a video that I did so if you
want to check that out I'll link it down
below but as for right now we really
know next to nothing for sure in fact
they've already said they're not going
to have it at this year's e3 so we're
probably not gonna see it until Tokyo
Game Show in September or maybe even
later than that if they want to do a
Nintendo Direct style thing during the
holiday season how hyped are you for
both Final Fantasy 15 and Kingdom Hearts
3 by Square Enix what more could we see
from those during this e3 to be
perfectly honest I'm actually not that
hyped for either of these games but for
very different reasons for Final Fantasy
15 I grew up loving the Final Fantasy
franchise and over time I've kind of
seen it slowly turn into something that
isn't really what I originally loved I
don't think the game is gonna
necessarily be bad I think it's gonna be
pretty solid still I liked what I saw in
the demo but it's just not exactly
offering what I wanted out of the
franchise any more as for Kingdom Hearts
3 I am excited for it but after 10 years
of being kind of jerk around I'm just
kind of keeping my high flow bowls at an
all-time low and I'm just gonna save
those for when I actually have a
controller in my hand and that game is
playing on my TV screen as for whether
or not we're gonna get any announcements
for those this year probably
I mean ff15 is coming out later this
year so we'll probably get some new
gameplay footage or maybe even a new
playable demo on the show floor as
freakin March 3 no idea do you have a
game which you come back to time and
time again oh definitely for sure I mean
over the years there have been many
games that have gone back to time and
time again that I absolutely love but if
there's one game that probably stands
out above the rest its Chrono Trigger
it's one of my favorite games ever made
definitely my favorite RPG ever not to
mention the fact that it's just really
easy to jump back into it's not one of
those games or have to relearn the
entire system and try to figure out how
to min/max characters I love the story
really easy to play definitely game I go
back to every year or two if possible
well any modern game have the endurance
of classics like Mario as in will there
be Halo lunchboxes in 30 years yes and
no I think a lot of games that come out
nowadays that have huge fan bases are
going to endure for a long time I think
that those fan bases are always going to
keep them alive in a cult sense you know
there's always going to be people that
cosplay or make their own merchandise or
you know drive demand for stuffs to
still be made
I don't think anything that we've seen
released in the last five or 10 years is
going to have the same kind of staying
power or the same kind of iconic level
of popularity that mario has it's just
something that happened so early on in
the history of games and spread to so
many people a lot of which aren't even
gamers to this day but they still know
who Mario is it's just not an event I
think we're gonna see repeated anytime
soon
ps4 neo or new Xbox what more to offer
than 4k honestly no idea and not because
I can't think of any good ideas what
they should add but more of whether or
not it's a good idea to add any new
unique functions I mean one of the major
repeating things that's been said but
the rumors about the playstation 4.5 or
4k is that Sony wants to make sure that
all games are compatible with both the
original ps4 and these new ones that'll
support 4k resolution because if you
start adding unique functionalities to
these new systems you're gonna piss off
your entire fan base that already
invested in this older version because
you're basically saying hey we know you
bought the system just a year or two ago
but guess what if you want to play these
new games or make use of these new
special features you need to shell out a
whole nother four to five hundred bucks
which would piss a lot of people what's
your insight / thoughts on that the
current ps4 completely lacks the
hardware to allow the psvr to function
properly rumored mind you honestly I'm
just going to stick with this one just
being a rumor and one I personally don't
believe in I don't think it's
necessarily impossible but it just
doesn't make a whole lot of sense within
the context of all the other news we've
been seeing lately I mean we've seen the
psvr at live events where it's hooked up
to regular ps4 's and it would be
extremely dumb of Sony to open up
pre-orders for this PS VR system make
people order them in advance find out
hey guess what your current ps4 doesn't
support it which we're announcing at e3
and then have all those people cancel
their pre-orders it just doesn't make
any sense so that's it for this Q&amp;amp;A
thank you guys so much for watching and
a big thank you to everyone that reached
out over twitter with your questions
I'll be seeing guys soon with more
content as we get closer and closer to
III 2016</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
