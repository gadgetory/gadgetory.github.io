world it's one of the biggest
conventions we're gonna see
announcements from all the major
companies on what we can expect over the
next couple of years in gaming and to
celebrate it both Microsoft and Sony are
doing a bunch of deals Sony is doing
their days of play sale which is
starting tomorrow on the 8th while Xbox
is starting today with a whole bunch of
price cuts on hardware and games first
let's talk about stuff you can do for
hardware if you're still sleeping on
getting a new Xbox or Playstation now is
the time to do it because there is a lot
of deals going on first let's take a
look at Sony now when it comes to just
getting a ps4 itself there are two big
deals going on one is they're doing a
special limited edition days of play ps4
slim for 300 bucks it has a 1 terabyte
hard drive but more importantly it is
really nice-looking it's this blue
design with golden PlayStation symbols
on the top it looks so nice honestly
it's probably the best-looking ps4 slim
they've made so if you're looking to get
just a slim and not spend extra on a pro
that is a great way to go
now speaking of pros though the are
doing deals there as well where you can
get the standard black ps4 pro for only
350 bucks mass for accessories there's a
lot going on as well if you want to get
any new DualShock 4 controller those are
going for only 40 bucks and if you're
interested in psvr
there are a lot of price slashes going
on for that thing too you can get a full
bundle for the VR set for only 200 bucks
you can get a set of two new psvr Move
controllers for only 80 bucks and the
PSP our aim controller which is mainly
used for a lot of FPS style games you
can grab for only 50 now as for Xbox
Hardware there's a huge focus on having
discounts across the entire line of Xbox
ones you can get a regular Xbox one ass
with a 5 mega hard drive for only 200
bucks which is super cheap though it
might be worth spending a little extra
because you can get a one terabyte model
for 250 the biggest news by far for them
though as far as hardware goes is the
fact the Xbox one X is getting its first
discounted price ever at 450 bucks
that's 50 bucks off the regular price of
500 whether or not this is going to be a
sign that we're gonna see a more
permanent price dropping in your future
we're not sure but if you've been
waiting on a 1x and getting it just a
little cheaper this is the first time
it's gone below that MSRP Xbox also has
a lot of discounts happening on
controllers as well you can get 10 bucks
off of basically any Xbox one controller
design whether it's just the basic white
or black model or any of the limited
edition designs they've done there
so doing that discount to design lab as
well normally it's 80 bucks to start
customizing your own design lab
controller right now you can start as
low as 70 now Nintendo has not announced
any of their e3 deals in advance if
they're gonna have any to begin with but
as far as hardware goes something they
have announced recently that's kind of
tied in is that there are pre-orders now
up for a new limited edition 2d s Excel
which is themed after zelda with this
really nice-looking Hylian Shield design
now going back to Xbox and Playstation
both of them are also doing a lot of
deals on their various membership
services starting with Xbox the real
focus is on Xbox Live Gold and Xbox
gamer pass now if you don't know what
those are Live Gold is that you need to
play games online you also get some free
games every month well gamer passes a
service that gives you access to a
number of games basically for free while
you remember that you can play
so both these services are offering an
option where for only $1 you can get a
month of coverage so for two bucks to
get both which is awesome if you're
willing to spend a little more money
though for something more long-term
another deal they're doing which is
worth differently for both of them but
it's basically the same deal just
because of how each system works for
Xbox Live Gold if you buy three months
you get another three months free
whereas for gamer pass a six month
membership is half off PlayStation on
the other hand is a little more
conservative with their subscription
deals the two main ones are doing R for
PlayStation Plus which is basically
their version of Xbox Live Gold normally
that goes for 60 bucks a year but during
days of play you can get it for only 50
bucks 10 bucks off the more interesting
deal though is for PlayStation View
which is basically their substitute
cable package where you can watch live
TV normally to get started on that it's
45 bucks a month for the core package
but during days of play you can get
started for 35 bucks for the first two
months by the way for interesting
grabbing any of these hardware software
subscription deals we're gonna like a
lot of them down below in description so
make sure to check that out then of
course we have games now starting with
Sony they've announced a number of
specific titles that are going to be
getting discounts my personal favorites
include getting God of War for 50 bucks
yes that is only 10 bucks lower than
MSRP but it's still pretty much a brand
new game and a really really good one at
that so totally worth grabbing at that
price point also you can get the shout
of the Colossus remake and horizon zero
dawn for only 20 bucks a piece both are
excellent games and for that cheap
definitely worth checking out
some other ones that Sony has emphasized
that you can get Gran Turismo sport for
30 bucks and will be the show for 40
bucks
and if you
interesting capping some more psvr stuff
to the bigger games Farpoint
and impatient are only 15 and a more
recent title bravo team is running for
30
now as for Xbox the advance
announcements they've made about game
deals is a little more vague we'll know
more once the heels actually start but
the big overall header is that a whole
bunch of titles are gonna be up to 75%
off which probably means more like
twenty to forty percent off of the
really actual big-name pedals and then
75% off a lot of other games which are
still great to pick up they have a lot
of stuff listed under here though which
is really awesome a big focus on stuff
that's either first party like 4 to 7 or
sea of thieves but also games that
benefit from xbox one enhancements like
Assassin's Creed origins so there's all
the deals going on right now for III
once again we've got a bunch of link
down below if you want check it out keep
in mind Xbox is going on right now
PlayStation starts tomorrow on the 8th</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
