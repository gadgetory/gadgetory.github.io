so that could be the opening right there
is just like so one question I got a
bunch of although a little different
wording here and there some examples
include do you wish for a Super Smash
Brothers mainly HD port for the switch
what would you like to see on it or
would Smash Brothers come to the
Nintendo switch and there's a lot more
like that melee port force which would
be really cool I doubt it's gonna happen
if we're gonna get a smash game on the
switch one of two things is gonna happen
we're gonna wait for smash five to not
come out til about 2020 because it's
like the same time Yap from all the
other games or next year sometime we'll
see another port for smash for that
maybe gets kind of the same treatment
Mario Kart ain't got we're you know
here's the game here's all the DLC
characters all the DLC stages included
right away and then hopefully maybe some
new stuff added in as well or at least
another set of DLC characters because
there's a lot of stuff that's gotten
more popular since smash 4 first came
out I mean we could add Inklings from
splatoon we could add the main
characters from arms and really well
it's an indie game that's all like every
single platform Nintendo clearly loves
travel light a lot because we now have
not one but four amiibos for the series
so that could honestly be a real
possibility there's also a part of me
that really hopes this Namco helps make
Smash or we could still maybe get Lloyd
from Tales of Symphonia but that's
that's probably not gonna happen that
dream is dead what console controller is
your favorite
alright so without getting into like
crazy third party a pro controller stuff
we're just talking about stock
controllers from all the different
consoles that have been made honestly I
have to go with my favorite being the
current Xbox one controller you know I
think a lot of arguments can be made for
like oh well this controller is a better
d-pad or oh I like the grip better on
this controller but to me the Xbox one
controller is really just the best
balance of everything good grip good
button placement everything feels great
I think it's all around the best
controller choice as kind of an outside
weird one I want to talk about ro though
real quick GameCube controller there was
a lot of stuff wrong with the GameCube
controller but one thing it did that was
really cool was the button placement the
way they did ABXY was weird
different but actually really really
useful when gangs are built around it
and I would love if Nintendo would
actually revisit that not with doing the
whole reproduction line like they did
when Smash Ball came out but actually
making a controller that has some of the
same ideas but redesigned with you know
better grips better shoulder button
design so and so forth
it'd be cool probably not gonna happen
but a guy can dream what are your
thoughts on the latest Red Dead
Redemption 2 trailer do you think it
would be a great single-player
experience or multiplayer will be the
main event
I hope multi players in the main event I
mean don't get me wrong GTA online was a
great idea
I thought the first Red Dead Redemption
the volley player mode was a fun idea
because it really played up the Western
tropes having every match start with a
Mexican standoff but the point of Red
Dead Redemption is to make an awesome
free roam game and even though there
have been a lot of you know open world
free roam stuff lately that's just been
blowing up and getting beaten to death
red Energon was one of the best
executions of that idea and I want more
of that
multiplayer is fine at all but
single-player should be the focus not
multiplayer thoughts on the possibility
that one day we might see a gamecube
classic edition I don't think so and if
it was one day it would be like far far
future I think right now the current of
classics is probably going to end on the
n64 even if it goes that far maybe we'll
see with some mobile ones I don't know
but if they did do a GameCube classic
edition it'd be really interesting for a
few reasons first off there are some
obvious games that would be on it you
know super smash brothers melee Mario
Sunshine
Paper Mario thousand-year door try the
princess Metroid Prime one and two and
maybe some less popular first party
games like starfox adventures but what's
weird about the GameCube is two things
first off this is the first system where
we started seeing a lot more
multi-platform stuff for the Nintendo
and the stuff that was maybe you know
limited time exclusivity like what
happens with something from Capcom like
resin Evil 4 or beautiful Joe also game
Kiba had a couple of really amazing
multiplayer games that require you to
use GBA link meaning a lot of people
didn't actually get to try them out so
if they did do a classic and they found
some other way to do those multiplayer
games that
- GBA link some people could actually
experience them now that would be really
really cool for stuff like you know
Legend of Zelda Four Swords Final
Fantasy crystal Chronicles awesome stuff
would this happen I mean I don't think
even the system's gonna happen but if it
did I'd it'd be awesome
Nintendo please do that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
