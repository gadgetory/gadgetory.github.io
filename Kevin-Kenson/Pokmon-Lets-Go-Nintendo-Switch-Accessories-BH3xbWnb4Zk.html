it we have a ton ton of Pokemon themed
accessories that are coming out from all
major companies some of it is just new
versions of stuffs we've seen before
some are brand new accessories we're
gonna go over some of the coolest to
pick up first let's get the big obvious
one out of the way the poke of all
controllers so this is a special
controller that you can buy specifically
for Pokemon let's go it does not work
for anything else because well it
basically only has three buttons you can
move the stick you can press it in or
you can hit a button on the top and
despite that this actually works really
well for playing Pokemon specifically it
is just enough buttons to be able to
play Pokemon let's go there's a couple
very specific shortcuts are gonna be
missing that remove a little bit
easiness out of menu navigation but as
far as just the pure gameplay goes it
works out great it's really comfortable
and even uses motion controls for the
caching mechanic that once you get the
kind of proper feel down makes it really
really easy to get excellent throws just
hop all that off it does double as a
Pokemon go plus so if you're still
playing the mobile game you can use it
as a way to easily pick up Pokemon stops
and get a few other little bonuses and
has some extra functionality with let's
go like unlocking Mew this is an awesome
little pick up it's not gonna be used
for any games outside of let's go but if
you're a big Pokemon fan I think this is
a really cool collectible next we have
finally a new iteration in one of my
absolute most favorite Nintendo switch
accessories the PDP dock dock so if you
guys haven't seen this talked about this
thing before it is a light-up dock that
you put the regular and into the switch
dock into and it adds these cool little
light-up front plates to it in the past
they had one before that only has two
different plate options there was a
Super Mario to see one and then an
Legend of Zelda breath of the wild one
and they have a new set that comes with
two different Pokemon designs one with
his Pikachu one that I think looks
awesome and alternative choice with a
pokeball print not only do the designs
themselves look really cool but you can
have different light-up effects right
now we're just doing a plain yellow
because I think it looks really good
with Pikachu but you could do different
colors gonna flash different colors and
change over time it makes a really great
aesthetic change to the dock because
honestly the regular Nintendo switch
talk is a little boring if you missed
out on the chance to grab the Pokemon
switch bundle or you didn't want to grab
it because you just already have a
switch this is a great way to
personalize your dock and show your
Pokemon love or the having to spend a
ton of money now there are a lot of
really cool Pokemon themed accessories
Nintendo's no real
releasing both that pokeball controller
and the limited-edition switch set but
something they haven't seen just quite
yet is a pro controller and there is a
way around that for people that love
using pro controllers and want to
celebrate their love Pokemon at the same
time that's a shell exchange this is
something that we've done a dedicated
video in the past of doing a shell
exchange for the pro controller we did
an SNES controller for that time and
this is actually the same controller we
just did another shell exchange and it
is so easy to do I've done a lot of
shell exchanges or were joint cons and
those can be really annoying but pro
controller super simple you just need
the right kind of screwdriver on hand
and a little bit of free time and you
can get done super easily now this is
based on the official limited edition
Pokemon switch design but it is honestly
a knockoff and it really passes the test
really well if you're just kind of
looking over really quickly but if you
do a close inspection you will see some
of the differences the biggest one is
that the print on here well it does look
like the same right idea it's actually
different little figures and it doesn't
even have Eevee on it instead of being
Pikachu an Eevee like on the Nintendo
switch it's pikachu and Pichu something
they did do really well though is that
it's actually really really close to the
right colors for the handles for Eevee
and Pikachu it's just a little bit more
saturated than what's on the switch but
if you're not looking at it side by side
you would never be able to tell if you
picked up the Pokemon switch bundle and
you want a controller to round out the
entire set or if you didn't and you just
really love pokemon and one good-looking
pro controller this is an awesome shell
exchange by the way if you want some joy
Khan's would really show your love for
Pokemon a great way to design some is
using skins from today's sponsor D brand
they below line of skins that are
totally safe to use on your switch for
the joy cons the switch itself and even
the dock for Pokemon specifically I like
using the pair of yellows to have a kind
of Pikachu look or my personal favorites
the red and white to look like a
pokeball if you're interested checking
out any of these check out the link down
below for something a little bit
different so far all the accessories you
talked about are officially licensed
product from Nintendo they're made by
major companies they're things that
we've seen before they're just rebranded
floor Pokemon stuff which is cool but
sometimes you got to turn to fans to
find the really inventive and fun ideas
and a great example is this little guy
we picked this up off of Etsy from a
designer called K design and it is a 3d
printed pokedex
that has two different functions with
the switch first off it has rails on the
side so you can slot a pair of joy
clowns onto them either it's just a way
to transport them as a set or to even
use it as a sort of control grip the
is that you can open it right here to
reveal a little slot that holds for
switch cartridges next up is another
controller option this really isn't for
Pokemon let's go in particular but it is
pokemon themed and really cool and that
is the hoary d-pad controller now if you
haven't caught any my other videos
talking about this this is a joy column
that connects directly to the switch and
handheld mode you can't use it
wirelessly it's not meant for that but
it is a lot cheaper as a result but what
it does is it replaces the directional
buttons with an actual d-pad design
which is a big upgrade for some games
they've released a few different designs
in the past like a Zelda and Mario one I
was a big fan of Zelda won Mario's okay
this is a new option which is focused on
Pikachu putting him at the bottom right
here and then adding lightning bolts
everywhere I think the yellow and black
aesthetic is really awesome really good
addition to the series next up is a
tried and true accessory for every
switch owner and that's a carrying case
this is gonna let you safely carry
around your switch some extra droid cons
maybe the power supply and some games I
feel like this is an immediate go-to for
any switch owner because it gives you
just a little way to indirectly
personalize your switch just for you now
because Pokemon lets goes come out there
are a lot of these new designs coming
out I went for this one specifically to
showcase just because I mean this is a
pretty direct reference to the game and
come on let's go there's Pikachu there's
Eevee there's a whole lot of other ones
out there like with Pikachu alone Eevee
alone there's also a really cool
Charizard one that I almost picked up
instead of this one I'm gonna link all
those down below along with all the
other accessories in this video for you
guys check out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
