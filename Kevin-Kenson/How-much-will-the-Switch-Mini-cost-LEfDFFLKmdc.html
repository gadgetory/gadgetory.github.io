- How much do you think the
Switch mini slash pro will cost?
Thanks!
Heart.
So, I'm not entirely
sure because it depends
on the logic that Nintendo
wants to do with this
and what exactly the role
or a mini or pro will do.
Now this is working off the idea
that mini and pro are happening for sure
these are still very heavily rumored.
Now if they are both happening,
it's not one or the other,
they are happening simultaneously,
I think it's more likely
that the mini is going to
be the more affordable
version of the Switch,
maybe something that only gonna be $200,
at most $250.
And then a pro option, instead
of necessarily being like,
a premium, ultra version that's
going to cost more money
than a regular Switch,
I think it's going to be something
that's a bump up and
replace the regular Switch
line and end up being priced
at the same normal price point of $300.
Now of course there's the possibility
that these are not
things that are happening
simultaneously right now.
I think more likely we're
seeing the mini upfront first.
There's rumor that Nintendo
is working on a new version of the Switch
but that's a little
further ahead in history.
And if that's the case,
a higher price point
is possible if it's not just a refresh
but instead a more serious upgrade.
What's your favorite
video game of all time
and what's your favorite
Nintendo Switch game?
alright, so I have to preface basically
anytime some asks me my favorite,
especially when it comes to games,
I'm terrible at favorites.
This answer will probably change
every time you guys ask me
or atleast it's going to be rotating out
of like the same three
or four possibilities.
For favorite game of all time,
I think I'd have to go
with Chrono Trigger.
That's usually one of my safe answers.
That's just a game that was huge for me.
I'm a big fan of JRPGs
and something about the magic of that game
for it's time on the SNES,
it just hit so many different things well
at the same time.
The music, the visuals for
it's time, the gameplay.
Everything was just so awesome.
Not to mention it was just this dream team
effort of people that
worked on Final Fantasy,
people that worked on Dragon Quest.
Bring all that stuff
together and it just right.
As for Nintendo Switch game,
that's a little tougher 'cause
there's a few different ones I like and
stuff that I've done recently.
This is probably a little
too much of a boring
safe answer but Breath of the Wild.
It's just a really good Zelda game!
I don't know what to tell you.
Like it did such a great job bringing back
that kinda classic approach to Zelda
where it's more of just wander around
and figure stuff out
instead of being a super linear adventure
which was still good about
the other Zelda games
but having that kind
of freedom brought back
and massive explorable area
with mechanics the really
differed from anything
they've done in the series before.
I just love it.
So much.
Sony recently discussed some PS5 specs
like having the fastest
SSD, Ray Tracing support,
8k and so on, which sounds expensive.
How much of a price bump
do you expect over PS4
which launched at $400?
So, here's the thing with console prices.
It's a little hard to figure out right now
based on what Sony's willing to do
but I definitely think it's going to be
more than PS4.
Normally the logic with companies is that
when you're selling systems,
you sell them at a loss.
And sure you're not making
as much as you could
be if you were overpricing them
but you're going to make all of the money
you lose back by people
that buy the system
at that more affordable price point
and then they buy games, controllers,
accessories, all kinds of stuff
and that's where the
real profit comes from.
So with that in mind, while yeah the PS5
sounds really expensive, I don't think
necessarily it's going to be
you're paying the full value
of those parts altogether
but I think it's going
to be more than the PS4.
I hope that it's about $500,
which is definitely more although
not too much crazy more
when you put inflation into account.
But I think it's still
within what a lot of
people would see as,
Yeah, I'll pay that much for a system.
However, with how expensive
everything is starting
to kind of sound, at least base on what
they've been hyping up so far
and the fact that the PS4
has been doing really well
so Sony's kind of riding
that wave of success.
I wouldn't be shocked if
we see a higher price point
I really hope we don't
because if it starts
hitting something like the
$600 price area, that's
gonna be really expensive
and might be a recreation
of the entire problem
that happened with the PS3.
Where it sounded great but
then too high of a price
point scared a lot of people
away, right into the Xbox.
Do you think PlayStation will ever do
another handheld?
That's rough,
'cause the PSVita did
not do great for them.
I mean the PSP wasn't an
amazing success either
but at least did well.
Especially in the states
the PSVita just bombed hard.
And that's not me saying
it was a bad system,
just, no one cared.
So with that in mind,
I feel like right now
Sony's a little scared on focusing on
another platform like that.
Especially how that one ended.
I think we're more
likely going to see them
try to focus a little
more on some of the stuff
they've been actively
been doing with the PS4,
with the concept of remote
play, where it's like,
Hey, you can do this on your phone.
You can do it maybe on tablets
or other kinds of accessories.
Something similar to what Microsoft's been
talking about with their cloud gaming.
But a focus more of using your own system
as a server instead of there being
some other service somewhere.
I don't think it's necessarily completely
impossible that will
never do another handheld,
I just don't see them
being really encouraged
to do so right now 'cause it just has not
worked out for them.
And honestly, I liked
the PlayStation handhelds
I really enjoyed the library on them.
Like I was saying with
like my favorite games,
I love JRPGS and that's
a genre that did really
really well on the PSP
Not quite as much on the Vita
there were a couple good hits
but it was really strong on the PSP.
So, I like those handhelds.
I wouldn't necessarily
mind seeing another one,
I just don't see it in the cards.
By the way, if you're
looking for a way to see
what I'm up to or other
ways to ask me questions,
you can follow me on Twitter,
Instagram and Facebook
all of which are linked down below.
Do you want there to be N64 and Game Cube
games in the Nintendo Switch
online subscription thing?
Yeah!
That'd be cool.
I don't really have a
good reason why I wouldn't
want those things there.
I love a lot of N64 and Game Cube games
I think that while the overall libraries
definitely have have some hit and misses,
the hits that are there are incredible.
If I had a way to play
stuff, like Ocarina of Time
or Starfox 64 on my Switch,
I would absolutely love that.
And Game Cube even more so.
I mean there are a lot of
classics from that system
that are hard or really
expensive to get nowadays,
so if I could play the Fire
Emblem game from Game Cube
on my Switch, awesome!
Super cool!
Do I think Nintendo is going to do that?
I have no idea.
There was a lot of rumor of SNES
games coming to subscription
and then there was
never actually an
announcement about it when we
thought there would be.
And there's been no word since.
So, I don't know.
I don't know when Nintendo is
really planning to do with
their subscription service
in the long run.
I think all of this would be a great idea
to make it a lot more worth it.
I just don't know if it
just the actual steps
they're going to take.
Why do you love the Switch so much?
'cause it's cool? (laughs)
Okay, why do I love the Switch so much?
It's got a great library of games.
It allows me to play
both handheld and on TV.
It's just, it's good.
I'm not really sure if I
should give anymore extra
justification for this.
It's really good.
Do you think Nintendo is
getting ahead of themselves
by releasing, supposedly, two
new Switches: One this year
and one probably next year.
It depends on what exactly
those new Switches are.
I mean if it's something
that's meant to be
a whole new version that
completely changes things
and now you have to get
brand new games that only
work for that version, yes.
I think that's happening
a little too soon.
But if there's are just system refreshes,
this is about the right time.
Especially is you compare
the Switch to Nintendo's
history with 3DS, not
their main line systems,
they would do refreshes
like this pretty quickly.
Especially if all it is
is a slim line version
or something that's supposed
to be a more affordable option.
I mean really, look at
the history of the 3DS.
That system ended up having
basically six different
versions over time
including new versions 2DS
XL, so and so forth.
So with how many times they did that,
in the time span of it's life, the Switch
getting two new versions
starting two years after it
first came out, I don't
think it's that crazy.
What is you favorite
Switch game under $20?
That's harder to do
off the top of my head,
I'm doing all the
questions in the moment so
I need to remember what things cost.
Um, a game that I'm
pretty sure is under 20
it might actually be even under ten.
But I love a lot is
Bloodstained Curse of the Moon.
Now Bloodstained is kind
of a weird situation.
'Cause it's a spinoff game
of a Kickstarter game that
isn't out yet.
If you don't know what it is,
Bloodstained Curse of the Night
was this really successful
kickstarter for a game
from the guy that did
later Castlevania games
and this is his way
of making a new Castlevania
game not under Konami.
Just that with a fresh coat
of paint, different characters
whatever but it's that
same style of of game.
So as a tie in with it,
they had this other company,
AntiqueCreates, who makes
a lot of retro style games
they had to make an even
older style Castlevania
game in the vain of the
ones made for like the NES
called Curse of the Moon.
And it is so, so good.
It's this great, it captures
what was really cool
about those older games.
But also updates and changes
it a little bit to where
it feels a little fresh and new and
a bit more user friendly.
They even have different
difficulty options
so you could play like the
more classic hard difficulty
where if you get hit by an
enemy, you go flying back
and you'll probably fall in a pit
and get really angry
or you can do a more
beginner friendly mode
where you just don't flinch at all
so you're usually safe if you get hurt.
A lot of stuff it did smart
that's' inviting to new people
but awesome for fans of the old stuff.
I cannot recommend it enough.
What other Microsoft games do you think
will be coming to the Nintendo Switch?
well I think the really
heavy empashse here from
Microsoft's standpoint would
be things that make sense
on a platform.
I don't think we're
going to see things like
the new Halo game or Gears
of War make their way to
the Switch because those
games are ones that
really focus on pushing graphic
and it's not going to
translate necessarily very well
to the handheld experience of the Switch.
On the other hand, a lot of
the more indie style focus
Microsoft games as we know,
Cuphead is already coming to it.
I think the Ori series.
There's a lot a potential
there for a lot of games
that make sense on the Switch that just
feel right at home.
There's also the possibility
we're just gonna see
more Microsoft produced
games coming out that embrace
a little bit more of
versatility in the sense.
Because one of the big focuses
at E3 a couple years back was
Microsoft being like, Hey, we're acquiring
all these studios.
There's going to be all this
new stuff in production.
And we didn't really get
any hard news on what that
new stuff was gonna be just yet
but if they're starting to
open up the doors a little
bit more to where their
games are gonna start
being on other platforms.
A lot of the stuff in development might be
focusing less on huge AAA productions with
the shiniest graphics possible
but instead be smaller,
focused experiences along
the line of what Cuphead
and Ori have done.
Could you show the
curved joycons with them
attached to the Switch?
Sure?
Rich can you go grab that?
I'm gonna just wait here for joycons.
(joycons clicking)
Is that all I need to do?
Next question!
Do you think Cuphead/Mugman
with be in Smash?
I really hope so.
I think there's a lot of
possibilities of who could
make their way over to
Smash based on the DLC we
have so far.
I mean, just looking at
the fact that we just
recently got Joker, the
only confirmed DLC character
that's a really out there choice
I mean there's no actual
official Persona game
on the Switch just yet.
We are getting the Dynasty Warriors
style one which will be on the system
but actual straight up Persona
five, is not on the Switch
And before we get any game
at all, he's already made
a presence in it.
That opens up a lot of
possibilities of who can get added.
If we do get some kind of representative
for Microsoft, I think Cuphead
would be a perfect choice.
So much of it rights itself right away
You have Mugman as an alternate skin,
they both have like a
black and white version,
mixed in a couple of
colors for other choices
Their moveset can kinda
be similar to Megaman,
there are a lot of ranged
moves that work as regular
attacks, then they can have
their own spin on stuff.
A lot of it is simple and straightforward.
If we didn't get Cuphead or Mugman,
I would still hope there
was some sort of cool
Microsoft crossover 'cause I think that
just open up the roster
even more in ways that
would really shock people.
I think a kind of runner up
would possibility could be
Ori, also rumored to be
making it's way to Switch
at some point.
That would also be really cool.
But, I just like the idea
of something Microsoft
in general coming to Smash.
Does Sega do what Nintendon't?
It did at one point.
I mean, I guess it's
doing it at this point
'cause there's not actually
a console around anymore.
Fun fact about this line though!
Because i was just recently
studying about the console war
about SNES verse Genesis.
At the time, when they
were releasing the Genesis
and they got a new head for
Sega West, which was Kalinski,
the Sega head at the
time hated the phrase,
&quot;It does what Nintendon't&quot;
And this was made by
the guy before Kalinski
and the reason why the Sega guy hated was
because, what does that
even actually mean?
It's this phrase that's kinda catchy
and does have kind of
a coolness factor to it
but it only really works
when you're actually
beating the opponent.
Not when you're trying to just trying to
compete against them and
not really known yet.
And in fact, he made the joke of,
What does it do that Nintendon't?
Does it not sell?
And Nintendo does?
Is that how the slogan works?
Because we're not selling yet.
As for whether or not it
does what that don't anymore,
we have a new Sonic game coming out
and I guess Nintendo
doesn't do that directly?
But they're getting it.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
