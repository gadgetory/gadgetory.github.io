options for wireless Nintendo switch
controllers and we even interesting one
to talk about today there's been a lot
of controllers in the past we've talked
about from 8-bit do they make a line to
different bluetooth ones are all styled
off of classic retro Nintendo stuff and
one of their big hits is this one right
here the NES 30 Pro well there soon
releasing an upgraded version called the
NES 30 Pro 2
now at first glance you might not be
able to notice that much of a difference
between these two outside of the slight
change in how they represent the
original NES style wise but there's
actually a lot that's going on
differently on the inside of this one
that makes it honestly a major upgrade
and a lot of them point to one very
specific purpose being better on the
switch now like the previous NES 30 pro
this is still just a straight-up
Bluetooth controller you can use it
across a whole bunch of different
devices Mac's pcs iOS Android but the
main purpose here for this one really
design-wise is to make it just an even
better fit for the switch and it
actually has some features that makes it
very competitive against other wireless
controllers currently on the market
first off as far as the only functional
external change you can notice right
away this uses a USB C port instead of
micro USB so it's bringing it in line
with the entire line of Nintendo
products if you own a USB the USBC
adapter which you might use for certain
controllers or charging stations that
will work with this or you can even
unplug your switch dock and use the
charge the controller as well so you
don't need to carry around any kind of
different cable like you would for the
previous model also while I'm currently
showing off the main nes design this one
does come in four different colors this
one based on the nes another design
based on the n64 with the green and blue
button with a couple of yellow buttons
as well a GameCube inspired controller
which has that nice little indigo purple
finish with yellow sticks which looks
really nice and then one that took me a
little bit of time to figure out is a
black design with great trim and purple
start and select buttons this is
actually going a little against the
grain instead of being a Nintendo based
design it's based on the Sega Mega Drive
controller so that's only up going on
the outside but what's different on the
inside is what really makes this a major
upgrade especially for the switch it
offers three new functions the previous
controller could not do motion controls
so you can use it for games that make
use of those like for instance aiming a
bow and Legend of Zelda Rumble which is
a really interesting fact because not
many wireless controllers for the switch
actually support Rumble outside of the
official switch pro controller and also
a turbo button feature because come on
you always have that one for retro
controller so with all that mine let's
actually test it out and see how it
handles so before we actually start
playing on switch we have to get this
actually connected to it which is really
simple you start by putting the
controller in switch mode as opposed to
putting it in modes for Android or Mac
or whatever and you do that by hitting
start and y at the same time once you've
done that you just have to make sure
you're on your switches controller
connection screen hit and hold the sync
button and we're good to go
also by the way once you have actually
synced this with your switch it will
remember that connection so whenever you
want to use it
just make sure a switch is running hit
start turning on and you're good to go
so I know we've played this a ton on the
channel every time we test something out
but it makes a lot of sense I'm gonna
play Zelda with this controller that way
I can test out the motion controls as
well as see how the rumble feels yeah
this is a lot like the n30 the original
one in that you know the missing the
grips hurts a little bit but outside of
that I mean all the buttons everything
feel really good
sticks are nice and tight so first let's
try it the motion controls so pull up my
bow make sure they're on and yeah that
feels just like using the regular switch
pro controller so that works that's good
to know
let's see how the rumble feels let's go
find something to hit and just see how
well the remote motors feel in this
controller but yeah okay so the
vibrating this does feel pretty solid
it's not quite as heavy as you're gonna
see in a lot of big-name controllers I
feel like you know the Xbox one Rumble
or even the switch programs Roller it's
definitely a heavier one but for being a
cheaper controller option that has a
rumble motor it is pretty good now one
other function this controller does have
is that you can turn on a turbo function
however that does not work for the
switch specifically that's only limited
to other systems like using it on a PC
or phone if you are using on those you
wanna make use of the stripper button
all you have to do is hit and hold the
button you want to use it with and then
hold the start button boom it's
activated but for switch it is not an
option
so all the new functions work pretty
well and this is definitely an upgrade
over the original n30 pro but where does
it stand in comparison to other wireless
switch pro controller options well
honestly surprisingly pretty high first
off it has one major benefit in his
favor and that is the fact that it is
the cheapest option out there as far as
wireless controller options go the
official Nintendo switch pro controller
is 70 bucks
sometimes 6 easy to find a little on
sale the power a wireless controller and
their GameCube controllers 50 bucks this
stands at a nice cool 40 you not to buy
any other accessories to make it work
this does is designed to work with a
switch directly really easily and it
will say despite the fact this is the
cheapest option out of that group the
buck equality on it is really good I
like the shoulder buttons I like the
front facing buttons I like the sticks
they have a nice little tightness to
them the only part that feels a little
low to me is the d-pad and there's a
reason for that a Punto is really
obsessed with this idea of retro
controllers and recapturing nostalgia
and as part of that the d-pad on this
controller is designed to feel a lot
like an old-school d-pad for better or
worse it feels great if you grew up
playing those controllers but as time
has gone
options have gotten better so it's not
the best d-pad out there but if you've
grown up playing an old-school
controllers this is gonna feel very much
like home one aspect of it that I think
it does fall short compared to the other
options though is the grips because this
is once again designed to kind of look
and feel a little bit like an old-school
controller which is cool but it's
missing something is kind of standard
these days which is well actual grips to
put your hands on as a result for long
periods of gameplay it's just not quite
as comfortable I think they did a good
job of making the styled controller work
comfort wise because these kind of
rounded sides here
really kind of fit to your hands and
feels a little nicer but it's still not
quite as good as a more well currently
traditional grip design that being said
for being a forty dollar controller
you're getting the benefit of not only
Wireless but it's also going to be
giving you motion controls and aside
from the official Nintendo switch pro
controller this is the only controller
option out there right now that's gonna
give you Rumble which is a surprising
fact and really cool for the money I
think this is a great pick up it walks a
really good balance between being
something that offers a very nostalgic
look and feel something that old-school
fans are going to appreciate but at the
same time offers all the buttons and
functions you need to make sure you get
the absolute most out of all your switch
games as well as any other devices you
want to use this on close once again it
is a Bluetooth controller you can still
use this on phones PC Mac whatever not
to mention this
look really cool</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
