to start bringing us more content and
one of the ways I plan on doing that is
i'm gonna start covering a lot more
indie games particularly those that are
available on PC through Steam and today
I'm going to talk about crypt of the
necrodancer now first off just to be
clear this is a game that is still in
early access meaning that it is not a
complete game just yet so this isn't
exactly a full review because well i
don't have my hands on the final product
instead this is just a look at how the
game is currently shaping up what kind
of condition it's currently in and
whether or not it's worth playing waltz
and early access or if you should at
least keep an eye on it for when it gets
fully released later sometime this year
now that we've gotten that out of the
way what is crypt of the necrodancer
well this is a fusion of two very
popular genres in the indie scene with a
very unique sort of flavor and that's
the combination of rhythm games and
roguelikes the basic idea is that you
have to explore and survive a number of
randomly generated dungeon floors all
the while only being able to move and
act along with the beat of whatever
music is currently playing hitting a key
off beat will cause zero movement and
failing to maintain movement with the
rhythm will lose you a valuable coin
multiplier allowing you to get high
scores and more gold for useful
equipment what's beautiful about this
game is its mixture of simplicity and
complexity controlling the lead hero
navigating the dungeon is done with just
the directional keys attacking enemies
consists of just moving into them and
using items or spells is the result of
hitting a combination of two directions
so the whole game is played through just
four buttons or if you have one on hand
can even be played using a dance pad now
that being said while the control method
is really simple there's a whole lot of
different mechanics going on here that
make the entire experience a lot more
complex playing the regular version of
the game consists of enemies that move
along with the beat all of which have
patterns that you can learn and figure
out how to predict making it possible to
get through whole floors without taking
any damage if you're careful but in the
hecticness of staying on beat this can
become a lot harder than it sounds along
with encountering and dealing with a
number of enemies and boss Type monsters
dungeon floors will also consist of
traps different kinds of movement tiles
and treasure chests that contain a
number of different useful items such as
one time use healing items spells that
cool down equipment that reduces damage
or alters how you move
or new weapons which not only modify how
much damage you deal but what squares
you attack as well for instance the
spear allows you to hit enemies that up
to two squares away rather than just one
right up front while the broadsword hits
a line of three squares in front of you
and they even come with various
different special properties like glass
weapons that deal more damage but break
when you get hit or blood weapons that
drain health with every so many enemy
kills each floor will also host a single
merchant room who will have three
different random items on sale which can
be purchased with gold gain from killing
enemies and do also features by far one
of the game's best little flavorful
bonuses singing along with the original
soundtrack of each level now speaking of
the soundtrack this is of course one of
the most important aspects of any rhythm
based game and thankfully crypt of the
necrodancer is absolutely fantastic each
song is memorable and enjoyable
especially when the merchant is thrown
into the mix and there's a steady
progression in speed between each floor
and song that just feels natural the
game also does give you the option of
uploading your own music and assigning
songs to individual levels with it
adjusting the beat of each level to fit
the song now it's a nice little feature
and I'm glad they made an option for
those you out there that like to use
your own music with rhythm based games
but in all honesty I really personally
preferred playing this game with its
base soundtrack there's just this really
great natural progression that it has
and if you don't use the base soundtrack
you lose out on that awesome little fun
bonus of the merchant singing along now
the customizable music is just one of
the many bits that really makes up one
of this game's biggest strengths the
sheer number of options that it provides
you with along with just playing the
regular game you also have the ability
to play a hardcore mode with no upgrades
available and having to deal with every
single floor one after another and
there's a daily challenge mode to try
and ranked in top scores there's also
side rooms that let you practice
fighting certain monsters so you know
how to better handle them when you
encounter them in the dungeon and
there's even local co-op so you and a
friend can try to tackle the crypt
together the game also offers multiple
playable characters but only some of
them being currently available so far
since as I said earlier the game is
still in early access now some of these
characters just offer a more difficult
version of the base game while others
can completely change it for instance
the bard whose movements dictate the
beat rather than the other way around
which in all honesty is basically the
super easy mode of this game so to sum
things up the
really two things that make crypt of the
necrodancer a great game so far first
off it's simple yet really addictive and
really unique form of gameplay and
second off just the sheer number of
options the game gives you in terms of
its customizable music all the different
game modes to try out and just the
number of different items you can try
out with each randomly generated run
also it's worth noting the difficulty of
this game is just plain unforgiving the
first level by itself isn't all that bad
as you learn the basics but each new
level after that ramps up the difficulty
big-time giving you a great challenge to
try and complete it as I said earlier
this is an early access game so there's
still some work that needs to be done
here we don't have the fourth and final
level just yet and a number of playable
characters are still missing but what's
completed so far is excellent I
personally find it to already be worth
its asking price of $15 on steam if
you're still unsure that though or you
just aren't a fan of buying early access
stuff this is definitely a game to keep
on your radar for its full release date
planned for sometime later this year so
that was just a look at crypt in the
necrodancer and how it's currently
shaping up in its early access stages if
