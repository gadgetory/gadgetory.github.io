keyboards on the switch but today
something a little bit different and
takes it a bit of a step farther this is
the game serve VX same switch now
gamester has made a number of keyboards
like this that are paired with mice that
are used for PC and mobile but the VX is
different in that it actually works on
ps3 ps4 Xbox one and the switch now when
I say this works on the switch I don't
mean it in the same sense that we've
talked before with keyboards where you
can hook up to the switch and use it for
typing which doesn't really a whole lot
of use in the u.s. right now there
aren't any games that need that this
actually Maps itself on your switch and
works like a regular controller enabling
you to play games with a keyboard and
mouse setup now we're going to talk
about the full possible ramifications of
something like this a little later but
for now let's just look at the product
itself so this is the left half of a
keyboard you can use it just for your
left hand and has all the buttons you
need along with these four buttons here
on the side no wonder these are used for
is for adjusting the sensitivity of the
mouse for whether you're doing hip
shooting or for aiming down sights
specifically the idea is this is what
it's being used for in first-person
shooter games so when you're not holding
down the aim button this button here is
going to affect how easy it is to look
around and move with the mouse whereas
if you are holding down lean button
these ones doing adjust the sensitivity
while you're in that mode meanwhile the
mouse side you have all the traditional
setups here we have the left and right
click a center scroll wheel I can also
click down to side buttons which are
normally mapped to the front shoulder
buttons on the most controllers and then
there's also a dpi adjustment back here
the build quality on both of these is
pretty solid and in fact the keyboard
itself actually uses blue mechanical
switches so it's giving you that little
bit of push back and that very
satisfying clickety clack sound now
setting this up is very simple it varies
a little bit from system to system and
the switch in particular is actually one
of the easiest ones that you can do all
you need to take is the wireless dongle
attachment that comes with this plug it
into the switch put the keyboard into
switch mode and that's it you're done
now I've only played with this enough to
really make sure that it works that the
setup is working properly and that I can
use it on the switch let's go ahead and
actually do a real test and try it out
in fortnight
all right so we're in a match before we
start dealing with having to survive
other players real quick for this setup
that I'm using I'm just using the preset
key configuration this guy has you can
customize it using a separate mobile app
but by default the layout actually for
the most part makes sense I don't know
it's gonna apply to every single game
you try but everything I've done so far
it works well but of course you can
always find tune for personal preference
yeah moving the mouse action feels
pretty natural it doesn't you don't have
the same sense of like actual mouse
acceleration because it's just acting
like a control stick but yeah that feels
not weird
now as weird as it should be wow that
person is you're really not good you
definitely use this guy for a while
before feeling really comfortable
because even when your brain is like
yeah you just have to press like B to
pick something up or it's not B it's
like X but you see that prompt if you
have been using this long enough it's
like wait which key is that again but I
mean it's all very snappy and responsive
I'm playing right now and nothing it
doesn't feel like there's any real input
lag I have good refined control of just
looking around I'm honestly really
surprised that this is going something
as I did I really expected there to be
some kind of more noticeable input lag
or I don't know just more confused on
part but it's it really works I need to
find more people it feels like it I mean
there's maybe a tiny tiny bit of input
lag but it's pretty minor and honestly
that's probably more due to the TV we're
using than this okay so I finally died
and I'm still not very good at for
tonight but the important point here is
while I was alive and still playing this
felt normal
like entirely like if I didn't know that
I was on a switch this just felt like a
standard keyboard and mouse setup and
that any problems I mean I had a few mix
ups with my inputs where I would forget
which key was bound to which switch
input but once kind of just getting that
stuff you know just through repetition I
just felt like playing normally there
wasn't any kind of real input lag or
weird issues at all even just looking
around and using what the mouse
felt fine and even if it develop a stood
still adjust it on the fly with these
buttons over here like using something
like this isn't going to just flat-out
make you better at a game because you
still need to know how to play properly
and have proper awareness and map
knowledge but as far as just helping
with the straight abuse of aiming moving
fire
I mean this felt better for sure now of
course we can't talk about a product
like this without bringing up a pretty
big issue that a lot of people have
which is the debate of whether or not
using something like this a keyboard a
mouse for consul is considered cheating
in a competitive game I mean if you want
to buy this to use on your switch with
Skyrim playing single-player great go
for it do what you want to do but if
you're playing something like Ford
Knight is that an unfair advantage and
is it technically cheating there are
some very heated arguments about this
very idea and what it mostly boils down
to is the idea of is it just another
expensive product that's giving you an
advantage like anything else you can get
I mean after all people can get
advantages by buying nicer headphones
using a better monitor or TV using a pro
controller instead of a standard one is
this just another step in that same kind
of logic and after all there are a lot
of games out there that are even now
supporting cross play if you're playing
fortnight on switch but you're going
against people on PC that are using
keyboards why can't you - where this can
get a little dicey though is the fact
that you're using keyboard and mouse on
a platform that's designed to well
honestly handicap players a little bit
because they are traditional using
controllers oftentimes causal versions
of games do have some degree of an
assist to help bounce at the fact that a
control stick is not as precise as a
mouse so if you're playing a console
version of a game while still getting
the precision of a mouse is that unfair
now me personally I do lean towards the
idea that if you are using something
like this for a online competitive game
you're not doing it just for fun you're
not doing it in single-player stuff yeah
that is a pretty significant advantage
in borders on cheating but the
circumstances of that are starting to
change because once again the whole
problem with this isn't that you're
using a really good controller it's that
you're using a controller that has this
kind of precision while still having the
benefits of handicaps built into the
game for you know traditional
controllers so if we hit the point where
Morgan's starting to embrace the idea of
using a keyboard and mouse and just gets
rid of those benefits then something
like this is honestly supercool and
you're already seeing this start to
happen with a lot of other systems I
mean Xbox specifically is already
running a program where you can use
keyboards on the Xbox one and you can
use it too for specific games that are
designed to allow it to be used right
now that is only warframe but that list
will supposedly increase with time and
to me that's something that's really
exciting because I love the idea of
being able to embrace using all
different kinds of controllers on
console not just traditional ones don't
game
I love using a traditional game pad and
I still use it and most the time because
I find it to be the most comfortable
especially if I just want to play
something really laid-back but if I'm
doing something competitive why not use
something that's more precise tool I
mean after all if I'm playing a fighting
game I'm gonna use a fight stigma at the
time not a game pad why can't that apply
to FPS games as well either way this is
a really cool little keyboard mouse
combo it was super easy to set up it was
really easy to switch between using it
on the switch versus the ps4 or the Xbox
one I think it's a really handy
controller it's just whether or not you
feel completing in a competitive game
single-player awesome pick this thing up
multiplayer let us know let me know down
below in the comments what do you think
is achievement you something like this
is it not cheating why let us know see
you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
