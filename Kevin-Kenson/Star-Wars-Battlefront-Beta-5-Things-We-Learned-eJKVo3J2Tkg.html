this past Thursday and is going to be
wrapping up really soon so I want to
talk about five things that really stood
out to me while I played it starting
with how this game is not like a
battlefield now don't get me wrong there
is some influence from the Battlefield
series on this game because obviously
it's being developed by the same people
dice but there are a lot of ways that
this makes huge changes from how
battlefield works which personally is
actually kind of relieving to me because
my biggest fear for this game is that it
was just gonna be another battlefield
game with a Star Wars skin thrown over
it and depending on who you are this is
either really good news or sounds like
an absolutely terrible idea
for a lot of reasons in general really
the game is just a lot more arcadey in
its design you don't have any ammo for
your guns instead they can just overheat
temporarily if you fire too much you
don't have any kind of secondary weapons
or gear that have limited uses instead
you have abilities that all act on
cooldowns which could be pulling out a
specialized weapon like a sniper rifle
or grenade launcher for a single shot
using something like a grenade or even
mobility based abilities like using a
jump pack there's also the fact that
most of the big interactable things you
can do on a map like using a vehicle or
playing as a hero are based on power-ups
you pick up rather than something you
interact with and they randomly spawn on
the map and to top off these two is the
fact that in general the game has a lot
of toned down mechanics that make it a
bit more casual for instance there is no
recoil in any of the guns you can only
Crouch not go prone and doing so doesn't
increase your accuracy and where your
respawn is completely random unless you
choose to respawn with your partner all
this ends up making the game something
very different from battlefield in a way
that makes it a lot more open to people
that don't want to really have a steep
learning curve they just want to jump in
and have a lot of fun in really one of
the most beloved universes from film but
if you're a fan of battlefield or you
want something that's a little more
recognizable to modern-day FPS games
you're not gonna find that here at all
now that being said I do have some
pretty big problems with this beta
starting off with point number two
vehicles I absolutely hate the way
vehicles control in this game it's
sluggish awkward and nothing really
handles the way you'd expect it to it's
impossible to get the hang of
controlling a vehicle but it's
definitely far from intuitive which is a
real shame because honestly one of the
biggest things I look forward to in this
game was using starships because growing
my favorite Star Wars games were stuff
like Rogue Squadron or even older with
x-wing vs. TIE fighters so finding that
using vehicles like TIE fighters or a
wings controlled the way they do it was
just a big turn-off for me in this beta
now there is one other big problem I had
with this beta but it is one that dice
has addressed and has said they are
trying to fix which is the balance
issues in the Walker assault mode now
I'm a big fan of asymmetric game design
where two teams compete and don't
necessarily have the exact same
objectives trying to work with what
strengths and weaknesses they have on
each side but the thing about asymmetric
game design is that it is a bit trickier
to balance which is exactly the problem
DICE ran into playing on the Imperial
side you have a pair of 88 es that are
just raining destruction on the
rebellion you have access to more
vehicles like 80 STS and the rebellion
doesn't really have anything great going
for them on the other side they don't
even really have a huge terrain
advantage going on so while it's not
necessarily impossible for the rebellion
to win it's not very likely and assuming
that both teams are equal in skill the
Empire just has so much more going for
them now like I said earlier dice has
admitted this is a problem and they are
going to fix it for the launch of the
game but at the same time it's still a
little worrisome that they thought the
way it was before was okay and it kind
of brings up this worry that other game
modes are gonna have the same issue on
launch day hopefully not but what we saw
from this beta isn't exactly the most
encouraging now I didn't walk away with
nothing but complaints because there is
one thing I really really do love about
this beta and that's point number 4 the
attention to detail as a gamer I
definitely have some misgivings about
the mechanics we're seeing in this beta
but as a Star Wars fan I absolutely love
everything I've seen the amount of work
that dice put into recreating the Star
Wars universe in a video game is nothing
short of excellent and it's not just a
matter of creating planets we've seen
before as maps to play on or making sure
that each side is wearing the right
costumes it's all the little things it's
how all the characters were holding or
using their weapons it's how they're
running it's what kind of animations
they have when they get hit it's how 80s
teas have their heads explode no matter
what kind of damage they took right
before dying
what makes this attention to detail even
better it's just how much is happening
on the screen at all times it's not just
limited to what you're doing in the
battle there's tons of little
environmental effects happening like
dust clouds rocks falling down or things
happening the distance like seeing an
epic starship battle happen right above
you dice has done an
excellent job of taking such a
well-known film universe and condensing
into an experience that feels extremely
familiar now my last point point number
five is a little more awkward because
it's not really based on something I
experienced in the beta directly it's
more something that the beta made me
realize and that's how much I'm going to
miss a campaign mode in this game now
this is a weird argument for me to make
because for the most part in most FPS
games I could care less if there's a
single-player campaign and oftentimes I
prefer if there isn't one because a lot
of times it just feels like a six hour
long tutorial that had some minimal
amount of investment into it that could
have instead gone towards making the
multiplayer even better the thing is
part of the reason why is usually a
problem in other games is cuz they're
trying to create their own characters
their own settings their own plot lines
to where with this there's a
well-established universe and a lot of
material to work with to make levels
where you're playing as soldiers from
each side living through some of the
major battles now given that is kind of
what you're doing in multiplayer mode
but it'd be really great to also see
this kind of thing used in a
single-player campaign because it's been
a while since we've had a really good
Star Wars game and having one that also
meets the expectations of fans of
single-player games just what has been
really great to have and we're not gonna
have that instead you have these offline
single-player co-op modes that just
consist of surviving against waves of
enemies which is nice to have as an
alternative to online multiplayer if
you're having any problems to playing
online or you just want a way to
practice your skills a little bit
without dying constantly on the internet
but at the same time it's kind of a
paltry thing compared to having a real
full campaign so those are my thoughts
on these Star Wars Battlefront beta both
the good and bad thankfully what
problems that you have with the game are
things that can be fixed in time for the
launch on November 17th and hopefully
they do while the things I did enjoy
would take a considerable amount of work
to redo and thankfully doesn't need it
as always if you guys enjoyed the video
hit that thumbs up button to let me know
I'll be seeing you soon with more
content including a full review of
battlefront when it comes out in
November until then though if you don't
want to miss out on any videos make sure
to subscribe and I'll see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
