hitting the year-and-a-half mark since
the ps4 and Xbox one first came out with
the Wii U basically having an extra year
on top of that and in that time a lot of
things have changed that might change
your idea about which system is right
for you you know we've had more
exclusive game releases system updates
new functionalities price drops bundles
temporary sales all kinds of stuff that
might change your idea about which
system is just right for you what's up
internet Kevin here and I just want to
bring you guys a little update on the
current state of the eighth generation
of gaming consoles and before we start
talking about the nitty-gritty of what's
different about each system which one
might be right for you let's look at how
they've all been performing so far now
looking at just hard sales at the end of
last month the ps4 is sitting at the top
and worldwide sales with 20 point 2
million units sold Xbox one is in second
place with 11.6 million and the Wii U in
third with 9.3 now there's a few reasons
for why there's such a big disparity
outside of just you know which one
people tend to like more looking at the
Wii U first we use always been in this
kind of awkward place since the last
generation as far as Nintendo goes
because there's this whole idea where a
lot of people treat the Wii as a
secondary system because they view it as
being the more kiddie option you know
it's one meant more for families and
because the view isn't that much cheaper
than the other two systems like the Wii
was it just hasn't been selling as
strongly not only that though but well
it's been out a whole extra year there
really wasn't a whole lot going on that
first year we didn't see a lot of games
that people were super excited for which
did change this past year and the Wii
you saw a much bigger boom in sales
during the last quarter of 2014 thanks
to things like Mario Kart 8 and Super
Smash Brothers coming out meanwhile for
ps4 and Xbox one well there's a few
reasons for that first off to kind of
defend xbox a little bit the ps4 has
been available in more regions and for
longer and many of them with the
exception of China where the Xbox ones
now for about half a year while the ps4
is just about to come out this month now
despite that fact even though it's been
available more places 8 million units is
a really appreciable difference in sales
and it's more than just the fact that
it's available more places because even
if you look at individual countries the
ps4 has been outselling and there's a
few reasons why first off back when the
Xbox one was first coming out it was
released at a whole hundred dollars
higher than the ps4 because you had to
get it in a bundle
with a Kinect which thankfully now
there's a Kinect 'less bundle where
you're paying the same price you would
for a ps4 which is four hundred dollars
meanwhile there's also the fact that
during the Xbox one launch there was a
whole lot confusion about what kind of
DRM restrictions it was going to have
several different Microsoft employees
were saying different things no one
really knew what was going on and it
just made a lot of people angry and in
the end Microsoft did pull back a lot of
those restrictions but the damage was
already done to the reputation and it
really hurts those initial sales now
once that calmed down and healed up
another problem came up where it became
really clear that between the two
systems ps4 Xbox one the ps4 is
definitely the more powerful system
because we're seeing multi-platform
games released on both of them where the
ps4 version had 1080p resolution and the
Xbox one version was sitting at 720p so
for people that were debating which
system to get for those big
multi-platform titles
well ps4 started getting a big win so
yeah just looking at how they've so far
performed the ps4 has been the more
popular system not necessarily the
better system for you personally but
it's the one that more people have
gravitated towards so let's start
looking at what each system now has to
offer you now since they've been
released there have been a lot of
patches for each system which have
helped to close some of the gaps and
differences between them and create new
ones both the Xbox one and ps4 can do
things like take screenshots record
gameplay to upload or just live stream
to twitch but just few areas where they
have started to divert first off the
Xbox one which has shown a much heavier
emphasis on media and social apps you
know all four systems offer the core
media apps of YouTube Hulu Netflix and
Amazon Instant Video but overall the
Xbox one does have a greater array of
additional pay-per-view programs so if
you're really looking for a specific
movie or TV show you want to watch and
rent Xbox one is going to more likely
have that for you as far as social
options go right at launch the Xbox one
is the only system to offer Skype but it
also now has the option to do friend
suggestions so if there's a gamer that
all of your gaming buddies have in
common that you haven't added yet it
might be a friend of yours and Xbox ones
going to recommend it to you so overall
they've put a much heavier emphasis on
social functions and using it as an
overall multimedia device the ps4 on the
other hand has been focusing a lot more
on gaming functionalities you know back
at launch they had that whole thing
where you could use the PS Vita to play
ps4 games remotely as long as we're
nearby the ps4 but more recently there's
been a new function that's really
awesome those still a little rough
around the edges and that's share play
the idea behind share play is that if
two people own a ps4 and one of them has
a game that the other one wants to try
well you can remotely log into a session
where you're basically pretending like
you're playing a game locally you can
switch off who's actively playing the
game or if the game has some kind of
local co-op option you can play the game
together provided depending on the
situation either one of you or both of
you has to has a PlayStation Plus
account now as I said a little rough
around the edges still it's not perfect
the person that's remotely playing is
going to experience a little bit of lag
which depending on the game is either
bearable or a death sentence and for
whatever reasons share play sessions
only lasts 60 minutes apiece so if
you're trying to do a more extended
playtime session with your buddy you're
gonna have to constantly reset play
share every hour which will just start
to wear thin now meanwhile the Wii U
while it's beginning a lot of stability
updates really hasn't gotten that many
interesting new functionalities you know
they've been giving you ways to
reorganize folders and you know better
ways to use a quick Start menu on the
Wii U but overall basically offers the
same functions we saw right at the start
like being able to use the Wii U tablet
to play certain games directly instead
of having to use the TV screen or having
television integration now one other
thing I want to mention about the
system's themselves is the fact that
while the ps4 and Xbox one both require
you to have a paid membership to play
games online both of those memberships
now come with free monthly games now on
average the ps4 has been getting more
free games every month usually between
two and three
well the Xbox one gets about one or two
but if you look at individual titles
there is an occasional difference in
value
you know the ps4 is almost always
different digital or indie titles that
are 15 to 20 bucks maybe scraping at 30
while the Xbox one occasionally has
offered games that are normally 40 or
even 60 bucks as an example this month
they're giving Rayman legends which is a
game that when it was launched was 60
bucks and even now cost 40 bucks to get
digitally so while the ps4 has given
more games overall value wise it kind of
balances out now speaking of free games
this is really the one thing I've always
emphasized about which system is right
for you
what exclusive titles each system has to
offer as well as what titles your
friends are interested in so you can
make sure you all get the same system to
play together now I can't of course help
you with which system your friends
bought but I can let you know about what
games are exclusive to which one
starting with the Wii U because the Wii
U is kind of the odd man out
you know in many ways the WiiU has the
largest number of exclusives that are
only for it and honestly in my opinion
or some of the best games but it also
misses out a lot of other games that are
available on basically everything else
you know there's a large number of
multi-platform titles that don't make
their way to the Wii U because it's just
a weaker system than the other two you
know we're talking about some of the
biggest sellers of last year like
destiny called duty advanced warfare and
Lord Rings shadow of Mordor but in the
meantime there's still a lot of really
strong exclusives that are only for the
Wii U like I said last year was one of
their strongest we finally got Mario
Kart 8 and super smash brothers for Wii
U both which are excellent games along
with other titles like Hyrule warriors
Bayonetta 2 captain toad treasure
tracker lots of really strong exclusives
that not only have been a little more
family-friendly but also offer some of
the best local multiplayer options out
of any of the systems you know I've
owned all three systems since they've
each been launched and as far as what
I've used the most with friends the Wii
U's come up a lot more because there's
more options for games you can play
together as a group and not just have to
do things on and separately now as for
the ps4 and Xbox one like I said there's
a lot of multi-platform games that are
available to both of them and not the
Wii U but also like I said earlier on
average the ps4 version is the
better-looking version so that is a
point in their favor now looking at
games that are exclusive to them there's
basically three big titles for each that
stand out to me that have been released
so far on the Xbox one we had Dead
Rising 3 at launch widget is a fantastic
game though it did get ported to PC
later titanfall which was a huge boost
for Xbox one sales also though once
again available on PC as well and then
the last and in some ways the least game
despite my wishing sense it overdrive
which is completely exclusive to Xbox
one and is in my opinion a great game
but also just didn't sell very well it's
barely even scrapped 500,000 sales which
isn't a great sign for how long it's
been out meanwhile on the ps4
we had kills on at launch which a lot of
people picked up because it was the one
big game right away for ps4 but honestly
kinda mediocre later on early last year
we got infamous second son which is a
great game completely exclusive for ps4
and honestly one of my favorite games of
the new generation of consoles and last
but definitely least at least in my
opinion is the order 1886 which just
came out and has been selling quite well
but got really scaling response from a
lot of reviewers myself included because
wallet is a very pretty game what
content is there and
which there is just isn't really worth
paying 60 bucks for now of course those
are just the big triple-a titles that
each system has been pushing there's
been a lot of Indian digital titles as
well they each have their own little
handful that we use got shovelknight
which is a great retro style platformer
the Xbox one just got Ori in the blind
forest which I've been playing and
loving and back at launch it at killer
instinct which is a great return to an
old-school fighter but as far as Indian
digital games go I have to give the win
to ps4 because it just has the largest
number of them now once again a lot of
them are on PC as well but if you're a
pure console gamer then the ps4 is going
to offer some of these strongest indie
titles to come out in the past couple of
years including stuff like transistor
mercenary Kings rogue legacy don't
starve and many many more a lot of which
have been free games on the PlayStation
Plus membership so for Triple A games
they all have their wins personally I
like the Wii U the most but there's a
lot of multi-platform use it misses out
on that the ps4 and Xbox one both get
and when it comes to indie titles ps4
just wins hands down for me now of
course each system has only been around
for about a year and a half I mean we
use had an extra year on top of that but
it was a really slow year that basically
just doesn't count so they're all still
really early in their life cycles and
there's a lot more games coming out that
can change your opinion about which one
you want so let's take a look at some of
the biggest ones to come out later this
year starting off with the Wii U again
we have Mario Party 10 later this month
in May we've got splatoon which is
Nintendo's attempt to do a competitive
team vs. team game except instead of
filling each other with bullets you're
just covering the balls with paint and
sometime this year we're going to get
Xenoblade Chronicles X for those of you
that are JRPG fans a new starfox game
which sounds like it's going to be a
digital title but it's still starfox and
then hopefully we'll get the new Legend
of Zelda sometime this year although
given series history I really wouldn't
be that surprised if it ends up getting
pushed back to 2016 meanwhile over on
the ps4 we're getting blood-borne at the
end of this month which if you're a fan
of the SOL series is definitely
something you might be getting excited
about over the summer we're getting
until done which isn't a Quantic Dream
game but looks a lot like one we're
probably going to see a debate again
about what counts as an actual video
game or not you know because it's almost
like an interactive movie but it could
still be really fun and would be a nice
foray into the slasher film style and
sometime this year we're going to get
one of the games that made the biggest
Ripple back at last year's e3 no man's
sky which is an indie title for the ps4
it will be available on PC later but
it's a space simulator with a great
artist etic that promise
is yet you're going to be able to
explore an entire universe now this is
one of those games where you get really
excited watching previews but there's
always that little voice in the back of
your head going I hope it delivers
because if it doesn't it's going to be
really disappointing and we just won't
know until launches but it's definitely
one to get excited for also taking a
quick look at early 2016 we are going to
get a new Uncharted game for the ps4 and
if you're a fighting game fan you're
basically being forced to lean towards
ps4 over Xbox one because Street Fighter
5 is going to be a ps4 exclusive now
last up our upcoming Xbox one games and
there's a reason I saved this one for a
last because I feel like Microsoft might
actually have the biggest ace in the
hole for this upcoming holiday season at
least as far as pure sales go you know
sometime this year we're going to get
fable legends which initially I was
excited about but then we found out it's
free-to-play which doesn't always mean
free-to-play so depending on how that
works out at launch maybe I'll be
excited and like it maybe not we'll find
out
we've also got quantum breaks sometime
this year which was one of the first
games we found out about for the Xbox
one and still no almost next to nothing
about you know we've heard it's going to
be a third person shooter there'll be
this kind of in-game TV integration
thing and it's going to have time
control elements but it's all been
really vague so that's another title
that might be worth getting excited
about we still know a ton about but then
there's the one huge game that Microsoft
has up its sleeve and that's halo 5
Guardians you know loved the series hate
the series gone in waves with it with
each entry you can't deny that halo is
the largest exclusive that Microsoft has
ever had for each of their systems and
finally getting a new one for the Xbox
one could do wonders for the system
sales you know I'm willing to bet that
there's a lot of gamers out there that
haven't bought an Xbox one yet but are
planning to pick one up the day halo 5
comes out because that's the one title
they've been waiting on this whole time
now looking a little farther in the
future for Xbox one there are a couple
other exclusives worth noting they
announced both scalebound and phantom
dust last year which we got really cool
looking trailers for but who knows how
the actual games will turn out just yet
and they have announced that a new Gears
of War game is in the works but given
what a pile of crap judgment was who
knows how this will turn out so they
guys have it all the stuff that at least
I think you need to know when
considering which system to get now I
know that was a lot of information back
to back to back so let's just do a quick
little cliffnotes recap the way you
offer some of the best local multiplayer
options as well as some of these
strongest exclusives that are
we'll only on it nowhere else but at the
same time it's going to have the worst
graphics and you're missing out on a ton
of multi-platform titles that are
available on every other system Xbox one
is going to offer some of the best
shooters that have been released so far
like titanfall and some of the best
upcoming ones like Halo and Gears of War
as well as giving you the best media and
social apps to choose from last but
definitely not least is the ps4 which is
going to give you the large story of
indie titles the best graphics and some
really solid exclusive games that are
once again only available on ps4 and
nowhere else now which of those systems
is right for you is completely up to
your own mind if you want my advice
though or at least my opinion or what I
would do if I didn't own them all
already well the order I would go
depends on one important factor if
you're a PC gamer the Wii U is actually
really worth grabbing first because it's
going to offer the most different games
that you're not going to get on PC after
that go for the ps4 Xbox one just
depending on which exclusives jump out
at you more now if you're not a PC gamer
and you're gonna go pure console no
matter what grab the ps4 first there's a
ton of great indie titles worth grabbing
it's going to give you the best looking
multi-platform games and it has some
great exclusives after that grab the Wii
U to diversify your options a lot more
and if you've got to get all three of
them pick up the Xbox one last so you
can get what exclusives you're missing
out on now whether or not that order is
right for you is for you to decide but
that's my personal recommendation now as
always guys thank you so much for
watching the video if you enjoyed it

think that thumbs up button as well as
