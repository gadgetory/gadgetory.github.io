- Today we're gonna take a look at a
bunch of awesome products that you,
at least normally,
can't get in the US
and we're gonna start with
the Razor Raiju Ultimate.
Now Razor has made a
whole bunch of different,
awesome, cool gaming products,
but sadly, their Raiju
line of PS4 controllers
is not one of the ones
they've made available
to their US customers.
Now, I was a big fan of the original Raiju
that was released earlier
in the PS4's life cycle,
but it was still a little
rough around the edges.
There were a couple aspects of
it I didn't really care for,
like the stick-heads
and it was missing a couple
features that I would
really like to have in a pro-controller
and the Ultimate basically
addressed all of those problems.
So as far as the features go,
it's a lot of stuff that's
getting pretty common in
a lot of pro-controllers.
You've got mappable buttons that you can
adjust using an app your phone,
you can switch between a dedicated wired,
or Bluetooth connection,
you've got adjustable trigger stops,
and you can swap the
stick-heads if you wanna get
a longer stick design
for more precise control.
And, of course, it would
not be a Razor product
if you didn't have Razor Chroma,
RGB lights all around the touch-pad
that you can fully customize.
(electronic music)
Now, all that stuff is cool,
but what honestly really sets
this controller apart for me
is the build quality,
the whole package,
the heft of the controller,
the texture and shape of the grip,
which is really comfortable,
how smoothly the sticks glide,
and one of the more unique features of the
Raiju line of controllers,
mechano-tactile buttons which
give a really satisfying snap
and allow for really rapid pressing.
Now it's worth noting
that this controller does
have a slightly more
affordable younger brother,
the Raiju Tournament,
which is stripped down of
some of the fancier functions,
like the RGB lighting,
but one of the things that's really
interesting about that option,
is they actually swap the d-pad and stick,
so it's an Xbox 1 layout
rather than a PS4,
which some people prefer.
Now this is certainly
not a cheap controller,
and because you have to import it,
you're probably gonna be paying even more
than it's valued at,
but honestly it is well worth the price,
and is currently my go-to PS4 controller.
(upbeat dance music)
Next we're gonna go from talking about a
pro-controller for PlayStation
to a cheap alternative
controller for Nintendo.
Now there's a lot of awesome
third party brands out here,
making controllers for the Switch,
like PowerA, PDP, Hori, even 8Bitdo,
but there's even more
options if you look at
what other countries have to offer.
Like this Cyber Switch
controller from Japan.
And by the way, I wanna not just how
simple this controller is,
it actually kind of appeals to me because
so many controllers
out here are focused on
very heavily branded designs,
like oh, here's a Zelda
one, here's a Mario one!
This one comes in blue, red or black.
That's it.
Now this is the cheaper,
wired option grab.
If you spend a little more money
you can get a wireless version as well,
and that one is still cheaper that getting
a Switch pro-controller,
which isn't that hard to do.
Ah feature wise, it is
skimmed down a little bit.
Is has all the buttons
you need to play games
and it does have motion controls,
which is a nice touch,
however, sadly, it does not have rumble.
Now as far as how it actually
handles as a controller,
it's fine.
It definitely feels like it's price point.
The strongest part is probably the sticks.
They feel pretty good.
The front facing buttons
and d-pad are okay,
they get the job done,
but I've definitely used better.
It's nothing to write home about.
The two parts that are the weakest
are the grip and the shoulders.
The grip just has this
very hard line right here,
which I don't really like the
way that feels on my palm.
The grip itself on the back is okay.
The problem with the triggers is that
they're that kind that
have that little bit
extra tension of the back end,
which almost feels like you're
not really fully pulling it
which is not good.
Ah I would not recommend
using this for anything that
relies heavily on the triggers,
like a shooter,
but for everything else,
it's pretty ignorable.
Now because this a third party controller,
it does have some additional functions.
It's got Turbo Mode,
pretty common on a lot
of third party things.
The most compelling option
on this controller though
is that it actually has four
different re-mappable buttons.
To this day, as far as all the different
Switch branded controllers I've tried,
usually only have two
buttons, if any at all,
so having four gives that little bit of
extra versatility that's
really nice to have.
(slow electronic music)
When it comes to PS4 controllers
there aren't a lot of officially
licensed options out there.
One of the few that you can get in the US
is the Hori Mini Gamepad.
Which is a wired controller that is fine,
it gets the job done,
but there's still a couple of parts if it
that just aren't quite as strong,
but in Japan, there's
a wireless version that
improves on a lot of aspects of it.
It's just overall a much
much better controller.
Including the fact that it is,
of course, well wireless.
Plus, it isn't that much more expensive
than the wired version,
while still being a
lot cheaper than buying
a brand new DualShock 4.
On top of all that,
I really like the translucent
red color it comes in
instead of that very boring
blue that the wired one has.
Now at first glance you might be wondering
what's actually different
about this controller
versus the wired one?
Well it's a lot of small subtle things,
but they all add together
to being a big improvement.
First of, all the Option
buttons have been moved
to the top middle now,
instead of being some at the bottom,
which was a little more
uncomfortable to reach
and the touch button right here,
actually also acts like a
light bar on a DualShock 4,
so it matches colors based
on certain this happening
in game which I always think
is a nice little touch,
even if it does drain
the battery a little bit.
The back part, also now
has a different texturing
on where your fingers rest,
giving it just a little more grip
and by far, the biggest, and best change,
is the stick design.
The wired one has this very hard plastic
with these dots on it that just isn't
comfortable at all to use.
Whereas this one is using a design that is
basically the same thing
as the DualShock 4,
which is softer and just way way better.
(upbeat dance music)
A really easy way to
personalize your Switch
is with a carrying case,
and no doubt there are a
lot of different options
to choose from in the US,
but if you start looking at stuff that's
exclusive to different countries,
there are so many more to choose from.
For instance,
from Japan we got this
Mario slip case that,
it's not gonna carry
everything for your Switch,
but it will for the Switch by itself
and keep it nice and safe,
and there a whole bunch of
different designs to choose from.
Like Mario, Luigi, Donkey Kong, Kirby,
even Splatoon,
and if you need a way to
carrying around your games,
look at this!
I have never seen a Disney
themed carrying case in the US.
So if you're a Disney fan,
grab one of these!
(electronic drums)
Now what is probably the most
interesting item on this list
is the Taiko Drum for Nintendo Switch.
This is designed for a specific game,
Taiko no Tatsujin,
which was made available
in the US digitally,
but the controller wasn't
brought here at all.
In Europe, you can get it in a
bundle with the game and the drum.
In Japan you can buy them separately,
or in a bundle,
but in the US,
it's just the game.
Which is really a shame,
because you can play
it with just Joy-Cons,
waving them around,
it works,
but it's just not the nearly as fun
as actually picking it up
(bang)
and hitting it, 'cause it is a drum.
And that's actually the
really interesting thing too,
is that even when using this controller,
you need to hit it hard to
actually register in the game,
which gets you all the
more into the action,
and on that note,
word of warning,
you might see things like this
pop up in the US for sale,
they're not the official ones.
They're ones that are basically knock offs
that are made to be cheaper
for people that wanna get it,
but be careful with those,
because realize, this is
an accessory where the
entire point is to keep hitting it
(bang)
as hard as you can,
and so if it's not made very well,
it's not gonna last very long
as you just keep hitting
it over and over again,
so if this is something
you're interested in playing,
do yourself a favor,
buy the real thing.
