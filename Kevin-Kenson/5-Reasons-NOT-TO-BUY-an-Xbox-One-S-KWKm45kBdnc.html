one the new slim looks cool and all but
the original one still plays all the
same games right so which one do you get
well I've got five reasons why you
should get the original Xbox one reason
one it's cheaper
the Slim's release has caused brand-new
Xbox ones to fall down to only 250 bucks
with a game included and really if you
want to take a further step down and
look at used ones those are selling dirt
cheap online with some listings going as
low as a hundred bucks brand new shiny
stuff is cool at all but we got bills to
pay reason to you want a quieter system
while the Xbox 1s is smaller and gets
rid of the power brick that comes with a
downside namely heat everything's packed
all in there close together with more
heat than ever before making the Slim's
fan work a lot harder to keep the system
cooler and as a result louder reason
number three and I can't believe I'm
actually going to argue this if you want
to use the Kinect while pretty clearly
not everyone loved it the Kinect does
have its fans and for good reason it's a
fun accessory for fitness and dance
games or if you're the kind of person
that doesn't mind waving your hands
around whenever you're browsing what
movie to watch and one of the things the
slim did to save room was completely
getting rid of the Kinect port which
made it smaller but if you want to use
one you've got a problem now sure
Microsoft is releasing an adapter you
can buy separately but now you're paying
more money and you've got a bigger cable
mess to deal with
reason for you don't own a 4k TV aside
from its size the only real big
functional upgrade the slim has to offer
is 4k video support and HDR for more
color range which is cool if you have
the TV to support it but if you don't
then it means all of Jack diddly
and reason number five waiting for
Scorpio this is honestly the biggest
reason as Microsoft has already
announced their next upgrade to the Xbox
one project Scorpio which will not only
support 4k video like the slim
but we'll also support real 4k gaming
and VR if you have to play some games
right now while you wait for the next
real system upgrade to come out you
might as well save your money and buy
the cheapest used xbox one you can or
maybe not</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
