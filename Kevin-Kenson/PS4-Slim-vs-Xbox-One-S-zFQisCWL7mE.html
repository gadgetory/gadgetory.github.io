ps4 and of course in just about a
month's time after we got the
announcement and release of the ps4 slim
as well as a few pieces of pretty
important news that could affect your
decision on which system you want to buy
now since the ps4 is for the most part a
system refresh with only some changes
let's do a brief recap of the main
points of comparison from my last video
the Xbox 1's offers backwards
compatibility with select 360 games
it's controllers use double-a batteries
with the option to buy a recharge kit it
has a lot of different media streaming
services and can even be integrated into
a cable box setup and its library of
exclusives has some strong winners for
racing and shooter fans though from this
point on all of their console exclusive
games will be on PC as well one of the
biggest wins that comes with the upgrade
to the 1s though is 4k video support and
HDR including being able to play UHD
blu-ray z' making the 1s a pretty strong
contender for if you want an all in one
media device as opposed to just a gaming
system as for the ps4 the most important
thing is that it is the more powerful
system of the two multi-platform games
usually run better on the system
offering higher native resolutions and
more consistent frame rates though there
are some exceptions when it comes to
exclusives for the ps4 they are for the
most part better-looking and offer a
wider array of games especially for
single player while it doesn't have
backwards compatibility it does have
PlayStation now which gives access to a
large number of ps3 games to stream play
for a monthly fee though the service is
now available on PC as well and Sony
also offers their own digital TV channel
package called PlayStation DV the ps4
controller uses an internal battery so
you don't have to keep buying double A's
but its life per charge isn't exactly
great which can be really annoying if
you want to play really long
uninterrupted sessions now as far as
important bits that are true of both
systems both offer ways to record
gameplay and take screenshots as will
the stream to twitch both will charge
you a monthly fee if you want to play
games online but both will also throw in
free monthly games for that subscription
so there's what's still the same so
what's new
well obviously the ps4 slim is a lot
the ps4 and Xbox one s were pretty close
in size but the slim is 7 inches less
wide than the one s and less than half
is tall on the flip side though the 1s
is still the quieter of the two the slim
is a little less noisy compared to the
latest model original ps4 but it'll
still get uncomfortably loud from time
to time the ps4 slim also now offers 5
gigahertz Wi-Fi as opposed to just 2.4
like the original putting it on par with
the Xbox one and 1s another thing worth
noting is that both systems have pretty
easily replaceable hard drives but the
1s has a distinct advantage in that you
can load games up from an external hard
drive as well which is significantly
less of a hassle now there have also
been some major changes to PlayStation
recently that our model agnostic all PS
fours will now support HDR via a
firmware update taking away one of the
advantages the one s had but a recent
downside is that PlayStation Plus has
now had a price increase putting its
yearly and three-month plan options at
the same price as Xbox Live Gold now
another important thing to consider when
debating buying one of these systems is
of course what's coming in the future
and as of right now there's a lot Sony
has two big hardware releases for this
holiday season first in October will
beginning psvr
a dedicated virtual reality headset for
ps4 and second in November will be
getting the PlayStation 4 Pro previously
known as PlayStation neo it'll also
support 4k video streaming but unlike
the 1s for some mind-boggling reason
will not be a UHD blu-ray player
meanwhile Microsoft doesn't have any
other new hardware for this year but
next year during the holiday season we
should be seeing project Scorpio an
improved Xbox one that will be more
powerful than any other console of this
generation offering a 6 teraflop GPU as
opposed to the ps4 pro's 4.2 so if
you're not going to wait for those more
powerful systems and want to get
something right now which one should you
get the ps4 slim or the Xbox 1s well the
biggest factors that I will always
emphasize is what system has exclusive
games you actually care about and what
systems your friends have if after that
you're still stuck as things stand right
now the ps4 slim offers the more
powerful gaming system with a larger
library of excellent single player
exclusives that cannot be played
anywhere else
while the Xbox 1s is going to be a more
all-encompassing multimedia device
thanks to 4k video and UHD blu-ray
support and the ability to play order
360 games that you still own or missed
out on that or still you could just
build a PC</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
