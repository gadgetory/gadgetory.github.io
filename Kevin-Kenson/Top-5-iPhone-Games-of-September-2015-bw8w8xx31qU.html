too it's once again time for my favorite
iOS games of the month and to be
perfectly honest I thought this was kind
of a slow month for app games with the
exception for one genre platforming
platforming had a really damn good month
evident by the fact that every single
game on this month's list is a
platformer although they do each
approach the genre a little differently
first off we've got stranded now this is
an auto-runner where you can't control
where you're moving just simply whether
you are jumping or crouching but it's a
lot more difficult than it sounds
because the game is heavily momentum
based if you let yourself run into
anything or mess up a landing it's gonna
slow you down a lot and you might have
trouble reaching the next checkpoint
which is a problem because you only have
so much oxygen to get from one place or
another as you play the game you do
collect currency which can be use to
upgrade some of your attributes and buy
new suits but for the most part the real
challenge of this game is just learning
how to conserve your momentum and just
keep the pace going
second up we've got another Auto runner
but this one works a bit differently and
that's Astra now we're as stranded was a
left to right kind of more traditional
platformer Astra has you jumping from
planet to planet think like a very
simple version of mario galaxy where you
have to double jump to escape the
atmosphere and then just kind of have
gravity screw with you while you find
your way to another place to land each
planet has its own little things going
on enemies that you can jump on to kill
enemies you can't kill that you've to
run away from little platforming
segments little puzzles you have to
solve so on so forth this isn't the
first platformer to tackle this
particular genre but it's not one we've
seen very often and I think this is one
of the better ones to do it thus far
third we're gonna keep the gravity theme
going but go a little bit different idea
with it with gravity duck Islands now
this game was very clearly inspired by
vvvv where the main platform mechanic is
hitting a button to reverse gravity but
you're having a little more control over
what you do in this one basically one
button will reverse gravity while
another button does a different special
feature based on the level you're on
such as jumping or going into a float
mode and the entire thing is just going
level to level trying to avoid spikes
enemies all kinds of things that can
one-hit kill you and make your way to
the exit it's not that difficult if you
just want to beat each level and call it
a day but beating each level under a
certain time limit
two three star of them all makes us
probably one of the most difficult games
on this list this one walks a really
nice line between puzzle game and
platformers so if you're a fan of either
genre this one's definitely worth
looking into
number four isn't exactly a platformer
it's something a little different but it
does have platforming elements and
that's cave or not where the whole game
is focused on you trying to escape this
series of caves underground now there
are a lot of games that have done the
genre before where you're just holding a
button to go up and you're trying to
avoid different obstacles but most of
them in my experience have been much
more fast-paced that are usually
inspired by flappy bird and it's the
kind of thing we were gonna die ten
seconds into every game because you just
made some small stupid mistake this
isn't like those this is much slower
paced which I really like because you
can take your time with each level and
all you really need to worry about our
resources like not running out of fuel
midway through I really like the more
relaxed tone in this game and the fact
that it still is actually pretty
difficult to get high scores so you're
not getting frustrated the fact that
you're constantly dying but at the same
time you're not just having a breeze
getting a new high score every time you
play that last on this month's list
we're gonna go from a more relaxed game
to a much more frantic one with Papago
the huppah Coast controls are really
simply you just have to tap the screen
to jump from platform to platform or
point in the hold somewhere on the
screen if you want to jump in a
particular direction the thing is
everything is extremely fast-paced if
you stand in any one area too long it's
a game over and the levels always come
in packages of five so if you die midway
through say on level three or four you
go all the way back to the first one
thankfully all the games a little
transition seems like beating a level or
dying can be skipped so it keeps you in
the action constantly and the whole
thing is accompanied by this amazing
chiptune soundtrack that keeps the
energy level high throughout honestly I
found this one to be the most difficult
on this month's list but also the one I
had the most fun with and probably the
only one game on this month that I would
say is an absolute must grab so those
are my favorite app games of September
2015
all platformers and all really
affordable there were a few other games
this month that I was interested in but
just didn't quite make the cut so if
there's any games that you loved that
weren't on this month's list
