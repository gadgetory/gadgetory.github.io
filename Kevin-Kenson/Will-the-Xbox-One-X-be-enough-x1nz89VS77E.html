into the Xbox community now this is
actually a question that I've been
thinking along and hard about I have
done lots of research I read lots of
articles studied graphs of the math
radical star charts and horoscopes and
the answer I've come to is
in all seriousness thinking about
whether or not the scorpio is really
going to add more adoption to the xbox
community yes and no I mean there's
always going to be those people that are
excited by new hardware that are going
to pick it up at launch date there are
those people that want the highest end
system out there without going to the
trouble of building a PC so yeah some
people are going to move over to Scorpio
right away but is it going to be a large
number I'm not really convinced yet you
know I think Scorpio alone is a strong
move but there is more that we need
because really when you look at this
generation one of the biggest things
that has separated systems other than
power is exclusives so when he has a
huge number of exclusives while
Microsoft has kind of just leaned on a
few of their biggest like Halo and Gears
of War and then either pushed back or
cancelled a lot of other ones that we've
been waiting on I mean scalebound got
canceled and crackdown 3 we keep hearing
about and keep not actually knowing
what's happening with it so for Scorpio
to really make a huge move for Microsoft
we need some exclusives to go along with
it thankfully they've already announced
a lot about Scorpio as far as its tech
specs so I'm hoping that frees up time
at their e3 conference so we can see
some game announcements paired with it
who has a better world horizon zero dawn
or breath of the wild now this is
actually a really interesting question
because while both of them are
open-world both games took very very
different approaches on how to
accomplish it for horizon zero dawn for
instance is basically a further
refinement of what we've already seen in
a lot of other free roam games mainly
Far Cry where you have this sort of
approach of find a high area it marks
your map and it shows all the different
stuff you can do the side quests you can
accept collectibles to find monsters to
hunt so on so forth well Legend of Zelda
borrows these concepts but it almost
feels like Nintendo kind of broke them
down and took a step back for more
simplicity where there are towers you
can climb but it literally just gives
you the lay of the land it marks your
map and shows the geography but it's up
to you to actually look around and find
things like shrines you want to discover
or weird oddities or where there's
nearby towns that kind of thing and as a
result of that I actually like Zelda a
lot more because ferengi Rodon is still
a great game but it always feels like
you're just kind of making away from one
objective to the next while Zelda you
actually have to take your time
exploring things freely to find the
stuff you want to find finding shrines
is a very very tough thing to do for
some of them
and so it just gives it extra feeling of
you're actually exploring and
discovering something and this open
world is actually this interesting thing
you're finding and not just well there's
the next Waypoint you need to reach
favorite game genre favorite game from
each major genre you play so for me my
favorite genre is definitely RPGs that's
been my favorite for a long time and
pretty much anything you could consider
an RPG whether it's the old-school
turn-based stuff that you'll see with
the older Final Fantasy games more
modern action RPG hybrids tactics games
old pause and plays like Baldur's Gate
or more recently pillars of eternity all
that stuff I love but I'm pretty good
about spreading love with other genres
as well I mean I spend time with
action-adventure stuff puzzle
platforming fps the only thing I really
don't play much of is like the really
heavy simulation is type stuff like
anything that's trying to be more like
real life whether that's doing a sports
game or certain racing games I just
don't really care for me the more
fantastic or weird or sci-fi a game is
the more I love it which type of games
do you enjoy old retro titles versus
modern triple-a titles or does it depend
on the situation more often than not I
actually do end up falling in love a lot
more with the charm of the kind of indie
titles that try to capture old-school
style being one of my favorite games
from a couple years back is shovel
Knight because it was sort of taking the
best aspects of old games like Mega Man
or even the older Mario games in
Castlevania but adding in more modern
game mechanics and elements while still
keeping that old-school look and charm
so yeah I do my best to kind of not
favor one of the other but at the end of
the day I probably am a little biased
towards retro what's your favorite Mario
Kart weapon well you know there's a lot
of good choices I really like the horn
because it prevents blue shells from
hitting you red shells are useful just
to annoy your friends but at the end of
the day if I had to pick one I probably
go with the coin because the only thing
you're stuck with when you're in first
place all the time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
