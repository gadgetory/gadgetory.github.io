little handheld that can also double as
a home console it's got an amazing
library games for its first year the one
thing that's a little light on right now
is media apps in a particular one
glaring omission is a proper YouTube app
now admittedly in the grand scheme of
things this really isn't that huge of a
deal because thankfully there are just a
couple devices out there that can run
YouTube however for those of you that
have really wanted to try out watching
YouTube on a switch well there's
apparently a way to do it I've actually
seen a lot of people posting now that
there is a weird workaround to get
YouTube to work on a switch the first
one that I saw that we actually filed
the directions for was from master of
Hyrule so I haven't done this just yet
I've read some of like the basic outline
of what we need to do it seems weird but
we're gonna run through it and see how
it works and if it actually is something
worth doing
so first we have to go to our system
settings into users and then I need to
click on social accounts for that user
after that I have to go to linking a
Facebook account but surprise I'm at
actually linking a Facebook account
instead we actually use the Facebook
account to go down to pages that are on
Facebook and then from there I have to
find Google Chrome go to its page and on
its page is a link to Google Chrome so
now that I'm gonna Google Chrome's page
I'm not actually doing anything on the
page itself instead of going to a link
for Google Chrome and once I'm there I'm
not doing anything there I need to find
the link that'll take me to just
straight-up Google Oh guess what was
weird about that is it
so far most things were just like part
of lists and like obvious links that
time I described the bottom of page and
the Google logo is in the corner and
that was actually a link to Google all
right did that your browser is not
supported by Google+ there's plus Google
that's weird cuz it's reversed but okay
now I guess I'm on Google+ is website
okay okay I mean I need a verification
hook saved to stuff of course I didn't
bring my phone with me when we're
shooting oh you know it it's totally
it's totally down the hall because I had
plugged it into the table and now we
play the city so how was your day oh
that's right I forgot about that part so
now that I have my phone thanks man I
need to get my verification code don't
worry about what's back here that's
ignore that okay so I'm logged into
Google+ so I have to go on my computer
and link videos to my Google+ to be able
to watch them through here I need to get
my computer so then I have to link
YouTube videos to this I never mess with
the Google+ do not seven days go Marquez
Bailey if I only had a new video go up
one of my recent videos sure first thing
that's on my front page okay so now
we've done that I should be able to
watch that video on here maybe hopefully
I think have to refresh the page oh well
it's at least loading something oh I
just hit the play button it did it so
there's a way to watch YouTube not
through YouTube at all okay so now that
we have this up and running let's run
through real quick once again everything
I had to do to make this work I had to
go into system settings which you know
makes a lot of sense
after that go into my user go into the
social media settings to that and then
link a Facebook account only I'm not
actually linking a Facebook account
instead I'm using that landing splash
page to go to the bottom and then find
pages I attend to Kate that I'm not a
robot
and then I had to find the page for
Google Chrome now once I found that page
I had to go to the side and find the
link to actual Google Chrome which then
is the download page for it which once
again running actually using instead
you're going to find a link to regular
Google which isn't like an obvious link
it's just the logo for Google once
you're on that you then have to click to
go to classic view and then there's two
different links that go go to Google
plus one that says Google Plus and then
one that just says Plus Google obviously
enough the one that says Google+ doesn't
actually work it to go the one that says
Plus Google once I do that I had to log
in to my Google Plus account which I
haven't used in years and then I found
out that I couldn't actually watch any
videos because I had no videos linked on
that page so then I to bring out my
MacBook link stuff on Google Plus go
back to this and then I can watch them
why would anyone do this
so yeah this really isn't something
anyone should do I mean it's a really
cool way of showing how you can kind of
expose loopholes and find things that no
one really thought about in advance as
they were you know creating these splash
pages or ways to set stuff up on the
system it's crazy that you can actually
do this
but it's not anything that really anyone
should do I mean you had to go through
how many steps just to get a video
working that you had to set up in
advance if you weren't really thinking
about it when I could just do it on my
phone or any of the other five million
things we listed earlier that run
YouTube so yeah hopefully YouTube makes
its way to the switch because if you
really want to use methods like this we
just we just need a proper app now
that'd be nice</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
