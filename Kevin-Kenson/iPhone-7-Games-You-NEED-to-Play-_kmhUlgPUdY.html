want to try some games out on it right
away the prettier the better so here's
five of the best app games you need to
play as soon as possible first off is an
amazing game that originally came on
console but had a perfectly done
transition to mobile transistor this is
still one of the prettiest games
available on iphone and with the sevens
new stereo speakers you can lose
yourself in the game's incredible
soundtracks so much more it blends this
sword of real-time top-down adventure
game with a tactical pause option where
you can unleash powerful combos on
enemies but what's even more interesting
is the game's RPG aspects allowing you
to combine numerous powers to create
customized special attacks or gaining
passive bonuses
it's beautiful challenging and has a ton
of replayability teamed up with the
game's satisfying story and incredible
soundtrack if you haven't played this
before you've got to check it out now
now number two is the most recent game
in one of the best franchises to find
its home on mobile the room 3 really
this whole series is worth checking out
they are easily some of the best puzzle
games on iOS thanks to great visuals
intuitive controls and a huge variety of
puzzle types challenging all kinds of
players seriously this game does some
trippy stuff and even if you find
yourself breezing through a number of
challenges you're bound to encounter one
or two that'll stump you and the whole
thing is packaged together with this
really ominous bare-bones mystery plot
that leaves you waiting for more and
more games to further delve into the
setting check the series out you will
not regret it
third up let's take a break from the
more complex stuff and look at a much
simpler straightforward super addictive
game chameleons run like most auto
runners the basic idea here is pretty
simple tap the screen to jump and don't
die but thankfully the game adds a lot
more complexity than that and pretty
quickly you have to keep changing your
color to match what you're touching and
the game's frantic pace along with walls
that auto change your color can make it
tricky to keep up with and while the
visuals aren't exactly
detailed the vibrant colors and
simplicity of the art makes it
surprisingly really good-looking though
you never have much time to gawk at
things given the speed of the game throw
in objectives replayability and trying
to one-up your friends best time and
this makes for a really addictive game
you can kill time with on the go coming
in at number four is teeny Titans this
game takes an all too real obsession
with collectibles and puts it in the
game that ends up working beautifully
you run around town is robbing
collecting various figures of different
heroes and villains that you then use to
battle it out with enemies in 3v3 RPG
style fights each figure has its own
stats instead of moves and the game even
uses a rock-paper-scissors mechanic
where certain types of heroes Trump
others and get bonus damage it's really
bizarre though how well this game taps
into the collector mentality sending
players on these self-inflicted quests
to visit each store in the game flinging
figures off the shelves in the hope of
finding a rare one as well as saving up
to spend a bunch of money on a special
one if you just want to blitz the game
story
it isn't very long but if you really buy
into the collection fever this game will
hook you for much much longer now last
but far from least is my most recent
personal obsession on iphone severed
severed is this really weird warped
mixture of a dungeon crawler with
infinity blade and fruit ninja you make
your way through this twisted world
filled with crazed monsters slashing
your way through them timing how you
handle which enemies win and ultimately
cutting off parts of them to collect and
improve your character it's art is
intriguing to say the least and despite
its overt violent tone it actually has a
fairly deep and interesting story behind
it and the game's dungeons are littered
with little secrets and collectibles for
you to find combat is super intuitive
and at its heart it really is a puzzle
game more than anything else
forcing you to learn enemy attack
patterns timing of those attacks and
knowing how to slice just right when the
opportunity arises to get as many
upgrades as you can don't let
appearances fool you this game is
surprisingly deep and is a worthwhile
addition to anyone's app game
library that or you can ignore this
entire list and just use your phone as a
$700 Pokemon go machine also a valid
choice</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
