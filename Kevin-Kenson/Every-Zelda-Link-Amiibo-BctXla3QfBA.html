first introduced us to their new form of
unlockable content packed in addictive
little physical collectibles that we now
know of as amiibos and more than any
other franchise there are a lot of them
for Zelda with just link alone there are
ten different Link amiibos so I thought
let's take a look at all of them and
rank them from worst to best
oh yeah Joan's kicking is off at the
bottom number 10 is the original Super
Smash Brothers link based on Twilight
Princess now it's not this guy's fault
this is actually one of the original
amiibo made in a set of twelve and it
just shows because the quality is
improved over time now some of things
that are off-putting about this one
first off the face is really pale I mean
twelve princess link is supposed to be a
little pale the game is definitely d
saturated but you'll actually notice
that it's because it matches the same
color as his pants to cut down on cost
which is really weird once you actually
start noticing that also the support
stand I get that it's supposed to be
like a golden color because that's
associated with Zelda a lot but who's
ever ideas want us to use this color for
a stand no not a good idea if peeing
your pants is cool consider me
Miles Davis for number nine we go from
the original link amiibo it's one of the
most recent ones with Skyward Sword now
I'll be honest part of the reason to the
low-ranking is because this guy is tied
to what is probably the worst 3d Zelda
game and that just kind of screws his
chances from the outside but even then
just looking at the design I'm just not
a huge fan a lot of them are sort of
shield wielding and there's nothing
unique about this pose that makes it
interesting me also the face all the
Lincoln me bows are either happy or kind
of stoic this one's trying to be kind of
determined or angry and even looks a
little bit like you doing kind of a duck
face it's just not it's not a good look
although I do appreciate the fact they
learned their lesson from the first link
amiibo and instead of that yellow we at
least have clear support for number
eight we have the Ocarina of Time link I
say ocarina
but is it oakarina
is the doc oh just say oh this time it
is ocarina though okay then for number
eight we have the ocarina of time links
now unlike Skyward Sword
I actually am big fan of ocarina of time
so that's not why I'm hating all this
one it's just that to be honest I think
it's kind of a boring design I mean I
understand the fact that it's supposed
to be based on the concept art from way
back when but I just don't think it
translates well to a figure in the
situation it's not something that I hate
it's not something that's terrible it's
just not very good or stand out to me
either also it's kind of hard to tell
that he's actually playing the ocarina
from like a distance it almost looks
like eating a taco coming in at number 7
is horse rider link from breath of the
wild now that sounds kind of a weird one
for me to rank because at first glance I
actually kind of like it I think there's
some good attention to detail I like to
have like the bundle packs and the
shield the way your cape is flowing but
there's a couple things about it that
kind of ruined the whole thing for me
first off the fact that compared to the
other link amiibos he's kind of dwarfed
in comparison it's like a little tiny
link riding a tiny horse more
importantly once you actually take a
look at this thing closer Rick doesn't
have a face then for number 6 we're
going back to an older amiibo design
with the Super Smash Brothers Toon Link
now part of the reason why this one gets
a bit of a free pass compared to the
other smash brothers link is that Wind
Waker is a much simpler cartoony art
style that's a lot easier to do on the
cheap so it just works a lot better and
what details this one does have are
still really good
I like the shield design I like the
little you know detail on the sword
the sheath overall solid amiibo for
number 5 we have another kind of weird
one to rank and that's the 8-bit link
based on the original Legend of Zelda
now the reason why is because if we're
just talking pure aesthetics like how
things look it's not exactly the most
appealing design I mean the blocky look
is actually kind of weird once you see
it in person although I do really
appreciate the attention to detail
keeping it closer with the original
Zelda design we actually has the cross
on the shield instead of the Hyrule
symbol but the reason why this guy gets
a little extra boost it's just a novelty
of it I mean if you're just going to own
a single link amiibo or even just a
small set of them this guy is going to
be one of the ones you want to grab
because the idea of having 8-bit
original link number four we are going
back to Wind Waker but this time it's
the 20th anniversary design now some of
the arguments here are the same as last
time because
Waker is a simpler more cartoony art
style it is easier to translate into a
good-looking figure but even then if you
hold this guy up side by side with the
other Wind Waker link there is quite a
bit more detail here especially going on
with the hair out there just like the
overall pose and design of this one more
a lot of the other links are sword or
shield ready to fight this one on the
other hand is showcasing the actual Wind
Waker and you can actually see how his
hair is cap everything is blowing in the
direction that he is directing the wind
in what are all those heads now it's
time for our top three starting with the
20th anniversary Twilight Princess link
design now to be honest part of the
reason why this guy gets to rank so high
is because we have an uglier worse
version of him to directly compare to
and you can really see how the detail
and amiibos have gotten better over the
past couple years just looking at the
face detail the way the hair is molded
even just all the little etchings and
grooves on the shield the armlets the
sheath there's just a lot going on that
showcases how amiibos have gotten better
the posing in the stands isn't my
favorite but just looking at the overall
design and quality of this really makes
it one of the better Link amiibos out
there coming in at second place and was
honestly a very close contender door
number one top spot is the majora's mask
link amiibo now to kind of continue a
point from last time this is one of the
most reason to me the design so there's
a lot more detail going on here but what
makes it really cool and special is the
fact that this particular link doesn't
need a lot of detailing there isn't
exactly a whole lot of stuff to keep
track of here and yet what detail we
have is very fine I mean even just
looking at the hair it's not just a
matter of having it pointed in different
directions but you can actually make out
some of the individual hair threads
which is really cool we also have not
one but two faces to get detail out of
both links and the mask is holding also
this is the only link amiibo we have
that's based on young link which just
makes it especially really awesome this
leaves out our number one top spot the
breath of the wild archer link amiibo
now being based on the most recent
Legend of Zelda game there is a lot
going on in this amiibo but there's no
detail being lost I mean this guy is
completely decked out you've got sword
and shield bow and arrow quiver even a
little tablet that he uses in the game
but all the detailing looks great I also
got to say that while initially I was
kind of against the idea of changing his
tunic color from green to
this blue is just way more aesthetically
pleasing compared to the sea of green
and all the other link amiibos what
really sells this design though is the
fact that while we have some other link
amiibos with interesting stances they
all have to rely on some kind of stand
or little support system whereas this
guy actually incorporates it into the
design using this dust cloud which just
makes this truly awesome looking amiibo
so that is how I rank all 10 different
link amiibos I'm sorry wolf link fans
this was a human only rank list let me
know what you guys think which ones do
you love which ones do you hate what's
your top 3 give me the whole list of 10
whatever let me know down below in the
comments and I will see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
