in the latest batch of iPhones and by
far the really the only one relevant to
gamers see Apple has been really pushing
its use in a lot of apps like email or
Instagram where you can preview images
before opening them but when you look at
how it can be applied to app Cannes it
gets a lot more interesting now first
off if you don't know what 3d touch is
basically the 6s lines of phones all now
have pressure-sensitive displays so it's
not just about how long or how short you
press but also how hard now this is
interesting for app games for two
different reasons first off you can
condense controls when you're playing a
game on your phone you want as little of
the screen as possible to be dedicated
to overlaid buttons so for instance
let's say in an action game where you
can have light and heavy attacks well
instead of having two separate buttons
you can make one button where you
lightly press it for a light attack or
press more firmly to do a strong one
second it can be used for much more
precise control over situations where
you can move things on a gradient for
instance during the Apple Keynote they
showed off a new upcoming game where you
could touch something to shoot at it and
the more firmly press the more you would
zoom in on the target now as of right
now there's really only one game on the
App Store that uses 3d touch in an
interesting way and that's a G Drive one
of the more successful iOS racing games
and it uses that second example I gave
of how you could use 3d touch where
basically the screen mimics a gas pedal
where you can lightly touch just slowly
accelerate or press down as hard as you
can to floor it now after actually
having used it I gotta say it was a lot
more intuitive than I thought it would
be but at the same time I have this
image in my head of someone who just has
stupid high grip strength and taking the
game a little too seriously associating
the firmware I press the faster I go and
just eventually smashing their iPhone
screen with their thumb and really the
ideas we've seen so far in previews and
games have been released or is that tip
the iceberg of what you could use 3d
touch for and a lot of popular genres
for instance you could do a top-down
shooter where while you're holding your
finger on the screen you'll rapidly fire
but if you press down more firmly you'll
perform your charge shot instead or
maybe shoot some kind of super-powerful
bomb you get have an FPS game where
right now a lot of them either only have
hip shooting or really awkward controls
for aiming down sights we're touching
the screen will make you aim and then
pressing more firmly will make you fire
either pressing repeatedly to burst fire
or just holding down to spray in prey
puzzle and mystery games could give you
whole new ways of interacting with your
environment where
objects react to how hard you push on
them or you could even use that zoom and
example I gave earlier where you can
inspect an item and the more firmly
press down the more you look at really
specific parts of it and card games
could even just borrow the functionality
that we're seeing an Instagram where you
can just lightly touch a card to inspect
it and look at the details and then
press down to actually play it and
honestly these are just the really
obvious basic ideas of how 3d touch
could apply to more popular genres point
is that 3d touch is actually a really
cool new idea when you think about how
it can be used for app games and
honestly I'm really excited to see how
game devs can use it in more interesting
ways the thing is this is currently only
on the newest set of iPhones so we're
probably not going to see very many
games that are based solely around using
3d touch we might get one to help
showcase it but for the most part a lot
of devs are probably going to make games
where you can have options to play with
or without it but given some time and a
few more launches we might start to see
some really interesting games come out
thanks to this functionality well that
was just my quick two cents on the 3d
touch function of the new iPhones if you
guys have any cool ideas for how this
could be used in games make sure to let
me know down in the comments if you
enjoyed this video hit that thumbs up
button to let me know as well subscribe
and I'll see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
