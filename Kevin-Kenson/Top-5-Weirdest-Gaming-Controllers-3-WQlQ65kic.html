lot of weird attempts at making
interesting and new controllers and here
are five of the weirdest ones that have
been made starting off with the Coleco
super action controller back when gaming
was just trying to grow all kinds of
weird controllers were made because no
one was really sure quite yet what was
working and we're throwing all kinds of
crazy ideas at the wall just to see what
sticks and this is a perfect example of
that this is released as a special
controller for the ColecoVision meant to
be used with action eSport Games
initially coming with the title super
action baseball and the first thought we
really looking at is how am I supposed
to use this comfortably even though it's
clearly meant for the right hand to go
on the stick both ways feel super
uncomfortable all the buttons on the
grip feel absolutely terrible and it's
definitely not just because of the age
not only that but using the control
stick just ends up jerking both your
hands around overall the thing is just a
nightmare to try and use something that
you can really easily figure out just by
looking at it now another thing that
happened a lot in the early days gaming
was taking ideas that already worked but
trying to put some kind of new
futuristic spin on it to make it all
cool and sci-fi and one of my favorite
examples of this is the Konami laser
scope for the NES instead of using your
hands to hold a light gun like a sucker
the laser scope was a head-mounted light
gun that came with the game laser
invasion but could also be used with
other light gun games like duck hunt it
worked by lining up a laser sight
projected on the lens and yelling the
word fire to shoot now I'm not gonna lie
10 year old me would have flipped his
 over this thing in concept
especially once you realize it's also a
headset for the game's audio but it does
have a few pretty big problems thing is
it feels absolutely awful to wear
doesn't really adapt to different heads
very well and the like and fires at just
about any loud noise as we discovered
during rigorous testing fire fire fire
shoot it doesn't matter where I look
fire its yet stupid modern TVs not
having cathode ray tubes fire nope
didn't do it
it took so much now weird controllers
are not a unique thing to older games
it's also happened with a lot of later
titles where they tried to do different
special edition ideas one of the
absolute worst ones being the resident
evil 4 chainsaw now as a collector's
item to show off in its a little display
case it's actually pretty freakin cool
but trying to use this thing to actually
play games is just terrible not even
focusing on comfort factor considering
the shape of this thing but button
placement is just all over the place
requiring you to reach way farther than
normal to hit some regular buttons and
an r2 and l2 placed on the sides that
I'm not really sure how you're supposed
to hit normally it does have some cool
gimmicky stuff when used with resin evil
for like causing Leon to raise and lower
as chainsaw when you do but getting far
enough in the game with this controller
to even try that is a trial unto itself
it's a cool showpiece but an absolutely
bizarre way of trying to control a game
now when it comes to weird controllers
in recent years though one system has
all the other ones beat out and that's
the Wii with all the different weird
attachments you can have for the Wii
mode and my personal favorite is the
bowling ball okay yeah sure if you're
using this just for Wii bowling this
makes some sense but does it really
considering the fact that if you're
using it like a bowling ball you're much
more prone to accidentally letting go
which is going to end up in a lobbed
plastic ball at your television screen
yes there's a wrist strap which could
keep the controller from flying away but
then you have this big bowling ball
thing tugging your wrist every time you
let go which isn't exactly comfortable
and something that the controller itself
does warn against right on it you also
gotta love this thing's button interface
on the top of the ball which is mainly
there to browse control we Bowling's
menu but also totally means you could
play smash or Mario Kart with this
ineffectively now last but not least you
can't do a list on weird controllers
without of course talking about the best
accessory ever to come out in Nintendo
the power glove meant to be played with
a very specific group of games the power
glove was one of the earliest attempts
at adding a form of control outside of
traditional buttons giving the user the
ability to do things by raising and
lowering the glove relative to a center
point you set as well as making
different minor hand gestures like
tucking your thumb or pinky finger well
this was designed to work with a few
specific games in mind it does have a
setting that lets you play any regular
Nintendo games you'd like it's just not
going to be the smartest controller
choice you've ever made and you're gonna
look
absolutely goofy using it in front of
other people so there you have some of
the weirdest controllers that have ever
been released in the history of gaming
if you somehow haven't watched it yet
make sure watch Austin Evans version of
this which is focused on some of the
weirdest consoles my personal favorite
being on there the Virtual Boy as always
if you enjoy the video hit that thumbs
up button let me know and I'll catch you
guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
