the first two days of using a Nintendo
switch I have not once docked it
inflated in TV mode as far as I'm
concerned this right now with the games
on it is pretty much a handheld that's
the way I use it and it's really shaped
and changed my perception about how I
want to use it incorporate it in
different setups and I thought occurred
to me when I did my recent battery video
about the flexibility of a USBC port
where what if I could set it up so that
I could just take this and set it down
somewhere I can charge it now admittedly
as things are right now wireless
charging isn't exactly the most super
efficient method but I'm just really
curious if I can get a setup like this
to work with the switch and if it does
if it's actually viable right now so to
begin with obviously we need some way
for the switch to receive a charge for
my wireless charging service and that's
where this USBC wireless charge receiver
comes in handy because you're pretty
cheap you can just grab them off Amazon
plugs right into the bottom of the
switch and bam the idea is you lay down
and it should work just fine the only
thing is you might notice this kind of
flimsy floppy kind of thing just weird
the idea is you can peel this off on the
back and it'll stick to whatever device
you want to charge but I don't really
want to do that with my switch
especially this idea doesn't pan out I
don't want to stick anything to it that
I have to rip off so we have to find
some other way to keep this thing still
and I've gotten idea the switch hybrid
cover this is an accessory that
Nintendo's released that's mainly meant
to be a way of protecting your switch
when you're using it portably kind of
seals off the front and keeps the screen
safe and it gives you a better way to
use it in kickstand mode instead of the
weak little one built into the switch
but most importantly for us though is it
gives us a little place we can hide that
Wireless charge receiver all we got to
do is open up the case plug in this
wireless charger sivir
and one problem we do run into is that
it is a little taller than the switch
when you try closing it it's just not
going to fit right so we have to tilt it
to the side and keep that in mind for
later when we place it on surfaces now
that we have all this set up the
question is what are we going to get to
actually have a charge on now there are
cheap options you can grab on Amazon but
I want to do something a little more
interesting special maybe even something
where you have furniture that's
integrated into it so I took if
to Ikea while I was there I found a
couple different options there is of
course always the traditional pads they
can just place on top of your desk one
of the cooler ones though was the
nightstand you can put next to your bed
that has an integrated charge surface in
it so I ended up getting this LG cellie
so whatever I ended up getting is that
it's really cool how it integrates the
charge surface has great cable
management and it looks good now that we
have everything we need let's put this
thing to the test and we're getting a
charge now we just have to see how long
it'll actually take based on our testing
to get a full charge on your switch
using this method it could take as long
as eight to nine hours so does wireless
charging work yes is it the best most
efficient method out there for you to
use not at all the only case where it
does kind of make sense is that
nightstand set up where you could be
playing late at night put it down on the
nightstand and let it charge while
you're sleeping but in a situation where
you're playing during the day and the
battery gets really low and you need
that extra little boost
not exactly the method you want to use
but it's really cool that we got this
set up to work and it's really
interesting to imagine a future where
all handles are going to have this kind
of technology built-in so you can just
charge it simply by setting it down</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
