(techno music)
Sure, a lot of popular Apple products
are able to play games nowadays
across phones to tablets
to even the Apple TV.
But, none of these
devices are really built
for that specific intended purpose.
It was something that was added on later.
What about the concept of an actual
dedicated gaming console from Apple?
That's something that actually did happen
over 20 years ago with the Apple Pippin.
- [Man] The structure of the Pippin is
- Pippy! Atmark!
- Based on every Pippin's
- [Announcer] Scottie Pippen!
- Kind of.
The Apple Pippin wasn't actually
any specific one piece of hardware,
but was instead something that
Apple was experimenting with
during the years between when Steve Jobs
had left the company and
when he had come back.
It was a core concept that
Apple had back in the early 90s
to create a scaled-down simpler version
of Macintosh computers that
were aimed at consumers,
something that could be
a full multimedia device
whether it's for movies,
music, video games, whatever.
And the idea was that instead of making
their own Apple Pippin products,
they would license that core technology
out to other companies.
And they would make whatever
hardware they wanted,
as long as Apple was attached.
By the way, the name Apple
Pippin actually comes
from the type of Apple
called a Newton Pippin
which is a smaller scaled-down version
of the Macintosh Apple.
So, pretty thematically appropriate name.
- [Host] It was a fine apple for eating.
- Now, while Apple was
putting this idea out there,
there weren't that many actual companies
that ended up working with them
before the entire project fell apart.
And, only one in particular
actually made its way
into being a system that was
launched on store shelves.
That was done with the company Bandai.
- This from Bandai!
- Now again this is during
the early to mid 90's
when video games were
really starting to boom
a lot more in the US.
We saw the return of more systems
and we really had that heated rivalry
between Nintendo and Sega.
- What NintenDon't.
- So there's a lot of new people
trying to enter the market.
Bandai's approach was to try
and make a video game console
using Apple's Pippin technology.
The result of this partnership led
to two specific pieces of hardware
that people often refer
to as the Apple Pippin.
One was the Bandai
Atmark released in Japan
and the other was the Bandai
@World released in the US.
A lot of this stuff on paper
sounds pretty good, right?
- [News Anchor] Apple was
betting that the TV would be
the preferred viewing
device with a new approach
to home computing called Pippin.
- So, why did it fail?
(upbeat music)
♪ Pippin, my daydream,
everything inside out, ♪
♪ listen to your heartbeat. ♪
- So, we've got our Pippin opened up,
but now we need some games to play.
We actually do have on hand
one of the Bandai Atmarks.
This was the original model
released in Japan first.
There was that other option, the @World,
which was released
worldwide mostly in the US,
a little bit in Europe
and they are specification-wise,
the same thing.
The only major difference
is the @World was shipped
in a black design and again
was released for different markets.
As you can see, the Atmark
is pretty bulky compared to
its other contemporary systems,
namely the N64 and the
original PlayStation
which focused on having a
very rectangular footprint
and not being very tall,
whereas the Atmark is a lot more kind of
scrunched in and very box-like.
There's a lot more going on in
the main body of it as well.
On the front along with having
the two ports for controllers,
you do also have an audio outport
and there's a bunch of
buttons on the top of the box
that are multimedia controllers.
As I said earlier the Atmark did have
a wireless controller option,
but we actually just have the
wired one here to show off.
It's kind of a weird design.
It reminds me a lot of the
original conceptual pitches
for the PS3 controller which
is very boomerang-shaped.
Of course, this came out
quite a bit before then.
And, you can see how
it's kind of this hybrid
between what was popular
in game controllers,
but also what was happening in PC gaming.
For instance, you can see how it does have
an incorporated handle design,
kind of like what the
N64 and PlayStation has,
but it is incorporated
into one singular shape.
The biggest influence though
from PC and Mac gaming
is the fact that it has
actual trackball for controls,
along with having a D-Pad,
four front facing buttons,
three buttons on the bottom
and two shoulder buttons
that are really inset.
It's certainly an overall design
that makes a very clear
statement about being different
from the competition,
although in retrospect,
I'm not sure if visually
these aged very well
compared to what the
other systems have done.
Though the N64 controller
is an abomination.
So, having this on hand I did want to try
to be able to get some
games to play on it,
which are actually really
really hard to track down.
So, I decided to go a
slightly slightly shadier way
of getting it to work which actually
I still couldn't get to work.
So, we had to call in
our resident Apple expert
to help us figure out
what we needed to do.
So, Travis, I have a bit
of a confession to make.
The main reason we're
making this video right now
is because I really wanted to play
Super Marathon on the Pippin
and I couldn't get it to work.
So, I needed an excuse
to make you figure it.
Why can't I get this to work?
Or why couldn't I get this to work?
- So, after some quick discovery,
I found out that Pippin games
are actually somewhat complex
because the operating system
and the game live on the disc
and those are basically married together.
So, a lot of games that are available
and there aren't very many,
online they just have the game files.
The Pippin actually can't load
an operating system to make the game boot.
I went through a series of steps
going from a Windows
computer to back to a Mac,
and then back and forth to
finally be able to burn them
and get them to work with both
the operating system and the game files.
You can see here that we
actually had our first attempt
not go well and that I kind of went back
to the drawing board
and looked at some of the
newer, different options.
We got to what you have now.
- So, it works then?
- It does work now.
- Yes.
- Yes.
- When it was first released in 1996,
there was a lot this
console had going for it
that its competition like the N64
and the PlayStation didn't have.
It supported 16-bit color,
it had an early form of
a wireless controller,
it wasn't region-locked
so you could actually
play games from Japan on the
US version or vice versa.
Like the PlayStation, it was
an early disc based system,
and its tech specs were well above
what a lot of the competition had.
Most intriguing of all though
this was one of the first
gaming focused consoles
that actually offered
an Internet connection
and had the ability to
use an Internet browser.
- [Person] So, the Apple computer page.
- This was a feature that
was super ahead of its time.
Keep in mind, a lot of people make
that same statement about the Dreamcast
which came out two years
later after the Pippin.
The Pippin was also one
of the first systems
that really tried walking that kind of
in between the line of a gaming console
and a home personal computer
including the fact that it
supported both AV out and VGA.
You could either hook it up
to your home's main television system
and use it like a set-top box
or connect it to a
monitor for a desk set up.
Because of its origins
as a multimedia device
for the core Pippin technology,
the kind of games that were available
in the Atmark and @World
were pretty varied,
including some titles that were
more traditional full-blown video games
and games that were more
along the lines of edutainment
or kind of just creative programs.
- To e-mail, you can
send and receive messages
to and from anywhere in the world.
- Because of its origins
and Pippin being designed
for multimedia use,
the kind of games that were on the Atmark
and @World were pretty varied.
On one end of the spectrum,
you had very traditional
straight up video games,
a really good example being Marathon
which was Bungie's kind
of prototype early version
of what eventually
became Halo on the Xbox.
And, on the other end of the spectrum,
you had games that were
more like edutainment
and a lot of which relied on licenses
that Bandai had access
to like Dragon Ball.
We have the Pippin hooked up
and we have our selection of
completely legitimate games
that should be working,
or so Travis tells me.
Yes, it's definitely from the 90s.
So, this is insane that right now it's
reading the OS off of that disc.
It has to make this boot title
a lot slower than it
would have been otherwise.
I have to use the trackball
to move the mouse,
so that's already wonderful
which views selects.
The answer is the shoulder button.
I guess it's kind of
works like mouse clicks.
It even has kind of a clicky-ness to it.
It's weird to think that
Bungie technically worked
on the Apple game before they
worked on a Microsoft one.
Ooo, boy! Okay, so all right.
How do I fire?
He's coming for me.
There we go.
I think I crouched on accident.
(gunfire)
Blood everywhere!
This is awesome.
And, I am bad at it.
Turning it back on.
- [Game Console] Pippin.
- That sounded weird.
Should we play that sound again?
Let's play that sound again.
- [Game Console] Pippin.
- Yeah, that's weird.
Trackballs are the worse
form of control ever.
Try this again.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, this is 90s.
Do you see the high-quality graphics here?
Oh, boy, this is certainly a game.
What is happening?
(laughing)
Get 50% for weapon.
Well, the Pippin had a lot
of cool stuff going for it.
It had a lot more problems that led
to its pretty immediate failure.
First of all is the one
weakness that a lot of consoles
had their downfall caused by price point.
When it came out in 1996,
there were already a couple
of new generation systems out,
and one of the leading examples
was the PlayStation
which launched at $299.
By comparison, the Pippin
launched at $599, twice as much,
making it a very expensive option
compared to the competition.
- [Man] Bandai is shipping
this device now at 648,000 yen
which is set by today's
rate of about $650.
That's for the device, the
modem, and five titles.
- While the technology behind
the system might have been
an argument for why it had
such a high price point,
it wasn't helped by the fact
that there wasn't really
a software library
that made it enticing enough for people
to want to buy in the first place.
Sure, they had some licenses to work with,
like Dragon Ball, but
no major game developers
at the time were really interested
in working with Apple or Bandai.
They already had agreements to work either
with Nintendo still, Sega,
or switched over to Sony
when the PlayStation came.
Another huge problem is that
one of the unique features
of the Pippin that might have
been a strong selling point,
the ability to browse the Internet,
just didn't work very well.
The modem that was built into the Pippin
was under half the
speed of standard modems
at the time they were out during 1996.
There was the problem that if
you hooked it up to the TV,
which a lot of people would have,
considering that it was
treated like a game console,
well, you couldn't actually read anything
in the browser because CRTs
weren't high enough resolution
to display modern web pages at the time.
All of these problems combined
with a lack of advertising
behind the Atmark and
@World caused the systems
to sell greatly under what Apple
and Bandai were hoping for.
And, the final nail on the
coffin is when Steve Jobs
returned to Apple and did away
with any programs they had
that involved any of
kind of clone technology,
AKA licensing out their software
to other companies to build things off of.
They wanted to now make
everything in-house,
making the Pippen one of
the immediate projects
that was put to an end.
The Apple Pippin systems
had their problems
and in retrospect it makes
sense why they failed,
but they really did lay the groundwork
for a lot of features
that are now standard
in modern day consoles.
And, were one of the first steps
to truly making a
multimedia gaming system.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
