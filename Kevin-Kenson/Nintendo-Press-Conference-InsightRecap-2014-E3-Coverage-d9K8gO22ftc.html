guys the third and final III press
conference response vid this time for
Nintendo now Nintendo actually had the
shortest press conference of them all
weighing in at only about 45 minutes but
it made up for with a lot of dense and
really good brand new announcements
first off we got to see some new
trailers and new gameplay for a few
games we already knew about and have
been waiting patiently for we got new
trailers for Xenoblade Chronicles X and
the pokemon ruby and sapphire remakes we
also got to see some more gameplay for
Hyrule warriors which looked a lot
better than when we first saw six months
ago and we also got to see some more
gameplay for the new yarn Yoshi game now
titled Yoshi's wooly world we also got a
new trailer for Bayonetta 2 which also
announced that the game will be
including the first Bayonetta remade for
the Wii U now of course the one big game
that a lot of us have just been waiting
on and want to get as much information
about as soon as possible is the new
super smash brothers for Wii U and 3ds
which we did get a couple of different
announcements for first off we got one
more confirmed character in the form of
palutena from Kid Icarus but more
interestingly they also announced me
fighters now me fighters of course take
your me but you can customize it a lot
there's three different base forms to
choose from between fist fighter a
swordsman and a gunner and each of those
have 12 different special moves to pick
from to use for now there was one other
announcement linked to Super Smash
Brothers that was a little weirder and a
lot of people aren't sure how to react
to entirely just yet and those are
amiibos these are little statues of
different popular Nintendo characters
that will have different uses across
multiple games but the only one planned
for right now is Super Smash Brothers
where you can scan it on your Wii U
gamepad and it'll add that character
into the game either as a friendly AI or
for someone your opponent to fight and
the more times you use the amiibo the
tougher the fighter gets honestly this
wasn't exactly my most favorite
announcement to come out in Nintendo
today but it is a little mildly
interesting and I'm curious to see what
they'll do with it in time as of right
now with just the Super Smash Brothers
use not to interested just yet now one
of the biggest things that come out of
the press conference though was just the
number of brand new games for the Wii U
that I don't think any of us really
anticipated to begin with there's a new
IP featuring toad as the main character
called captain toad treasure tracker and
we also are getting a sequel to Kirby's
canvas curse for the Wii U
called Kirby and the rainbow curse we
also got the announcement of the Mario
maker this is an editor for the Wii U
that lets you make your own 2d style
Mario levels that can be played in both
retro style
2d graphics or in the more recent style
where their 3d but still played on a 2d
plane now by far though I think the
biggest two that really made a big
impact at today's press conference
though was first off the announcement of
Zelda Wii U with just a little bit of
gameplay tease showing a more open world
style Hyrule and then there was one
other brand-new game which I think
caught a lot of people off guard which
is splatoon now it's really hard to
describe you what makes this game looks
so fun without actually watching
gameplay for yourself so you should
really look this up but the basic idea
is that you're playing a multiplayer
competitive game but instead of trying
to defeat your opponents you're trying
to cover the map in your team's color
paint kind of weird to describe I know
but take a look at the gameplay it looks
like a lot of fun and really interesting
so overall Nintendo's press conference
really surprised me and in all honesty I
have to say that for me personally it
was my favorite press conference out of
all five we've seen it was the shortest
but there was just nothing but strong
announcement after strong announcement
with the small weak little exception of
the amiibo as for the rest of the press
conferences I would probably rank it
more or less as Microsoft in second
place followed by Sony followed by
Ubisoft followed by EA but none of them
was really particularly that weak we
also didn't have anything particularly
earth-shattering but overall each press
conference had some great announcements
it looks like we've got a good year
ahead of us for games if you guys want
to catch the other videos I did post
earlier covering those other press
conferences I do have those linked down
below with one of them linked at the end
