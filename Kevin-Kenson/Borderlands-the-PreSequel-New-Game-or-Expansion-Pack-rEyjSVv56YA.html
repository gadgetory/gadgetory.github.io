we're going to talk about Borderlands
the pre-sequel this is the third entry
in the borderlands franchise but is also
the first one not to come from its
original developer gearbox but instead
2k games Australia and at first glance
this is a pretty obvious fact
considering that this game looks a lot
like Borderlands 2 so the big question
is what does this one actually do
different from its predecessor and is
that enough to make it stand out as its
own significant title does it do enough
to warrant purchasing at a full price
game so let's go ahead and talk about
that and to start with let's look at how
this one fits into the rest of the
series as the title suggests the
pre-sequel takes place before
Borderlands 2 and after the first game
though it's worth noting its hope from a
retrospective point of view containing
spoilers from events in the second game
as is traditional to the series players
take on the roles of one of four
different vault hunters with the one
interesting twist this time around being
that instead of having a cast of all new
characters each of these hunters have
previously appeared either as an NPC or
boss enemy with one particularly popular
example standing out the game story
revolves entirely around tues antagonist
handsome Jack and how his rise to power
took place helping to explain events
that lead to the massive changes between
Borderlands one and two as a result you
as a character feel like you actually a
very little agency even by the series
standard as most of your missions
revolve around getting Jack access to
one place or another and help him
achieve his goals now thanks to the fact
that the part of gearboxes staff still
involved in this game was the writing
team a lot of the writing is consistent
between this title and what happens in
Borderlands 2 and there's very little in
the form of plot holes or at least what
you can get away with in a game whose
storytelling is so over-the-top the
overarching story really isn't anything
too special though that's never been a
huge strength in the series it does
still however maintain the trademark
silly dialogue referential humour and
interesting new forms of cursing the
pacing and flow of this game is a little
bit on the wonky side missions seem
awkwardly spread out and there are
situations which you can easily be over
levelled for the main quest yet
something's only update with main quest
progression which creates problems for
instance it actually takes quite a bit
of time for you to finally unlock your
third gun slot and the fourth comes
pretty quickly right after it plus there
are numerous times where the main story
requires you to
be one level yet all the side quests
unlocked alongside it are noticeably way
below where you are in the game turning
them into busy work just to grab an okay
gun or grind out several of them to make
the one or two levels you need to
progress now the core mechanics of this
game are very easily recognizable it all
boils down right back to the same
formula of except quests blow stuff up
get bigger and better loot and wash
rinse and repeat players level up each
vault hunter customizing them through
skill trees and equipment which comes in
the now very familiar colorful array of
rarities hoping to signify particularly
cool stuff for your level while the game
can be tackled single-player doing so is
highly recommended against as the game's
difficulty and loot drops become
significantly more interesting when a
team of players using different
characters or at least different builds
work together so if you've played any
previous Borderlands games or any loop
grinding games in general a lot of this
is going to be very very familiar
territory and as I said earlier it is
very alarming at how many similarities
there are between this game and
borderlands 2 so let's start talking
about what changes actually do exist
first off most obviously are the vault
hunters themselves and I'm not just
talking in terms of their appearances
and voices one thing I really
appreciated in this entry is that the
vault hunters action skills are
noticeably pretty different from
previous entries the cast from
Borderlands 2 all featured moves that
were very familiar to skills from
Borderlands one and felt more like
remixes than brand new moves whereas
most of the action skills in pre sequel
feel really unique in particular the
lawbreakers ability to go into a
temporary auto aim mode and claptraps
EXE ability which activates one of the
many different special programs offering
numerous different buffs some of which
are good some of which are really good
some are bad and some are just plain
weird on a related note character
advancement in this game is also
considerably faster action skills are
unlocked sooner and reaching an
individual talent trees final node can
be achieved as early as level 25 rather
than 31 weapons feature many of the same
enhancements as before though elemental
types have been shifted around a little
bit the slack element introduced in bl2
is gone and instead there's a new cryo
element giving you the ability to freeze
enemies in place and deal damage over
time which is really useful a new gun
type has also been introduced in the
form of laser cannons which come in a
wide variety emulating other gun
training from spread out shots and rapid
fire to long-range precision rifles or
even constant beings while those are
basically all the changes for just the
guns themselves the game has introduced
one new interesting way to get new guns
and that's the grinder a machine that
allows you to mix three weapons of the
same rarity to try and get a new one of
one level higher which sounds really
awesome at first but keep in mind that
whatever you create matches the lowest
level item you put in rather than be an
average so creating up-to-date powerful
weapons will still be really costly this
is also a way to spend the game
secondary currency moonstone which
thankfully has more uses beyond just
simply purchasing weapon capacity
upgrades as I said it can be used to
make better items using the grinding
machine or can be used to purchase
special drinks that give you different
temporary bonuses in game now the game's
largest mechanical change though is the
low gravity since most of the game takes
place on a moon players are able to turn
this to their advantage by being able to
not only jump higher but make use of a
note to kit enabling them to do minor
midair boosts or slam into the ground
damaging enemies around them 02 kits are
the new equipment slot item which not
only impacts how much air you can
breathe but also grants benefits to your
slam attack and usually offers numerous
bonuses related to in air combat the low
graph does create problems sometimes
with how far useful items can fly I've
had a few cases where a cool drop ends
up landing in the middle of a no reach
zone such as in the middle of insta
death hot lava but at the same time you
begin to miss it rather quickly in the
game's few non low grav areas as the
jumping height is super useful and
changes up party tactics for finding
good positions now there are a couple
other little minor changes new mechanics
introduced in this game one of the most
useful ones being the fact that you can
now inspect other players to see their
equipments and builds but that's
basically it and while some of these
changes are really appreciated it really
does very little to change up the
overall game itself making this feel
much more like an expansion to
borderlands 2 rather than a brand new
standalone game that being said I still
enjoyed a lot of my time with it one of
the benefits of changing so little is
that if the formula does work people can
still enjoy it even if some get angry at
the lack of innovation or change if you
have a group of friends to play with and
this can definitely still be worth
picking up at some point but considering
the number of games on the horizon and
how little of a new experience the
pre-sequel is
definitely a game you can wait on a few
price drops for which in this case is
inevitable considering the series
history with DLC content it is a bit of
a cash grab to be sure but if you're a
fan of the series then you'll definitely
still find it enjoyable with a good
group of friends I just think it'd also
be a safe move to wait till your
investment in it is something less than
60 bucks well that was my review of
