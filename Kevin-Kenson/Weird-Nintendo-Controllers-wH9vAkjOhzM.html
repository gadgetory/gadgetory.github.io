but something that at least Nintendo
hasn't really done a lot of yet that
kind of surprises me and honestly even
disappoints me a little it's stuff like
these controllers or at least plastic
molded things you could put controllers
into they give you an interesting and
kind of weird way to interact with games
next Nintendo is messed with this idea a
little bit they released a steering
wheel from Mario Kart and then there is
all of LeBeau which is kind of its own
separate category in my mind so it's
coming down to a lot of third-party
companies to do things like this gun and
fishing rod I forgot what a fishing rod
was called for a moment okay so first we
are going to try the fishing rod out are
there two different cabins and I didn't
make either of them and then we wait for
it to load forever with a ps2 style
loading screen
let's okay that's reverse that's not
forward that's forward okay so this game
uses limited motion controls like it
still relies heavily on using the
buttons and everything but you're gonna
use much controls for at least casting
which you know having the fishing rod
shaped thing works for and then for
reeling in which is why this is shaped
this way so let's actually get to a spot
to fish Nate Beck I didn't do it heavy
enough and then freaked out okay try
this again trans get ha I didn't go very
far then we're in the ocean I don't see
any fish though I'm just gonna slowly
reel in huh anything here we just reel
it in is this even almost wonder if like
it's not enough set still no fish in you
where okay so next let's try out the
rival which does use a little more
precise motion controls at least a
little more naturally cuz you're you
have to aim the gun just a little bit
the game still not great but uh at least
the motor controls are working here
sadly it's not like the we where just
because how the motor controls work
differently it's not situation where you
know you can point a name somewhere on
the screen and that's where you hit
instead you're still using a stick to
look around but you can make little
adjustments it's kind of like aiming a
bow and Zelda okay look guys neither of
these accessories are particularly good
well at least the game is there for it's
not really their fault that they're just
designed for stuff that is this way but
you know it gets me thinking though
about all the stuff you've seen in the
past that enjoys the idea of using a
controller inside of something else now
normally when people think of this
concept they think a lot
about the Wii because there was a lot of
we accessories that were built around
that whether it's the wheel or other gun
attachments like this or even the
bowling ball that existed for some
reason but actually when it comes to
Nintendo this concept goes way further
back than that the first time Nintendo
actually had an accessory where you put
a controller inside of something else to
get a bizarre and weird way to control
the game was robbed the robot and to
actually show you guys this we actually
need to go get one so let's go right now
so we got lucky and found the robot
we're looking for it was in great
condition too so let's get back to the
office and check it out nowadays a lot
of people know Rob the robot from his
appearances in the Super Smash Brothers
series of games but I find that a lot of
people don't actually know what Rob the
robot is you know they know that it's a
reference to some kind of old-school
Nintendo thing it's a product they sold
but they don't know why he exists or
what it even did for the old school
systems and it's actually very
interesting so Rob actually stands for
robotic operating buddy and the entire
concept is that he plays games alongside
you where you'll give him commands by
doing stuff on the screen and then he
will hit buttons on the Nintendo
controller through a very indirect
method that we're gonna actually show
you in a little bit but the reason why
he exists is because it was basically a
way for a Nintendo to tell people that
the NES wasn't a gaming system see back
when Nintendo was first coming over to
the u.s. to try and sell their systems
the artsy's wasn't very happy with video
games there was a major crash back in 83
and all the major companies are around
for the US and gaming just did not do
well so there was this very heavy stigma
attached to gaming consoles just not
being a good investment or something
that people should really buy so to try
and combat that Nintendo instead
marketed their system as a very advanced
toy so you're buying the NES but the
actual thing is Rob the robot he's this
toy that plays games with you the games
are really the focus don't worry about
that you have to buy this with it but
the robot is really the focus when you
master Rob the video robot
and meet the challenge of gyromite
with
but it was gamble that really paid off
and eventually got it into a lot more
households now despite the fact that
robbed robot was the really heavy focus
of how they advertised the Nintendo
early on there's only two games that
actually make use of him gyromite which
we have hooked up and ready to go right
now and then a game called stack up now
each of these would use different
attachments under op and would interact
with them in different ways but we're
gonna actually take a look at how you
would play with Rob in gyromite so the
way Rob would work is actually very
similar to a light gun that you use for
something like duck hunt we're using
this controller I'm gonna input
different commands in the game and the
game's gonna flash certain lights the
Rob is gonna see recognize and do that
command so here we are on the map right
here and so the entire goal of this game
is you're trying to navigate around it
and you're trying to raise and lower
these colourful pipes so first let's
move this blue pipe which is gonna take
a lot of work he's not on first we have
to pick up one of the spinners pick it
up there we go
this is all to raise one single pillar
by the way it's gonna take a second we
gotta get spinning because if this
people stand on its own go take it back
up and drop it down
and there we go and that hits mutton all
of that now let's say you wanted to be
able to also hit the red button right
after but sub the blue button press down
well that's why the spinner is important
because we can let go of it and it's
still gonna stay in place though as it
starts to lose momentum it's gonna
eventually fall off and that's a whole
another problem so as you can see it
takes a lot to be able to actually play
this game properly with Rob almost a
little too much to be honest this game
is a lot of fun with to actual people
but with Rob it's a little hits alone
knowing and tedious over time but it's
still a really interesting idea and just
for its time this was such cool tech now
obviously I don't think Nintendo
necessarily needs to make a new Rob the
robot for the switch but this all goes
once again to the idea of just really
interesting accessories that involve
docking controller and some different
method and I really think the switch can
benefit from more design ideas like that
because right now we basically just have
a steering wheel and robots are cool</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
