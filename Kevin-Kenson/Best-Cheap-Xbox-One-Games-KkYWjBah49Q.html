library with a lot of great games that
aren't going to destroy your wall and a
lot of them at least console wise are
exclusive to Xbox one so whether you're
a long-term Xbox 1s owner or you're
planning and picking up a 1x later this
year let's talk about the best games you
can grab for 20 bucks and under and
we're gonna kick things off with what's
probably the highest profile game on
this list Tacoma Tacoma is the second
game from fulbright the developer behind
the indie cult hit gone home and just
like gone home Tacoma is a narrative
focused game those of you that are only
interested in games that involve
explosions blowing things up platforming
you're just more traditional gameplay
kind of stuff you might not find this to
your taste but if you're a fan of good
narrative you're gonna feel right at
home here in Tacoma you'll be exploring
a recently deserted Space Station where
you're able to run AR simulations to see
what the crew was doing right as
everything went horribly wrong allowing
you to explore each of their backstories
character relationships all through
these little simulated movies that you
can fast-forward rewind and freely
travel the station being able to follow
people through hallways or see what one
person was saying to someone else for
Wynd
and then see what the other guys were
talking about at the same time alongside
this ability to explore the game's
narrative freely in whatever way feels
natural to you there are just a little
bit of traditional gameplay bits thrown
in as well for instance through
conversations you'll be able to glean
interesting information such as codes to
enter restricted areas once again if
you're looking for an action game this
isn't it but any fan of narrative
definitely should check this game out
next tip is a game that not only is the
distinction of being fairly cheap to
begin with but it's actually free right
now if you have Xbox Live Gold
and that's slime Ranger slime rancher is
a rather interesting spin on the farming
simulator genre where you own a ranch
populated by nothing but well slimes
you spend the game capturing them
putting them in pens finding their
correct items to feed them capturing
other slimes bringing them together it's
one of those games where the entire goal
is really just to push onward and keep
finding stuff to do it's kind of got a
weird Zen attitude to it there isn't
exactly a traditional way to beat the
game exactly other than the progress as
much as you want and just lose track of
time building up your ranch right now
your goal is to bring slimes to the pen
take their poop and sell it for money
that isn't to say that nothing can go
wrong in this game there are totally
ways that you can start messing up your
ranch but it's all tied together in this
really just sickeningly adorable package
that makes it all the more addictive
look it's free right now Xbox Live Gold
check it out definitely worth playing
next is a game that is a bit of a hidden
gem because I had actually never heard
of it until I started researching games
that were in this lower price range and
that's telling not included now this is
a very simple little platformer with a
really charming aesthetic and everything
is set up like it's a stage play in fact
the levels are even constantly evolving
as you're going through them it's just
one stage that's constantly shifting to
change the levels design and you're
doing your best to get the highest score
possible now it is a little bit on the
short side even for its low price-point
but if you're the kind of person that's
obsessing over getting the highest score
possible in every stage there is a lot
of time to sink into this game to help
keep things from getting stale the game
is also divided into three separate acts
each of which features a different main
character with a different set of
abilities changing up the gameplay each
time so once you think you've gotten
settled in and you're getting the best
score as you can now you have to learn a
whole nother character all over again
it's simple fun and most notably a
really charming game that for 15 bucks
is well worth picking up rivals of
aether is a fairly obvious match clone
but a really good one focused on having
a small roster of only eight characters
9 with DLC each which play very very
differently however they all have their
own unique gimmicks and traits and
different play styles that makes each
one a pretty unique experience while the
core of the game is very clearly smash
brothers it does enough of its own
changes to give it its own interesting
twist blocking has been replaced by a
timed parry you cannot ledge grab but it
can instead do wall jumps and smash
tacks have their own dedicated button
the game is only 15 bucks to start 20
bucks if you want to grab the Ori DLC as
well honestly fighting game fans even
people that don't even like smash
brothers this game is totally worth
checking out
now I'm gonna cheat a little bit because
one game on this list isn't technically
fully released yet it's one of the early
access games an Xbox but honestly it's
worth every penny as it is right now and
that's pit people bit people is the
newest game from the behemoth the same
developers behind battleblock theater
and Castle Crashers and just like those
games this features a ton of absurd
humor
it still has really in-depth and
interesting mechanics I've been a
longtime fan of tactics games and one of
the things I really like about pit
people is that it brings this very
interesting balance of simplicity of the
genre where really all you need to do is
move characters to the right positions
and the AI handles the rest but at the
same time where you actually put people
position wise is very very important the
learning curve is very easy to pick up
but there is a lot of complex nuances to
this game and there's tons of different
game modes to choose from there's
storyline quests PvP locally online just
all kinds of content to do and lots of
stuff to unlock word of warning to
anyone that's never played a behemoths
game before this game is absolutely I
almost said this game is absolutely
insane you are going to have no idea
what's happening at all for the first 20
minutes plot wise but that's totally ok
because it is hilarious because this
game is an early access it is currently
incomplete it does not a full game just
yet but there are constantly updates
happening that are adding new quests new
characters new everything so honestly
just jump on board right now and enjoy
the ride so there you have some of the
best cheap games you can grab on Xbox
one right now now all we need to do is
wait another month 4-cup had to come out
so it's hopefully good enough to kick
one of these games off because it better
be after this long wait</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
