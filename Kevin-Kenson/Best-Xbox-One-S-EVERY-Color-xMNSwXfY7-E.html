improved Xbox 1's offering some pretty
big upgrades from the original and
despite it only having been a few months
we already have five different colors
thanks to celebrating major game
launches and of course the holiday
season so after getting our hands on all
five of them
let's check each one out now I'm going
to rank these things based on my
personal preference but if there's one
that you guys love make sure let me know
down below in the comments
starting off at the bottom my least
favorite Xbox 1s is easily the military
green Xbox one for battlefield one now
for the price grabbing the game early
and a larger hard drive altogether is a
great deal but honestly when it comes
just the system's look on its own I
really just do not like it it might work
for some others and I'm sure there's
some entertainment setups it'll fit
right in with but for me this drab green
just does absolutely nothing it's just
the right balance of being not only
subdued but also not really that
appealing of a color to start with
unless your entertainment center is
driving a military theme hard I just
don't see this thing blending in well at
all now next up is storm gray this is
another special edition system
celebrating battlefield One's launch but
unlike the military green option it's
only a 500 gigabyte hard drive as
opposed to one terabyte and it's
actually limited to specific retailers
the only way to get one of these is
through Walmart or directly from the
Microsoft Store now like with the
military green I'm not a huge fan of
super dull colors for my system but this
gray is definitely a big improvement on
the military green and much more up my
alley or if you're just a fan of dark
systems this is about as close as you're
gonna get right now to a black Xbox one
s without doing a custom job for third
place the bronze medal is gonna go to
the deep blue this one's kind of a weird
one because it wasn't released for any
particular game or celebration I mean it
is packaged with Gears of War but it
didn't even come out when the game did
what is kind of special about this
edition though is that like the storm
gray it's a store specific special
edition only being available via the
Microsoft Store and Game Stop now also
like the storm gray since this is a
special edition but not the headliner
for this particular game you're stuck
with just a 500 gigabyte hard drive
which is kind of a shame really because
of all the
coloured options this thing is
great-looking one thing I really like is
that even though this is a matte finish
something about this particular color
does give it just a bit of shine in the
right light my only real problem with it
is honestly the big problem I have with
all three of the colors so far on the
list there is no sense of trim going on
here the base is a slightly darker blue
but it just makes the whole thing look
like the system was spray painted one
color a black or maybe even a white base
would have done wonders for this but
even without it it's still a great
looking system coming in second from the
top is the Gears of War Crimson omen now
while all the others on this list have
been special editions this is the one
system it's actually a full-blown
limited edition design released to
celebrate Gears of War 4 and packaged
with a 2 terabyte hard drive the largest
available size in any Xbox 1s right now
while the other systems are just
different colors this is a full custom
job on the Xbox one s with physical
modifications like fake claw marks and a
paint job that's all over the place with
splotches of dark red and Gears of War
symbols it even features its own unique
startup and powered down sounds this
strength however is also its weakness
this system is super showy and not
necessarily in a way most people are
going to love for a hardcore Gears fan
it accomplishes exactly what it needs to
do but for anyone else it's a
it's a bit much
I will say I really really love the dark
red color choice if they had a solid
color option of it available with a
black base I would a hundred percent be
sold and it'd be number one in this list
but as it stands this is a fan pleaser
and not for everyone now you've probably
guessed by this point what's on top
that's right
the original regular white xbox 1s now I
know some of you might be thinking what
the hell are you doing putting the
standard white xbox one at the top when
you've got all these special and limited
editions around here's the thing basic
is not bad and it honestly makes perfect
sense for the white system to be on top
because it meets the number one goal the
core system should it's the best-looking
system for most people while all these
other colors might fulfill some special
case or personal taste the white Xbox 1s
is honestly just flat-out best-looking
for most setups and a large part of that
for me
is thanks to its hard contrast between
its white and black parts while the
other systems are all painted
practically one color with a shade
difference or have all these insane
designs the basic white Xbox one has
just has this clean sharp look thanks to
having a black base that makes the white
of the system really pop and stand out
the others might be cool for some very
specific setup ideas but at the end of
the day the regular white Xbox 1s just
wins</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
