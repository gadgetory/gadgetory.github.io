let's take a look your box because just
like the smash one I really love what
they did design what it is sometimes
boxes your special-edition systems can
be a little boring this one looks great
the front side shows up the system a
little bit won't work in the back is
showing a number of the characters
fighting it's Diablo himself and it
looks awesome now things are a little
different with this special edition
compared to the smash one in terms of
what actually has been customized or
changed once again we do have a custom
dock and it's using the same kind of
aesthetic of putting things on the left
and right side of the Nintendo switch
logo in this particular case we have a
demon facing off against an angel we're
not seeing the kind of shading effect
they used on the smash one it's really
just one tone of gray with the black but
it still looks really nice and then
unlike the smash phone we still have
regular joi cons but the switch itself
is a special edition where you have half
of Diablos face covering just the one
side of the switch now this is a pretty
minimalist approach but I will say it
does look really nice I wish there was
just a little more going on I understand
it's a little tough to work with this
side because of the kickstand but for
what design we do have I think it looks
really nice my only real complaint with
this bundle is the joy cons I feel like
using the regular gray ones is just it's
a little weak I think especially cuz
we're using grey for the prints on the
back of the switch and for on the front
of the dock I think just a little bit of
color could have really helped
especially because in Diablo I mean
there's a really heavy use of the colors
red and orange and seeing eyes are those
present on the droid cons I think would
have been really well either using the
Mario red joy cons which I can kind of
get them not using because I want to
keep that as a Mario thing but even the
neon red which kind of tilt more towards
orange whatever think fit this a lot
better now along with all the normal
stuff you're getting a switch bundle
like the switch itself joy Kahn's dock
grip and cables there's a couple extra
things as a bundle comes with you do get
a digital copy of Diablo 3 which you
know makes sense that's a bundle but one
extra item that we didn't see with the
smash bundle is you also get a little
carrying case now this isn't the most
extensive one out of the ones you can
get on the market a lot of other ones
are larger those more protective this is
a pretty basic one it's large enough to
carry the switch itself as well it's a
small handful of other games it doesn't
really have room for any cables or extra
joint cons it's a pretty minimal small
one it gets the job done and I do think
it looks really nice I like the red and
black they went for on this you can kind
of see that there's actually two
different blacks going on on the
three kind of dislike glyph print going
out of the background with the Blizzard
name and on this side you've Diablos
head with a glyph behind it as well I
really like the red they chose for this
this is the kind of red I had in mind
for what I would love to see on the joy
Khan's
it just thinks it works really well
we're celebrating the series and goes
really well with that black by the way
if you grab the system and you really
like the idea of red joy Kahn's we don't
want to spend a bunch of money on
getting new ones a great option is skins
like these from today's sponsor D brand
they have a whole line of switch skins
that are completely safe to use and gain
for the switch itself for the joint
country even the dock I think this red
looks really good with the Diablo design
but you could also go with maybe an
orange they have a whole bunch of other
colors to choose from you want to come
out check out the link down below so
something is not actually a part of the
bundle but is kind of tied into it I
really thought was cool so I'm going to
pick it up and show it off with this as
well is they also have a Diablo 3
wireless controller now this is not an
official Nintendo switch pro controller
this is actually based on the powering
Wireless and enhanced controllers which
came out a couple weeks back and I did a
review on if a couple different colors
and designs out but this is a new option
based on Diablo 3 that I think looks
really nice you've got Diablos face on
the main body the controller the name on
one of the handles which I could maybe
do without but it doesn't look terrible
but I also really just love the color
choice here where you have this kind of
dark black for most of the night main
body and then we use that same kind of
muddy dark red for all the buttons
including the ones in the back which is
a great contrast and then just for some
of the lettering we've got a brighter
orange that gives just a little bit of a
nice balance of the red now if you're
not familiar with the enhanced watts
controller this is basically the first
real competitor to the Nintendo switch
pro controller for a wireless controller
option on the switch there have been
other options kind of those usually
involve weird high jinks to do things
like making an Xbox one or ps4
controller work as far as an
officially-licensed controller goes this
is the first real option as far as
differences go between this and the
official pro controller there really
aren't nearly as many as you would think
the button layout is very similar the
sticks have the same kind of design a
lot of the button feel and stick feel
feels
basically the same the biggest downside
to this is that you are losing out on a
couple major functions of the pro
controller like having built-in Rumble
which is really the biggest loss to me
and the ability to scan amiibos but it
does still have motion controls which is
nice
another change it's kind of upside kind
of downside depending on your personal
preference is that instead of being a
rechargeable controller like a pro one
this one actually runs on double-a
batteries so you will get a longer
charge out of a single set of batteries
but if you run out you have to go and
buy batteries batteries not included
now there is one just a complete upside
of this controller versus it and that is
the addition of two buttons on the back
which you can program to act as any of
the front facing buttons or the top
shoulder buttons giving you just a
little bit of customization over control
and can make certain games a lot easier
for all of this it runs a little cheaper
than a standard pro controller at 50
bucks and if you're a Fed Diablo I think
this is an awesome little pick up if
you're not able to get the system or
your to have a switch you don't want to
spend money on entirely another one I
think this is a great other option if
you want to pick this up I'll put it
down below in the description along with
links to the system as well once again
kinda like let's smash one I don't know
if I recommend picking this one up if
you're looking to upgrade your switch to
a cooler design but if you don't own a
switch yet this is a great one to pick
up to be your first one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
