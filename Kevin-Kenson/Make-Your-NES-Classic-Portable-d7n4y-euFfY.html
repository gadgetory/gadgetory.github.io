awesome collector's piece taking the
original Nintendo Entertainment System
and 30 of some of its most awesome games
and shoving it all in one tiny little
portable box but I think there's a way
we can make this thing even cooler the
classic edition is a love letter to
Nintendo's oldest fans who grew up with
the original system back in the mid 80s
it's about 1/8 the size of the original
system and while it doesn't exactly
operate the same just being a sealed off
little box with no cards one thing that
is absolutely amazing about it is how
much love was given to its presentation
it be easy enough for the system's
interface to be a boring list of 30
games owners can boot up but instead
Nintendo gave this thing some attention
with a great-looking gallery of games an
easy to find and well presented list of
settings and even a cute little demo
teaser of Mario running around jumping
into every game and it isn't just the
software the build quality of this thing
is superb despite its small size and
light weight the NES itself feels pretty
solid and while the controllers may look
just like the originals at first glance
and be fair are just as it comfortable
by today's standards the button quality
is terrific and feels just great since
it has an HDMI output you can use this
thing with any modern TV rather than
having to deal with an upscale ER or
using an old CRT with the original
system and the image quality is
fantastic really this thing is just a
few steps away from being flat-out
amazing and the only things holding it
back are the lack of a wireless
controller which there are some
off-brand options available and more
importantly a method for expanding the
devices library now all that being said
the NES classic is a neat little
addition to your home room setup but
let's do something a little fun and a
little dumb to take this thing in the
next level
full portability thanks to its power
port being micro USB you don't have to
rely on a traditional wall plug-in to
power this thing instead you can take
just about any portable battery with USB
ports and hook it up simply running the
games doesn't drink that much power so
you'd be surprised how long it'll last
now what about actually seeing games
well that's where this camera monitor
comes in just run HDMI into one of these
plug in some headphones and you've got a
fully powered retro gaming setup free of
any kind of placement restrictions
the camera monitor runs off of its own
rechargeable batteries separate from the
battery bank of the NES has plugged in
too and most can give you as much as 2
hours of battery life
not exactly a full-on handheld but
considering the setup it's kind of
amazing especially considering using a
full NES set up with a controller is
this practical not at all is it super
freaking cool absolutely if you're
curious about doing this setup I've got
links down below to all the stuff we
used along with some alternative options
that are a little more affordable if you
don't want to break your bank for this
set up of course right now if you're
looking at buying an NES classic edition
off of ebay you might have already done
that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
