people have been waiting on ever since
it was announced as being one of the big
exclusive titles for the Xbox one
promising to introduce a kind of game
that was uniquely representative of the
system's motto being an all-in-one
entertainment machine fusing elements of
a video game and a TV show together now
this game comes from remedy studios the
same guys responsible for starting the
max payne franchise and more recently
Alan Wake and quantum break pretty
safely follows the same formula those
two had where storytelling is definitely
the main focus while gameplay mechanics
take a bit of a back seat mechanically
the game is okay core gunplay movement
and cover controls are pretty meh your
character always feels a bit loose and
doesn't always move precisely as you'd
like it's not exactly terrible just not
particularly good thankfully though the
game's time control elements make it a
lot more fun giving players a lot of
useful powers like freezing time in a
small zone moving super fast teleporting
or just blowing stuff up with your mind
these powers are added alongside new
enemies at a pretty good pace keeping a
game from ever feeling too repetitive or
stagnant and keeping players engaged the
story however is really where this game
shines though not without its pitfalls
the writing is solid and the overall
plot of the game is good one of its
greatest strengths for me comes from its
approach to using multiple perspectives
most of the game is played from the main
character's point of view but each
chapter ends with a small moment played
as the game's antagonist featuring a
choice mechanic that will alter some
parts of the game's plot this not only
flushes out the overall story more but
goes a long way in making the antagonist
of the game a lot more compelling and
interesting instead of just having a be
that guy that you want to kill I also
really love the game's balance between
what plot is given via main cutscenes
and what plot you learn from reading all
the different little collectible
articles there's a lot of games out
there that feature this kind of method
of getting plot by reading everything
you find but often times they don't get
the mix right and will end up punishing
players from out reading everything that
they find thankfully quantum break
doesn't do that it's possible to play
through the whole game never reading a
thing and walk away feeling satisfied
with what you know while taking the time
to read the game's various collectibles
will
a lot more depth that you just wouldn't
have been aware of otherwise now there
is one thing this game does that I'm not
really a fan of and sadly it's one of
the big things that they emphasize is
being a unique mechanic about it is the
TV show integration basically the game
is divided into five acts and with each
act you play through a few chapters and
then you have to sit and watch a 30
minute TV show the details of which
change a little based on things you've
done and choices you've made during the
gameplay bits it's kind of an
interesting idea but also a really
divisive one and really messes with the
game's pacing it's really jarring to get
used to the flow of just playing through
a level only to then be forced to sit
there and watch a 30 minute show which
sure you can skip but then you'll be
missing out on all the important plot
bits and it doesn't really help that
honestly I didn't think the TV show was
that great the main actors did a good
job but it was really lost in the
supporting actors and special effects
that just weren't that good honestly
after watching the first two episodes I
found myself treating the rest of them
has just background noise listening to
them to grab what plot I needed while
focusing on browsing the web or playing
a handheld game while it wasn't
interesting way to portray the game's
plot outside of the main character's
point of view and fleshed out a lot of
the supporting cast more it just didn't
do enough for me to justify breaking up
the gameplay and honestly I think it
could have been done just as well if not
better if it were condensed trimmed down
and just done with in-game graphics
rather than real actors like I said I do
think it was an interesting experiment
but in this case it just didn't really
pan out at least for me your mileage
could vary I could see some people let
really enjoy this but I can see a lot
more people who are just gonna get
turned off by this gimmick you know in a
lot of ways quantum break reminds me of
Sony's attempt at a big new next-gen
exclusive with order 1886 both games
placed an emphasis on the story pushing
the strengths of the respective console
had safe familiar gameplay that wasn't
particularly polished and clearly try to
set up a series the thing is is that
while I ended up hating order 1886
quantum break feels like it actually
pulled off the idea a lot better mainly
because the way it pasted the gameplay
kept it from getting boring while it's a
short game it's worth at least a second
playthrough just to see how some
different choices affect the storyline
and most importantly it actually
resolved
main plot while still leaving a few
small that's open to make a future game
possible but not an absolute necessity
the TV show aspect might turn some of
you off but for me at least it didn't do
enough harm to detract from the rest of
the game and like I said earlier there
will be some of you out there who do
actually enjoy this little experimental
part of it I don't regret paying full
price for this game but for those of you
out there that are a little more wary
about how many hours you can get out of
a game or playing something that puts
more emphasis on plot / mechanics might
want to wait for a price drop or two I'd
say the game is easily worth spending at
least 30 to 40 bucks on so those are
just my thoughts on quantum break if you
guys enjoyed the video hit the thumbs up
button to let me know as well subscribe
I do have a link posted down below in
the description if you want to grab a
copy of the game as always guys thank
you so much for watching and I'll see
you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
