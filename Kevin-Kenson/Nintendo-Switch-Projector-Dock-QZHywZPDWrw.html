switch its housed an absolute goldmine
for weird or different out-of-the-box
accessories to make use of its
Portability and I think one of the ones
that has stood out the most to me ever
since it first made its debut on
IndieGoGo is the Oh Joe portable switch
projector dock
the Ojo is a small portable projector
that very heavily lends itself to being
used with a switch so much so that it's
even mimicked the switches dock design
so they're able to load it right here
like you loot the dock but instead of it
just acting as a place to charge the
switch or display the signal it's
actually pushing it out of a projector
built into the dock itself now but we're
going in depth of things like image
quality brightness and just well how
well it works as a projector something I
want to talk about and really praise
about this guy is how user-friendly it
is it is super portable and really easy
to use not only is it nice and small and
compact and easy to carry around but it
also actually has an internal battery
that will allow it to run for up to four
hours so yeah you can plug it into a
wall and use it like a standard
projector but you can also use it on the
go or out in the wild without plugging
into anything like we have right here
right now it is running just off of
battery power and clearly working on top
of that this thing is really really easy
to set up I mean just like with a
regular switch dock the way you have to
hook up the switch is to just drop it
into the dock design that's gonna get
the video signal running and then
getting the actual projector going is
really simple it actually automatically
Keystone's for the vertical axis so what
that means is when you're worrying about
if it's pointing up too high or too low
it's automatically making sure that the
picture on the wall or surface whatever
you're portraying it on is going to keep
it a nice square image it doesn't do
this for the horizontal so you still
have to make sure that it's like
pointing straight it can be a little to
the left a little too right but only
worrying about what axis is a lot easier
than worrying about both and that's
really it it's just making sure that's
pointed straight and you mess with the
focus a little and it's good to go super
simple so once you have it all set up
how well does it work well this
projector in particular is 1,200 lumens
so if it's on sort of the mid high range
level for most consumer projectors which
basically means that it's bright enough
that it'll work in a dim room but for
optimal settings you definitely want to
use it in something that's either a very
dark room where there's no other light
sources or you're outside at nighttime
you could use it during the day but it's
not going to be the clearest image now
as for how large this image can be all
the tech specs for the Ojo reference
that it does a maximum size of 120
inches but I think we can push it a
little are than that so we're outside of
our offices and there just so happens to
be a building that has white walls so
we're gonna see how clear this image is
once we've won we've kind of awesome it
develo blurry with the resolution but
kind of amazing by the way if you want
some more pics of this guy as well as
just other cool stuff we've been
shooting lately make sure to check out
my Instagram it's linked down below
check it out now where the Ojo starts to
have some problems though is when it
comes to just raw image quality 1200
lumens is enough to get a good bright
picture in a dark room but the projector
is only 480 P which admittedly the image
doesn't look quite as bad as I thought
it would have that resolution but at the
same time it's far from optimal I mean
yeah you can have the projector make
only a small screen close up against a
wall and it look pretty good but that's
also kind of defeating part of the point
of using a projector so you can get a
much larger image where it also runs
into problems is its speaker quality
does have built-in speakers and it'll
sound okay if they're running nice and
quiet but as soon as you try to get the
volume to any kind of appreciable degree
of loud it just doesn't sound good at
all now it does have an audio out so you
can hook it into some headphones or
another stereo set but that kind of
counts as a bit of a ding against its
main strength portability now to balance
things out a little bit another big
string of Theo Joe is that it is a very
versatile little piece of tech I mean it
is marketed primarily as being a
projector for the switch but it actually
also features an HDMI IN so you can
really hook up any device with an HDMI
out to it and use it as just a nice
little portable projector along with
that it also doubles as a battery bank
that you can use with your switch or any
other devices of that need charging
you're actually able to switch it
between an off mode projector mode or
just a power supply mode where you can
plug in anything to its USB airports and
provide a charge now this is only at 5
volts 2 amps so it's not exactly going
to be something that's going to bring
your switch back to life very quickly
but it is gonna give you a lot more
battery life as long as you keep hooking
it up also going back to portability a
little bit one of the nice thing you can
get with the Ojo is there is a bundle
option to get a case and the case is
actually really nice it gives you just
up space to fit the Ojo itself the AC
adapter for it a full switch with two
joint comes attached and then some
additional slots to fit a comfort grip
or some additional joy cons I kind
wish it had a place to also fit a switch
pro controller but if there's anything
that's gonna be missing that's fine
everything else makes for an awesome
little portable switch set up over all
the Ojo is a really awesome little
portable projector whose only real
problem is that it's capped at 480p I
mean if your focus is having something
that's an alternative to a TV or getting
the best visual way possible of a game
it's not the strongest choice but where
it really excites me is this idea of a
portable switch set up especially for
multiplayer games I mean the idea of
being able to play Smash Brothers once
it comes out with this little portable
case and just set up wherever you want
for competitive matches is really cool</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
