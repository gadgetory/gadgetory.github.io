Nintendo's biggest franchises,
and standing amongst all
the gigantic number of them
that now exist, one of
the all-time most popular
has, of course, been Pikachu.
So popular, in fact,
that he now even has his own
movie, Detective Pikachu.
- That's my character!
I'm the trash man!
- So, to celebrate it coming out,
let's look at some of my favorite Switch
and just other Nintendo-relevant items
that have come out,
celebrating the world's
most famous lightning mouse.
Kicking things off
is this Pokemon-themed
Switch Pro Controller,
which technically doesn't exist.
Nintendo has done a lot of really cool
Pro Controller designs,
mostly celebrating very specific games,
but there hasn't actually
been a lot of them just yet.
And surprisingly, Pokemon
is one of the series
that, well, didn't get one.
Thankfully, shell exchanges
are really easy to do
on Pro Controllers.
So, if you're interested
in a design like this,
or something else that
doesn't officially exist yet,
you can find shell swaps like
this that get the job done.
Now, when I say Pro
Controller re-shells are easy,
I mean they are really easy.
Joy-Cons take a lot of work
and can be a little scary,
'cause you have to mess
with a lot of the boards
inside of the controllers,
'cause you're placing
both the bottom and top of the system.
The shell main body itself
isn't too difficult,
but still a little
annoying to get just right.
Pro Controllers?
Super simple though.
You just remove a number
of screws in order,
switch the parts off.
You have to move a
little bit of the boards,
but it's not that difficult.
Really easy to do.
Now, this design is inspired by
the official Pokemon Nintendo Switch.
I say inspired, because it's
actually not entirely correct,
but works out even better
if you just really like Pikachu.
It does feature the handles
that are both Pikachu and Eevee-colored,
but the patterning on the main body,
instead of featuring cutouts
of Pikachu and Eevee,
are cutouts of Pikachu,
Pichu, and little Pokeballs.
If you wanna take this a step further,
you can even grab this shell exchange
and just a random yellow handle option,
so that way, you can go double yellow,
making it a full-blown Pikachu design.
When it comes to collectible stuff,
there is an endless list
of things based on Pokemon,
but one that's officially
made by Nintendo,
for the Switch, are Amiibo.
Now, there's a couple
different Pokemon Amiibo,
mostly pulled from Super Smash Bros.,
but when it comes to Pikachu specifically,
there are two options.
The Super Smash Bros. Pikachu,
who is regular, small-sized, pretty cute,
or you get the gigantic Detective Pikachu.
This was a limited design
that you can still find,
just not for the original MSRP it was at.
It's a little more expensive now,
but it is a noticeably larger Amiibo
based on the Detective
Pikachu from the 3DS game,
and even features a base
that has a little city map
on the bottom of it.
Its uses as an Amiibo
are honestly pretty specific and limited,
but if you just want
an awesome collectible
that has a really detailed
Detective Pikachu,
I mean really, look at
the texturing on the hat.
It is an awesome little collectible.
When it comes to Switch controllers,
one of those popular options,
aside from the official
Nintendo Switch one,
is GameCube-style controllers.
So popular, in fact, that
all three major third parties
that make accessories for Nintendo
have released their own version of it.
And surprisingly, pretty much all of them
have also released a Pikachu version.
Two main examples you can grab right now,
PDP and Hori's options,
which offer slight
differences from each other,
aside from the obvious fact
the way they approach
the Pikachu branding,
it's just a little bit different.
The biggest thing you will really notice
is that the PDP design is a
noticeably larger controller,
along with having larger shoulder buttons.
Despite being the smaller of the two,
the Hori option actually offers
the larger buttons and D-pad.
As a third option that
is not actually out yet,
PowerA, the other manufacturer
of GameCube-style controllers,
has their wireless GameCube option,
which will be getting a Pikachu design
later this summer, that is
currently up for pre-order.
I will say the PowerA design is, to me,
the one that's closest to feeling like
you're using a traditional
GameCube controller,
but since this is the wireless option,
which is also an upside,
it is gonna cost you more
money than these two.
All three of them do a great
job of celebrating Pikachu.
If I had to pick one
from a pure aesthetic standpoint, though,
I think I'm gonna have to
go with the PDP design.
I love the black circle
with the full-body Pikachu
right in the middle, sideways
profile, looks super awesome.
Since they're GameCube controllers,
if you love playing
Pikachu in Smash Bros.,
these are all great choices, or really,
if you're just a Pokemon fan
in general, great designs.
One of the biggest ways
that Nintendo themselves
have officially celebrated
Pokemon on the Switch,
is the official Pokemon: Let's Go
Nintendo Switch collector's edition.
Now, I've unboxed and talked about
a couple different special designs
that Nintendo has done for the Switch,
and a lot of them have been
kinda hit or miss with me.
The don't necessarily look bad,
I just feel like Nintendo could
go more all-out with them.
But as far as the options that
have been released so far,
the Pokemon one is definitely
the best design they've done.
Going along with the
theme of Pokemon: Let's Go
being focused on Eevee and Pikachu,
the design comes with a
Pikachu-yellow right Joy-Con,
and Eevee-brown left Joy-Con,
and they even come with
special wrist straps
that give a two-tone approach
that match the Pokemon as well.
Matching the theme of the Joy-Cons,
the dock also features
both Pikachu and Eevee
in their respective
colors on the same sides,
and the back of the Switch
itself has this patterning
that shows off silhouettes
of Pikachu, Eevee,
and some Pokeballs.
Something interesting
about this bundle as well
is that, unlike most, which
come with a specific game,
well, this one has one of two choices
you can find out there,
one with Pokemon: Let's Go, Pikachu!,
and the other with Let's Go, Eevee!
Again, this is, in my opinion,
the best special edition
Nintendo has put out yet
for the Nintendo Switch.
If you really want a special design,
or you're a huge Pokemon fan,
this one is definitely
worth tracking down.
By the way, if you want an easy way
to add a little Pikachu yellow
to your favorite system,
an easy way to do that
is with skins like these
from today's sponsor, dbrand.
They have a whole line
that are safe to use
on your Joy-Cons, the dock,
or even the Switch itself.
Check out the link down below.
Now, we've talked about a couple different
controller options, but
those are mainly used for
if you're playing in docked
mode or maybe tabletop.
What if you want a way to
celebrate Pikachu in handheld?
Well, that's where the Hori
D-pad Joy-Con comes in.
They've actually released
a couple versions of this.
Originally, it was a
Mario and Zelda design,
but eventually, to celebrate Pokemon,
they made this Pikachu one as well,
with a Pikachu silhouetted at the bottom,
and a bunch of lightning bolts
covering it in a pattern.
Now, this is not a full-blown
traditional Joy-Con.
It does not have vibration,
it cannot be used wirelessly,
but as long as it's
connected to your Switch
in handheld mode, it's
gonna give you access
to a D-pad, something
that a lot of people miss
from standard Joy-Cons,
which just have the
four-button setup as well.
Something really cool about it, too,
is that, since it's a left Joy-Con,
if you have the Pokemon-edition Switch,
well, you can pair it
with the Pikachu yellow
on the right side, left
Pikachu on this side,
and you have a complete
Pikachu-focused design.
It's worth noting that if
you really want a D-pad
on your Joy-Cons, there are
other options out there.
There are cases you can
put over a regular Joy-Con,
there are shell exchanges you can do
that replace the buttons
with a D-pad-shaped design,
though it still kinda clickiness.
This option, however, is I
think a really good balance
of something that's just a complete
easy-to-use package right away,
you're not doing any kind
of assembly or anything,
and it has a pretty solid
D-pad as part of it.
One of my all-time
favorite Switch accessories
that doesn't really offer any
major function to gameplay,
but just adds a little bit
more style to your system,
are these PDP light-up docks.
And it's a really simple mechanism.
It's basically a dock-dock.
You take your regular Switch
dock, put it in the PDP dock,
and place a number of different
face plates on the front
that'll light up, featuring a
number of different designs.
When first released, they
originally came bundled
with two different designs
based on Mario Odyssey.
- [Officer] Name!
- Mario.
- Last name.
- Mario.
- And Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild,
but later on, to celebrate the release
of Pokemon: Let's Go, they
released a new bundle,
featuring two different Pokemon options.
One, this more generic Pokeball design
with just a bunch of them in a pattern,
which looks pretty cool,
or two, more relevant to today's video,
this design, featuring
Pikachu running around,
covered in electricity.
The dock can display in a
couple different colors,
so you can match it up
style-wise if you like.
For instance, red for the
Pokeball, yellow for Pikachu,
and just gives a nice little cool way
of personalizing your dock a little more,
beyond being the very
basic black-and-gray design
that it ships as.
It's also worth noting,
that if you're not fan
of any of the designs currently available,
there are people on Etsy
making their own custom frames,
fitting a whole bunch of different.
Now, I know we've been
talking about Switch a lot,
but there's another Nintendo system
that deserves a little bit of love
that's still worth grabbing,
and that is the Nintendo 3DS.
Specifically, the 2DS XL.
The Switch may be the
big hot thing right now
from Nintendo, but the 2DS
still has an amazing library
of games worth playing through,
so if you haven't grabbed one before,
now is a great time to still do so.
And even better, the
2DS XLs have had a lot
of really amazing limited-edition designs.
One of the best is this
Pikachu-edition one right here,
featuring Pikachu's face
on the top of the system,
and something that's always a
great little detail about it,
is that it's actually
grooved a little bit,
so his nose is pointing out,
which is kind of stupidly adorable.
- You're adorable!
- Topping it off, I think
Nintendo just also did a great job
with the color coordination on the system.
Obviously, Pikachu's face
makes a lot of sense,
but it has this nice
little brown bordering
on the main body of it,
brown buttons up top for the shoulders,
and the front face also
has brown for the D-pad
and front-facing buttons.
Now, this an older
design, and discontinued.
They're not officially
making them anymore,
so it is a little more expensive
than buying a regular 2DS,
but if you love the Pokemon design,
it really isn't actually that
crazy overpriced for resale.
So, it's worth throwing
down some extra money for.
It's worth noting that this
is not the only Pokemon design
they've done for the 2DS XL.
There's also a Pokeball design,
which is actually, personally,
my top-favorite 2DS XL.
One big accessory that
pretty much everyone needs
for their Switch, and I'm
sure you guys saw this coming
the moment you saw that this
was an accessory list video,
carrying cases!
There are so many different carrying cases
designed out there, and a
lot of them feature Pikachu
in a number of different ways.
One of my personal favorites
that we have, however,
is this PDP design, which
features a pretty intricate cover
with Pikachu running.
Very similar to the light-up
dock design, actually.
This is gonna give you a
way to safely transport
your Switch in style,
as well as giving you a way to store
not only the Switch itself,
but also some game cards
and any kinda necessary
smaller accessories
or cables that you need to bring around.
Again, this is not the only
Pikachu design out there.
There are a lot of them to choose from,
so if you don't like this
one, we're gonna list
a couple other really
cool options down below
if you wanna check 'em out.
Now, if you already have a Switch
and you didn't get the chance
to grab the Pokemon-edition one,
one way to add a little extra
Pikachu flavor to your system
is a clear shell case
like this, from Hori.
Now, this particular design is, of course,
focused on Pikachu.
It adds a clear front to both the Joy-Cons
and the Switch itself.
The front of the Joy-Cons
get little Pikachu tails
that are golden, and on the back,
it makes the whole design black,
with a golden Pikachu on it.
This is an especially good choice
if you have kids that love Pokemon,
and you want a way to both give them a way
to add Pokemon flavor to their Switch,
but also give a little extra protection,
so it keeps it nice
and safe from scratches
or even if they drop it,
this is gonna give it a
little extra protection
on the whole body.
It also leaves a little space open
for the kickstand to still be used,
if you still wanna prop
it up for tabletop mode.
It even comes with its own
separate stand that works better.
So, there you have it, some awesome ways
to celebrate Pikachu on the Switch
and some other Nintendo systems as well.
Nintendo has released a lot
of different Pikachu stuff
in the past, so let me
know down in the comments
what your favorite
Pikachu-themed products are.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
