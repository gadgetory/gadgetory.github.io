this week the Destiny alpha ended and
thankfully I got a chance to actually
play in it since I tried it out at the
e3 show floor so I want to bring you
guys an idea of what the gameplay was
like that we saw in the Alpha and I
thoughts on it so far just you can get a
better idea of what will expect from the
game when it launches later this year
now those you that aren't aware of what
destiny is or haven't paid that close of
attention to what it's trying to do it's
basically a fusion of FPS and MMO RPG
mechanics it's not the first game to
explore this combination but it's
definitely going its own approach with
how they're handling the fusion to begin
with like in most MMO games you need to
make your character and destiny offers
three different races to choose from
which as of right now appear to be
purely a cosmetic choice there are
humans which you basically get the idea
of awakened which are basically pale
blue humans with crazier hair and eye
colors and EXO's which are basically
just robots after going through cosmetic
options for looks like facial structure
hair and face markings you can then pick
your class which destiny offers three to
choose from Titans which are meant to be
the tanks hunters which take on the role
of high single target dps and warlocks
which have area of effect moves and
later on support abilities each class
has access to the same weapons the big
difference between them is special
pieces of armor and what kinds of
special moves melee skills and grenades
you have access to I personally played
as the Warlock mostly giving me a big a
we avoid blast that just ruins enemies
now as far as the core gameplay goes
destiny feels a lot like familiar
territory while there are a lot of
different RPG mechanics happening in the
background like what kind of gear you're
equipped with what class you picked what
abilities have gained from leveling up
in the end it still feels very much like
a traditional FPS each class has a
grenade likeability on cooldown and a
mainly move that can have a bonus effect
also on cooldown along with various
passive bonuses that might lead them up
to favoring a certain play style or type
of weapon and their signature special
move which ends up really playing up
their differences in team situations as
I said earlier any class can equip any
gun characters can equip up to three
different ones in different categories a
main gun which is usually some kind of
assault burst or marksman rifle or just
a hand cannon a special weapon which
consists of shotgun sniper rifles and
energy based fusion rifles
and heavy weapons which include things
like a minigun or rocket launcher so
well there are a lot of RPG things going
on in the background as far as how
damage is calculated and how your
character is built the end result still
ends up playing just like most familiar
FPS titles so after you've made your
character the destiny alpha was
basically divided into four main
sections to really show off different
aspects of its gameplay first off
there's old Russia the office starts
here with a story mission featuring moon
Wizards and then you're allowed to
revisit it to freely explore the area
find secret rooms or chests and accept a
number of side quests to help level up
your character and make money side
quests are in all honesty really bland
there are kind of MMORPG grunt tasks
some of you may be familiar with like
fetch this item from this place or kill
10 of these kind of enemies and so on so
forth admittedly though the FPS side of
things do make these five quests a lot
less monotonous and they do give you a
really good reason and sense of
direction to explore the rest of old
Russia this product game is somewhat
instance but you will end up running
into other players and can party up with
them on the spot if you want to work
together adding on to the MMO side of
things then there's the tower this is
the central social hub for the game
giving you a place to accept and turn in
major quests socialize with players and
non battle situations or most
importantly stock up on items and
purchase new gear for combat this is
also the one place where the camera
changes to the third-person perspective
letting you see what your character
looks like to others as you gear up now
third up is the crucible now this is
actually the mode that I got to try out
on the e3 show floor and it's basically
a sight arena lets you treat the game
like you would any other multiplayer
competitive FPS the crucible puts you
into 6v six matches with varying
objectives based on the menu it does
look to attain a current total of six
different match types to choose from
though during the Alpha there was only
one option available which was
domination having players compete over
keeping control of three different
objective points now last up is the
devil's den which is another part of the
game that really showcases its
multiplayer options but in this case
it's much more co-op focused The Devil's
Den is a dungeon setting where a team of
three players preferably each one of a
different class work together to hold
off waves of enemies level of difficulty
on this is noticeably higher than what
you'd experience in just the open free
roam segments of the game so it really
forced
you two have to work together with
fellow players and I just try to do your
own things and end up dying separately
so you can kind of see how destiny is
trying to enter wine the two different
genres as far as the core gameplay goes
and all the different side modes it
plays a lot of like a regular FPS game
but then there's the story missions and
the exploration aspects and the ways you
build your characters leveling up in
unlocking new abilities in gear that
really open it up to the more they
MMORPG style of things all in all my
experience with the Alpha was pretty
positive it definitely feels more like
an FPS overall but the mo aspects being
added do help give it its own distinct
flavor I wasn't a huge fan of the
crucible mode mostly because it does
make the gameplay like any other FPS but
that is the reason why it's a side mode
the game's exploration and story modes
on the other hand appeal to me a lot
more this is where the MMO aspects
really show with things like how you
encounter other players and just having
the chance to freely roam explore the
game's environments the one thing I'm a
lot more curious to see that I didn't
get a chance to experience in the Alpha
is how customizable each class is in
terms of other special moves and builds
at later levels and just how different
two characters the same class can
eventually become or if they just end up
being more or less the same character
whose only big difference is their gear
choice so it's just a little look at my
experiences with the destiny alpha there
is a beta upcoming for it as well and we
will be seeing the full launch for it
later this year on September 9th at
which point I will be picking it up so I
can bring you guys my full thoughts on
