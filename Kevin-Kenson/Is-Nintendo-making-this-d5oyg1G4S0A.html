- It's been a little while
since Nintendo held a Direct,
but there has been a
lot of different rumors
and leaks building up lately in terms of
what they might have
going on in the future.
And one of the biggest ones has to do
with the Nintendo online service.
Data miners have been
looking at the source code
for the emulator that comes
as a part of Nintendo online
that allows people to play NES games.
And it seems as though there are signs
pointing to two very big things.
The first thing that a lot of
people have been talking about
is the addition of a number of SNES games
and just the concept of adding
an SNES emulator to the system.
The list of supposed SNES games coming to
the Switch currently stands at 22,
and as no surprise to no one,
shares a lot in common with
what's on the SNES Classic.
It has a mixture of both big name games
and a few surprise ones as well.
For instance, we've got of course
a number of different Mario games,
Legend of Zelda: A Link to
the Past, Super Metroid.
But at the same time,
we have other titles
like Breath of Fire II,
Legend of Mystical Ninja, and Star Fox 2,
which is kind of a big
deal because that's a game
that never came out in the
US and the only way it was
made available recently is
as part of the SNES Classic.
And it was kind of one of
the big selling points of it.
It was the only way to play Star Fox 2.
But now it might be a case that
everyone that has a Switch can.
This news alone is really
cool for the Switch.
Because as I have said many times before,
I am really not a fan of how Nintendo
has been approaching
their retro games lately.
They keep restarting and doing
different systems for each platform.
And while I wish they didn't
reset again for the Switch,
we're at least starting to
see signs of growth that more
and more games are gonna come
to it and more platforms.
And these are some really
good SNES games on the list.
But this isn't the only bit of news
to come out of these data miners.
Another thing that's been talked about
and not really dug into
by a lot of people yet
is that when looking at
the list of emulators
supported by online, there's four.
One for the Nintendo, one
supposedly for the SNES,
and two mystery ones.
Now there are a few
different possibilities
for what these emulators could be for.
And I think there are a couple different
top candidates that are a
little more likely than others.
And I wanted to talk about
some of the biggest ones.
And the first one that I really think
has the highest priority
after SNES is Game Boy.
And this could either be
for just classic Game Boy
on its own going all the
way through Game Boy Color,
maybe having a separate one
that's Game Boy Advance,
or even all as one.
It's not entirely clear.
But it's possible that
those last two emulators
could just be Game Boy in
all of its different forms.
Not to mention the fact that because
the Game Boy Advance and Game Boy
are such older systems
and are much simpler,
they'd be a lot easier
to emulate on the Switch
and there's a lot of really awesome
games on there to choose from.
Now while I do think Game
Boy is the most likely,
there are of course other
possibilities that are,
well, much more hyped for a lot of people.
I mean, the classic edition systems
have definitely renewed
people wanting to get
a lot of their favorite games
growing up on current systems
or some way to easily play them.
While the NES and SNES
Classic have certainly
served their purposes for those systems,
now people want an N64 Classic.
And before the Switch even came out,
there was one system that
people have been really wanting
to be made available on
Nintendo's newest platform.
And this might be finally the time
for us to have the GameCube.
The GameCube is a beloved favorite
for a lot of longtime Nintendo fans.
And while its actual sales
history wasn't the best
because the PS2 was just an
obscene monster at the time,
there is a great catalog of titles
on the GameCube that haven't really been
made available much outside
of a couple HD remakes.
And this is exactly why it
would make a lot of sense
for the time to really happen
to start seeing a lot of those
games come back and be made
available on the Switch.
I mean, after all, sure
there are a sure mix of
stuff like both Zelda games that came out
on it like Wind Waker
and Twilight Princess.
Resident Evil 4 has been
remade on basically everything.
But we still don't have really any ways
of playing some of the
great Nintendo titles
like Super Mario Sunshine or Fire Emblem.
There's just a lot of great quality titles
that could be made available
on Nintendo Switch online.
And there's already so much stuff built in
to make this really easy on the Switch.
By the way, if you're looking for a way
to customize your Switch
and maybe celebrate
one of your favorite old
systems like the GameCube,
a really easy way to
do that is to use skins
like from today's sponsor, dbrand.
They have a whole line of Switch skins
that are perfectly safe to use.
You can use them for the Joy-Cons,
the Switch itself, and even for the dock.
You can get them in a variety of colors
like these awesome purple ones right here.
If you want to check them out,
just go to the link down below.
For instance, a big promotional thing
that Nintendo did as part of the NES
coming to the Nintendo
Switch online service
was releasing these NES style Joy-Cons
where they're NES controllers,
but they have the little sliders
to attach to the side of your Switch
and they kind of work like Joy-Cons.
But the main point is using
them for the NES emulator.
Well there already is that for
the GameCube on the Switch.
There's adapters that let you use
GameCube controllers on your Switch.
And there's even third-party controllers
that are designed to just be
wireless GameCube controllers.
There's already so much accessory support
for it on the Switch that
it just would make sense
for Nintendo to bring the games over too.
It's about time.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
