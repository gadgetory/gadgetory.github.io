- One of the big ongoing
rumors in the past two years
is the idea that Nintendo was working on
some kind of new Switch.
I don't know if that's
a Mini version or Pro
just some kind of Switch
revision and hopefully
it's something we might
even see at this years E3,
though it is probably unlikely.
But in the hype of a new
Switch potentially coming out
a lot of people have
started posting concept
art for what they think a
Switch Mini or Switch Pro
or some kind Switch
revision should look like
and a design that picked
up a lot of traction
recently came from a
designer Olivier Raymond,
which is honestly one of the
coolest concepts I have seen.
I first saw this concept
posted on NintendoLife
and I know made a lot of
rounds on Reddit before that
and its this redesign
Switch that kind of walks
a line between both of
what we been thinking of
for a Mini and for a Pro revision as well.
It's a really premium
looking idea and really
the first thought I had when I saw it was
that's the best case scenario of what
I want a new Switch to look like
and the second thought I had was
I need to talk to the person that
made this because this is awesome.
And that's exactly what we did
we reached out to Olivier and he responded
and we got the chance to do an interview
regarding his logic into designing
this revised awesome Switch design.
Well of course the main
this we want to talk
about is the Switch design that you did.
The Switch Up, I think is
what you call it, right?
Why don't we just go to
the beginning of that
what was sort of your starting
point in designing that
you know what kind of
inspired you for this design?
- Really it was a personal thing
I, it was something I did on my own time
back at home and it,
I started with the idea that I,
I was reading a lot about
rumors with, for perhaps
some sort of a mid-gen, you know, refresh
for the Nintendo Switch.
Which is a console I truly adore
I find the concept
completely in love with it
and I, it shows how Nintendo is always
reinventing themselves
and I have massive respect
for this company and I
think design is often,
doesn't work for so many brands
and very few companies get to have the
courage of their ambition and I think
this is certainly one of those.
And yeah so, I wanted to pay tribute
to this beautiful idea by basically
I'd say revisit the concept and right away
I had to of course let go of a feature
I found that was very,
I'm close to a lot of people which
were the Joy-Cons.
- Now one design decision that I know
gets a little bit of mixed response
but I personally think
its the right way to go
is the removal of Joy-Cons.
This is something that
people have theorized a lot
regards to a Switch Mini, where instead of
heaving Joy-Cons that you
remove on the current Switch
is just a built in part of the system.
- Perhaps its a feature
that we could put away
and it liberates a lot
of other opportunities
in terms of hardware for sure because
you don't have those interruptions
with metal rails and weight and you could
have more space for other
components and therefore
pretty much more
opportunities for performance.
- Now yes this get rid of some
of the share ability factors
the Switch has you can just take your
Joy-Con and hand it to
someone but at the same time
this doesn't stop you really from still
having it as an option.
A design like this could
still support people
using older Joy-Cons
and connect wirelessly
its just that there's two always
attached to the sides for the main body.
Are there any other aspects
of the regular Switch
that, either you think
are faults or just ways
they can improved upon that you
tried to fix in your design?
- So its quite a funny situation I put
myself in because I, myself, I like games
and I play some of them but I wouldn't
consider myself being a hardcore gamer
but reading on the internet
I was collecting basically
insights from everywhere
when I was obviously brainstorming
about the whole thing
and I think the D-pad
for example was something
that quite a lot of
people were screaming for
and I quite understand why Nintendo
went with their, with their proposition
with the four little individual buttons
because obviously when
you want to split them
they become something else.
But continuing with the
idea that I wouldn't remove
those Joy-Cons and they would also,
then there's no need for
those four buttons anymore
so I couldn't bring them
back this much beloved D-pad.
- But one of the more
interesting decisions along
side that is that the
right side of the controls
are flipped now so that the sticks are
at the same height
instead of being off set.
- I mean this is also
another element that is very
crucial to my proposal
next to the original one
I think its something that, well, I mean
its quite graphic, you
see it right away and
I have to apologize in advance I guess
that's one of those
professional defamation's
were I don't know whether it's, you know,
my OCD triggered in and I couldn't live
with the idea to have four buttons
on the top and joy stick slight off set.
And that would be pretty much the only,
I'm being transparent
here, that is the most,
that would be the reason why I decided
to lay it, you know, in
such a symmetrical way.
Obviously for the purity of the design
but I, I understand that most people
prefer the other way around and,
which is a very legitimate and some other
also I mean I, I've been reading also
with other critics that where saying
that they, not critics but people who
were criticizing my design they were
appreciating this type of layout so,
I mean in the end I, it's a,
I guess it always generates
some sort of controversy.
- Of course there are a
lot of functional things
about it too I think one little
design choice in particular
that I really like was the
approach to the joy sticks.
With the current Switch, the joy sticks
prop right out of the main body
whereas with this design, they're sunken
in a little but but they're
still proper sticks.
A lot of people when
they talk about making
a Mini or smaller kinda
stripped down design,
they imagine using circle pads like
on the 3DS instead, which I personally
really don't like, I am
not a fan of circle pads
it makes sense for
certain designs but if you
can go with regular sticks instead,
I am all for it and this is a really
good compromise for that design I think.
I think more of the most,
aside from obviously
the visual aspect of the Switch itself
which is noticeably different.
I think one of the most
intriguing aspect of your mock ups
was the dock redesign you did, which isn't
really anything like
Nintendo's current dock.
Just kinda walk us though your pitch
and idea there of how that would work
and, you know just the
merits of it I guess?
- I guess, I don't, I don't
quite recall how it happened
but it was something I
was trying to figure out
a new shape with the
Switch and I had that idea
with the grip handles
and then the dock came
and I hadn't figured
that part out right away.
And it became quite obvious at some point
that it was going to be the
basically the corresponding
shape that would fit
with the groove or, on behind,
you know, the back plate and,
and in, of course then
I was, I was exploring
a lot of different
configurations but this one
seemed to be the most,
I'd say, obvious one in the end,
it's not often, you know,
simplicity takes quite a lot of time
to come to you and
certainly is the case here
but I thought in the end it was a very
elegant proposition because,
well most of all
there were quite a few people experiencing
scratches on the screen and everything
with the original dock.
That's something that I wanted to
you know, avoid and of course laying it
in this specific way is,
you prevent this for sure.
I also thought it was some sort of a
celebration of the whole
thing, you know its like
basically the Switch
looks like its resting,
it's on some sort of podium or pedestal
which I think is elevating
the whole thing again.
As if it wasn't, kind of a, sleep mode
because its referring to
the TV so it's somehow
I thought the analogy
was quite poetic here.
- Its not just the shape or
the design in itself either
I really love the return to colors.
The mock up shows bunch
of different color designs
and that's something that
I've said time and time again
that Nintendo is just missing.
Yeah we have Switch Joy-Con con colors
but Switches themselves are still
just kinda of plain black and I would love
to see them get back to a more color focus
aesthetic like they had with
some of the older Gameboys.
- Yeah, it's quite tricky
because you, obviously
you're trying a lot of configurations
and then it's also a subjective thing
because most people I
mean its one of those
places in the design
process where everybody
has a different opinion and, but I
and so, what I did was
basically pick up some
of the shades that went
through history of Nintendo,
and, so that, that atomic
purple had to come back,
I mean its one of those signature things.
And then I, I kind of inspired myself
from the Gameboy Color for the,
that kind of, I called it Iggy green
but it would be that lime
green, and the fuchsia color
was, you know renamed as ink
pink as a homage to Splatoon
so I, I kind of figured
out how to link them
all to some sort of a different universe.
And so, yeah that's
why you get those names
and, sort of master blue
was for the Master sword
kinda of blue, indigo shade.
And the cloud white was for
those little clouds from
Lakitu characters so yeah I basically went
through the whole catalog trying to
find the right character fitting
with the right color
but, yeah quite some fun.
- So what are the chances
of a new Nintendo Switch
being like this design, I mean obviously
its not going to be the exact same thing
but how many ideas could be shared with
what Nintendo is officially working on.
Well when you look back on the history
of Nintendo revisions they don't
do it a lot for their main line systems
the last time was the Super Nintendo
when it got a slim line,
but if you look at their portables
which I would argue the Switch
is more closely related to,
they do revisions a lot.
There were a lot of Gameboys, a couple
different DS's and now
a lot of different 3DS's.
In the history of those normally
the revisions are
relativity light each time,
they'll go through three
or four different models
and each time something new adjustment
or change is made, one is
smaller, one has a bigger screen,
one changes some of the buttons and then
it adds on and builds
up more more each time.
So when you see the difference between
the 3DS and 3DS XL, its not a huge thing
but if you go from the
3DS to the new 2DS XL,
its pretty different
systems by that point.
The kind of changes proposed by this idea
and what I think a lot
of people are hoping for
to see in a new Switch
is a lot all at once,
more than I think Nintendo traditionally
does in their revisions but I think
it's what they need to do.
The Switch isn't really treated
the same way as a hand held like
their other systems have been,
it's a more expensive item, it is
considered a main line unit that
is hybridized with their
concepts for hand helds
and so if we're getting some kind revision
whether that is a Mini or a Pro,
hopefully its going to
be something that is
more drastic like this and not just simply
hey its the same thing,
but the screen's bigger.
This is something that probably
not everyone freaks out about but,
confession, I love cool packaging.
I just love if get a
box that's put together
in a really cool way and
makes you excited about
the product, and almost
acts as like sort of
a little reveal, and I love the packaging
in the design you posted.
Is there just any kind of insight
or explanation of your process on that?
- Sure, I mean its, for me
it was an integral part of the project
and that's something
where I guess my friends
interrupted, I mean they,
they jumped into discussions telling me
I probably was going a bit far,
and they were probably were right
but it's something I
couldn't avoid because its
for me its the whole package, you know,
its not just about the object,
it's the total experience.
But yeah, I think its
very important, I think
for example, Apple quite
understood this right away
I mean when you open a
box they even control
the amount of air getting in the box
so you have slow opening
and they, you know,
so they kind of hold
on to the whole ritual
so that it's, it really is
some sort of a celebration
and I think packaging is very important
and it's a fundamental part
of the experience for sure.
- No definitely that
idea of just, you know,
there's that instructions
there you move that
and there it is on display verses
how the Switch current is where it's all
taken apart, its in
the different wrap ups,
I mean, I know it's efficient maybe,
but its not fun you know, so
I really like that design.
Something you just said that
blew my mind a little bit
because I already liked
the name but that didn't
occur to me at the time when you said it.
I love the name Switch Up.
I think when everyone talking about
the concept of a new Switch
they say oh the Switch Pro
the Switch Mini, very
straight forward things
that get the idea across but,
not particularly imaginative,
if I can say words right (laughs).
Just walk us through
the name choice there,
the Switch Up because I love that.
- Yeah.
I was looking for some sort of equivalent
to Pro or S or you know
all of those things
we're getting used to
which is some sort of
a little add on that indicated that it's
not quite yet a 2.0 version
but more of a 1.5 thing.
And so it had to be short,
it had to be concise
and I went through a
lot of options but when
that one came around it
was, I mean that was it,
it's two letters and it's very related
to the universe of Nintendo
I mean it's part of
their, I mean, when
you say up to everybody
gets that mushroom, you know and so its,
I think it was, it all, you
know it connected all the dots
and it became very natural
and was quite obvious
right away that it, and
it's also a good indicator
of upgrade and up scaled and updated.
So its an update, yeah, so it just fit in
that's one of those lucky
moments and I thought
it was certainly the right approach,
if we were to go in such
a direction for sure.
- The main take away I want from all this
is that, I think the
Switch has gone a long way
in revitalizing Nintendo's image.
There is something about
that system that rekindled
a love for Nintendo not
only in long term fans
but it brought a lot of
people back onto the system,
even people that don't
really normally play games
since, you know, the Super Nintendo.
It's this idea that resonated
with people immediately
and I think that opens up a lot more ideas
in people's minds of where it
can go and what can be next.
It was in and of itself a great
idea but now we want to see
the next step, the
refinement of where it can go
and, honestly this
concept art thing is just
the best case scenario of
what we could expect to see.
Its the dream, you know, part of why you
you enjoy the Switch so
much you mentioned was that
Nintendo wasn't afraid
to do something different
and that's were that
same kind of conceptual
stuff comes from, you know it's,
it's picturing something cool
and then figuring out how to make it work.
Not the other way around,
you know you don't go
pure functional, you have an image
and you work towards
it and that's something
I really appreciated in that design.
- And we really have
to give them credit for
you know, innovating all the time
and they're reinventing themselves.
I mean I don't know what's
coming next from them
but I'm, obviously sure that
it's going to be amazing.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
