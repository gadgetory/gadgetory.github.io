the corner and if you're still
scrambling to find the perfect gift for
the gamer in your family that already
has every game they could want I've got
a list some of the best accessories you
can give them this time around focused
on Xbox one to begin with one of the
biggest accessories to come out this
year from Microsoft directly is of
course the elite controller offering all
kinds of upgrades and customizable bits
the problem though is that there are a
lot of people searching for these right
now and they are going out of stock just
as quickly as they show up plus it's not
exactly the most affordable gift you can
grab someone so if you want to do
something a little different there are
plenty of ways to upgrade a regular Xbox
one controller and one of the most
unique options is this the scuff FPS
adjustable trigger and pro grip combo
with just a little work this kit lets
you upgrade your Xbox one controller
with a better slightly softer and less
slippery grip as well as giving you the
ability to modify your controller to
switch between full and half stop
triggers which is one of the handier
functions that the elite controller
offers now these do come in five
different colors black white blue red
and green so for the competitive gamer
and your family this gives them a few
different ways to add a little style to
the controller as well as upgrade its
performance
now not all gaming accessories need to
be super flashy there are a lot of
really functional useful bits that any
gamer can appreciate having and one of
the biggest ones for the Xbox one is a
rechargeable battery pack honestly this
is one of the things that bothered me
the most with the Xbox one at launch
needing to rely on buying batteries so
with this nice little addition you can
upgrade your regular orly Xbox one
controller to be rechargeable never
needing replacing but instead just
plugging it into your system whenever
need be these are also available in a
combo pack with an Xbox one controller
so if you know someone that needs a new
controller as well that's a great way to
kill two birds with one stone
now another functional and great Buy is
the Xbox one media remote one of the
biggest strengths of the Xbox one is
that it's not just a gaming platform but
also an all in one media device and we
all know that guy or girl that spends
more time watching Netflix and Hulu
rather than playing games and while you
can use your controller it's not always
the most intuitive or comfortable option
and not everyone wants to wave and yell
there connect like a jackass especially
if they're trying to watch with some
company and that's where this remote
comes in it's not just great for what it
adds it's also just a well-made remote
Packt sturdy simple and comfy to use
with backlit buttons now if you see when
you're pressing during late-night TV
series binge sessions now the next item
is something that I don't think occurs
to a lot of people and honestly it's a
little situational whether or not you
need it but if you do this is an
absolute lifesaver and that's a carrying
case for your system in particular the
CTA Xbox one carrying case if you know a
gamer who is in a situation where they
need to or like to carry their system
around back and forth this is an
absolute must-have sure you can just
throw your system in any bag but that's
just going to cause wear and tear over
time with scratches and dents whereas
with this carrying case you're going to
have a nice snug and safe place to store
your console along with all of its
cables accessories and games and I love
the fact that it has a completely
removable pouch for the Kinect giving a
little extra room to use for those of us
that have completely ditched using it
now there are better carrying cases out
there if you want something heavy-duty
that's going to protect your system from
an avalanche or rockslide but for most
people this is all you're going to need
at a much more affordable price now last
but not least no gaming accessories list
would be complete without of course a
headset and the one I'm going with is
the turtlebeach XO for stealth
now if the gamer in your family is also
an audiophile keep in mind that there
are way better sounding headset options
out there but you're gonna throw down a
few hundred bucks for them whereas for
its price point the stealth is a great
choice
while not truly Wireless functionally it
pretty much is by plugging into your
xbox one controller through this little
adapter not requiring some crazy long
USB plug gear system and it offers a few
bonus features over the baseline model
most importantly a bass boost so sound
effects like gunshots and explosions
come through nice and cleanly it's also
worth noting that Microsoft does sell
their own version of the audio adapter
separately so if someone you know
already has an awesome headset that uses
a single aux cable you can just grab
them one of these so they can use what
they already have with their Xbox one so
here's just a few gift ideas for the
Xbox one owner you know or maybe a few
things good blow gift cards on in the
