powerhouse the last couple E3s,
and hopefully this year
will be no different,
but there's a lot more unknowns
this year than the past couple.
And there's a few things to
kinda just be a little wary of.
One of them is the fact that Nintendo does
have a habit of relying
on their Nintendo Directs
to announce news whenever they want,
so there's a lot of stuff that we might
want to see at this year's E3,
but could always be saved
for a later announcement.
And one of the biggest rumors and things
that people have been
wanting confirmation on
is whether or not we are
seeing a new Switch this year.
There've been a lot of rumors ever since
the end of last year
regarding that Nintendo
might be working on some
new model of the Switch.
So, the popular rumor of this new Switch
being some time late this year,
does that mean we're going to get
an official announcement at E3?
Probably not, or at
least, I don't think so.
I think Nintendo really approaches E3
with the logic of it being
a game-focused event,
they want to announce new titles,
they wanna focus on games
they've already talked about
and do more in-depth dives on them.
I mean that, after all, is a huge focus
of the Nintendo Treehouse,
is doing sort of, like,
interactive Let's Plays and
showing people gameplay.
I don't think they see that as
a time to focus on hardware.
I mean, even when the
original Switch was announced,
that was not an E3 event, that was its own
separate press conference,
both for the initial reveal
and for the more in-depth
dive into how it works.
So, I think they're gonna
follow a very similar logic
for a potential new Switch model,
where it's gonna be
something that we find out
closer to the holiday
season, later in the summer,
maybe sometime in August.
However, if it does get an
official reveal at this E3,
it would certainly be one
of the bigger surprises
that they could pull out for this year.
After all, one of the things
that's a little awkward
about this one, is I don't feel like
we really have a super strong game title
going into into this E3.
The past few years,
they've always focused on
one major game that has
wide audience appeal,
whether that was Zelda,
Mario, or Smash Bros.
This time around, we've got a
lot of good games coming out,
at least good franchises,
but nothing that I feel like
is an entire show winner.
Fire Emblem's coming out just
a couple months after E3.
Pokemon is getting its
own dedicated Direct
just before E3.
And while Animal Crossing
is an amazing game
and I think gonna be one
of the stronger things
they can focus on, it doesn't have quite
the same huge appeal as those past titles.
If Nintendo really wanted to
come out this E3 swinging,
I think definitely one of
the strongest ways to do it,
aside from a random resurrection
of an old game franchise,
would be to confirm the
concept of a Switch Mini
or even something that's
further on the horizon.
There are, after all, rumors of other,
more powerful Switch models,
or even a whole new system
in development for some time in 2020.
So, if that news got confirmed,
once again, big surprise.
I don't think it's gonna
happen, but it'd be awesome.
As for other non-game announcements
that Nintendo could be making,
there's some that I
think are pretty likely
and some not so much.
On the unlikely side, there is of course
their own service of
Nintendo Switch Online,
which the main purpose of right now
is to play games online.
Now, the added benefit of the service
is you can play some select
Nintendo games on your Switch,
which is a cool little feature,
but a lot of people complained
that it feels very under-baked
compared to what it could be,
and I tend to agree.
Now, the full memberships
last a whole year,
so a lot of them are gonna start going up
in just a few months, so it's possible
that way in advance, Nintendo
could make some announcements
about how they plan to
improve the service.
One of the most likely things being
the addition other game
systems aside from NES,
like Game Boy or SNES.
Will this be announced at E3?
I doubt it, it could maybe
be very lightly touched on,
but I see them focusing
on major announcements
for that service closer to the time
when it's been the one-year anniversary,
so that everyone who signed
up when it first went live
has reasons to renew for another year
instead of just giving it up.
By the way, if you're looking for an easy
and cool way to customize your Switch,
take a look at these skins
from today's sponsor, Dbrand.
They are totally save
to use on your Switch,
on the JoyCons, and on on your dock.
They come in a variety
of different colors,
and one of my favorite
recent ones they've done
are these matte black, they
look awesome on the JoyCons.
Check out the link down
below for more info.
As for other physical products,
I don't see Nintendo focusing
on controllers at all,
accessories aren't really
a big thing they deal with
unless it's something
that is extremely thematic
for a specific game, like when they had
the Pokeball controller for the
last Pokemon Let's Go games.
So, if there was any kind of controller,
it would be something tied into
one of the upcoming titles,
something weird for Animal Crossing, even.
I really doubt it, though.
However, what we will likely see
is of course Nintendo's long-running
and successful collectibles, amiibo!
It's been a habit of Nintendo
to announce new amiibo
at each E3, usually tying
into one of the games
that they have announced for that year
or for something that's
coming out very soon.
Again, we've got a lot of major titles
on the way later this year,
so it wouldn't be surprising to see
some confirmed amiibo
designs for those titles,
or even for something that they
surprise announce at this E3.
There's of course also Nintendo's foray
into cardboard accessories
with Nintendo Labo.
I don't think we're gonna
see any brand new Labo kits.
I think the big focus right now
is on the VR set that
was recently released,
and if there's anything
tied to Labo at all,
it's going to be more software updates
for other games adding some
kind of support for Labo VR.
If there's gonna be anything
Labo related at all,
that's where I see it going,
I really don't think we're
gonna see any brand new kits.
'Course, the big focus for
Nintendo at E3 is the games,
and there's a lot that could
be talked about this year.
And like I mentioned
earlier, I feel like there's
not one singular huge title
like there was the past couple years,
but we have a few really
strong ones to choose from,
including new Fire Emblem, new Pokemon,
although that it is
getting its own Direct,
and, of course, Animal Crossing.
One game that a lot of
people are really hoping
to see this year is Metroid Prime 4
and I'm just not sure that's actually
going to happen this year.
We did get an announcement
that it was being pushed back
earlier this year, so as a result,
the chances of actually seeing
any kind of real major update,
I'm just skeptical.
Now, there is the change they might
have something minor for it prepped,
we might get some kind of update
or maybe hopefully even just some kind
of other hype trailer, something that just
shows a little bit of what
the gameplay could look like,
even if it's not final.
But whether or not we see anything at all,
it's just very much up
in the air right now.
Now, an interesting recent bit of news
is that there's been kind of a &quot;leak&quot;
regarding GameStop listing 21 SKUs
for unannounced Switch
games, mostly likely
in an anticipation of them
being announced at E3.
Now, something to keep in mind
is that when you have SKUs
like that for Nintendo Switch,
it's not necessarily all
first-party Nintendo stuff,
this isn't the same thing
as when Xbox announced,
hey, we have 14 first-party
titles coming to E3,
this is just 21 games in general
that have not been announced yet
that are gonna be on the Switch.
So this could be games coming from EA,
Ubisoft, Square, third party companies
that are making multiplatform stuff,
but definitely some degree that should
be some first-party content.
As for what those games could be,
honestly, anything at this point.
There's a lot that Nintendo's already
kinda ran through lately
for releases on the Switch,
things that have already been announced,
but there's a lot more that could happen.
We might be seeing some other revivals
and sequels of older titles
that haven't seen anything yet.
There are, of course, a
large number of different
Mario franchise games that
could be getting new entries
like Mario Strikers, I hope, I wish,
probably not, though, Mario Golf.
Personally, I really hope to see
an announcement of a new Golden Sun,
that's been my wish basically every year.
The math kinda checks
out this time, though,
it took nine years between two and three,
so, you know, what's another nine years
to make a fourth one?
(chuckles)
(sighs)
Overall, Nintendo is definitely a mystery
for this year's E3, I think it has
a very good chance of going heavily
in one direct or the other,
being either a great surprise,
where there's a lot of stuff we would
have never expected to see get announced,
or it could be all the stuff we know about
with a few handfuls of announcements
that are fine, good, but nothing stellar.
Again though, I think the
big thing about Nintendo
is that they don't rely on E3 exclusively.
Anything that isn't announced
or made big news at E3 this year
is simply because they
are saving more stuff
for later in the year to talk about,
so there's always that chance
that if we don't see
everything we want at E3,
we might just get an announcement
a month or two later.
