bit of a weird controller this is
something that I've seen some coverage
over the past I was really curious about
it and the company that makes it
actually reach out to me seeing if I
want to check it out and I had to say
yes because I really wanted to see how
this thing worked firsthand for myself
and it's this guy right here the mix box
arcade stick kind of this is a fight
stick but instead of having well the
stick part of it they replaced it with a
keyboard setup with four keys that
resemble a WASD so the argument here is
that if you've been playing fighting
games on keyboard first you're a PC
player you never got a stick or anything
before this is gonna be normal or
natural for you or another argument is
that this is actually more intuitive for
someone who's new to fighting games in
general which I grew up on arcade stick
so that's a weird sell to me but that's
part of the reason why I really want to
check this guy out now before we talk
about how it actually works
in personal it's kind of cover the build
of this guy so this is using a metal
arcade body that weighs a little over 5
pounds so it has a decent heft to it but
it's not anything crazy heavy it's gonna
be nice and comfy on your lap and
obviously the setup we've talked about
is that we've got the 4 WASD buttons
right here for movement and then we've
got the 8 v buttons right here for all
the main buttons for you know attacks
and then there's a couple of buttons
that are moved to the top for kind of
auxilary stuff like options pressing the
touchpad share button and the
PlayStation button one of the things
that I really like about this guy is the
fact that sometimes when companies have
kind of cool concepts or weird ideas
like this they'll con rely on just the
concept alone and cheap out on the
actual quality and thankfully that isn't
the situation here so obviously we have
the keyboard and button set up and there
are both really high quality stuff the
keyboard parts are using red Cherry MX
switches if that means nothing to you
basically Cherry MX switches are the
industry standard for good keyboard
switches it's what a lot of gaming
keyboards use red ones in particular
like this the main point of them is that
they're very light and easy to press so
you can do rapid press
really easily now as for the arcade
buttons same kind of deal these are
using what are called sound wad entry
buttons I've talked about them a little
bit in the past basically same idea they
are an industry standard for what a good
arcade button should feel like so
overall build play stuff here I like a
lot of what's going on my only complaint
has to do with the cables so back here
we have a little hatch that hides the
cable which is pretty standard on
fightsticks but it doesn't have like a
hinge it just comes off entirely which
is a little annoying because that means
you could lose it if you forget to put
it back on and the cable length is a
little shorter than I'd like it's long
enough if you're going to use it in a PC
setup or you have some kind of desk B as
far as setup you're using it at a
tournament but in a traditional living
room setup it is not long enough so for
testing this guy out I tried it with a
bunch of room fighting games
specifically Tekken 7 Dragon Ball
fighters injustice 2 and Street Fighter
which is the one I'm going to use just
kind of show some examples of stuff and
like I said one of the big things about
this guy is that it's supposedly it's
supposed to be more intuitive for newer
players and I gotta admit it's actually
a lot more so than I thought it would be
I mean I used to mess with keyboard a
little bit in fighting games back in
like college but I was using a really
bad keyboard so there were other
problems there with this guy
it actually was pretty simple I mean
there's certain things that are
obviously really easy to do you know if
you have to do any kind of double taps
or just do one direction that kind of
thing it's easy
so for Tekken it's great but for Street
Fighter this is the game that worried me
the most because this like a lot of
other fighting games relies a lot on
circular input stuff that was designed
based on the fact that you're using an
arcade stick so for instance you know
the classic aduke and is doing down
forward punch and that's not that hard
to do here you just kind of have to just
kind of roll the keys and you get no
problem I thought it'd be a little more
difficult to do something like an
uppercut because that's like a weird
like Z motion on a stick but once again
it actually came to me pretty naturally
more than I thought it would
no it's faster yeah because I use
multiple fingers I'm not relying on one
hand moving I'm just so the real thing
that scared me about Street Fighter with
this guy is this big fellow right here
zingy so Zen keeps a fighter that relies
on doing things that involve like 360
and even full-on 720 inputs which with a
stick makes a lot of sense you just roll
it around really fast with this guy
though it's a little weirder because you
kind of have to just move the keys and
I've gotten the point where I can like
kind of do it reliably for the 360 the
720 I'm not even come for enough to try
that right now I've been able to do it
but it's not nearly as intuitive or
friendly as a stick is so when it comes
to using this guy with something that
has that rapid emotion it's not
impossible to do it's just not quite as
simple or as intuitive as a stick would
be but that's really the one main region
where this guy starts to fall off for me
when it comes to just normal quarter
circles half circles and you know just
directional stuff it really surprised me
how intuitive and defending this guy
honestly if I'm playing something where
I'm not playing as you know this guy
right here I actually think I'm gonna
start shifting over to using this
instead of a traditional fighting stick
because something too especially for new
people that's really cool about this is
that when you're doing stuff like
rolling inputs it's really easy to
accidentally like overturn and go too
high and then you're jumping when you
don't mean to and stuff like that
especially when you're like frantic in
the fight it's really hard to do that
because you can't exactly accidentally
hit the up key you know you're just
hitting the two keys you need and it
works fine so yeah
I actually really like this so at the
end of the day you're gonna use whatever
style fits you best if you're already
pro fighter status and you have your
arcade stick in there happy with it
great but if you're looking to get into
fighting games and fightstick seem a
little weird view honestly give this
thing a look because like I said I
really just want to check it out because
I was curious I was a little skeptical
at first but it's really won me over it
is super intuitive super comfy to use
it's awesome if you want you get out I
have a link down below in the
description they also sell this in a
black if white isn't so much your style
so check that out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
