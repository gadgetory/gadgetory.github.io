what's your favorite Nintendo switch
game except Zelda Zelda okay seriously
though aside from Zelda the game I've
definitely put the most time into on my
switch right now is shovel Knight it's
not exactly an exclusive game though it
does have an exclusive chapter right now
which is spectra Knight that is
incredibly fun I definitely recommend
checking it out if we want to talk about
stuff that's exclusive to the switch I'd
say my number one is probably fast rmx
it's this sci-fi style racer very much
in the vein of f-zero something we
haven't seen in quite some time
it's really simple but a ton of fun one
other one I think that's worth throwing
out there is if you don't own a ps4
definitely check out I am sets nah it's
better on the ps4 if you can play there
but if not ten elements which is pretty
awesome
which upcoming game are you most hyped
about so what's actually interesting
about this question for me is that a lot
of the games I've been really excited
for and waiting a long time for just
came out in the early part of this year
like Nier automata Mass Effect Andromeda
and of course the new Legend of Zelda
breath of the wild as far as the rest of
this year goes I'd say the one title
that I'm for sure psyched about is
persona 5 and just another couple weeks
but going to been further past that
there are a lot of games I'm really
excited for that we just don't have
definitive release dates for just yet
like Red Dead Redemption to death
stranding the Final Fantasy 7 remake and
just so much more this has been a great
year for games and there's a lot of cool
stuff on the horizon do you ever get
tired of video games and one of their
hobbies do you have if so so I don't
know if I'd ever say that I've gotten
tired of video games in general I've
definitely burnt out on specific genres
like I've played too many FPS or too
many RPGs back-to-back a more recent
example being open-world games because
there have been a lot of great
open-world games recently but there's
been a lot of great open-world games
recently when I'm not playing games are
making videos I spend a lot of my time
consume media you know TV movies books
I'd like to say that I read a lot of
highbrow classics or intellectual
fiction philosophy not really nine times
out of 10 that ends up being trash
fantasy and really when I'm not playing
video games I'm just playing more
traditional old-school game
I love doing lots of board games with
friends different card games and even
tabletop role-playing games like D&amp;amp;D and
other more obscure pen-and-paper RPGs if
you could go back in time and replay any
one game for the first time which one
would it be so this is a weird one and I
had to think about it a lot because
there's a few ways I could go with this
I could replay a game that had some kind
of amazing plot twist I don't want to
have my mind blown all over again or I
could just replay a game I really love
and have that sort of new rush feeling
of experiencing it for the first time
and the conclusion I've come to is I
would replay Super Mario RPG on the SNES
not because it's one of my favorite
games but because that was the first
real RPG I played and it completely
changed my perception about gaming you
know I missed out on stuff like Final
Fantasy and Chrono Trigger up until then
and it was this new experience that was
so much different and really introduced
me into what is now my favorite genre of
gaming</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
