we are almost there December and you
know what that means it's time for gift
guides we're doing one focused on each
system and today we're taking a look at
some awesome gifts you can get for the
ps4 owner you know and make sure you pay
attention to because we might also have
a little giveaway going on right now
this year saw a lot of new pro
controllers come up to the ps4 and one
of them is the scuff Vantage now what's
really interesting about this controller
is that it's a bit of a departure from
what scuff has done in the past for ps4
often times their designs in the past
like the impact and the infinity
we're just heavily modded ps4
controllers that you could customize in
the case of the Vantage however this is
a built from the ground up brand new
controller for the ps4 and one things I
love about it is that it's a very
modular right on the design previous
ones you'd have to use a lot of tools
switch things out or just order it to be
a certain way and it would ride that way
this one you can change out the
faceplates you can remove the rumble
motors replace the sticks replace the
d-pad all kinds of stuff you're gonna do
right on board or that any outside
assistance which is great if you want to
go all out it is available in a wired
and wireless model however if you want
to save a little money there is a wired
only option as well as any longtime ps4
owner can tell you one issue that you're
going to run into at some point is hard
drive space the longer the own system
the more games you get is just gonna
fill up and if you don't want to play
that always horrible game of what can I
afford to delete right now it's a really
great idea to pick up an external hard
drive there's not a ton of options out
there that are officially branded as ps4
however you can find a lot that are more
or less clearly aimed at that by going
for the right color combo like we have
this one from Seagate which comes in a
nice blue and black which is really
stylish you just hook it into the back
of your ps4 and bam you have more space
to use to save more games
one thing that of course every ps4 owner
has is a controller and if you've got
any special edition designs you want to
make sure that thing's actually proudly
on display and not just sitting in a
drawer somewhere or laying around on the
ground so a great little pick up is a
controller stand that's right a
controller staing because when you have
special digit designs like this monster
hammer right here which is one of my
personal favorites you want to be able
to have it somewhere that's actually on
display and people wouldn't see the cool
design on it not just laying on its
countertop like this next up is
something that's a little weirder is a
little outside of the box and I'm going
to be honest probably not at the top of
someone's list until they actually give
it a shot and try it out and find out
that it's actually pretty cool I just
realized it an awkward pun but the point
is it's a cooling fan for your
controller that's right this is a
cooling fan from Nyko that attaches to
the bottom of your DualShock 4
controller you just charge it on its own
right here with this port and then you
turn it on give us a nice little fan
that's gonna keep your hands nice and
cool over long hours of gameplay one of
the always important accessories for any
gamer is a headset when it comes to the
ps4 there are a lot of options out there
but when it comes to getting the best
value for your dollar one of the
consistent top line winners is the
official PlayStation Gold headset this
is a wireless headset designed
specifically for the ps4 by Sony and for
its price range it is one of the best
sounding and durable at the same time
they actually did a design overhaul
that's made it a little more lightweight
which I really appreciate and if you're
willing to spend a little more money
there is the special edition design I
have right here which is based on the
500 million won which has this awesome
transparent dark blue and just a dark
blue outline overall which is just
beautiful looking by the way you guys
haven't seen yet we are doing a Nintendo
switch giveaway right now we've had a
good year we want to celebrate with you
guys by giving away a Nintendo switch
that I'm doing with John Morrison if you
guys want a chance to enter just check
out the link down below in the
description usually when people think
about must-have accessories for their
Playstation the first thoughts are
controllers and headsets but something
else I think is equally important that
doesn't triptan everyone's mind right
away is a carrying case now if you would
just have your one PlayStation and you
want to bring it to a friend's house or
you're bringing it to work sometime or
just you need a reason to move from one
place to another you don't want to just
have this unorganized mess of cables
you're just carrying and hopefully don't
drop at any point so carrying cases are
really handy now this is actually one
they designed for the original ps4 but
it will fit the ps4 slim just fine they
actually have a newer model out right
now that removes some of the branding so
it's not quite advertising what you have
in the bag but it has just a space to
carry the PlayStation itself some extra
controllers all your cables with room
for discs and everything else you need a
one so it's a really convenient way to
keep it all together in one tight
package so you can take it on the go the
standard low shock for for the ps4 is a
good controller but it's not for
everyone some people prefer the layout
of an Xbox one controller and if you own
multiple systems you don't always like
the idea of having to switch between the
two different styles all the time so a
great solution for this is this little
adapter from Brook this plugs in to an
Xbox one controller and makes it so
it'll work with other devices like a ps4
or a switch or even PC this is gonna
allow you to use this on any system you
like so you can just use one controller
across all of them and have a consistent
play style it's easy to set up you just
plug it into the controller replacing
the battery port and it acts as a
rechargeable battery as well which is a
nice little bonus and allowed to use it
across all your systems one issue that
long-term ps4 owners have had to deal
with is the relatively short battery
life of the DualShock 4 controller now
late
versions of the controller have improved
on this issue they are much better than
they were when the system first launched
but it can still be a little annoying if
you're not constantly plugging it in and
realized oh no I've got a low charge so
a great solution to this is to buy a
charging stand this is a really nice
basic one you can just pick up on Amazon
for super cheap it's gonna allow you to
charge two controllers at the same time
you just cradle them on it while it's
plugged into a wall unit a lot easier
than have to worry about going up to
your system getting a cable plugging it
all in you just have to set up a nearby
door somewhere that's conveniently close
to where you like to play a lot hook it
up an easy place to set down your
controllers we're not using them and
make sure their charges always admix now
we've already talked about one hits an
option for the ps4 with the gold headset
which is a great affordable one but if
you want to spend a little more money
and get a little fancier there's some
really awesome choices out there one of
my recent favorites is the new naari
ultimate from razors now this is
something that's a little bit different
from standard headsets because first off
you are still getting a high-quality
it's a great audio great durability and
offer surround sound is even giving you
some positional tracking so you can hear
above and below not just left right and
forward but what's really interesting
about this headset in particular is it
also has haptic engines in the ear cups
now yes this is marketed specifically
for PC but it's designed to work on
other systems as well and in fact ps4 is
one of the situations where you can
still use the wireless USB dongle which
is awesome and the way it works is that
any sound that's coming to the headset
will cause it to start activating these
little Rumble motors in the sides it's a
little subtle at first but especially
when you get large explosions in a game
or gunshots from like that you'll really
start to feel the difference and it's
honestly a truly immersive experience
these things are awesome I can't quite
explain how cool it is to feel the
sounds at the same time it's it's cool
check it out if you're looking for
something that's a little more of a
stocking stuffer and not gonna break the
bank a great little option for
PlayStation for our thumb grips these
are thumb grips from control freak and
I'm basically recommending them on every
gift guide because they are just awesome
little pick ups especially for the price
these latch onto your Jill truck for
controllers thumb sticks they add a
little extra height so you get some more
precision when aiming especially for FPS
games and they have a much creepier
texture than the controller has by
default so make sure that in higher
tension situations you're keeping your
thumbs on those sticks it's a nice
simple little add-on you'll be surprised
how much improve someone's game if
you're just looking for that little
something extra to give someone for a
Playstation these are them if you or
someone you know owned a
of playstation stuff I'm talking having
the system extra controllers a headset a
VR headset just all that kinda stuff
it's hard to sometimes keep track of all
in heaven in one nice place so a really
cool solution to this comes from sky
wind this is a cooling stand for the ps4
it'll fit the ps4 pro specifically but
it also gives spaces to put the VR
headset the controller sport a headset
in the back to controller charging ports
on the side and even adds USB outs on
the front it even gives you a place to
store external hard drives if you need
them the cooling aspect is I need bonus
but honestly just the ability to have
all this together and one nice little
setup I think it actually looks really
clean and keeps all your stuff nice and
organized we've talked about some pro
controllers but what if we want to go in
the opposite direction something that's
a little more affordable so you give as
gift especially for kids in mind that's
where the Hori mini pad comes into play
I love this little controller I mean
look there's definitely better options
out there if you want something that's a
pro little thing but if you just want
something that kids can use comfortably
and you're not worried about them
breaking it and then you're out of sixty
bucks this is a great little choice this
has all the buttons you need the only
thing that's missing is a full touchpad
which you still have a touchpad button
if anything needs to be clicked in but
anything with full touch interface not
so much but very few games actually use
that anymore
it is a wired hookup but it's actually
designed to be very much like an
old-school SNES controller which as an
adult is a little weird to grip but for
a kid this is the perfect size going
back to carrying cases the one we talked
about earlier is a great choice for
someone that has a ps4 slim or is even
still using the original ps4 but if you
have a pro it's not gonna cut it because
it is a much bigger system so a great
solution is this gaming backpack so this
is designed to fit a ps4 pro it also
worked for like an Xbox one X and any
other larger systems but the main
benefit here is it's gonna give you a
way to carry that or controllers games
wires a bunch of extra stuff too and I
really appreciate that while this is
definitely designed a little bit with
kind of the gamer look in mind it
doesn't happily advertise that oh this
is a system carrying case there is going
to be a ps4 in here it doesn't push that
vibe at all now if you want to get a
really nice gift for a ps1 or something
that's like expensive top line kind of
thing I personally really love the
SteelSeries arctas Pro Wireless this is
their top line model they make for ps4
it does also work on PC as well and this
is just an amazing headset in general
great sound quality's super comfortable
you can play with this thing on for a
long period
not be bothered at all and I also really
love the battery solution that used for
this because with wireless ones it can
get a little annoying when you need to
you know plug it into your ps4 or find a
wall outlet or just any kind of way of
charging instead this one relies on a
pair of removal batteries one that will
sit inside the headset and another one
that sits inside the wireless
transmitter that acts as a charging
station so as soon as one battery gets
low just pop it out replace it with the
other one switch them and you're good to
go they do make a wired version of this
as well that's a little more affordable
and you're still gonna get that great
audio quality but the cable length on
that is a little short I think it's more
suited to a PC setup for ps4 Wireless is
the way to go next we have a controller
that is honestly my personal favorite
that I got to mess with earlier this
year but it has one little pick up with
trying to pick it up and we'll talk
about that in a second but it's the
razor rise u ultimate this is an amazing
ps4 controller it is super comfortable
lots of awesome little customization
options and in typical Razer fashion it
does support promo so you get some
awesome lights around the touchpad which
is a great look well this is the
controller I recommend most for ps4 one
little snag with it is that it's
actually not technically available in
the US so you can grab it in your up
super watching from there awesome but
for US customers you're gonna have to
deal with importing one which can take a
little longer and also you're probably
paying a little more than MSRP on
something that's already a pretty
expensive controller so it can be a
little rough to get your hands on but if
you want to give someone the absolute
best of the best do it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
