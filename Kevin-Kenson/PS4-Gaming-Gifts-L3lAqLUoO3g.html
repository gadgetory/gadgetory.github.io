today we're talking about Sony let's go
over some of the best gifts you can get
for the PlayStation 4 owner you know can
you list off what is the biggest thing
that gamers use all the time
controllers and while the DualShock 4 is
a solid controller that gets the job
done there are more choices out there
for instance if you want to give to
someone a pro controller option I'm a
big fan of the Nikon revolution I think
it's got a better grip design I like the
switch the sticks around and has a whole
bunch of different customization options
to make sure you get the most out of
your controller including some
customizable macros on the back at the
other end of the spectrum though if
you've got kids in the family that like
to use systems but the DualShock still
little too big for them Hori now has an
interesting new option for the mini ps4
controller now this is a wired
controller option and for an adult it's
not necessarily the best choice but it's
fitted just right for kids it's kind of
reminiscent of an SNES controller but
it's a little thicker and has these
little grip grooves on the back as well
and not to mention this is a much
cheaper controller than getting say an
official Dual Shock or purl one so if
you've got a kid you want to make sure
they're not using the most expensive
option out there this is a great choice
now of course controllers are important
but there are other accessories that can
help shape your gaming experience and
one of the biggest is headsets and
thankfully since Sony owns their own
headphone division they're able to make
some great in-house headsets for the
PlayStation 4 such as their
top-of-the-line platinum headset or
their more affordable and still really
solid mid-range option the gold headset
these are both awesome designs they're
comfortable you get little customization
options through the ps4 interface
directly and they make use of a dongle
which some people might not like the
idea of f-first but this makes sure that
you have a dedicated connection there's
gonna be way stronger than any kind of
generic Bluetooth design along with the
great sound quality these things also
offer a solid build and good battery
life making them an awesome option for
any PlayStation 4 owner you know that is
yet to invest in a headset now a
returning product that I talked about
before for the original PlayStation 4
and I think still makes a great option
especially now with the ps4 Pro is
cooling stand options actually can we
get where's there a microfiber cloth I'm
just like oh no I see all this lint now
mr. Rowland now in general I'm not super
huge in the idea of cooling stands but
in the case of the ps4s especially the
pro these things get really really warm
so getting the added support from a
stand that might also help make sure
that the Playstations own fan doesn't
kick in and start making a lot more
noise this thing's actually a great
investment and it's gonna offer you a
couple other benefits as well that are
really really useful for instance it
plugs into the system of drawing power
so you actually have an expansion of
three more USB ports to places to put
controllers and charge those as well and
to top it all off you're able to show
off the top side of your system which if
you want a special edition like the Star
Wars run right here is just gonna look
awesome our number of functional useful
cool things you can get to the ps4 let's
talk about some more kind of collectible
fun things you can get one thing I've
always been a huge proponent of our art
books now thankfully Sony's had a lot of
awesome first party games coming out
this year and I think one of the best
ones visually especially conceptually is
horizon zero dawn I mean there's just so
much cool stuff that goes on in the game
involving robot dinosaurs and this
post-apocalyptic landscape that actually
seeing the concept art that went into it
is really frickin cool and this isn't
your particular favorite game there's a
whole lot of other awesome games out
there that have art books for them like
persona 5 the Uncharted series lots of
other great options you can't go wrong
with art books now this holiday season I
have been in a bit of a board game movie
I've got one for each of these videos
and for Sony I am so excited about this
one
the blood-borne card game now
blood-borne is not a recent release for
the ps4 but it's honestly still my
favorite exclusive game the system has
and the board game for it is frickin
awesome it's actually more of a card
game really it's one of those really
cool ones where you do this kind of
mixture of cooperative and competitive
where you all need to work together to
beat the game but still be in the game
ultimately one of you is the winner so
you have to constantly balance out
making sure that you're doing this best
for everyone but still making sure that
you get out ahead not to mention that on
top of just the gameplay itself being
fun the build quality on this game is
phenomenal especially for its price
point this is actually one of the
better-looking ones I've seen for under
40 bucks it is a great game check it out
so here's some great gift ideas for the
Sony fan you know I'm gonna link
everything down below along with a
couple other option as well so make sure
to check that out
and I'll see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
