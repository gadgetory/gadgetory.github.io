featured recently on the channel is this
light up dock right here from PDP which
i think is an awesome accessory for just
doing something a little different with
your Nintendo switch setup because the
regular dock is well kind of boring and
this does a lot more interesting things
for it and while it comes with two
different little sheets like this four
designs down on the front
I started thinking how cool would it be
to actually have more options that you
could switch between more often and
really how hard would it be to do on our
own which we kind of learned was
actually harder than we thought it would
look let's just let's just show you what
would happen so we're taking a look at
these inserts and what actually they're
made out of there's really only two
things we have to worry about the
artwork itself which we'll get to later
and more importantly right now the
plastic sheet that it's based on now
you're not exactly gonna find something
shaped exactly like this so you have to
do a little home improvement job so
first off we got clear acrylic sheets
like this now you can find these at
pretty much any home improvement store
you can also grab them online and this
is the small size we could find so we do
have to cut it down this is an 8 by 10
inch sheet what's more important though
is the thickness because you can't
really as easily defend yourself so this
is a point oh eight inch thick one or in
the more logical metric system it's two
millimeters so that's the size you want
to get to match these inserts and we're
gonna do our best to kind of cut out and
shape this to match the design that PDP
did now if you're wondering why this
piece of acrylic is so much he's you're
looking than the PDP one that's because
when you buy these it actually has this
little protective film layer on it that
way when you're doing stuff like we are
where you're cutting it you're going to
accidentally make all kinds of Nicks and
stuff in the plastic as a result of that
though it's also really hard to do
things like actually pencil in where you
want to cut stuff so instead when you
want to make markings we actually took
the PDP sheet itself and used it as a
stencil where we grabbed a box cutter
and cut lines all around to get the size
that we wanted now something worth
noting here is that we did choose to cut
on the higher parts and leave the bottom
intact to be the base for it because
it's really important for these sheets
at the bottom is perfectly straight well
we're gonna do our best job to make a
straight cut otherwise this is just
gonna make our job a lot easier because
needs to rest right on the bottom of
that dock now once we've done the kind
of drawing with the box cutter the next
step is to actually cut it now there's a
whole bunch of tutorials you can find
online for how to cut plastic sheets
like this and one of the idea is that we
initially thought would be a good
to go for us was using a dremel tool
because well we have one on hand and
while that did work it did have the
problem making it a lot harder to make
sure we had a perfectly straight cut so
instead we decided to go maybe a little
overboard and upgraded to a chop saw
real quick by the way this probably
should go without saying but kids don't
try this at home and adults please use
proper safety wear and wear gloves and
some kind of eye protection so once we
were done cutting out the main pieces
the next step we had to do actually
ended up being probably the most
difficult part of this whole idea and
that was getting the notches down below
so that this could sit inside that talks
little base area where the lights shoot
up and we had a couple of these had to
do this and well a lot of they're just
difficult that way we thought we would
first off we got a sanding diamond wheel
point tip to use on the dremel tool
which we thought we just kind of let us
like lightly sand it down and get that
kind of curve going just right and
instead all that ended up doing was
melting the plastic around the tip and
basically just completely ruined it so
clearly that didn't work so the next
idea was to do something similar to how
we did the initial cut out which was to
use a box cutter to just kind of cut a
little groove area that we wanted out
and then use scissors to cut that
portion off but that didn't work because
of the high tension on the acrylic sheet
so what happened was when we use the
scissors it just caused these massive
cracks to form and well obviously we
can't use this because it's just got an
awful little final version is that this
point that we realized we didn't really
need to perfectly match whatever it is
PDP Dib you didn't have to have these
tiny perfect exact notches as long as we
had enough plastic per to sit on the
base it was gonna be fine even if we had
to cut a little deeper in so instead of
using scissors or any kind other tools
we just used the regular saw tool on the
Dremel to cut out the area we needed
which will led to a much smoother cut
without causing any kind of major
fractures in the plastic now while all
this cutting so far has gotten us the
rough shape that we needed obviously
it's not exactly looking great just yet
that's what we need to take a sanding
tool for the dremel tool to actually
smooth out all the edges and everything
to make sure that it's actually a nice
good-looking piece of plastic you wanna
display and now those jagged piece of
stuff that we just cut out of a sheet so
now that we have our base piece of
plastic the next step is to do the
artwork now we don't know 100% for sure
how PDP did this our best guess is that
use silk-screening which basically
employs a very thin layer of paint so
instead for our group which is gonna be
a little simpler is we just picked up
vinyl stickers there are a ton of these
things on the internet mostly for cars
sometimes for like mac books and laptops
and that kind of thing but they're
really easy to set up and apply all you
got to do is take off the base piece
there gonna be a clear bit of plastic
along with the white part you put that
on when you're doing take off the clear
plastic
and all that's gonna remain is the white
cutout so we thought cool we can pick up
a variety of these different stickers to
do different designs on hand and maybe
down the road try something a little
more custom but after we applied a
sticker we discovered a bit of a problem
so at first glance after we apply these
stickers we think hey this actually
doesn't look too bad but once we
actually turn the dock on with them in
we realized well probably didn't really
anticipate you see the stickers that
have a lot of surface area it's very
easy for those to get air bubbles which
you don't notice at all when the
stickers just applied to something but
when you have a light running through it
well now you're starting to see all
these holes and things in place that
make it look well just not good from far
away it can kind of be pulled off
sometimes but up close you really start
to notice problems with this design now
if you're really careful you can use a
thicker sticker and get away with it
like this one we did right here with a
Sonic and Tails design we were a lot
more careful on this one and as a result
you don't have as many air bubbles but
there is another problem that comes up
with this where when you have this much
surface area the light doesn't pierce
through as well so while this design
does work and it doesn't look half bad
you're definitely not getting the same
sense of color that you do with some of
the other ones so in general might be
better go with designs like this
Nintendo one where you're gonna have
much thinner stickers to work with so
more lights gonna pierce through and you
have to worry about those air bubbles so
what have we learned well it is totally
possible to do something like this I
mean it's gonna take a lot of time
investment you're rolling it to buy a
lot of plastic sheets to go through
different run throughs of cutting them
down and you're gonna need to have the
right tools on hand but if you have all
this stuff and a bit of a knack for you
know do-it-yourself kind of crafting
stuff this is something you could do
though honestly based on our first-hand
experience it's probably better left to
professionals</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
