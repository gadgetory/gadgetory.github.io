- One of the longest
running questions we've had
is can we see your Amiibo collection?
And it's an idea that I've
been kinda holding off
on for a while because I
wanted to grow the collection
a little more and we never
really had a good way
of displaying it all at
once, at least until now
with this wall setup behind me.
Now I'm not gonna boast
and say this is like
the largest Amiibo collection
or anything like that.
Mainly because I'm not actually trying
to collect all of them as they're released
'cause that's way too
daunting and insane for me.
Instead, I really focus on just collecting
kinda just specific ones
based on what I really like
and there's usually like
kinda four main groups.
First, I collect anything
that is Fire Emblem or Zelda
'cause those are my two most
favorite Nintendo franchises.
And somewhat regrettably
after I made that decision,
they've also turned out to
be the two biggest series,
they keep pumping out
a lot of Amiibos for.
Proven by the fact that the
whole bottom two rows here
are nothing but Zelda.
After that, I really end
up collecting Amiibos
either if they are some
kind of third-party company
where there's not a lot of
little stashes and stuff in them
and I just enjoy the fact that
there's some kind of cool little figure.
For instance, I got the Bayonetta
and Cloud one's up there,
Shovel Knight especially.
And then the kind of last category
is any Amiibo where they
kinda do something special
or different or really cool.
I think a great example
of this is the Yarn Yoshi
where it's actually a knit little figure
which is so awesome.
So with all these guys lined up,
let's go ahead and take a look
at some of my absolute favorites.
Starting with the Archer Link Amiibo
from Breath of The Wild.
So I actually ranked all of
the Link Amiibos ways back
and this one was still
my favorite back then.
Mainly 'cause the attention to
detail is so cool on this guy
and I really appreciate
the fact that compared
to a lot of other
Amiibos where a character
is just standing somewhere
or has some kind of regular stance,
this one actually has a
little bit of action going on.
And instead of having just
like a clear plastic stand
or something to support
it, they just tie in
this kind of little dirt cloud behind him
which just looks so cool.
This is just one of the
best ones they've made.
So moving on from him, I'm gonna stick
with Zelda a little longer and talk about
the Champion Amiibos.
All four of them really are super awesome,
mainly because not only is just a great
variety of characters but because it's one
of the kind of later lines of Amiibos
that Nintendo started making,
you can really start to tell
the increase in quality with these.
Especially with someone like Daruk.
There's just so much
extra sculpting and detail
that goes on with these
Amiibos versus other designs.
Just down to how his body is shaped,
the details on the weapons,
all the individual hairs going on.
There's just so much
attention on these ones
that I just can't help
but appreciate them.
It's probably one of the best
full sets of Amiibos they've released.
So moving on, let's talk about
some other Amiibo designs
other than just ones from Zelda.
This next one admittedly is a little more
because I love the novelty
of it and not the character
or the specific design
but it's the Baby Metroid
that was released as part of
the Samus Returns Remake on 3DS.
I love this little guy
'cause I like I said earlier,
I really like any Amiibo
where they kinda do
something a little special
or a little different
and in this case, while
Baby Metroid isn't exactly
a big name character that I love,
I can't get over the
fact they actually made
this kind of squishy membrane for it.
This little see-through clear part
that has this plastic that gives,
that is just a great little detail.
Now next, I want to take a moment
to talk about what is probably
one of the rarest Amiibos I
own, if not the rarest for sure.
And that's the female Corrin
from Super Smash Bros.
So near the end the last
set of Super Smash Bros.
Amiibos they released,
all came in sets of two
where there was kind of the main design
which was really easy to get and they had
player two costumes that were
limited to specific retailers.
This one in particular was
only available on Amazon
and they sold out super fast.
So I really looked at grabbing this one
and kinda like with the Champion Amiibos,
one of the things I really love about it
is you can just tell that
this is kind of the stage
where Nintendo started
taking the Amiibo designs
a lot more seriously
and the amount of detail
and sculpting, especially
looking at the face
compared to some of
the older Amiibo faces,
it just looks so much better.
And then going kind of in the opposite
direction of these ones is one of the less
clearly defined Amiibos that
I own but I love him so much,
is up there in the top middle
is my Shovel Knight Amiibo.
Like I was saying, I
really like collecting
any Amiibos that don't have
like traditional Nintendo stuff,
there's not always a
lot of figures of them.
It's no secret that Shovel Knight
was one of my absolute
favorite indie games
and the moment they announced one
that was gonna be an actual Amiibo,
I just could not wait and I
grabbed that guy immediately.
I mean, just look at it, it's beautiful.
So that's where I'm at
right now with Amiibos.
Let me know down below in the comments
the ones you guys been collecting,
what your favorites are and
I'll see you guys later.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
