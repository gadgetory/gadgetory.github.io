on strong and one of the biggest ones to
look out for this year that people
really hyped up for is the PlayStation
Classic I know I was excited for it cuz
to this day the ps1 is still one of my
favorite consoles with an amazing
library to pull from but now that the
console is here it's kind of
underwhelming don't get me wrong it has
its strengths but it has its problems
too and something that really highlights
this fact to me is that on the same day
this came out for around the same price
I got something that I think celebrates
my love a PlayStation much better these
shoes I get it this is kind of a bizarre
ID and it's not something you can really
do a one-to-one comparison with but
trust me there is a logic and argument
to all of this but first let's take a
look at both these starting with the
classic and a first glance the
PlayStation classic is exactly what you
would expect is just a little tiny
miniature PlayStation and I think that
they did a really good job on that as
far as just the build quality goes this
is a cool little looking replica
obviously it's not an exact match the
ports are different HDMI USB for the
controllers but it looks like a little
tiny PlayStation I appreciate that
there's even some cool little details
about it too like the open button is
pressed below and it doesn't actually
pop up in the lid so you might be
wondering well what exactly does that do
well when you're playing games that have
multiple discs like Final Fantasy 7 this
is the button you have to hit in order
to change discs which on the one hand
sounds kind of annoying but it happens
rarely enough that I think it's just a
cool little detail and I appreciate that
sadly though once you put the system up
that's kind of where these details in
yes does kind of recreate the way the PS
one's menu looked when you're doing
things like messing with the memory
cards but it's just very bare-bones and
basic looking and there's not a lot to
it you're picking between different
games and there's a couple little basic
settings you can just but that's really
it something that I really appreciate
about the NES and SNES classics is they
felt like something that was a bit of a
labor of love there's lots of little fun
details and things that really reached
out to fans they gave you choices for
things you could add Scanlan's you could
create borders and different backdrops
to make up to the fact that it's a four
by three game none of that is really
present here all the games are in four
by three with just a black border around
everything and then when you look at the
list of games available on it the whole
thing is just kind of well awkward
I wouldn't necessarily say that any of
the games on there are bad although some
of them have certainly aged much better
than others but when you look at the
list of choices and what's not here
there's a lot of games that just don't
seem like they necessarily belong
especially you're only sticking to 20
games I mean for instance Metal Gear
Solid at 5-7 awesome makes perfect sense
should be on here but at the same time
you have stuff like battle orient Toshi
de and a Ridge Racer Ridge Racer but you
don't have Grenier is MOU or castlemania
city the night or even Crash Bandicoot
the fact that this is a PlayStation
classic and doesn't feature a game that
basically was the mascot of the system
is insane to me there is a part of me
that still thinks that if you were I'd
era hard fan this is still a pretty cool
collectible because let's be honest when
it comes to a lot of these classic
systems people pick them up and they
play them for maybe a week two weeks go
back on occasion but at the end of the
day it's basically a cool little
collectible paperweight you know I think
if you're a die-hard fan and you really
just want to collect this because you
just love everything playstation then
cool go ahead and grab it but if you
want to actually re-experience and play
these old games this just doesn't really
capture that feeling right you know
compared to what Nintendo is done with
the NES and SNES Classic editions I
think this is something that kind of
meets the bare minimum requirements it
has the game on it it looks like a
little system but there's just not any
other real love behind as for the shoes
well these are the PG 2.5 playstation
shoes from Nike and we actually covered
the older version of these that came out
earlier this year just the regular PG 2s
and it's really interesting the shift in
design aesthetic they went between these
see the original PG 2's were focused on
being the sort of celebration of
PlayStation 4 specifically so the
aesthetic was much more focused on this
black design with some cuts of blue here
and there and they used the four button
colors from the PlayStation controller
as little accents on the other hand with
the 2.5 s there's been this decision to
go with a much more retro design going
for the gray of the original PlayStation
kind of lining up with what we're
talking about with the PlayStation
Classic and the accent colors are
actually different it's not the four
button colors but instead it's the four
colours that are present in the original
PlayStation logo which some of them are
similar in the same but you'll also get
that kind of orangish yellow and a more
kind of hot pink salmon color as opposed
to the pink and orange of the buttons
there's also of course just the general
design changes from the PG 2 s 2 2 point
5s and one of the ways that
impacts the issue specifically is the
print design of the for PlayStation
controller symbols is a lot more heavily
present which I really like well I
wouldn't say either shoe designs bad
looking or anything I definitely think
the 2.5 is just this really cool
celebration of old-school stuff like the
twos were cool and you know the recent
they're more the kind of modern look
Morna comes just having that like retro
love that's what I think of when you
think about how you feel about Nold
system it's not what the current trend
is is where it started from though it is
worth noting that just like with the
twos this does have the light of effects
which are a little more reminiscent of
the ps4 where you get that nice kind of
glowing blue that you can't have in a
solid color or this kind of pulsing
effect which is really neat although I
probably shouldn't have it on very often
this is a really interesting form of
cross promotion because there's a lot of
different stuff it's a brand adapter for
video game consoles and things but this
is one where I feel like I mean you take
it with you and it's something a little
nicer than just a t-shirt or a hat or
beanie shoes have a lot more going into
them and there's an interesting history
behind the different times that
PlayStation has collaborated in this way
in fact way back in 2006 was actually
their first home was Nike which was an
Air Force One and it's something they've
been really heavy on this last year with
the 2.5 the PG 2s I talked about earlier
and then even more recently at least
from the PG twos was a Air Force Dillon
they did during e3 that we also got our
hands on which are also very pretty but
once again still focused on that ps4
aesthetic the point I'm trying to make
here is that while these are two very
different products all is really the
reason why they're being marketed and
why people want to pick them up is the
same you're a PlayStation fan that wants
to pick something up that represents
your retro love of the system and the
shoes just do a better job of that I
mean the PlayStation Classic is an
awesome idea and if it were done right I
would definitely pick it over the shoes
but the weights designed right now it's
just the bare minimum it's just kind of
something that was made to capture this
kind of craze and nothing beyond that
whereas the shoes or something that a
lot of thought and design went into and
there's just a lot more loving care and
crafts involved when you look at them in
terms of these differences it's just
night and day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
