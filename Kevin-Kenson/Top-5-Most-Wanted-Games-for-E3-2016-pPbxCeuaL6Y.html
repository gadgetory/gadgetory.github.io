that list of games that they're just
hoping to get announced year after year
after year so I thought I would talk
about the five games that I would
absolutely flip my shit over if they got
announced at this year's e3 first off is
Elder Scrolls 6 now I have been a huge
fan of this franchise ever since playing
Elder Scrolls 3 morrowind which
continues to really be my favorite of
the series I mean don't get me wrong
oblivion and Skyrim are both great games
as well but they put a lot of effort
into simplifying and streamlining a lot
of things from morrowind some of which
was definitely for the better but there
are some things that I just really miss
especially the complexity of the game's
dungeon designs the biggest thing for me
really though is that if and when they
announce Elder Scrolls 6 I just want it
to feel
alien again one of the things I really
loved about morrowind is that it wasn't
just fantasy but it was also completely
unique in design as far as what kind of
monsters and creatures that you
encountered including giant insects and
flying jellyfish meanwhile oblivion and
Skyrim basically covered all the stuff
that we're used to seeing over and over
and over again all that being said the
chances of a new Elder Scrolls being
announced is pretty unlikely I mean
fallout 4 just came out this last
holiday season so they're still working
on DLC for that if they were gonna do
any kind of reveal board it would just
be a very minor reveal teaser for some
release date in late 2017 or even 2018
but even that alona get pretty hyped up
for now second up is something I would
love to see from Rockstar which would be
Red Dead Redemption 2 or red dead 3 red
dead revolution red dead reconciliation
whatever the hell you want to call it I
want that game it's been six years since
redemption came out and rockstars
released some good games since then
especially GTA 5 but the fact that
matter is in my opinion Red Dead
Redemption is the best game they have
ever made and it's about time we
revisited it it just did such a
fantastic job of capturing the western
genre that so very few games really try
to tap into and it did it's so much
better than all the other ones that have
tried who knew that just taking the
basic mechanics that we've become
familiar with in GTA and applying it to
a Wild West setting where you're
stealing horses instead of cars would
end up being such an incredibly fun game
not to mention they had one of the
best storylines that Rockstar has ever
delivered being a perfect homage to
several different styles of Western
films now Rockstar has a history of
never really doing stuff at e3 they
normally avoid it but there's been some
rumors lately that 2016 might be an
exception the company above them take to
interactive has hinted that they're
going to have some kind of big surprise
game announcement for this year's e3 and
just perfectly timed with it there is
supposedly been a leaked bit of concept
art that teases possibly a Red Dead
Redemption remake or maybe even a whole
new game either of which would be good
news but a full-blown sequel would
definitely make me a lot more excited
now speaking of a franchise that needs
revisiting third up is Devil May Cry and
I'm not talking about having a sequel to
2013's DMC which was a very pretty game
but it failed to have the depth that the
rest of the series had I want a new
Devil May Cry that revisits what made
the older games so good I want a main
character who's snarky not angsty and
whiny about the world like the new Dante
was I want a Devil May Cry that actually
challenges you to learn how to do combos
instead of just making everything easily
flow into everything else and most
importantly I want to double make cry
that actually challenges you instead of
holding your hand the whole way while
being a bunch of pretty eye candy hoping
that the game isn't too hard now
thankfully just like with Red Dead there
has been some recent rumor that this
might be happening at this year's e3 as
there's been a leaked photo of the voice
actors for Nero and Dante doing motion
capture together which admittedly is
very thin evidence but it's enough to
get my hopes up now for number four
let's divert course a little bit so far
we've all been talking about
action-adventure RPG style games but now
I want to talk about one of the very few
sports games that I absolutely love and
that's SSX SSX tricky and SSX 3 are some
of the most fun of head and split-screen
ever because they perfectly balanced
having some pseudo realistic basis on
how actual snowboarding works but more
importantly it made the whole thing
silly and allowed you to do over-the-top
crazy shit and I had really high hopes
for the new SSX that came out a few
years ago but it pretty much removed
that entire part of the game opting
instead to try and make it this more
realistic or serious kind of experience
and even worse it got rid of the
competitive aspects of the game instead
of having races or trying to do
tricks and other players instead opted
to just have this time trial mode where
you make bets and try to get a better
time score than other players which
paled in comparison thankfully it still
managed to have fun core gameplay and an
incredible soundtrack but I would just
love it if EA Sports revisited this
franchise and just brought back a little
bit of the silly fun that made the older
game so special now for last on the list
I'm actually not gonna talk about a
specific game but instead I have a
request of a company that I've been a
longtime fan of but have also been kind
of drifting away from over time and
that's for Square Enix to bring back any
of the major JRPG franchises that they
haven't touched in forever it could be
the mana series Chrono Trigger Valkyr
profile just get one of these games that
have a fantastic cult fanbase and
breathe some new air into them and I
don't mean making a port of one of the
old games to iPhone or doing some kind
of mobile spin-off of them I mean a
proper brand new sequel and it's obvious
that Square has been experimenting with
the idea of doing this I mean a lot of
the recent activity has been trying to
bring back some old-school flavor
bravely default is basically Final
Fantasy in all but name and one of their
upcoming games that hasn't released yet
in the u.s. is I am setsuna which
according to reviews from overseas is
basically Chrono Trigger with a
different setting so it just feels like
it's time for them to finally take one
of those old properties and do something
new with it if I got just that alone
this III would easily be one of my
favorites of all time unless of course
they do announce something and it just
looks like some kind of grotesque
monstrosity so that's my wish list for
e3 2016 let me know down in the comments
below what games you guys want to have
announced we're just a week away from e3

news to cover if you enjoyed this video
