switch but sometimes you don't want to
spend a bunch of money to play a game so
thankfully there are a lot of awesome
games in the switch library that are
super cheap and I want to go over 10 of
my favorite that are under 10 bucks to
start things off is blaster master 0 -
this is equal to blaster master 0 which
was a reimagining of an NES title that
is a very retro style side-scrolling
shooter but with a little bit of an
interesting kick and that you're not
playing is necessarily a traditional
character but instead a vehicle though
there are top-down segments of the
characters as well overall the gameplay
is great combat is fun
explosion feels rewarding and the game
has a pretty decent story to boot it
offers an awesome 16-bit era inspired
graphical style and one of things I
loved about the original blaster master
0 is that there was a lot of DLC
supporting side characters from other
video games that made awesome cameos we
don't have that just yet 4:02 but i
wouldn't be surprised to see that pop up
over time and plus if you haven't played
the original
that's also super cheap play both
they're great this next game is one of
my absolute favorite mobile games that
has ever been made and it has a great
home on the switch as well and that is
rain's Game of Thrones edition now yes
season 8 of Game of Thrones may not have
gone exactly how I would have liked but
that doesn't kill the hype for how fun
this game is it's a very simple
straightforward plan where you're making
different decisions by swiping left or
right you can play as an over a
different characters from the franchise
depending on which character you're
playing as different choices present
themselves some circumstances play out a
little differently and the whole point
is to get as far as you can making the
right decision possible to keep
everything nice and balanced before
something goes wrong and you have a
revolt that ends in your death make no
mistake you are definitely going to die
a lot playing this game but as you keep
going through different playthroughs
successive over and over again new
different things will start to emerge
new mechanics open up and more
characters are unlocked to play as
giving it a lot of replay value third up
is one of the oldest games on this list
and in fact was one of the first really
cheap sleeper hits you could grab on the
switch and that's Kimiko basically the
whole goal of chemical is imagine
playing a top down almost Delta style
game but on a very short time limit or
eve to rush through levels as quickly as
you can
it offers three different playable
characters all of which handle very
differently and offer really fun
experiences that while you're doing the
same levels
feels like a different kind of challenge
the art style makes you say very
pixelated also very colorful look that I
think gives it quite a bit of charm and
has an excellent soundtrack that
accompanies the frantic fast gameplay
with how fast-paced the game can be it's
a great choice if you want to play
something in short bursts but still have
that sense of accomplishment that you
actually beat a whole level of something
and with the three different characters
playing so differently it's well worth
three full playthroughs now I'm gonna be
honest with you guys not every single
game on this list is actually under $10
there's a single game we are about to
talk about that is over $10 by a
whopping hole single dollar at 11 and
that is west of loathing west of
loathing is one of the most insanely
funny weird games I have ever played it
is a western style emphasis on style RPG
that is entirely made out of very basic
stick figure like drawings and is a very
strange very enjoyable experience there
is not a single aspect of this game that
takes itself seriously whether that's
the class system in it where you can
play such things as the cowpuncher or
the snake oil salesman who literally
hits enemies with snakes or just the
every single line of dialogue that is
all over the place it's a little
difficult to explain what exactly makes
this game so entrancing but honestly
just trust me it's 11 bucks give it a
shot you won't regret it that next step
is a game that's a bit of a weird sale
when just look at it visually you might
be wondering well how much fun can that
really be but honestly it's a ton flat
hero's really really simple game very
cheap to pick up basically you just
control these little squares you can do
it by yourself or in co-op with friends
and the main goal is to stay alive
inside this very small area you can
clean the walls jump around - through
the air there's a lot you have to do in
terms of learning all the different kind
of projectiles you need to dodge and
just memorize the right patterns to
survive this is a really simple game to
play and super affordable I think it's a
great pick up if you just want a game
that's gonna be an occasional time
killer you're not looking for anything
that's going to be a huge investment it
also makes a great fit for anything you
want to do very simple co-op with family
members where you don't want anything
that's gonna be too difficult again
visually you might think it's a little
too simple but trust me it grows on you
very quickly another game that
originally was at home on mobile but has
found its way to the switch and makes a
great fit is flood of light
this is a simple puzzle game which you
explore a seemingly desolate possibly
post-apocalyptic world manipulating
light posts in order to bring down the
water level and explore more more the
stages it is a beautiful looking game
awesome very just light soundtrack to
the background and the puzzles can get
much more difficult as you get farther
along if you're looking for the absolute
cheapest games on the switch if that can
be entertaining this is one of the best
the absolute cheapest game on this list
because it's completely free is Delta
rune chapter one now yes to be fair this
is technically a demo for a game that is
coming out who knows how many years from
now but it is so amazing that honestly
you should just try it now for those you
who don't know del sur une is a sequel /
prequel / who actually knows what it is
but it's kind of related to undertale
featuring a lot of the same characters
but it remixes the mechanics to making
it a party based RPG instead and it
works out beautifully
like with undertale it has a very unique
aesthetic along with an amazing
soundtrack and a storyline that
constantly walks the line of having some
really good heartfelt moments and
absolute utterly insane silly things
that are hilarious if you're a fan of
undertale and you haven't played this
yet what are you doing go do it now and
if you haven't played undertale honestly
check it out it's free-to-play tons of
fun and if you liked it really give
undertale a shot because they are great
games by the way if you're looking for
an affordable way to customize your
switch a great option our skins like the
Easter today's sponsor dbrand they make
a whole bunch of different skins that
are totally safe to use on the joy
collins the switch itself and the dock
with a lot of different options when my
personal favorite being the matte black
which looks awesome the joy cons check
out the link down below for more info
another classic option graft of the
switch is mighty gunvolt burst now this
is a game from inti creates who's
responsible for a lot of different -
platformer games have been on the 3ds
and the switch they made the Mega Man
Zero games back in the day they also
ain't blaster master zero which we've
already talked about but mighty gun
vault first is their approach to making
an old-school Mega Man style game and it
is awesome the game is a crossover
between their own Megaman like series as
your striker gunvolt and the less
successful mighty number 9 and puts them
together into an 8-bit style Mega Man
game that is honestly the better version
of what mighty number 9 should have
pinned it relies on the same run and gun
mechanics that are popular to the
franchise but where it mixes things up
it is a heavier emphasis on speed
rewarding you for killing enemies
quickly and getting through stages as
fast as possible the game also offers a
very large number of different character
to play from some as part of the game
initially others are deal so you need to
grab but each one plays differently in
its own interesting way that allows you
to play the game multiple times it's a
cheap pickup and a great choice for
anyone that needs their Megaman fix this
next game is my absolute favorite one on
this list I cannot recommend this game
hard enough and that is blood-stained
curse of the moon now that name sounds
familiar the more recently released
blood-stained rush light was a huge
successful Kickstarter the game finally
came out it's been getting great reviews
and the whole point of the game is that
it's kind of recapturing the style of
later Castlevania games like Symphony of
the Night curse of the moon is a side
game there released as kind of part of
it it came out much earlier it's made by
NT creates and entire bases instead to
try and be like an old-school NES style
Castlevania game and it does its job
perfectly the game has fantastic level
design great music awesome visuals and
some of the best boss fights I have done
in this style of game and features four
different playable characters they can
all switch between them all handle very
differently this is also the best level
entered old-school games that's out
there if you love old-school Castlevania
you owe it to yourself to play this and
even if you don't just play it it's
amazing do it genre that I think has
really found its renewed energy thanks
to the switch is platformers there's no
shortage of different platforming games
you can grab that of all kinds of
different weird unique mechanics and
visual styles to separate them and one
that is very cheap and awesome to pick
up is Hugh the basic idea behind Hugh is
that as you progress through the game
you will unlock different colors that
you can make the entire world reflect
and depending on what color you
currently have the world showing
different objects are interactable in
different ways you can shove crates
around you can land on blocks that make
it safe not to land on spikes and you
can change colors oft in order to even
pass through objects that were
previously there it's very easy to begin
with but as you get further and further
unlock more colors to mess with the
puzzles get much more intricate and
really interesting not to mention the
use of very bright saturated colors
makes for a beautiful looking game if
you're looking for another great
platformer that's not going to break the
bank at 10 bucks this is a good choice</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
