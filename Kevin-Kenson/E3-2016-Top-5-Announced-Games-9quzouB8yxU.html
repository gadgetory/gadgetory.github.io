announced and despite the fact that a
lot of them were leaked ahead of time it
didn't really stop the fact that a lot
of hype has been built up so I want to
talk about the five new games announced
that I am currently the most excited for
first up is Resident Evil 7 now growing
up I was a huge fan of the rez Newell
franchise it was easily my favorite
horror game series out there and as the
years went by they slowly kind of
started to drift away from that and turn
into more of just an action series 5 &amp;amp; 6
in particular weren't necessarily bad
games they just didn't have any of the
horror roots that the game series
started with and it looks like the seven
were finally getting back to that along
with a definitely creepy trailer a demo
has already been released for the game
that Capcom has said they're going to
add more mechanics to that we're gonna
see actual combat we're gonna see a few
more familiar things from past games but
the first-person view is something
that's being kept in the final game
along with the dark gritty creepy
feeling which I cannot wait for if done
right this could be one of the best
comebacks in gaming history and one that
I am definitely welcoming second up is
we happy few now technically this game
wasn't announced at this year's e3 it
was actually revealed a year ago as part
of a Kickstarter project but this is
really the first time that a lot of eyes
are on this game and it was easily the
most engaging trailer at Microsoft's
press conference the trailer introduced
us the sort of 60s era style dystopian
world where everyone's on drug induced
happiness and your character is the
person who's starting to come down from
that and realizing just how dark and
twisted the world actually is which is a
premise I absolutely love and offstage
after the main press events we did get
more in-depth looks of this game which
is this interesting mixture of survival
action and really basic RPG mechanics
with social stealth you're doing
everything you can to escape this island
where you're having to find food to
survive taking drugs on occasion or
wearing different clothes to fit in with
everyone else and even having to fight
your way through sometimes looking at
the gameplay it's not the most polished
thing just yet but it is still in
development and the basic concept alone
makes this one of the most interesting
new ideas I think that we saw at e3 this
year for number three is god of war
for now to be perfectly honest the God
of War series is always a hype train
that's kind of missed me I've enjoyed
them I've had fun playing them but I
never really just jumped on to the full
excitement for them before it always
felt like sort of a watered down branch
off of Devil May Cry to me but the
trailer and gameplay we saw four four
completely changed my mind about this
next one first off I am all for the
movement to Norse mythology it is one of
my favorite historical Pantheon's and I
cannot wait to see how they breathe to
life a lot of the myths and legends from
it and second off and more importantly
is how severe of a facelift this game's
combat went under you could definitely
tell from the older god of war games
that they were very heavily influenced
by major action adventure games of their
time like I said earlier Devil May Cry
being a big influence whereas this one
seemed to be kind of rebooting the
series for more modern games and is
taking much more heavy cues from the
Dark Souls series where combat in
general is much slower paced it's more
methodical there's still definitely that
element of speed and anger at times in
it but overall the pacing compared to
the older war games is definitely toned
down a bunch this was definitely one of
the best executed trailers and demos at
this year's e3 and I think it did a
great job of bridging a gap between
people who loved the old god of war and
want to come back for more violence but
also drawing in new people that weren't
necessarily into the gameplay style of
the older ones moving on to number four
we've got another fourth entry in a game
series and that's Dead Rising for now I
am one of those people who has had
complete and total burnout from zombie
games we have had a way way too many
than released over the last five or six
years and I just wasn't that big of a
fan of them in the first place to really
keep on with how many have come out but
the one series that has been an
exception for me for this is Dead Rising
because the amount of silliness and
ridiculousness that this game has makes
it completely worth it if anything the
zombies are more of a backdrop excuse
for just all the silly stupid shit you
can do and this is one of the things
that worried people when Dead Rising 3
was announced because the initial demo
and trailer for that looked oddly
serious compared to the rest and it
didn't turn out that way thankfully but
it did have a few people scared and I
think this is something that Capcom and
Microsoft both picked up on and made the
trailer for this one completely
ridiculous focusing on this holiday
theme where you're blowing up zombies
with rocket-propelled candy canes we're
seeing the return of the
character of the original game frank
west who is by the way the best main
character in series so far so it's just
shaping up to be this incredibly silly
fun adventure where you just take
everything you find put it together put
some holiday wrapping over it and run
over zombies with it all things I am
poor well we had plenty of other games
announced and shown off of this year's
e3 promising serious tone dark gritty
worlds it's great to see that we're
still getting a few games here and there
that focus on just silly dumb fun and
that's all I'm looking for
when Dead Rising 4 gets released now
saving best for last there is obviously
one game that has to be talked about
that was announced at this year's e3 and
that's the new game coming from Hideo
Kojima death stranding now it's kind of
a bizarre thing to talk about how much
hype is building for this game and how
excited people are because we really
know next to nothing about it aside from
a very interesting and engaging trailer
that we saw and the fact that it's
coming from Kojima and normally that
little info on its own shouldn't be
enough to get people excited for because
we really know nothing about the game
and yet that alone is all a lot of
people really need there's a side of me
that's very calm and rational thinking
well you know we really don't know that
much about this game we should just kind
of hold off wait till we get more
gameplay don't get excited about it yet
you want to avoid hype that's never a
great idea but at the same time there's
this fanboy in me that's loved pretty
much everything released by Kojima that
just expects this to be the next great
thing especially now that he's working
with his own team straight up and no
longer under Konami I'm gonna save any
kind of crazed speculation about what
kind of game this could be for later but
needless to say this is one of those
games that I think a ton of people are
just chomping at the bit for more info
on and it's gonna be quite a while
before we get that info or any kind of
hard release date so those are the five
games I was most excited about there
were a whole lot more announced at this
year's e3 that are worth talking about
like injustice to quake pray and more so
let me know down in the comments what
games you guys are the most hyped for
that we saw at this year's e3 as always
guys thank you so much for watching and
I will see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
