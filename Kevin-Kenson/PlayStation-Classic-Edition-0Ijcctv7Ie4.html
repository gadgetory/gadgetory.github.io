mobile what is your favorite retro
console of all time and if so would you
have it released again into a micro
version with pre-loaded games so growing
up I was really really really into rpgs
I'm stone into RPGs my favourite genre
and the two systems that really shaped
that for the Super Nintendo which we
already have a micro mini system classic
edition of although it is missing a few
really important games from that genre
like Chrono Trigger but the other system
that I would lose my mind for some kind
of collection would be the ps1 there are
so many amazing games on the ps1 that
really shaped my tastes and games today
and actually have a collection that's
just everywhere on one system it has
like all the best refugees from that era
would be incredible I mean a lot of
those games are available still kind of
digitally through the PS Vita the ps3 a
couple of them are on the ps4 and
they've done some like digital releases
on PC but to have like an actual console
that celebrated that whole genre and
with the ps1 contributed to it I've
would buy it in RP Sony no Bologna I
think if somebody got invested in the
idea of doing retro consoles as well
there's some really cool interesting
ideas they could approach with it
especially for the ps1 I mean obviously
this is the original design right here
but something I think it'd be really
cool is if they actually based it off
the slimmer version which had the
attachable screen because then you could
have a retro system that has its own
built-in monitor for playing the games
but still offer the option to an HDMI
out to your TV for a more full
experience and upscaling everything
which would be super cool I know it
sounds a little crazy to be like hey
make this classic system just focused on
this one genre but that's how large the
JRPG library is on the ps1 and how many
great games are on there I mean Square
Enix alone has how many Final Fantasies
with seven eight-nine tactics all the
releases of the NES and SNES games
Chrono Cross and then even more
third-party companies with Legends
Dragoon legend amana breath fire three
four there's just so many amazing games
that could cram onto one little mini
system I would love it
do you like Mortal Kombat or any
fighting games in general yes I know it
just spent forever ranting about RPGs
but fighting games are like a close
second third John rrah for games that I
love I'm terrible at them
oh I don't think as much time climbing
does that like because I'm just
basically good enough to beat my friends
I like Mortal Kombat but mostly because
of how good nether realm is at making
single-player content for fighting games
as far as an actual fighter they spend a
lot of time while fighting in I grew up
loving Street Fighter I spend a lot of
time in Street Fighter 4 I've dropped
off a little bit in 5 and lately I've
been really playing more Tekken 7 I am
super excited for Soul Calibur 6 I
really want that to probably be the one
I actually try to like get kind of good
at even though I know it's not the
biggest fighting game out there and then
obviously as its own category Smash
Brothers is just always tons of fun
what new releases are you looking
forward to for each console well let's
get a really easy one out of the way
switch Super Smash Brothers just done
for PlayStation as far as system
exclusive ones go I know the really
popular answer that I should probably
give here a spider-man and that is true
I am really excited for spider-man
that's one of games I'm most
anticipating this year but like I said
it's about this video I'm a really big G
RPG nerd so I'm really excited actually
for Dragon Quest 11 which is finally
coming to the US and I just another
couple weeks actually so really have on
that as for Xbox definitely the new aura
game I loved the first one I think they
are just artistically beautiful I'm
always a big sucker for any kind of 2d
platforming especially Metroidvania
style games so yeah that's just those
three for sure what's your favorite
Mario character so growing up a little
brother my favorite character is
definitely Luigi Mario despite the fact
that Nintendo seems to love treating him
as a punching bag these days
cut - Luigi dying again best phone games
right now well this is a perfect setup
for today's sponsor pub G Mobile is the
official iOS and Android version of
player unknowns battlegrounds a
free-to-play battle royale that pits a
hundred players against each other on
one of two gigantic Maps roll all have
to start off with scratch and work hard
to scavenge all the weapons and supplies
they need to win you can play in teams
of four or if you're like me you can go
into solo matches so you don't have any
teammates to disappoint the mobile
version offers the same feel as pub G
while having a lot of updates and
changes to make it fit perfectly on
mobile including intuitive and easy to
customize controls realistic graphics
and
variety of game modes including the much
faster paced arcade modes where quick
matches can take as little as eight
minutes making it perfect to play on the
go and once again it is totally free to
play so you've got nothing to lose
giving it a shot make sure to check out
the link down below in the description
to download and try it out for yourself
what is your opinion on the spider-man
ps4 Pro special edition console so
obviously I don't have my hands on the
system yet I do have it Pia dirt and I'm
excited to unbox it and check it out in
person but as far as just things you've
seen screenshots and all kind of stuff I
am really excited for it I've always
kind of had slightly mixed opinions on a
lot of the PlayStation special editions
it's not necessarily I think they don't
look good I just think a lot of times
they could look better and this one
particular I think is probably one of
the best designs they've done especially
for being themed on a game or franchise
my only real complaint before seeing it
in person is I wish they added just a
little bit of blue to the system I get
the focus is red with the white spider
symbol in the center I think that looks
great but just having a little bit of
blue trim somewhere to really evoke the
full look of the suit I think would have
done wonders for it but we'll see what I
think one's actually unbox it who would
you like in Super Smash Brothers
ultimate part 3 and the ongoing need
narrowing down which characters I want
to see added in this game and it's
getting really difficult to do now
because I feel like all the characters
have talked about the last couple times
have now been officially confirmed or
kind of D confirmed because you know
Simon Richter Belmont are now both
playable characters I really want to see
shovel Knight which we now have as an
assist there are so many more I would
like to see and I think there's still a
lot of probabilities for some of them
because I think Nintendo is really
embracing this idea of the EKKO fighters
where they're just adding a ton of
characters as just easy kind of
copy/paste of other characters with like
changes while it's very unlikely I would
love to see proto man as an echo fighter
of Megaman I think an interesting one
although this kind of weird would be to
do big boss for Solid Snake and then one
character that I would still love to see
I've mentioned this one before but I
just I'm still holding out to hope is
jino I know there's a lot of people also
really claiming it for Goku and there's
actually a lot of good arguments for why
he could kind of fit in the cast but
honestly I don't really see that one
happening even though it would be really
cool best announcement of Gamescom so
games come this year's actually felt a
little light to me at least as of
filming this video because it still
technically going on but it's mostly
gonna release take confirmations and a
little more in phone games we already
had announced back at e3 or even Allura
earlier which I am excited to see more
stuff on those games I mean Delma krycek
ero new info and all its stuff sounds
great as far as like a new announcement
goes that got me really excited I know
this isn't like the biggest thing for a
lot of people and I actually freaked out
a little bit about it supermassive games
working on a new series which is kind of
based on what they did with until dawn
or it's an interactive horror game kind
of design where you're directing your
own movie but it's an anthology style
with several shorter stories and smaller
games which i think is a really cool
idea I've never been a huge horror fan
movie wise but I've always loved horror
games and I really liked untilled on so
getting more stuff like that is just
great news and don't forget to check out
