- Super Smash Brothers
Ultimate is on its way
and will be here very soon.
And one of the big
accessories we're seeing a lot
of companies release to tie
into it are their own takes
on GameCube style controllers
and one of those companies,
Power A, was awesome enough to
send me their versions early
to check out.
So, I've got both their wired,
there's no cable plugged in right now.
And their wireless versions to try out,
so I'm gonna compare these
to the official Nintendo
GameCube controller that's
already bene released
as well as comparing the
wireless one specifically
to using a wireless Switch Pro controller.
Now, before we dive
into direct comparisons,
let's just talk about what you're getting
with this controller in general.
So, this is a GameCube style controller,
not a GameCube controller.
As in, whereas the Nintendo
GameCube controller
is just an old-school controller
with the actual cable,
this is designed to work
for the Switch directly.
The wired one comes with the
USB hook up, the wireless
is just a Blue Tooth connection
that will go to the Switch
with no problems.
Now, because this is
actually a Switch controller,
there are some changes
and modifications versus
how GameCube controllers
are normally shaped.
For instance, you have two
shoulder buttons instead
of the single Z button.
And they are technically flipped.
These are considered Zr and Zl,
these are considered R and L.
This makes sense when
compared to a pro controller
on the Switch, but versus
a GameCube controller,
this is a flipped orientation.
Aside from that, the
only major visual change
is that because this
is a Switch controller,
you're also getting more
buttons in the center.
A regular Game Cube one just
has the single &quot;start&quot; button
in the middle.
This one, you've got the
&quot;home&quot;, &quot;capture&quot;, &quot;plus&quot;
and &quot;minus&quot; buttons and the
D pad has also been increased
in size, because one of
the really big complaints
that's happened in the past
with GameCube controllers
is the D pad on the guy
is just way too tiny.
So, obvious differences aside,
how does it actually handle
in comparison to using a
standard GameCube controller?
So, when we're comparing these
to the official GameCube
controller, I'm gonna mainly focus
on the wired Power A controller.
For the wireless one,
basically everything about it
still applies, the only major difference
is that it's wireless
and costs more money.
Now, aside from the obvious
details like the fact
that this has extra
buttons and everything,
the main thing we really
need to talk about
for how it compares to
a GameCube controller
is just how the buttons and
everything feels in reactive.
Now, obviously Smash isn't out yet,
so I can't test these on Super
Smash Brothers specifically,
but I have been playing a
bunch of the Smash clones
that are available on the
Switch, like Brawlhalla
and Brawl Out.
And the main things I've really noticed
when using the Power A
controller is that everything
is just a little bit looser.
The sticks in the Power A
controller just move around
with a little less resistance.
The triggers don't give
you quite as much push back
as well when you're pressing down.
And there is a little less travel distance
on these too, so it is
easier to kinda rapidly tap.
The front buttons, on the other hand,
actually have a little
more travel distance.
On the regular GameCube controller,
it's really just a button
that goes down immediately.
These, you have to press
down and go a little further.
It's a softer push, it's
not quite as clicky feeling.
I will say that the front-facing buttons,
however, do feel basically the same.
They might just have a
little less resistance,
but as far as being able to rapidly tap
or just comfort of
pressing, it feels the same.
And honestly, that's not too
far off from everything else.
When you're actually playing games,
while you can remark on things
like, &quot;Yeah, the stick's
a little looser, these
travel a little differently.&quot;
Ultimately, they still
control it really well.
The only one that maybe
feels like a slight downgrade
is these front buttons, because
of that just little extra
travel distance you have to deal with.
To balance it out, though, I
do really like the increased
size of the D pad.
I was never a big fan of the D pad
on the original GameCube controller
and having that larger size
just makes it a lot easier
to push each individual button,
which isn't super important
in Smash specifically,
but if you're ever using
this for any other games,
that's a big upside.
Something else we need to
talk about too a little bit
is that while these are
both wired controllers,
there's a couple differences
that are pretty important
on this one, because it
is a Switch controller,
not an official GameCube controller.
For instance, the fact that
this cable is detachable.
I don't even have it on right now,
whereas Nintendo's GameCube controller,
it's hard-wired in.
I understand why.
It's basically just a reprint
of the official GameCube
controller they made in the past.
But at the same time, having
the ability to remove it
is really handy.
On top of that, since this is
actually a Switch controller
and plugs in via USB, you
can connect it directly
to your Switch instead of having
to buy a separate adapter.
So, if you already own
GameCube controllers
and you just wanna get additional ones,
this is a great pick up,
because you're already using
an adapter in the first place.
But otherwise, if you're just looking
to get one to start using
with Smash specifically
and you're not worried about multiplayer
or number of USB ports available,
this is a way cheaper pick up.
One other thing to talk about too
is the length of the cables
do vary a little bit.
If you're using an old-school,
original GameCube controller,
those, in the west at least,
only came in two-meter lengths,
which is basically a little over six feet.
The reprints you can grab
right now from Nintendo
do come with a three-meter cable,
which is about 9.8 feet,
while the Power A controller
comes with a 10-foot cable.
So, it reaches a little
more than the brand-new
GameCube controllers, but
if you're comparing this
to an actual old-school
one, it's a lot longer.
When looking at the wireless option
for their GameCube controller,
a really interesting idea
is the fact that this is
just a Switch controller,
so it's not only a competitor
to the GameCube controller
for Nintendo, but it's
also just another option
you could have instead of
the Switch pro controller,
so let's go over some of
the major differences here
and how that works.
Now, this is very similar
to Power A's other wireless
controller options for the Switch,
the enhanced wireless controller
and then it shares some
of the same trade offs.
It uses AA batteries instead
of a rechargeable battery.
It is a wireless connection
and does feature motion controls,
but is missing a couple
of the core features
of the Nintendo Pro
controller, such as being able
to scan Amiibos and Rumble,
which is in my opinion,
the biggest loss.
What I really love about
this controller, though,
is that unlike Power A's
enhanced wireless controller,
which is just a cheaper alternative
to the Switch Pro
controller and features many
of the same layout and control style,
this is a GameCube style
controller that you can use
across the entire Switch library,
which I find amazing,
because I love the
GameCube style controller.
I love the ABXY layout,
so being able to use that
on Switch games is super cool.
Keep in mind that, because
this is a very distinct layout,
it doesn't work across
all games super easily.
You really have to play
games where the A button
comes up really often.
For instance, I think
something like Mario Kart,
this works great for.
But depending on how you have
to hit certain button combinations,
this can either be a massive upgrade
over using a standard Switch controller
or it could be a really awkward decision.
I think this is a great other controller
to have on hand if you already
own a Switch Pro controller
or if Smash is your main focus, this thing
in my head is just an instant buy.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
