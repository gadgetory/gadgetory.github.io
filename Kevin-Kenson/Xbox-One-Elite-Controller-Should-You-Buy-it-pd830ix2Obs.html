planning on grabbing one this holiday
season and you're hearing all kinds of
stuff about this new elite controller
it's selling out everywhere it does all
kinds of special the regular
controller doesn't do it slices it dices
but you still question yourself whether
or not it's really worth paying a
hundred and fifty bucks for a controller
and the answer is well maybe see the
fact matter is that this controller is a
whole lot better than the regular Xbox
one controller but all the different
special functions that ads aren't the
kind of things that every person who
buys one is going to be able to benefit
from so to begin with let's take a look
at what a hundred fifty dollars gets you
in the first place of course you're
getting the controller itself you're
also getting all the different little
modular pieces that you can switch
Internet which we'll get to in a second
it also comes with a braided cable that
you can use to connect to your Xbox one
or PC and you get a nice little carrying
case that can carry all of it all
together if you want to use it portably
now one of the obvious benefits of this
controller to anyone that just simply
picks one up is that it is clearly a
higher quality controller than the
standard Xbox one controller you can
tell right away that it's just made out
of better materials it's got better heft
the grips feel great the buttons are
snappier the sticks move nice and
smoothly it just feels like a better
experience right out the gate compared
to using a regular controller but of
course feeling alone is going to justify
spending an extra 90 dollars so the real
reason why this thing cost so much is
because the customization it offers
which comes in two different forms
physical augmentations and programmable
now as for the physical side it's got a
whole lot of little modular pieces that
I showed you earlier and there's really
four main things you can do you can
switch out one of three different sticks
including the standard concave design a
convex one and a taller stick you've
also got two different directional pads
to use one is the regular 4-way input
and the other is a new faceted design
that mimics an eight-way input which is
really useful for things like fighting
games where you have to do a lot of
rolling inputs like quarter circles on
the backside you also four different
back pedals that you can add or remove
which you can have four extra button
mapping options and the triggers are
adjustable so you can have them at full
stop or half stop one of the nicest
things about this controller is that all
the parts are attached via magnetic pull
and the amount of force it has is
near-perfect because it never feels like
you're going to accidentally rip them
off by playing too hard unless you're
doing some really silly crazy but
at the same time it's really easy to
pull off each part and put in a new one
now these physical customization options
are all well
good and do give you a good amount of
ways to customize the controller to your
liking but where it really shines is
when it's combined with the accessories
app which allows you to program a lot
more internal aspects of the controller
the app basically offers three main ways
you can adjust performance with a couple
little extras as well first off you can
do button remapping so if you want to
switch X and B you can do that if you
want to switch left and right sticks you
can do that so it gives you different
ways to map the controller to games you
like and in fact it comes with a lot of
different pre-designed custom profiles
that match different popular Xbox one
games like Gears of War halo Forza so on
so forth second off and the one that I
found most useful personally is the
stick sensitivity options you can
customize both the left and right stick
with one of four different choices you
can either have normal acceleration you
can do one that's slower across the
board faster across the board or an
instantaneous one where just moving the
stick slightly will make you move right
away but going full force will be just
the same as normal acceleration and last
but not least is the third customization
option of trigger sensitivity so like I
said before you can adjust the triggers
to be full or half stop you can also
change how much you need to pull the
trigger to get a certain degree of
performance out so if you want you can
have it a half stop and have half stop
be just the exact same thing as fully
pulling the trigger aside from these
options there are also the ability to do
things like adjust the rumble features
in all four sections of the controller
and for some reason you're also able to
adjust how powerful the backlight is on
the Xbox one symbol because that's
really important apparently now to top
all this off which is really nice is the
ability that you can actually have two
different active profiles at a time that
you can switch between on the fly using
a switch on the front side of the
controller so if you're playing a game
where two different levels of
sensitivity are really useful to have
for instance one wire on foot or one in
a vehicle what you can switch between
those sensitivities on the fly with
having to adjust any settings by just
flipping between one and two so all of
this customization put together both
physical and programmable leads to an
extremely customizable experience where
you can tailor your controller just the
way you like for every game you play
which is really awesome it's also worth
noting that the Xbox one elite
controller is not unique to the Xbox one
you can also use it with a PC by either
hardline connecting it or buying a
separate wireless dongle attachment
however if you want to make use of the
accessories app for full customization
you do need to be running Windows
ten so all in all 450 bucks this is a
really cool controller the problem
though is that all the different little
options it has to give you are really
only the kind of things that you can
benefit from if you already have a
certain degree of skill level this isn't
going to be the kind of controller where
you buy it and you're somehow instantly
better at playing Halo or Call of Duty
you have to already be pretty proficient
at the game to understand and really
make use of all the little options it
gives you as a result I can really only
recommend this controller for you if
you're a really competitive avid gamer
and want something that's going to give
you a little bit more extra of an edge
if you just play stuff more casually
you're really not going to see any huge
growth from buying this unless of course
you just want to burn 150 bucks to show
off to your friends that you got the new
special elite controller is it really
cool definitely is everyone who buys one
going to get the full hundred fifty
dollars out of it probably not so those
are my thoughts on the Xbox one elite
controller if you want to grab one I do
have it linked down below although they
are currently out of supplies you just
can't have to keep your eyes open for
when they show up again as always if you
