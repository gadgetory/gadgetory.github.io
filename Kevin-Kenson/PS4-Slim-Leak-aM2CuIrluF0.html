thanks to the leak and sale of the ps4
slim a redesign that Sony hasn't even
officially announced but to be honest we
all kind of saw coming sometime soon a
number of ps4 slims popped up on the
website Gumtree for auction people were
obviously skeptical at first but someone
bought it and it's looking like it's the
real deal while there's no hard news yet
on any major internal or performance
changes three design pretty clearly
accomplishes its namesake being about as
wide as the current ps4 but a little
less deep and obviously thinner looks
wise personally I'm a little mixed on
this one I like that the system has
embraced an all matte finish but I'm not
really a fan of the rounded corners or
the segmented look now being an even the
front facing USBs are spaced a lot more
and the power button has been moved to
inside the recessed bit rather than
being on the front and if you look at
pictures of the back you can see that
this slim version drops the optical
audio port to trim things down it also
looks like the slim is shipping out with
a redesigned DualShock 4 controller the
big difference being there's a little
window so you can see the controller's
power bar color from the front also
according to the guy that purchased the
system the new dual clock does use the
same battery as the original but that
doesn't mean it won't necessarily last
longer as it could potentially be more
efficient now sony has yet to comment on
this leak and they're probably not going
to we're instead going to have to wait
for September 7th where we'll be
revealed at PlayStation experience
alongside the much anticipated
PlayStation neo which as a result also
means probably no one's going to buy the
slim</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
