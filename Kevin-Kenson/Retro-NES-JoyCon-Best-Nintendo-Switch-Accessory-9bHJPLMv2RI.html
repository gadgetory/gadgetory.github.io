guys might remember that before I did a
video on a ps4 Pro that was painted in
the style of retro ps1 colors well now
there are also joy Kahn's done in the
style of the original NES now I actually
haven't opened or look at these yet I
know the basic idea but beyond that I
don't know what they look like so let's
open up and check them out so let's get
this one first so this is the right yeah
right joy gone no left droidcon I'm
terrible with directions maybe I should
take that I know the frames better than
you do Kevin oh this is cool right here
torso right away
so obviously the droidcon doesn't have a
d-pad it just has the four buttons so
they outline it to actually give the
actual detent language I think the NES
controller had that too just a little
white outline to it it's black here they
got the select button so next let's
check out the right one oh okay so
already I really like this one because
they actually redid the buttons on it so
the original one had red buttons like
this but these are actually the redone
to being gloss and then the lettering is
obviously put on the outside they even
did a little square box around each
button too except now it's like a
diamond pattern because there's four of
them
these are definitely also old-school NES
colors you know looking at these is
actually really interesting to think
about wise and Tendo controllers look
the way they did because if you ever
seen actual Famicom controller they are
nothing like other than button placement
the reason for this can be attributed to
the games crash of 1983 basically a
flood of really bad games made consumers
not want to buy game consoles anymore
and those retailers didn't want to carry
them but Nintendo wanted to sell the
Famicom in the US so the way they went
about it was trying really really hard
to make people believe it wasn't
actually a game system but something
else thus why it has such duller more
boring colors compared to the Famicom
was bright one their first attempt of
this is what they called the Nintendo
advanced video system where it wasn't
actually a game console it was a home
personal computer it was a full set up
including a keyboard mouse and actually
tried using wireless connection for
everything using infrared now this is an
idea that intrigued a lot of people but
not enough for anyone actually willing
to buy it
so instead Nintendo had to try again
with what we now know as the Nintendo
Entertainment System with you
the one to witness the birth of the
incredible Nintendo Entertainment System
the goal here was to embrace that it is
still a fun thing there are games
involved but it's not a game console
it's a toy that's why a lot of
old-school advertisements and even the
boxes for it
use different terms like calling it a
control deck instead of game console or
game packs instead of game cartridges
and why there was a huge emphasis on
things like the zapper is it the famous
zapper Everett so much about the one and
only ray call me captain or rob the
robots to make it seem like a kid toy
instead of just a gaming system that's
even why it was bundled with a game like
duck hunt which was a more kind of
gimmicky game at not something more
traditional fast forwards now and that's
why these joy cons have this particular
color scheme going on so with all that
in mind let's actually take an up-close
comparison and look at these joy cons
with a classic style NES controller now
there's a couple things I already talked
about that you can see when they're
actually side by side we've got the red
gloss finish on the button a main black
look to the system but still getting a
great trim around it red lettering that
says what buttons are what on the
outside not on the button itself and the
little gray squares around the buttons
also like I said we don't have a d-pad
gear so instead they have the same d-pad
outlined that is on the actual school
controller now what's really cool about
this is that they did try recreating the
look of an NES controller I mean that's
why you have all black here but what I
think it'd be really cool is that they
also start selling a grip that's done to
actually capture this middle bit right
here where you get the gray bars I mean
obviously you're not going to have the
start like button there because it moved
up but be a really cool looking combo so
there you have it color Wars NES retro
style joy cons these are available right
now so if you want to check them out
I've linked down below in the
description and I will catch you guys
