there to help you get the most out of
your Nintendo switch but when you start
to tally up a full list of all the stuff
you want to grab at least for me
sometimes that total cost gets a little
high so it's important to beware what
options you have out to is that
sometimes aren't going to break the bank
so we're gonna take a look at ten
greatness m to switch accessories that
are under ten bucks each
taking things off let's talk about some
products to help protect your switch and
switch related accessories with this
anti scratch case for your switch now
this is a cosmetically protective case
this is not gonna be one that helps any
kind of major trauma if you drop the
switch in like that if you want a more
protective case like that it's gonna
cost you more money but at the under ten
bucks you could at least get a case like
this it's gonna help protect your switch
from any kind of cosmetic damage like
scratching light things that kind of
stuff and honestly this one actually
looks really nice it's still giving you
access to all the ports everything you
need kickstand still usable if your
kickstand doesn't suck like mine does
and I actually really like the way the
aluminum finish comes off on this one I
really like the color red so just look
at the joy columns on the front and the
back of the switch itself I think it
comes together really nicely next up is
a classic accessory we've talked a
couple times about and that's a hybrid
cover for your switch now there are a
lot of these out on the market you can
find a lot of them from bigger name
companies that are gonna cost you more
money like 15 20 maybe even as high as
25 and oftentimes the main benefits of
those are giving you is it looks
prettier there might be some kind of
design on it might be made out of a
nicer material but oftentimes those
aren't actually adding any real
additional protection with this guy for
ten bucks you're getting the same exact
kind of coverage and functionality you
have a way of setting up your switch for
tabletop mode that doesn't use the
kickstand which is always a plus in my
book it's gonna give a little protection
to the main switch body itself and it's
gonna help protect your screen wherever
you're on the go by just folding it over
like this now let's get a little whack
here out there because there are some
Nintendo switch games where you know
having a special kind of peripheral for
your droid con to fit into just makes it
a lot better especially with more motion
based ones and so why not get a pair of
tennis racquets look there's not a lot
to go in-depth on these guys it's a
tennis racket that your drill conf it's
into so when you're playing Mario Tennis
you're actually kind of playing tennis
although I find that I'm really bad a
real tennis I probably shouldn't think
that way point is these are fun awesome
little pick up to get for kids and if
you're big fan of Mario Tennis this is
just gonna give you a little more real
interactivity with it then we have this
silicon protective case for the switch
pro controller now the benefit of this
is kind of like what we had for the
aluminum case on the switch but it's
gonna help protect some cosmetic damage
but really the bigger benefit of a grip
like this for the controller is that
it's just going to make it a little more
comfortable and a lot more usable for
really long-term play because one of the
issues that can happen with controller
plastic is as you play longer longer
get a little sweaty and your grip isn't
quite as good as it could be so with a
silicone cover like this it's gonna make
sure you can play for a long period of
time with your pro controller and not
have any issues with comfort bundled
with this you're also gonna get some
thumb stick grips which are not the best
ones in the market I mean they're not
control freak by any means but
considering this whole bundle together
is $10 if you just want a little extra
traction with those sticks they get the
job done just fine next let's talk about
the storage options starting with a
carrying case for the switch now this is
probably one of the most popular
accessories out there there are so many
different carrying cases out there you
can choose from they give you a way to
not only transport the switch but
additional accessories joy cons and
oftentimes they feature some kind of
design and they can get up there in
price or you can just save as much money
possible and get the most basic option
out there this is under ten bucks and it
does all the simplest things you need it
to it has a place to hold the switch
down you give that little straps to keep
it in place
you have little slots to put your game
cards and then the usual little kind of
pouch area just to have any additional
cables maybe some joint cons and maybe
the AC adapter but then it kind of
stretches a little bit it's just gonna
do all the same basic stuff there are
definitely better case options out there
that are going to look better or give a
little more protection and strength but
if you're just looking to save money and
something's gonna do the basic function
this gets the job done now if you're not
looking for a way to carry your entire
switch you just wanna be able to carry a
couple games you have somewhere else you
store your switch there are a lot of
different game cartridges to get out
there now this one is a little limited
to compare to some options out there
only carry six games but it's not only
cheap but actually kind of cool it's a
Zelda design that features link on one
side is all the symbol on the other
and while carries six games the way it
does it is he hit this little button and
bam just a little slot to have six games
three on top three and bottom it's a
little annoying to close it's not like a
walk in place you just to close the door
on it but if you just want an easy way
to carry a small handful of games that
also looks pretty cool this is it
awesome choice now on the other hand if
you don't care about having something
that's gonna be pretty you just want the
most function for the lowest dollar
possible
another option for game card cases is
this little guy right here this is from
yes Oh Joe the same people that make
that portable projector dock for the
switch and this is as basic as it gets
you just opened it up right here folds
out and you can hold 11 switch cards
which kind of when you close together
almost act like teeth and just fill this
entire space right here it's a
pretty efficient way of carrying a large
number of games it's not the prettiest
it's not gonna be exactly something
that's you know stylistic but if you
just want to spend a little bit of money
to get a way to carry around a lot of
games this works great now this next
item is the cheapest on this list and
honestly kind of stretches our
definition a little bit about the best
items under $10 but I saw this and just
thought it was ridiculous enough that I
really want to talk about it it actually
does work better than I was originally
giving it credit for see these little
bands on the switch so these are Nyko
dock bands and the only thing they
really do is you put them on the side of
your switch and it adds just a little
extra space to the front and backs when
you're putting it in the dock you're
running less of a risk of actually
scratching your screen that's it I mean
they're really simple it actually slots
on pretty comfortably onto the switch
and it still leaves the gap so you can
still attached and removed joy comes as
you wish it's a very simple fix there
are a lot of other ones out there you
can get like dock sleeves and such but
those are gonna run more money for a
cheap option that's pretty low impact
it's actually kind of neat let's talk
about some accessories that you can use
with your joy con starting with these
silicone grip cases these are very
similar to the grip case we were talking
about for the pro controller earlier
where it adds that kind of material
that's just a lot better if you're
playing for a long period of time you
start sweating the hands a little bit
but for joy con specifically one of the
other upsides of these is it actually
changes the shape of the joint cut a
little bit to make it a lot more
comfortable so it actually adds a little
bit more of a palm grip that's a lot
better than just the flat shape of the
joi con plus the way these ones are
designed it leaves the opening for the
rail still available so you can use them
free like this or still attached to the
switch the only thing with these is that
it does take a little bit of work to
really kind of put them on properly and
line everything up to look pretty which
to be honest this still isn't the best
final execution but the idea there we
have a new entry in the ongoing saga of
all different kinds of joy con grips
that are out there and this one is a new
personal favorite so this is gonna add a
couple things down on all of them
usually come with you are getting a
wrist strap that you can use in order to
keep it so you feel secure to your arm I
don't always use these but in the case
of like kids that are playing these are
really nice to have on hand and actually
really like the way these shoulder
buttons worked on this so sometimes the
buttons that are designed here use kind
of a lever system and it doesn't always
feel well natural this is just a
straight a button that you press down on
and it hits the button down below
feels really nice and still gives it
seemed kind of almost click enos that
you get when you hit the button directly
