gaming set of video and for good reason
we've actually been renovating one of
our main studio areas and you've
probably seen some bits and pieces of it
but let's take a look at how our 2010
gaming set up is coming along
first off let's take a look at our
actual gaming setup so right here we've
got our three mains current systems
hooked up to our Samsung TV this is the
same one that we used during the
ultimate Xbox 1s setup and right now
we're using the project Scorpio Xbox one
X with the white ps4 pro that came with
destiny and then over here we actually
have a switch dock that's been skinned
to by D brand so it's making this really
cool little white systems on the outside
black system in the middle then it's a
cool little symmetrical look now on the
outside of it we have these speaker
setup and we want adorn them with
something so we ended going for some
head where we have our Mega Man helmet
which I love and you know I wear during
serious gaming moments and over here
we've got the psvr setup we do have a
stand that's a little more functional
but I really love the design we've got
off of Etsy where it actually has the
PlayStation symbols it just looks
awesome as a little display piece and
then we've got a little more going on
down below over here well we have all
the current system set up where they can
have you know some air to breathe here
we've got some older systems or at least
retro style systems that I'm not as
worried about overheating with the super
analogue NT which is gonna let me play
Super Nintendo games in HD I love this
thing and then just I have something
from the same kind of era the Sega
Genesis so moving on let's go check out
some of the more displaced if we have
set up here right now this next part
actually my personal favorite thing
we've been working on which is our
controller display wall that down the
line I might try to mix it up a little
bit but right now it's entirely focused
on Xbox one controllers because well
honestly I think Xbox one is some of the
best special edition looking design
controllers so I wanted to showcase some
of my favorite ones
and you might notice that one of these
looks a little bit different from the
others I'll let you guys figure out
which one doesn't exactly belong moving
on this area back here right now is kind
of just in progress we haven't done
anything yet
the chairs normally in front of the TV
but we didn't want camera to you know
trip and die over it and then the CRT I
want to do some kind of retro setup
built around this but we just haven't
figured out the best place to put it yet
so hopefully there's gonna be future
update where this guy isn't something
really cool now before moving on to
showing off what's going on on this
other wall real quick I know there's a
lot of really cool fancy stuff here and
it's a bit much so to kind of share all
the luck I've had we are gonna be doing
a giveaway on today's video so make sure
to check out the link down below to get
yourself a chance to win a switch now
with that in mind we're gonna move over
to our storage solution right now we
actually just had this recently
installed and this is where a lot of our
just stuff goes so it's not sitting out
and looks like a mess one of the kind of
cooler cabinets is this one right here
where all the special editions we have
that are in use are lined up so yeah
take that in a second because I love
this drawer I know not all of them
that's not how all of these are we have
a lot of other just like third party
controllers and stuff like that
well the ones a little cleaner looking
at our joint hunt stash over here where
we've got a bunch of different D brand
skin joy cons and all the different
official ones Nintendo's released we
actually to make a little charging
station because we started realizing
that whenever we want to try using
different droid cons they always end up
being dead so we try to keep them all
full charge wherever we can next let's
take a look what we have going up above
here this is one of the more
work-in-progress areas aside from retro
land and here we're planning to display
all the different bigger collectibles
that we have we've got a bunch of here
already one of most recent ones is that
gold Lancer over there I've got our
Hylian Shield the needler a few of our
favorite retro stuff like the vetrix
laser scope and the chainsaw from resume
before I love this little guy this is
one of the first kind of weirder
collectibles we picked up we want to add
more to this and I'm not entirely sure
what else we're gonna grab just yet so
if you guys have any ideas for cool
gaming stuff you want on display here
let us know down in the comments so
that's where the gaming set up upstairs
is at right now we're planning on doing
a lot more up here I'm gonna do more
videos as this all kind of comes
together but I think we're off to a
great start</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
