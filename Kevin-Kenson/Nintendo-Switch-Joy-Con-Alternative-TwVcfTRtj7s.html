Pro controllers for the Nintendo switch
and there are a lot of them out there
but something we haven't talked about
yet is third-party controller
alternatives for joy cards this is the
wireless retractable game controller
from I have no idea I pronounce this a
pitcher Ã©poca I I'm not sure but the
point is this is a retractable
controller kind of similar designed to
the game vice which was definitely
originally primarily meant for phones
and tablets but it's been redacted to
also work as a Bluetooth controller for
the switch now sending this guy up looks
pretty easy so let's go ahead and give
it a shot right now first before you
actually put the switch inside of the
controller vise thing you need to add
these little rubber stoppers to actually
make it fit comfortably without you know
messing up the sides of the switch so
you're supposed to just kind of lay them
in there yeah that's feels pretty good
and then like a lot of these other kind
of vise controllers all you got to do is
kind of just rest it in there and then
you should be able to just pull it and
there we go you can see like how the
rubbers kind of just filling that spot
it's kind of a cheap solution but it's a
really smart cheap solution that makes
sense it's just don't lose those please
okay so now that we've got this at least
set up physically let's go ahead and get
into a game and try to actually make it
run okay go to controller setup and then
on the controller I'm supposed to hit
and hold the home button for a while and
that'll put it into sinking mode oh wait
I got to put it in switch mode too so on
the side here there's the different
modes you can put this guy in and it's
not words it's just logos for all the
popular stuff so there's even a little
switch logo right here just kind of put
it to that okay let's try and then we
sit here and wait a while until
something happens oh there it is
okay actually works perfectly fine so
far that's kind of cool that wasn't that
difficult to set up something I am
noticing right away though is that on
the controls for this it's actually the
Xbox one configuration where the a and
the B and the X and the y are flipped
versus how they are on the switch and it
looks like the switch is actually
reading those buttons as what they say
they are so it's not the kind of thing
where B is now a and a is now B it's
actually just that
the positions are different but the
buttons are right so if you're really
used to not looking at the buttons and
just kind of feeling out like oh yeah
the bottom button does this top one does
this it won't work for this you need to
actually flip in your head what does
what the probably said I'm more
confusing than it meant to be I will say
to that while there certainly is like a
cheaper element to this thing in general
just the field of plastic and button
quality and everything the grip design
is definitely more comfortable than
using an actual switch I mean it's kind
of one of the big downsides it's using
the switch in handheld mode is that it's
definitely not designed to be
comfortable for most people because it
doesn't have any kind of grip shape it's
just a thin droidcon design which
doesn't work well over time this is a
lot more comfortable right out of the
gate which I do like I'm curious about
something too so let's see so we got it
synced up what happens I put the switch
to sleep is this guy gonna stay on it's
gonna stay connected okay so it turned
off and then can I use it to turn the
switch back on okay so I put the switch
to sleep and it looks like the
controller just completely shut off so I
can't turn the switch back on using it
let's okay let's turn this back on
manually and see if it at least like
resyncs right away nope I think I have
to manually sync this guy every single
time I turn the switch on which
depending on how you use your switch may
or may not be super annoying because at
least for me personally when I'm using
my switch and handheld mode I am
constantly putting it to sleep for just
little bits of time like every time I'm
taking a break from a game I don't even
use the game's pause screen I just put
it to sleep immediately something like
this where it disconnects every time you
do that you're gonna notice that you're
gonna realize how much you put your
switch to sleep because you have to deal
with this every time that wasn't too bad
though cuz at least games will auto
prompt you with the control screen
something else that I noticed and the
instructions do cover like how to handle
this this has almost just as many
buttons as a pair of joy' cons I mean
there's a couple things that are
replaced like you don't have a plus and
minus button video starting to select
that do the same thing but the one
button you're short on is you don't have
a button that would do screen capture
and the way they solve that on this is
the home button on it
pressing it really quickly to screen
capture holding it for like a split
second will do the actual home maneuver
but that's also weird because the switch
also has controls we're holding the home
button so you have to time it to where
you don't hold it super long or else
have like the overlay options come up
but you need to hold it longer than just
a simple press because otherwise just
gonna take a screen capture every time
you use it it's a little annoying I kind
of wish they just didn't support screen
capture at all and the home button
worked like a home button because at the
end of the day if there's any button you
can be missing on joy calms its screen
capture hi I need everything else about
this thing works pretty well so far in
practice I mean it's comfortable the
buttons aren't the best but it's getting
the job done just fine and I can doubly
see that as far as just the grip design
alone goes I could actually really play
this a lot longer than using joi cons
there's a lot of other benefits I get
from using joi cons but this is
definitely a lot more comfortable by the
way if you're wondering how we got our
hands on a white switch this is actually
a skin that was made by today's sponsor
D brand they made a whole bunch of swish
skins that don't damage your system they
can work on the switch itself on joi
cons and then you have dock designs as
well you can get them in a bunch
different colors or just a nice clean
crisp white which looks awesome make
sure to check out the link down below
you know after spending some time with
this thing I gotta say this is actually
a lot better than I first thought it was
going to be I mean it's still not a
great controller the sticks are very
loose the buttons aren't that great the
placement could be a little better but
there are some merits to this design
because one does certainly bulk up the
overall size and shape of the switch
this is a much more comfortable
controller than using the joi cons you
know I even switched back afterwards and
I have to say that while the joi cons
definitely add better buttons and
everything I immediately noticed the
difference in just how much more
uncomfortable those small controllers
are on the side because it's just such a
thin piece of plastic compared to the
sory of an actual proper grip this is a
lot more comfortable the fact that it
disconnects whenever you shut off the
switch is a little annoying but it's
actually not as big of a deal as I first
thought it was going to be because as
long as you don't have any other
controllers connected to the switch
every time you start it back up it's
going to prompt you to connect to
controller we're all you have to do is
once again sync this guy to it so it's a
little annoying but not nearly as bad as
you might think at first so yeah it's
actually a pretty good control overall I
don't think I would recommend it still
for anybody that wants to do any kind of
intense serious gaming is once again the
buttons and sticks everything or just
not
but it's such an improvement for comfort
that if you just want to be able to kind
of play some more laid-back games from
very long periods of time this is gonna
be much better on your hands and it
really considers provoking the thought
of what Nintendo could learn from this
there's been rumor before that Nintendo
is thought about doing other droidcon
designs aside from ones we already have
and if that's true this should be one of
the first things they attempt because
yeah the larger size impacts the
portability a little bit but that's why
it's alternative option not the one the
system comes with but having a larger
more comfortable controller and having
all the benefits of an actual first
party Nintendo design where you have the
better buttons and all the extra
functionalities and you know buttons
here that are flipped would just be
awesome it would make the portal blow
out of a switch even better</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
