ps3 in Japan which for all intents and
purposes basically means the system is
officially dead after having absolutely
dominated the sixth generation of
consoles with the PlayStation 2 so when
he was prepared to try and continue this
winning streak and they in veiled the
original ps3 now the one they showed
here isn't actually the one we got
released a year later this model was all
silver it had this extremely weird and
uncomfortable looking boomerang like
controller and featured a whopping six
USB ports two HDMI ports and three
Ethernet ports what we got instead or a
pair of models that were extremely
expensive for their time running at five
hundred and six hundred dollars that
puts the lower end model at a full
hundred bucks more than with the 360 was
asking for with their highest end now
both these systems had a lot of things
in common they both had four USB ports
both of them offered of complete
Hardware backwards compatibility with
ps2 but there were a few very important
key differences between them the more
expensive model offered a 60 gigabyte
hard drive built-in Wi-Fi a card reader
and had chrome trim while the cheaper
model only at a 20 gigabyte hard drive
lacked those additional features and was
completely all-black now if you take a
cursory glance to the history of the ps3
you might think there's only three
different models the original fat ones
the Slim's and the super Slim's but
really there's a lot more than that
because the original fat model had a lot
of different generations after the first
two that came out at launch a year later
they released another model that was
pretty close to being the same as the 60
gig except it offered an 80 gig hard
drive and removed the hardware backwards
compatibility in favor of software what
this means is basically it still plays
ps2 games but some select titles
wouldn't entirely work right and some of
which were completely unplayable a year
after this one they didn't even more
trim down system that only had two USB
ports ditched backwards compatibility
entirely and came out in a couple of
their hard drive sizes like 40 and 120
and eventually started shipping with the
new dual shock 3 controller which had a
vibration function now while this one
did trim down a lot of features in some
ways it was actually the best one
because it was much more power efficient
a lot quieter and didn't have nearly as
many model faults involving the yellow
light of death now the reason for all
these different models early on is
because the
early years of the ps3's lifecycle were
not very kind to it it had a lot of
issues first off it was very very
expensive compared to the other systems
at a time and it was a full year behind
them the 316 that we were both already
up for a year and were big successes for
different reasons the 360 was embracing
the online multiplayer community adding
things like achievements and gamer
profiles while the Wii was a huge hit
with families the ps3 didn't excel at
either of these things what it did have
going for it is there was actually the
most powerful system of its generation
being the only one to embrace blu-ray
and made use of a very powerful cell
processor which was actually also kind
of a downside because it presented a
challenge for third-party companies to
develop for it as a result the ps3 lost
a lot of third-party support oftentimes
games would come out late on the ps3
compared to the 360 and even when a game
was made multi-platform both systems
what often times run smoother on 360
despite the ps3 being the stronger
system on the flip side what do you
exclusive games the ps3 had were
absolutely stunningly beautiful with big
hits like Metal Gear Solid for the
original Uncharted resistance fall of
man and near the end of its lifecycle
the big fan cult hit Demon Souls the
precursor to Dark Souls now as you might
imagine after the wild success that was
the ps2 a lot of people built up a ton
of hype for whatever Sony was doing next
especially after already having a year
with their competition and what they got
for those first three years left a
really bad taste in a lot of people's
mouths and there was a ton of hate for
the ps3 early on and Sony really really
needed to rebrand their image hard which
they started to do in 2009 with the
release of the ps3 slim now this model
continued the downsizing that was seen
in the last original model it still only
had two USB ports no ps2 backwards
compatibility whatsoever and dropped
even more functions like supporting
Linux OS in exchange though the system
was much much more power efficient a lot
more quiet and with a slimmer lighter
much better-looking build in fact I
really think the slim model ps3 is by
far the best-looking one this alone was
a step in the right direction but would
really help change Sony's image was
alongside of this we also finally got to
see a lot of really awesome exclusive
games on the ps3 that made people want
to switch over including awesome sequels
to some of their biggest franchises like
God of War 3 and uncharted 2 as well as
brand-new ideas that were really
successful like infamous I didn't
mention spider-man font I could just do
a really quick it anything like not to
mention it thankfully got rid of the
spider-man font now near the end of its
lifecycle the ps3 did receive one more
model change and that was the super slim
internally this was pretty much the same
thing as the slim same power draw same
number of ports same benefits and
strengths the big change though was the
exterior it was a little smaller it was
much lighter and most importantly
noticeably cheaper
well the slim wasn't approached to try
and make the system the best it could be
but also trimmed down the super slim was
trying to trim down the system as much
as possible to make it as cheap as
possible to produce so people could buy
at any low price near the end of
lifecycle in preparation for the ps4 is
impending launch in 2013 now the way
they did this is the exterior is
noticeably kind of a cheaper plastic it
just doesn't look as good and instead of
having a self-loading Drive instead had
a sliding top with a top loading disk
which made it much cheaper to produce
during the end of this lifetime you
still saw a lot of good games come out
on the ps3 we got a ton of JRPGs just
flooding it at the last second we got
one of the best games on ps3 The Last of
Us and it was at this time that Sony
also discovered the glory that is HD
remasters all of this together led to
what was in all Asti an incredible
comeback for the system what went from
being one of the most reviled consoles
of its generation became a huge success
that equaled out with the 360 by the end
of its lifecycle both of them had
basically the same worldwide sales the
360 won in North America but the ps3
beat it out in Europe and in Japan
especially considering the fact that it
had a year left to do this it was pretty
awesome</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
