finally here and while you guys wait for
my full review I wanted to give you just
a quick little unboxing of the US
collector's edition this is the only
special edition of the game available in
the US and it is a full 40 bucks more
than standard game putting it at a
hundred bucks so without wasting any
time let's go ahead and rip off this
plastic bullshit and take a look at
what's in this box taking a quick look
at the back of the box shows us
everything in this collector's edition
most notably a statue steel case and a
bunch of in-game dlc it's worth noting
that actually none of the DLC is in this
box instead it was a separate code that
i got when i purchased this so after
taking a moment how to figure out
awkwardly how to open this box you can
see that it's a pretty straightforward
presentation we've got the replica of
big boss's new cybernetic red arm and
two different cases one is the game
itself and the other is a steelbook case
now the replica arm is a little
off-putting at first because it honestly
looks more like some kind of baby cyborg
on but you put you get over that and
it's still pretty cool until you realize
that also other countries for some
reason got a full scale one to one
replica which just kind of makes this
one to feel awkward in comparison you
know if all editions have the same size
I think it'd be fine but knowing that
other people have an actual normal
looking arm and we get the baby cyborg
it's just a little weird next up taking
a look at steelbook case which does have
one other item inside of it a
collector's edition bonus disc blu-ray
which includes interviews
behind-the-scenes content and a
collection of all the major trailers for
the phantom pain last but not least we
also have the regular case which not
only includes of course the game but
also a map that shows off the two major
areas you can explore and highlight some
of the major locations within them
overall I gotta say for 40 bucks more
it's a pretty solid collector's edition
not the best out there but far from the
worst and while it still is a bit
disappointing the hand replica we get is
only half size instead of a one-to-one
scale it's still pretty frickin cool
especially considering the fact
the hand is completely poseable honestly
the only real problem I have with this
collector's edition and I think a lot of
people have been having this problem too
when just buying the standard version of
the game is that we've all been getting
these weird defective cases but
thankfully it's actually pretty easy to
fix with just having some paper a pencil
or a printer and just a little bit of
tape they're perfect just the way it's
meant to be so that was just a quick
unboxing of the metal gear solid 5 of
the phantom pain us collector's edition
