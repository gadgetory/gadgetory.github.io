we are really early for my appointment
the place match because I'm I've been to
excited but uh yeah we're getting ready
to try it out
the nitendo booth is insane this year I
mean it is every year I thought it'd be
a little calmer sand smash a sign-up
only but it turns out Pokemon let's go
is playable and that has a line and that
line is nuts along with that they've got
fortnight and just a whole bunch of
other games they've announced recently
coming to switch finally so yeah it's
pretty crazy uh so we're getting ready
to do smash I don't entirely know what
to expect it I don't know it's gonna be
like the full version of the game that
they've kind of shown so far whether or
not we can play as all the characters
they announced today which are every one
and two more so exciting
I signed it for the non-competitive
because I want to be able to mess with
items and try some other stuff and you
see how the game feels overall so super
hype can't wait to play
so we just physically fashion we're kind
of hanging out behind the booth again
because it is way too loud and way too
many people just running everywhere in
front of it on the sides smash was
awesome I mean I had a ton of fun with
it I did for fun so there were items and
stuff which gave me chips can I try some
that's about I was able to do a few
matches and I did a combination of
trying one of my favorite old characters
Ike and then I missed with the two new
characters Ridley and inkling now
there's still a ton going on my heads
I'm gonna try and just unpack what I'm
remembering right now as far as like how
the overall game feels obviously there's
the changes they talked about in this
morning's conference a lot of new
shortcuts trees and certain moves one of
things I noticed though is that as far
as the speed if it goes it's very
similar to smash for Wii U and that it's
not quite the same speed and weight of
melee but it's not as floaty and slow as
brawl is it's maybe just a little
heavier than some of the characters
there were a few times where I really
thought someone's gonna go ringed out
but no they came back to the stage even
when they seemed like they should be
pretty light as far as things go for
characters I tried out Ike is very
similar there are some really specific
changes but since he's an old character
let's kind of just move past that for
now new people inkling was really fun I
didn't fully figure out all their
mechanics just yet when I was messing
with the game you have an ink system
where you need to shore it up and once
you run out all your moves are a lot
weaker as far as their move set goes I
think one of the coolest ones for me was
their forward be where they do the the
roller but if you hit an opponent with
it it plants him in the ground making
them vulnerable to other attacks which
was really handy and then Ridley Ridley
was tons of fun I loved how heavy was
but he still had some great mobility
especially in the air because I mean you
know he has wings and can fly a lot of
his moveset was fairly standard like he
had a dash attack he had his up B which
allowed him to kind of just do a
straight dash up or sideways or down the
coolest move by far though is his down V
where he does this stab attack with his
tail and it doesn't knock anyone back it
has zero knock back that in fact they
just stay in place but it does a ton of
damage and there's even like a cool
little like it zooms in slows down a
minute the moment you do it it was just
a super cool feeling you're able to land
it it was hard to land but totally worth
it when you did those were like the main
things I really focused on I mean
honestly I was having fun trying out new
characters and while I tried having a
list of things my head to look out for
while playing
I just ended up having too much fun
while playing really think about anymore
I just kind of went with it and yeah I'm
really looking forward to see the full
release of this I really like a lot of
the changes they've shown off and
announced I think one of my favorite is
that if you're still playing with smash
balls and citizen characters having
ridiculous moves for the guns like a
super move for a long period of time
everyone just has move where you get the
one chance to hit and if you miss that's
it done and done and keep skiing play
going a lot faster and I was definitely
something I saw a wall we were playing
so with the demo we only got to play
with about half the characters like I
said though both of the new people were
there so that was awesome I'm really
excited to see what the full roster is
gonna look like especially if we get
just a couple more new character
announcements after this and let's face
it kind of like well smash for you we're
gonna get some DLC announcements</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
