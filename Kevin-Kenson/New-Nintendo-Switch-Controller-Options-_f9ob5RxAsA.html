with accessory options and one of the
biggest is pro controllers now of course
Nintendo has their own wireless pro
controller for 70 bucks but there are a
lot of Cheaper third-party options that
have been popping up that are wired one
I've talked about before is the Hori pro
controller but it now has a competitor
in the form of a pro controller from
powera now how does this one stack up
against the Horine even against a
Nintendo's own wireless pro controller
let's find out now before we go into the
in-depth of how this controller handles
how the buttons feel and everything
let's talk about the obvious downsides
of it being an off-brand cheaper
controller option there's a lot of
functions present and the Nintendo pro
controller that is not in this one
you're not getting a rumble feature
which is a big thing that's missing you
don't have NFC reader which isn't that
huge of deal because you can just use
joique on and you don't have any motion
controls which for most games isn't
really a problem but if you like using
those for a few handfuls like Zelda
right here that's gonna be a big note
for you as well and then there is of
course the fact that it is a wired
controller however that is actually kind
of one of the upsides for this
controller at least compared to the Hori
while they are both wired controllers an
important difference between the two is
the fact that the Hori wired is a
hardwired controller you cannot remove
that cable which can be really annoying
the powering one on the other hand has a
removable microUSB cable so it's easy to
replace if anything happens to the cable
damage-wise you can just switch it out
and it makes it a lot easier to store
and carry around the controller rather
than having this big bulky thing with an
unremovable mass of wires and then the
other big upside to this controller
especially when you hold it up side by
side with the pro controller is that
it's very obviously actually very close
in design the Hori went for something
that was very differently shaped and for
the most part to its detriment
whereas this controller is very clearly
the same exact setup with button
placement and everything some of the
buttons are a little differently shaped
there's a few grooves here in there that
are a bit different but for the most
part this is pretty much the same
comfort level as this now as for how the
actual controller handles once you're
using it well that's where things get a
little more murky while the button
placement is pretty much the same as the
actual Nintendo pro controller when it
comes to actual button quality things
are definitely a drop off even compared
to the Hori one as well the main AVX
wise are very stiff feeling and not in a
way that's actually like beneficial the
stroller buttons on the most part very
similar to the switch controller which
is nice the biggest areas though where
I've hang
with this thing are the sticks in d-pad
the d-pad on this thing is just flat-out
awful it kind of feels like when you
press down in any one direction you're
just pressing the whole thing down
there's not really a good sense of
differentiating between up down left and
right and the sticks are very loose
feeling it doesn't feel very comfortable
or nice to use them it's entirely usable
but compared to using the pro controller
or even Joe icons or even just the Hori
controller which is other cheap
alternative it just doesn't feel like
that great of a controller to use and of
course this is a $30 wired controller so
you're not looking for the ultimate
experience but as I said the Hori for
the same price just feels a little more
comfortable as far as the buttons go one
other big upside this one does have
though is it comes in flashy designs now
this one right here is a Mario themed
one that's red you can see all this
little flower print with the fire
flowers leaves star right here they also
have another one that's more Zelda based
and that actually looks really cool with
kind of a black design gold trim here
and there great looking controllers just
not the greatest buttons in the world
you know ultimately if I'm gonna say
which pro controller you should grab
aside from obviously just the Nintendo
one you're looking to save some money
I'm still leaning towards the Hori this
does have some upsides in terms of the
gripping more comfortable I like the
removable cable but ultimately as far as
how actually button quality is going to
go and your experience while playing
games that's just going to be the better
option right now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
