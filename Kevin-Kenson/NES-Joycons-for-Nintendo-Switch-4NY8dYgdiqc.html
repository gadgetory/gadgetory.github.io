Entertainment System
earlier this year Nintendo launched
their online services force which
members and as part of that to include
the ability of players access to a
number of classic NES games at play in
one or two players elicits although
small but slowly growing and as part of
that Nintendo sold these limited NES
controllers for the switch when I see
eliminated I mean limited you can only
buy these from Nintendo's online store
and even then you must be subscribed
intend to switch online and on top of
that it's limit one per customer though
you do get them in a pair as you can see
right here and the idea here is exactly
what you would imagine it's an NES
controller that's designed to work for
the switch so at face value just looking
at the front this is straight up at NES
controller design and the only real
major differences are well first off
it's a little heavier because there's
actually wireless tech in here and
something a little more advanced than
old-school NES controller and the
biggest visual difference is what you
can see on the top where it actually has
the joi comp style railing so you can
slot this on the side of the switch so
the only reason you would ever need to
is to either sync it or to charge it but
it does also give you access to an Ellen
R button which add a little extra
functionality that you need in order to
get the most out of using it with your
system now with the approach of making
these super limited it seems like a
Nintendo's leaning much more towards
treating these as kind of collector's
items rather than actual functional
controllers that you just walked down to
a store and buy and that makes sense for
a lot of reasons I mean it is a cool
functional joy comp but it's not exactly
fully functional in normal sense for
instance you are missing a very large
number of buttons you don't have a home
one a screen capture you don't have X or
Y you're missing basically everything
you would need to play anything outside
of the simplest of NES retro games which
is how Nintendo very heavily marketed
but there's actually a couple little
surprises about it that you wouldn't
expect the biggest being the fact that
while Nintendo does say hey this is
really only meant for NES games which is
partially true because once again not a
lot of buttons you actually can use this
other switch games it's not necessarily
a good idea because you're missing a lot
of stuff but there are a small handful
of retro style games that only need two
or three buttons one of them being a
shoulder that you can use this on for
instance actually tried this out on
towerfall and it is everything you need
a shoulder button for dashing a jump
button attack button and actually found
it to be more comfortable than using a
single joique on sideways because while
retro controllers aren't exactly the
most comfortable designs out there it's
still bigger and better than using a
tiny little joke on squished up like
this now once again this isn't really
designed for that and while you can play
the game using it the lack of a home
button means that if you want to
actually exit and switch to another game
or do anything beyond actively playing
it you need to pick up another
controller so it's not really a
functional choice if you want to play
anything outside of NES games but
thankfully Nintendo did address the
issues of lack of buttons in that app
specifically when using this for the app
it's actually intended for the NES
system on the switch it actually remaps
some of the buttons to where you're able
to use it still as a fully functional
joy conference since the LNR buttons
will now act as a screen capture and a
home button and hitting them
simultaneously will work the same as
using the ZL and Zr buttons on normal
joi cons which allows you to access
things like saving or loading different
save states or of course going back to
the game selection menu which is you
know kind of important one interesting
little addition to that I don't think
didn't - no actually officially
announced anywhere is the fact that when
you're using this controller with the
NES app it actually changes the sound
effects as well to match up with an
old-school Nintendo system as opposed to
the more kind of updated switch sound
effects
simply put this is awesome it's
definitely a collector's item as
Nintendo's kind of marketing it and how
they're limiting all the quantities I
don't think it's anything people need to
rush out and buy right away because they
just want to have an NES tile controller
but if you're a collector and you enjoy
the concept of playing the retro games
on your switch this is a great idea and
I think it's a step in the right
direction because the Wayne intent has
been treating the emulation on the
switch so far it could be better and
this is I think one of the first ideas
that really starts to click and show
better attention to that back when they
first launched the emulator in the
switch one of my big complaints to the
fact that it's a really cool idea and
it's something that I think fans really
want but in 10 it wasn't really treating
it the right way I mean yeah it's great
that we have some really big name games
on there like Leonard of Zelda and Super
Mario Brothers 3 and I think there's
some really cool ideas they've
experimented with like adding these
special edition modes of them like being
able to play Zelda with all the items
right away but at the same time it's a
really limited library and kind of feels
like it's just not quite enough even
though it is just a perk to add on top
of what should be an online-only service
honestly I really think that instead of
being just like a perk associated with
an interest which online the library of
NES games should just be their own
separate side perk that you're either
buying stuff individually permanently or
it's it's own separate subscription with
a larger list of games available and
having a separately sold controller like
this I think ties into that idea so much
better because it's not just a situation
of oh you signed up for online good job
do you also maybe want this controller
it goes for this it's like no here is
this separate service that's for
dedicated retro fans and here is an
awesome accessory to pick up for it and
I think it just makes a better pitch
overall and there really is a market for
this I mean even look at other
accessories that were made by
third-party companies like a pedo
they've made a line of different NES
controllers that kind of our combination
of something that's functionally useful
for modern games but features that kind
of retro style of these systems and I
think this acts as a very strong
competitor for that obviously you don't
want to use this in games outside of
just the NES emulator but if your goal
is just capture that old-school retro
feeling while playing those old-school
games on the switch this does an amazing
job of that again I think this is an
awesome collector's item I don't
necessarily think you need to rush out
and buy one if you just want a
functional controller for your switch
but if you love the retro stuff on the
system and you
they have high hopes like me like
Nintendo's going to shape it up and make
it truly live up to its potential this
is a great step in the right direction</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
