scouring the internet for some of the
coolest gaming merch you can grab for
under 50 bucks first off is a really
freaking cool Legend of Zelda keying er
now this hangar is a reference to one of
the first scenes of the original Legend
of Zelda when link has first given his
sword and shield I've seen a lot of
design similar to this one where they
take that scene and turn it to a key
hanger with regular old hooks to put
your keys on but what's really cool
about this one is how it takes the idea
a step further where you actually get
keychains that are shaped like a sword
and shield that latch into the hanger
itself this item is a little different
from some of the other ones on this list
because while a lot of those are from
regular retailers this is actually an
item off Etsy that was custom made to
order now one thing I noticed about this
once I got it is that it is a little
brighter than the original picture but
it's still really freaking cool next up
is a really cool way to light up your
desk setup and that's a stackable Tetris
lamp this lamp is made up of the seven
different block types you can see in the
original Tetris and what's really cool
about this is the way the lamp works
you've got your basic little line here
which plugs into an outlet and
everything you stack on top of that or
next to it is gonna get lit up thanks to
conduction between the metal wires this
is a great showpiece that you could have
on your desk set up living room or your
entertainment center but one little
problem with it is that it is a little
unstable so it's not gonna be a great
choice for something like your
nightstand third on the list is the NES
30 Pro wireless Bluetooth controller
from 8-bit doe now this controller works
with Windows iOS and Android running
devices and not only does it work great
but it's also just a badass visual
update to a classic retro style
controller now this is the pro version
of the NES 30 so it's a more comfortable
design but you can also get a classic
version that's shaped like the actual
original NES controller but still having
all the extra buttons you can also get
it in an SNES based design or a design
based on the original Famicom using the
red and gold coloring this is the
perfect option to turn your tablet
laptop or cell phone into a portable
retro gaming setup keeping the Nintendo
theme going next up we've got a coffee
mug that looks like a pipe from Super
Mario Brothers this is the perfect
vessel for your gamer fuel of choice
whether you're doing a late-night
session of binging back to
old-school Mario games or you're trying
to tackle those ridiculously hard Mario
maker levels now there are a lot of
other mugs circulating on the internet
with the same basic idea but when it
comes to quality this is really the best
one out there now on top of that it also
comes with a free coaster that's based
on the item blocks from the game as well
and if you really want to go all out and
upgrade your coffee table setup they
also have an option for getting a full
set of these now last but not least is
by far my favorite item on this list and
that's the field guide to Kanto which is
clearly not based on anything owned by
Nintendo having to do with Pocket
Monsters this is a fan-made field guide
based on the original Pokemon Red and
Blue that's completely written as though
it was from in universe so if you ever
find yourself getting lost inside the
actual game you're gonna know exactly
what you need to do what's really
amazing about this thing is the
attention to detail how every single
Pokemon is illustrated and reimagined
with more realistic proportions and how
they each have their own dedicated entry
that's written as though we're right out
of a pokedex from in-game to top that
off the back of the book also has a type
chart a full map of the Kanto region and
one reference it makes that I absolutely
love that only fans of the old-school
original games are going to get is a
dedicated entry to missingno this field
guide makes a perfect bathroom or coffee
table book that is an absolute must-have
for any Pokemon fan so that about wraps
up this list if you guys want to take a
closer look at any of these items I do
