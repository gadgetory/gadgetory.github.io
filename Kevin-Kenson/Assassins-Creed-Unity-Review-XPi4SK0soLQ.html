bit of a rollercoaster in terms of
releases some are good some have been
all right and some have just been
playing bad and in short I'm leaning a
lot towards throwing unity in the bad
column for quite a few different reasons
I'm not saying the game doesn't have it
strong points more fun moments but
there's a lot wrong with this game in a
few different key areas ranging from
simple game design choices to writing
and voice acting and even just how it
performs in general what's up guys Kevin
here and before I dive into my list of
complaints let's talk about the basics
and what parts of the game I do like so
far unity is the 5th or 7th main
Assassin's Creed game depending on how
you count them is the latest one come
out for the new gen of systems since
Assassin's Creed Black Flag last year
which was in my opinion one of the best
ones in the series it contains much of
the same core in terms of character
controls and abilities having players
blend in with crowds sneak behind boxes
and assassinate foes with a mixture of
traditional weapons including swords
guns and of course the series standard
hidden blade while killing things is of
course a given with the game's title the
majority over time is spent on the
game's platforming and free roam
mechanics scaling the sides of buildings
running from rooftop to rooftop diving
off of towers or just going in
directions you originally hadn't planned
on now it's different about unity is the
addition of two new mechanics which are
heavily related first off there's a new
multiplayer mode focused on co-op where
two to four players work together to
tackle a mission together and players
now have a much greater degree of
customization over the main character
Arno's equipment which not only changes
his appearance but also affects his
statistics which can emphasize one
particular play style or form of combat
these new customization options are
easily my favorite new gameplay aspect
in concept its original intent is to
help different players stand out and
complement each other in co-op missions
but even without that it's just a step
in the right direction for the series in
my opinion as it allows players to
really emphasize the abilities and play
styles that they like to use the game
does throw in some additional new
mechanics like getting points from
missions to unlock new skills so you're
kind of a pseudo leveling up and how
many abilities have been locked as well
as what kind of equipment you use gives
you an overall power rating letting you
know if a particular mission is going to
be harder or easier
for you now whereas Assassin's Creed
Black Flag started going in a new
direction by focusing on things like the
ship based combat more spread-out
settlements and more wilderness than
city unity is taking a step back to more
the style of the original Assassin's
Creed games taking place in a gigantic
sweeping city scape and I think they
handled it actually pretty well this
time it's not just that the city is big
but there's a lot of details that you
can make use of going through people's
houses to hide or escape from soldiers
having access to underground tunnels and
sewers to infiltrate buildings and the
games map feature has been improved to
give you a 3d layout of everything
showing you the pinpoint location of an
assassination target or point of
interest this is also made use of in the
games assassination missions which are a
bit less linear than in prior games
rather than just give you a specific
route to follow or an obvious way to
assassinate a target the game allows you
to choose to partake in optional side
objectives that may make your job easier
and let you stock your target to choose
when you want to strike though in all
honesty things still end up straight
forward in some missions but these
mechanics being a bit more of an
illusion of an open approach while still
being more or less linear and this marks
the first of my many complaints about
this game there's a lot about it that
just tries to look and feel more than it
actually is and it just ends up falling
flat on its face and it's not just how
the missions try to make themselves seem
less linear than they actually are take
the customization system I mentioned
earlier which as I said I love the
concept of problem is Ubisoft decided
that the addition of a customization
system would be a great reason to also
add everyone's favorite way to bump up
in games price microtransactions don't
want to grind time away in the game to
save up enough money to buy that really
expensive 5-star armor that also looks
super awesome no problem just by hacking
currency with real life money and you
can grab it right at the start of the
game though to be fair there are some
items that are awards from missions
instead this is especially annoying
considering the fact that money seems to
come by a lot slower in this game
compared to past Assassin's Creed titles
you're never really lacking in it in the
first couple of games whereas in 3 was
literally everywhere trivializing the
little minigame aspects for trading and
Black Flag gave you a lot of money but
you end up spending a lot of it on your
ship so it all balanced out pretty well
this time around though money is mostly
made from mission searching pockets and
opening the occasional chest but the
prices of endgame equipment is so much
higher than
lower level stuff that saving up takes
quite a bit of time not to mention the
fact that there are several chests in
the game that you literally cannot open
unless you also download the Assassin's
Creed unity companion app for mobile
devices an app game that is pretty much
the same Brotherhood minigame we've had
in the past four games but now on your
phone instead of in game to try and
create a sense of cross-platform play
which really only ends up harming the
game sense of immersion since you'll
stumble upon a blue chest that you can't
open because you just want to play the
one game you bought and not download any
side apps for two bucks then there's the
core gameplay itself which honestly I'm
just getting tired of black flag was a
great breath of fresh air because it
took a lot of the whole Templar assassin
space alien thing and put it in the
background to the very end and instead
focused on the story itself whereas
unity is taking a step back to a lot of
bad old habits the writing is on par
with most of the past games which is a
wave of hit and miss lines and it's a
bit disheartening that for some reason
voice actors this time around were
chosen to have British or American
accents rather than using French ones to
help immerse players in the setting
something that has been done since
assassin's creed two with Italian
accents or like in three with
Revolutionary War English or black flags
good ol pirate lingo well there are a
few new options for what you can do in
the core gameplay combatant free room is
still much clunkier that really needs to
be with awkward-looking combat and free
roaming not always sending you in the
direction we think it will it never
really bothered me too much in past
Assassin's Creed games until more games
started coming out that did the same
thing but better with examples like the
batman arkham series or even this year's
Lord of the Rings shadow of Mordor I
don't understand how at seven games in
Assassin's Creed continues to be nowhere
near as smooth when there's obvious
competition to take inspiration back
from and further improve upon now if all
that wasn't enough the games also got
performance issues galore I can't speak
for the Xbox one version personally but
the ps4 version features visual bugs
left and right and even some awkward
moments in gameplay well the pc version
simply has some of the worst
optimization to see in a game this year
with frame rates being well below what
they should be for the kind of visuals
the game has to offer and to be honest I
don't think it's even really that
good-looking it is a step upwards in
Black Flag especially in characters
facial
nations and some fine details like a
certain delete supporting characters
hair but everything else doesn't look
any more impressive than what we saw
back in black flag despite it being
exclusive for the newer gen systems so
what some of you may be asking now is
well what about the cough you mentioned
they added that so maybe that's good
enough to bring everything back well yes
and then you out about coop was
definitely a great addition and one I
think the series can benefit from in the
long run though it is worth noting that
it's at the exclusion of the game's
multiplayer which did have its own
little small called fan base the problem
is the missions themselves are in my
opinion really unimaginative and bland
they basically boil down to just
missions that are harder than normal so
teamwork makes it easier now that might
sound like an obvious duh kind of thing
but when I think about a game like this
having comp I want to see something
interesting or unique to draw it apart
from the single player like having
multiple objectives that need to be
completed within a certain timeframe of
each other forcing players to not just
work together but also coordinate and
split up at times sure something like
that would make pickup groups a lot more
annoying to play with but otherwise you
have a mode that to me doesn't really do
anything making it worth playing outside
of wanting to get the immediate mission
rewards or playing your game it's a neat
side load to do but doesn't go enough
for being a new reason to buy the game
so in summary Assassin's Creed unity is
a combination of the same Assassin's
Creed core which could really use a
tune-up by now with some new mechanics
and modes that would have been really
amazing had they not been spoiled with
things like micro transactions and
performance issues if you're a die-hard
Assassin's Creed fan then you've
probably already grabbed it and if you
haven't you might still enjoy some parts
of it to at least devour what new bits
of story has to add but to anyone else
that just likes to dabble in it or was
thinking about starting in on the series
since cock is now a
I honestly can't say that's worth
getting any time soon maybe after a few
price drops but for full price it just
doesn't cut it at all well that was my
review of Assassin's Creed unity if you
aren't interested in government copy
despite my warnings I do have a link
posted down below also down there in the
description is a way to follow me on
twitter if you guys enjoyed the video as

button let me know and if you haven't
subscribed yet hit that button too
