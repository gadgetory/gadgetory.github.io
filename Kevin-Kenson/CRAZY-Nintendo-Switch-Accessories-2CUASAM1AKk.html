place and we've scoured it for a bunch
of custom-made accessories for the
switch as well as a little bit for the
Xbox and the PlayStation and bring you
guys a collection of them some which are
cool some are functional and some are
just a bit crazy first off this little
guy right here question block that holds
a little plan so this is celebrating of
course the Mario series question blocks
turn all the games they give you coins
power-ups 1ups but of course in some
games especially Super Mario World
little plants even Carla so we put this
little guy in here right there now to be
honest this thing was actually
advertised with a picture of a succulent
which will fit perfectly in there and we
didn't know this which is really cool
they actually said you won we just
didn't know that so we don't open the
package right away and well I'm sorry
little guy now of course no custom made
accessory video would be complete
without something you could put a joy
Kon into and that's why we grabbed these
nice family-friendly combat now I don't
know why these exist why is this even on
the internet oh how can i buy how does
this come in shipping how did no one
question that we were able to buy a
bladed item to put a joy con into I mean
to be honest actually isn't that sharp
you can just do that fine but the point
is a little little crazy anything you
can buy like you know you could
definitely play some games in it I just
wouldn't recommend doing any kind of you
know motion intense game at a party
lotta dies now what is probably the most
intricate thing we picked up off of Etsy
is this special customized doc that is
based on the ship from super mario
odyssey and nicely touched by the way on
this thing is that you actually have
little pad where you can put any amiibo
of your choice obviously we had to go to
mario from mario odyssey now an
interesting thing about this dog is that
it's actually not a doc at all it
doesn't have any of the electrical parts
inside of it that make the doc work
instead it's actually just has a USBC
extension cable which you then have to
plug into the regular switch doc which
if you want to make things a little
easier you can pick up one of those
little portable docs that would work
better in the situation because when
you're using the nintendo doc what ends
up happening is it has this kind of box
design here as you can see I don't rip
it out because it's gonna mess
everything up but basically you have to
plug it in and make sure that has just
enough tension to where the USBC cable
is staying plugged inside so it's a
little bit of a convoluted setup but if
you're able to build up something around
it it's actually pretty cool okay now if
that Doc's a little bit too much for you
something that's a little more low-key
you can grab that we found were these
little pipes that act as a stand for the
switches main body now obviously this
doesn't act as a dock in and of itself
you have to use maybe a portable dock to
plug into the bottom or this is the
perfect way to actually play a tabletop
mode instead of having to use the
switches kickstand which in case you
haven't seen enough my videos yet I
utterly hate so great alternative for
that now don't worry it's not all
Nintendo stuff we've got a little bit of
PlayStation Xbox going on as well
something we got for the PlayStation was
this psvr stand which is really cool now
the thing is you may have noticed a lot
of these products are all well just 3d
printed with varying degrees of care
taken to actually clean them up
afterwards and I got to say this VR
stand is one of the better ones except
for the fact that it actually came in
pieces
so it sounded like something cracked but
visually it's okay yeah well you know
it's it's it's it's a good looking stand
it smells like burning plastic right now
so we exchanged screw this and put this
together ourselves
but once it's together it's pretty
good-looking and I think it's a really
cool way to display the VR with the
PlayStation cymbals now as for Xbox
something we've messed with before is
having wall-mounted setups which they do
make more simple hooks for controllers
where it's just a little kind of black
thing to the controller sits on is very
subtle but if you want something with a
little more style in flavor to it we
found this one it actually features the
Xbox logo and goes really really well
with the gray in green Xbox one
controller but of course a lot of
different designs look good up on there
so no matter what either way great
