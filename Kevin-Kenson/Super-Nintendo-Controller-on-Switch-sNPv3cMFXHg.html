Nintendo Switch right now,
there aren't a whole lot of options.
Your choices are, basically,
to use the two included joy cons,
although you can also buy more.
You can use a single joy con by itself.
Or, if you're willing to shell
out a little extra money,
you can get a Switch Pro Controller.
The problem with this, though,
is that thanks to Nintendo's pricing with
this generation for accessories,
this gets really expensive, really fast.
I mean, a single joy con is 50 bucks.
Eighty bucks if you get 'em in a bundle,
that's still 40 a piece.
And the pro controller
is a full blown $70.
That's ten bucks more than the MSRP
on the Xbox One or PS4 controllers.
But, there's thankfully, one new option,
thanks to 8bitdo.
Now, for those of you who
are unfamiliar with them,
8bitdo is a company that
specializes in accessories
that are all styled and themed
after old-school Nintendo stuff.
Get it? Nintendo. 8bitdo. Ha-ha.
Anyways, their biggest line are
these Bluetooth wireless controllers.
This one here is based on the SNES,
but they've made a whole bunch more
based on the Famicom, NES,
although those ones do have four buttons
like this one, and shoulders.
They don't have the two button set up like
the actual old school controllers.
They also have a line of pro controllers
that add analog sticks,
and a couple other button
options, if you prefer.
Now, normally,
these controllers are
designed to work with
what you would normally expect to
use a Bluetooth controller with.
Your PC, a Mac, tablet, phone, whatever.
But, thanks to a recent update,
it'll now also work with
The Switch.
All you have to do is
update your controller
to the recent 4.0 firmware,
you hit Start + Y at the same time,
which puts it in Switch sync mode.
You'll see the light up
here blink four times.
And, then, on your Switch,
you go to the Arrange Grip Order section.
Hit select button, which is for syncing.
And..
It works.
After a little bit of pause
that scares us a tiny bit.
Once you get it synced up to your Switch,
it'll be read as a Switch Pro Controller.
Now, how well does this
actually work in practice?
A lot better than I was actually
expecting, to be honest.
I went in half expecting
there to be a bunch of issues,
like input latency, or certain
buttons not reading right.
But, for all intents and purposes,
while playing certain games,
it feels completely natural.
An important distinction to make, though,
is that, while this is read
like a Switch Pro controller,
it's much closer to being
actually like a joy con.
Cause you'll notice, there aren't exactly
enough buttons to do all the things
a Pro Controller would do.
So, it works really well
with certain games like,
Mario Kart, or some of the
simpler downloadable titles.
But, on something like
The Legend of Zelda,
you're not exactly gonna
get full functionality.
At the same time,
unlike joy con, it also doesn't
have an accelerometer in it,
so any games that rely on
controls that are motion-based,
it's not gonna work for that, either.
Now, there is one huge
downside about this method
that has to be discussed though,
and that's connectivity issues.
It's not anything like
disconnecting once it's synced.
Once it's synced, it
actually works really great.
But, getting it synced in the first place
is really, really annoying.
Which isn't too huge of a surprise.
I mean, this is a recent firmware update,
and problems like this tend to happen.
Hopefully, there will be an upcoming patch
that actually fixes this.
But, as for right now,
if you try to sync this to your Switch,
you're gonna have a lot of problems
where it doesn't detect it.
Or, in one case, while
actually shooting this video,
it crashed the Switch.
(loud beep)
You just hit the Select
button for syncing and..
Error.
It shuts down the Switch.
This happens sometimes.
Another really cool thing 8bitdo has done,
is not only have they
updated their controllers
to work with the Switch,
but they've also updated
their line of retro receivers
to work with Switch accessories.
Now, what these are are
little Bluetooth dongles
designed to attach to
different old school systems.
They have one for the NES, the SNES,
and in this case, the
Nintendo Classic Edition.
And the idea is,
it lets you use their line
of Bluetooth controllers
with old school systems,
which is especially useful for
the Nintendo Classic Edition,
cause if you happen to own one of those,
you'll know that the
cord for the controller
that comes with it is
extraordinarily short
and pretty much useless.
And thanks to a recent firmware update,
this will now also connect
to Switch joy cons,
and Pro Controllers.
Now, setting this up is even simpler
than using the controller with the Switch.
All you have to do is update the dongle,
plug it in to whatever
device you're using it with,
and then hit the sync button on that
at the same time as hitting the
sync button on your joy con.
And, just like that,
boom, works fine.
If you're a huge Nintendo fan
and you own all the consoles,
this is an awesome way to consolidate
using a single controller
across multiple systems.
Especially considering
two of those systems
are the original NES and SNES,
and you're now playing wirelessly.
The receiver only runs
for about 15 to 20 bucks.
The Bluetooth controllers
go between 35 and 45.
So, this is definitely an
awesome alternative option
for people looking for more
ways to control their Switch.
Assuming they update the firmware again.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
