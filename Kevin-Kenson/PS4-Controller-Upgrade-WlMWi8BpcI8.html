- Today we're looking at something
that's a little bit weird.
I've been looking at this for a long time
and I've been debating
whether to do a video on it
and I realized that right now
there's kind of a pretty good
reason to actually cover a video on it.
This is the Avenger PS4 controller.
Or at least the Avenger PS4
controller shell, apparatus, thing?
So what this is, is it's a
grip that attaches to the front
and back of your PS4 controller.
It adds a whole bunch of
different little mechanisms here
that you can reach with your fingers.
And the idea is that with this,
you should be able to play
specifically FPS games without ever
having to take your thumbs off the sticks.
This is a concept that started
actually on the Xbox 360
when a lot of multiplayer
FPS stuff was really
starting to blow up on
consoles and with the PS4
being a bigger hit during
this current generation,
it made its way over to that system.
And it's actually really interesting
how this whole idea works.
The idea is that you have
all these little tabs
and things you can reach using
different parts of your hand,
not your thumb specifically.
That way you can just keep
them locked on at all times.
And it works on the very
similar concept as a lot
of expensive Pro controllers
do where you have
reprogramming of buttons
that you can reach
using other fingers instead
of having to move your thumbs
around and that way you can
be focused on just movement
and looking around,
especially in FPS games.
But the interesting thing
about this is that instead
of being a $200 controller
which might have those buttons
along with other features you
might not necessarily need,
it's just cheap little
plastic shell attachment
that is way more affordable
and gives you that option.
Though it's a little crazy looking.
So let's take an actual in depth look
on how this really works.
When you first open this up, you might be
a little intimidated of how
exactly to put this altogether.
It's in two pieces and
one of them is very spinny
and kind of weird
looking, but it's actually
really simple to setup.
It can basically be done in three steps.
The first one is take this front plate
and just snap it onto the
front of the PS4 Dualshock.
Second step we're gonna
take this back piece
and see these kind of
hinge parts right here?
You're gonna loop 'em into
the hooks that are on the top
of the controller, don't worry
about how everything else
is lining up just yet, just
get 'em in there into place.
Now once you've done
that, you can make sure
that all the other buttons
and everything are sitting
in the right way they
should and you're gonna take
this back piece here on the bottom
and just hook it together making sure
it snaps nice and tight.
Once you've done that, you're done.
The entire thing is put together
and it's really actually kind of ingenious
how this all works, so
again, the focus here
is to try and make sure that
you're never moving your thumbs
away from the sticks, you can just
stay focused on being able to do movement
and looking around at the same time.
So the main idea here is
to have ways of reaching
the four front facing buttons that aren't
gonna need you to move your thumb around.
So the way this is done by adding
all these different little levers.
There's one at the bottom for X,
you can use your palm, just
putting a little pressure.
One for circle where you
can use your index finger
to lift up and then up
above higher are these two
that can be used for triangle and square.
And you'll notice on the
back of the controller
all these kind of trigger
extensions that are going on.
This makes it so that you can either
have a further back way of
being able to reach the trigger
or if you need to be able
to hold down a trigger
for a very long period of
time, you can just grab
the little loop here and hold it down
and that's just gonna make
sure it's nice and locked in.
And it's more comfortable on your finger.
And then as for the front
buttons, instead of pressing
down on them regularly,
you're gonna rest your finger
in the same position you would
use for pulling the trigger,
but if you wanna hit the
button, you just tilt forward
instead and that's gonna
press down on R1 or R2.
I will say it certainly isn't
the most intuitive experience,
it's definitely different
from how you would
normally hold it and use a controller,
but with time spent on
it, it's actually a pretty
interesting and neat way
of giving you this option
of controlling more without
having to ever use your thumbs.
Trying this out too, it
gives you this really kind
of interesting highlight
to what the logic is going
into a lot of Pro controller
designs and this whole idea of,
how can we make things
comfortable for players
and give more accessibility
without having to rely
on more traditional controller inputs?
Okay, so I'm just gonna
mess around a little bit
in Destiny 2 to kinda
feel how this controller
actually handles, I will say
it's a little more intuitive
than I thought it would be at first.
The triggers of course feel normal
and just kinda running around right now,
I've been able to just play missions
and not move my thumbs of the sticks yet.
Some of the issues I am
finding so far though,
a lot of it just has to do with developing
the right intuition
like what goes to what,
every time the game
tells me to press square,
it takes me a second to be like, wait,
that's this one, yes
okay, flip up on this.
As far as the comfort
of all the levers go,
I've gotta say that they're
a lot better than I thought
just looking at them, I mean again,
this thing is absolutely crazy looking.
But it's really not that
bad to hit the square,
triangle or even circle,
the only one that's kind
of a problem which is a little unfortunate
and probably needs rebinding
in some games is the X
because X is very often used for jumping.
And so, when you're in a
situation where you're trying
to turn and jump at the same time,
depending on where your thumb's
moving on the right stick,
it just feels a little awkward
to have to flex your palm
at the same time and it's not always
the most intuitive thing to do.
The other part about this
that does feel a little weird
to me in getting used
to is the trigger setup.
Because of how much they've extended them
and the kind of extra layer it has,
there's kind of a softness
and part of the problem
is this is just the way
that the Dualshock 4
triggers are designed.
It feels a little awkward,
but what does help
balance this out at least for
things like aiming down sights
is this whole idea of
the loop grip right here,
where if you need to aim
down sights for a long time,
like say you're using a sniper
rifle, you can just hold down
on it and it's a lot more comfortable
than holding the button down
the way you normally would.
I will say at the same time
though, that while the trigger
pull feels a little
weirder to me, I do like
that I have one place to access
multiple buttons at a time
without really needing to use
my index fingers very much.
I'm either pressing down
to use the triggers,
going forward a little
bit to hit L1 or R1,
or raising the finger if I
need to hit square or triangle.
It just makes it so that
you're able to access
multiple buttons really easily
with minor finger movements.
You know, I gotta say, I
originally ordered this
mainly because it was just insane looking
and I thought it would be
a fun video to try it out,
but it actually isn't that bad.
You know, I didn't really
give it much credit
when I even first opened it up,
but after having spent
time playing with it,
it works really well
especially considering
that it is a much cheaper
alternative towards buying
something like an
expensive Pro controller.
But then it makes me wonder,
how does this actually compare
to like a $200 controller,
so I've switched over
to the main Pro controller
that's really become my go to
on the PS4, the Razer
Raiju Ultimate and again,
there is a major price difference
between this and the Avenger.
This runs for basically
200 bucks and a little more
'cause you have to import
it if you're in the US
whereas the Avenger is
40 bucks and it's still
half the price if you include buying
a brand new Dualshock to go with it.
Hey, speaking of Avengers,
did you ever wanna customize
you're your Switch in the color
of your favorite villain, Thanos purple?
Well that's possible thanks
to today's sponsor dbrand.
They have a whole line of
Switch skins that are totally
safe to use, check out
the link down below.
The main thing we really
wanna compare here
is the accessibility of additional buttons
because on the Avenger, it's
giving you this roundabout way
of accessing front facing
buttons with all these levers,
whereas a Pro controller
solution is gonna give you
just additional buttons
that you can reprogram
to match whatever button
you need them to be.
One of the immediate easy
comparisons is that on the Avenger
if you're using default button layout,
X is a little weird to
hit and you need to use
that fairly often for jumping
depending on the game,
whereas on the Raiju
Ultimate, if I've programmed
into one of these back buttons,
it's just pressing down
with my middle finger
and that's really easy.
Of course, when you're
talking about something
like a $200 controller,
there are more features
than just reprogrammable buttons.
You're also getting things
like redesigned grips,
higher quality parts,
more features in functions
like being able to
adjust the rumble motors.
So you're getting more for
that higher price point,
but if you're just looking for
a way to more easily access
buttons and that's the
only thing you care about,
the Avengers is an interesting
thing to compare against it.
It's interesting to see
how this shell approaches
the idea of being able to access
buttons in a different way
compared to how Pro
controllers have really evolved
with this idea because
here it's a lot of shifting
your hand, putting a little
more weight on the palm forward
or raising it up a
little bit, whereas a lot
of Pro controllers right now
have evolved from concepts
that are really popularized by SCUF
in the earlier days of PS4 and Xbox One.
For instance, having back
paddles that are accessible
through using fingers that you normally
wouldn't use while gaming like reaching
for it with your middle or ring finger.
This is something that went
on to inspire for instance,
Xbox One Elite controllers
design where it has paddles
in the back that are down on the sides
instead of straight back down.
And even SCUF and other Pro
controller manufacturers
are messing with other ways to access
buttons in interesting ways.
For instance, the newest SCUF
Vantage adds side buttons
where you're able to
flex your finger upward
kinda similar to how this one approaches
that other form of accessibility.
Whereas Razor puts reprogrammable
buttons on the top middle
so you can reach further in
from where you'd normally be
resting when accessing the triggers.
All of these designs are
focused around the concept
of changing the way we
hold and use controllers
because in certain ways,
games have evolved in a form
that the standard four
button layout isn't always
the most efficient way to actually use it.
That's not to say that the
concept doesn't work at all,
otherwise why would be
using this design still?
It's something that's very comfortable
and makes a lot of intuitive
sense to a lot of people.
But for the actual, optimal, efficient way
of being able to play a
game where you wanna be able
to look, move, jump,
shoot, fire, all this stuff
at the same time, well it's
not really that convenient
when you have certain moving
around different controls.
You need to be able to use your
entire hand in different ways.
Looking at how these third
party shells and controllers
address the concept of additional buttons
and changing the ways
that we actually interact
with the controllers, it's
really interesting to think
about how that might actually impact
future mainline controller design.
'Cause when you look at all
the mainline controllers
right now like the Dualshock
4 or the Xbox One controller,
they're all just very
heavily refined versions
of concepts that we've been
seeing over and over again
for the past couple of generations.
I mean, yes there's changes to things
like the way the grip is shaped,
maybe there's a little more
distancing or slight changes,
but overall it's the same concept.
The sticks are roughly in the same place.
You have a D pad, you have
four front facing buttons
and four shoulder buttons.
But seeing all these
new controller designs
that offer things like
buttons on the back side
where the grip is or weird paddle things
to be able to access buttons
without having to use
your thumb, it's interesting
to think that if this is
a better, more optimal
way of playing a game,
is that something that should start being
rolled into new controller designs?
Is this something that we could see
kind of in the PS5 or new Xbox controller?
Maybe not quite as crazy as this one is,
but still the same concept of having ways
to reach buttons that
would involve something
other than just your thumbs.
When you're looking at
a product like this,
I think there's two main
questions that people wanna ask.
One, does it actually work?
And two, if it does, is it worth spending
just 40 bucks on this to
modify your Dualshock 4?
Or is it better to save
up for a Pro controller?
Well for the question of does it work,
surprisingly yes, it certainly
takes some getting used to
like I've said and there's
a couple of aspects of it
that are a still a little weird
even once you are comfortable with it.
But I will say that overall,
I think it did give me
an improved experience
where I have a lot easier,
faster access to a lot of buttons,
especially when you do a lot
of things simultaneously.
With that in mind, if the only
thing you're really looking
for is a way to access more
buttons easily and no other kind
of features, yeah for 40
bucks it's kinda cool.
Now I will say that in my
experience of using it so far,
the plastic material it's
made out of does feel
a little bit more on the frail side.
I get a little worried,
especially with these
upper levers here that if
I got really intensively
into a game, I might
accidentally put too much
and could even maybe snap the plastic.
That hasn't happened
yet, but it just doesn't
fill me with the greatest confidence.
On the other hand, if you
spend more money on something
like the Astro C40 or the Razer Raiju
or any of the SCUF
controllers, you're gonna get
a lot more than just those
reprogrammable buttons
and a lot of other nice
features that are really cool
to make use of even if
you're not necessarily
looking for those in the first place.
Look, in just a straight
comparison of what's gonna
give you the best experience
possible and we're not talking
about price at all, I do
think a Pro controller
is still the better way to go.
It's something that's
built from the ground up.
It's gonna give you additional buttons
that don't get all over the place.
It's gonna have a better grip design
and often times have a
lot of other features
that are really useful.
But if you don't wanna
spend that much money
or you're not able to and
you just want something
that's gonna be a more
affordable fix to give you
a better experience right away,
this actually is something
that I think could really work
despite how insane it looks.
And look, I get it, if I watched
someone else reviewing it
and they were like, oh yeah this thing's
actually great, it does a good job.
I'd be skeptical too, I
would just not believe it
because yeah, it's kind
of a mess to look at.
But it really does, after a
little bit of initial period
of time of getting used
to where all the different
switches are and just getting
that button association
down in your head, it's better.
I really wish we could use the
Avengers theme in this video.
I just know we're gonna get
copyright claimed immediately.
But just imagine like opening
shot with that controller
and just, bum, bum, bum bum, ba ba ba, ba.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
