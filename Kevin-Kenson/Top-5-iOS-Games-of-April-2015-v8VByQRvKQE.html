are my favorite iOS games of April 2015
first up is tiny guardians a game that
clearly has its roots in popular tower
defense app games but does something a
little differently instead of protecting
a base from waves of enemies by setting
up towers you instead have a central
character that's walking across the map
and summons different guardians to
protect her along the way
these guardians encompass all kinds of
standard fantasy classes like fighters
that tank enemies archers and rogues to
blow things up and mages that have AoE
attacks and can slow down enemies the
game is a little slowly paced at first
because you find yourself just watching
the character slowly crawl across the
map but as time goes on it gets a lot
more fast-paced and a lot better
especially on higher difficulties my
only real complaint with it is the fact
that the in-app purchases are a little
on the wacky side because there's a lot
of them that are purely cosmetic but the
pricing doesn't make sense because
you'll have alternate character skins
that are maybe a dollar for one class
but are five dollars for another class
even though it's functionally the same
kind of product thankfully though none
of the in-app purchases are necessary to
enjoy the core part of the game you can
just buy it initially and enjoy the full
experience unless you absolutely have to
have an alternative skin for one of the
classes next up is the third entry in a
series that has been one of my favorites
on iOS but I've actually never mentioned
on one of these lists before and that's
sorcery 3 now admittedly this game is
extremely niche if you have a background
in tabletop games or choose your own
adventure games this can be a lot of fun
but if you don't it can be a bit jarring
though it is a pretty solid introduction
to the genre a basic idea is that you're
navigating your character through
dangerous territory through a series of
adventures making decisions like when
you should make camp whether or not you
should try to use a spell to solve a
certain situation how to solve puzzles
and deciding if certain quests are worth
doing or just too risky now this is the
third one and they are all linked
storyline wise but the plot is pretty
bare-bones and basics you could start at
this one with really no problems but I
definitely recommend playing through all
three if you can because they are a ton
of fun if you're into this kind of game
now the other three games on this
month's list are noticeably bigger
budget starting with implosion never
lose hope this is a fast-paced isometric
action game focused on you controlling a
mech combat is timing based where you
can either tap the screen repeatedly for
vast combo attacks or time between
slashes in order to make slower heavier
attacks you have a few other ways of
attacking enemies including ranged
weapons and special attacks you can
customize with time and between missions
you can unlock different passive bonuses
to equip your mech with the story is
nothing special for this game but the
dips did a great job on its presentation
and the game's graphics and soundtrack
and controls are all wonderfully done
it's definitely one of the more
expensive games you'll pick up by App
Store standards but if you're willing to
throw down the money for it it can be a
ton of fun
fourth up on the list is another
big-budget game for very obvious reasons
and that's halo Spartan strike now the
Halo series is of course popular for its
first person shooter mechanics but in
order to adapt better for an app game
this one is a top-down twin analog
shooter meaning that you use one analog
to move your character around and the
other analogue to point which direction
you shoot the developers did a fantastic
job of taking iconic aspects of the Halo
universe and cramming them into this
style of game you've got all your
recognizable weapons vehicles enemies
and armor abilities and any fan of the
Halo franchise will definitely
appreciate this game it does have a few
weak points I have experienced a crash
here and there but never really anything
consistent or super often and the game's
controls could use a little refining but
both of these are things that will
hopefully be fixed with patching and
even without it they're easily counter
balanced by how much fun the core game
is if you're a fan of the Halo franchise
this is an absolute must grab and even
if not it's still worth at least
checking out now last up is easily my
favorite game to come out this past
month and quite possibly one of my
favorite RPGs to be released on iOS ever
and that Steven universe attacked the
light now obviously if you're a fan of
Steven universe this is a game that
you're probably already chomping at the
bit to try out but even if not this is a
fantastic simple RPG to try out it's got
a lot of mechanics very similar to games
like Super Mario RPG and Paper Mario
where used timing mechanics to make the
most out of your tax or successfully
defend against enemies each of your
teammates has their own unique attacks
and play style while Steven provides a
support role by either healing them
giving defensive bonuses or using items
to support the team the plot and
dialogue in the game is really
simplistic and nothing to get too
excited about though if you are a fan of
the show you will at least have a few
references to get excited about here and
there
other than that though the game
definitely gets most of its strength
through its really solid gameplay
it's really easy to learn really easy to
get addicted to and honestly one of my
favorite iOS games that I've played in
quite some time
add onto the fact that this is actually
the cheapest game on this month's list
at three dollars and there's not much
reason to not go out and at least try it
right now because it's easily worth the
purchase so there you guys have it my
five favorites now to be perfectly
honest - this month it was actually a
really tough one there were a lot of
games I really loved and I had a tough
time narrowing down which five to go
with there were a lot of other great
games I didn't mention such as not
layers and devious dungeons - games I'm
sure you guys also loves so make sure to
leave a comment down below with what
your favorite iOS games were of this
past month and as always guys if you
