new Switch accessory to talk about.
We finally have a new
Wireless Pro Controller.
Let's check it out.
(upbeat techno music)
So, this is the Enhanced Wireless
Pro Controller from PowerA
and what's interesting
about this controller
is that it is the first
third-party wireless controller
officially licensed by Nintendo.
- [Robot] One day earlier.
- So, we are on our
way to Target right now
because while researching an
unrelated other video idea
that we might still do later,
we found out that apparently
the PowerA Wireless
Pro Controllers are already on sale there.
Amazon lists those for the
31st so this is a lot earlier
and something I've
really wanted to try out.
(upbeat techno music)
I feel like this is one of those pictures
that's not actually a
good idea to zoom in on
because pixel art doesn't
always translate well
when it's larger 'cause it
just, look at Link's face.
- Hey you guys!
- There are a lot of wired
controllers out there
but basically every wireless
controller on the market
aside from Nintendo's own pro one,
isn't really licensed until this one.
Now, obviously along with
being a wireless controller,
there are some additional
benefits that this offers
that other third-party
controllers don't always have
for instance it does have
motion controls built in,
not a lot of third-party
controllers offer that.
Though it is still lacking
in terms of any kind
of rumble feature or the
ability to read amiibos.
One interesting extra feature though,
is it does have programmable
buttons on the back.
They are two right here that
are really easy to set up
and you can map any of
the front facing buttons,
the triggers, or D-pad directions to them.
All you have to do is
hold this button back here
until the light in the
front starts blinking,
hit the button you wanna map,
and then hit the button
you wanna map it to
and you're done, it's as simple as that.
Now along with all these other benefits,
what other little nice
thing about this controller
is it comes in a variety of designs.
There's actually five that currently exist
and when we rushed to
Target we were able to get
four of the five.
The only one they were missing
is actually the one I wanted the most
which was a red design with a
black silhouette Mario on it
but we still have this design as well
along with a black, a white,
and a Legend of Zelda design.
So, with all that in mind,
how does this controller
stack up against PowerA's
previous wired controller designs
and is it worth grabbing over the official
Nintendo Switch Pro Controller?
Starting with their
previous wired controllers,
which by the way, this one is a wired,
it just doesn't have the
cable in it right now
that is one of the upsides
to them, they're detachable,
but when you're looking
at them side by side,
one of the things you'll
immediately notice
is that the wireless design
is just a little bigger
all around, especially on the back.
So it can actually hold batteries
which is a thing we'll
get to in a little bit.
But otherwise the grip
designs are very similar.
It's maybe just a little
larger on the handles
for the wireless one which I do find to be
a little more comfortable.
These two controllers are very similar
when it comes to button quality
and it makes sense they're
made by the same company.
The biggest difference
you'll probably notice
is that the top R and L buttons
are just a little more
elongated on the wireless,
otherwise button feel
is basically the same.
The biggest area where
there really has been
an improvement though, is the sticks.
The original wired controller for PowerA
had these very large stick heads
which I didn't really like.
They felt slippery, it
wasn't really something
your thumb could fit comfortably on.
It just, oversized.
I'm not sure what they
were going for here.
With the wireless design,
they've redesigned them to be
basically the same thing as
the Switch Pro Controller
which is a massive improvement.
Otherwise, the only other major difference
is that there are some
additional functions
of the wireless that are not
present in the wired controller
like those motion controls
and these programmable
buttons on the back.
Considering that this is
roughly twice the cost at $50
whereas these normally run for 25 to 30,
I actually think it's worth it.
Now of course the more
interesting question
is how does this controller stack up
against the official Nintendo
Switch Pro Controller
and the debate's actually a lot closer
than I would have first thought
because there's some really
interesting differences
going on here.
Now the first one I wanna talk about
is one of the kinda obvious
ones you have to accept
with these, it's a third-party controller,
it feels a little cheaper.
It's not quite as heavy,
the plastic's not as sturdy.
It's just all around a little different
but that's part of what you expect
when you're paying less money.
As far as actual button quality goes,
they're actually very similar.
The sticks feel about the same.
I think the only major
difference on this one
is that the buttons
feel just like they have
a little more resistance
which could be an upside
or downside depending on personal taste.
The only ones that feel outright worst,
are the plus, minus, screen
capture, and home buttons
but considering how rarely
those are directly relevant
to gameplay, not that big of a deal.
Where things get really interesting
is when we talk about additional functions
each of these controller offer
and the difference in price
'cause there's a couple things
I didn't really think about going in
that really do make this
an interesting offer.
To begin with, this
actually uses batteries
instead of being a
rechargeable controller.
A lot of search controllers out there
still rely on rechargeable batteries
and these days the only
really major company
that still uses double a's,
at least initially at launch,
are the Xbox One controllers
and depending on personal preference,
this can actually be a major upside
because it lasts a lot longer
before needing to be replaced
but once it does need replacing,
it's not as simple as just
plugging in to something,
you have to go out and buy batteries
if you don't already have them on hand.
That being said, it does
have a little indicator light
up top which does let you know
when the batteries are getting low
so you're never gonna get caught off guard
if it all of a sudden dies mid gameplay.
Now aside from that, the main differences
really come down to the functions
we've already talked about a little bit.
They're both wireless controllers.
They're both gonna give you the ability
to use motion controls but
this one's not gonna let you
scan amiibos, it's not gonna have rumble,
which is honestly I think one
of the biggest losses it has,
but over the official Pro Controller,
it does have those programmable
buttons on the back
which can be very handy depending
on the game you're playing.
Price-wise when we're talking MSRP,
this is 50 bucks, and this is 70 bucks,
but realistically, if
you're just looking for
a standard black Pro Controller,
you can find them for about as low as 60,
so it's really only a difference of $10
which when you first hear that
you might be like, oh, 10 bucks,
I might as well just
upgrade to the official one
but honestly, thanks to the
additional buttons on the back
and the fact that the
only really big feature
really missing is rumble,
if you're willing to part
with that and you like the idea
of using standard batteries,
this is a great alternative.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
