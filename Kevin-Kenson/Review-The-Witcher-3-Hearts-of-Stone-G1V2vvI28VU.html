the biggest successes to come out this
year and is one of if not the top
competitor for Game of the Year 2015 and
we just saw the release of the first of
two planned expansions for it
hearts of stone and if you haven't
picked up the season pass or you didn't
invest $10 in this DLC it you might be
wondering is it worth picking up what
exactly does it add because there's been
a lot of games in recent history where
the core game is really good but the DLC
is more or less pointless and thankfully
this isn't one of those situations so
first off what exactly does hearts of
stone add well it adds one new major
quest line which is leveled for
basically the end of game content it
also adds a few more side quests new
monsters new items and a new crafting
mechanic called rune words and one of
the things that I think really makes
this DLC worth it is how much continent
adds for how much you pay you know
there's a lot of other DLC out there
that costs 15 bucks and maybe adds six
hours of content 7 if you're pushing it
whereas hearts of stone cost 10 bucks
and it'll easily last you at least six
if you're just rushing through the main
plot but if you take time doing all the
quests at ads as well as trying out the
new mechanic it's easily worth 10 hours
and it's not just a matter of quantity
but also quality because the story that
hearts of stone adds is really damn good
in fact it's my favorite quest line so
far beating out everything that we've
seen in the base game and one of the
things that I think really helps it
stand up is that it has a lot of varied
content plot lines a lot of DLC tends to
be very laser focused on whatever that
expansion or DLC is talking about you
know there's some piece of information
or some particular quest you're on and
everything you find everything you do
revolves around that content in this
case though it works a lot more like the
core story which were three where there
is an overarching plot you're trying to
accomplish but along the way there's
also a lot of different side plots
you'll be involved in that all kind of
tie together really well it also helps
that while this expansion doesn't add
any new full areas to explore it does
read detail some areas with more things
than were there before and makes use of
a lot of stuff that was already in the
game but didn't necessarily serve a
purpose yet and without expensive The
Witcher 3s world is it's a pretty
seamless integration now new quest lines
and story are not the only things that
this expansion adds there's also one new
mechanic
rune words now rooms are already used in
the game where you could just take
different runes put them in sockets on
your weapons or armor to get some kind
of special effect like increasing the
effect of one of your spell's rude words
on the other hand build upon that
mechanic by giving a way to gain more
unique effects by using a specific set
of three runes and these are a lot of
effects that weren't previously
available in the game and stand out as a
little more interesting now unlocking
this mechanic is a little expensive in
game especially if you weren't actually
trying to save up any money for it
before you got the expansion but it's
really cool to make use of once you do
and you'll definitely be able to afford
it by the time you get through most of
the plot in hearts of stone so you can
make use of it in the final missions as
well as for the blood and wine expansion
once it comes out or if you just started
a whole new game over you can use them
for quite a bit more of the game so if
you have witcher 3 but you haven't
invested in the dlc yet change that
right now because it is excellent and if
this is any indication of what we can
expect for the second expansion blood
and wine which is planned to be even
larger then it's pretty much just worth
jumping the gun and investing in the
season pass instead so those are my
thoughts on the hearts of stone
expansion for The Witcher 3 if for some
reason you haven't picked up the core
game yet and you want to I do have it
