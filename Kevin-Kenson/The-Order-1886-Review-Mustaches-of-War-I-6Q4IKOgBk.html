order 1886 one of the most advertised
exclusive games for the ps4 and it was
immediately met with a lot of negative
criticism due to the fact that the game
is only five hours long which led to the
question these five hours of gameplay
worth paying a full 60 bucks for what's
up internet Kevin here and I've always
been of the opinion that a game can be
as short as five or six hours and still
be worth paying a little extra for as
long as the content is worth it
and it gives you some reason to want to
replay it sadly though order 1886 is not
looking like one of those situations
there is a lot I have to complain about
this game but before I get to that let's
start with the one thing I do like about
it and that's its presentation overall
the game is undoubtedly beautiful even
when locked at only 30 frames per second
it just looks amazing there was clearly
a lot of attention to detail given in
terms of character facial animations
cloth movement body motions everything
just looks really realistic making it
one of the best-looking experiences on
the ps4 to date one other thing the game
does that I really liked that I think
some people have had a bit of a problem
with is the fact that it mixes in a lot
of cutscenes in between gameplay as a
way to help load upcoming game segments
in other words once you initially load
the game up there are never any loading
screens ever the only time the game is
ever going to fade to black is when
there's a major scene transition or if
you die and has to reset up the next
segment of gameplay which personally I
really love it just makes the overall
experience much more immersive and keeps
you constantly focused on the action
rather than ever having to stop and wait
for the next segment to load now that
being said the visuals are basically the
only one big good thing about this game
it's all downhill from here starting
with the mediocre gameplay now if you
watched my five things you should know
about order 1886 a video I did just
before the game came out one of the
things I observed is that it looks a lot
like Gears of War which is both a good
and bad thing in the sense that I really
like the core gameplay but if there's
anything the later Gears of War Games
taught us it's that that gameplay can
get very stale very quickly if you don't
make use of interesting and varied
enemies weapon types or level design and
that's exactly what happened in the
1886 to begin with enemies are just
simply uninteresting almost everyone you
fight is just simply another human armed
with a kind of gun you could use most of
the time it's just a regular pistol or
assault rifle occasionally run into a
guy with a shotgun or a sniper but
that's about it which I think what makes
it especially disappointing in this game
is the fact that the whole thing is set
in this very Victorian horror type
setting where you're supposed to be
fighting werewolves and other monsters
there's only three times you ever fight
werewolves in the game with too quick
time event boss fights and while
vampires are featured in the storyline
you never actually encounter them in
game the rest of the time is spent
solely focused on fighting other humans
which just ends up making the whole
thing feel very blend it's made worse by
the fact that level design is all very
simplistic most the time you just walk
up to the first waist-high wall and take
your time shooting what enemies are in
view and that's about how every combat
will go throughout the entire game now
these combat segments are broken up
every now and then by stealth segments
and werewolf fights as I said earlier
but sadly these are actually when the
gameplay gets even worse first off the
world fights there's three of them and
they are all the exact same encounter
basically you enter a room you fight
three werewolves at once and there's a
bunch of boxes stacked around that crate
and narrow corridors and all the
werewolves do or run at you in turn and
run away
so you just shoot what all runs at you
dodge watch it run away watch the next
one come up wash rinse repeat until the
fights over it's some of the most boring
repetitive parts of the game which is
really a shame because the word will
should have been the highlight of the
game that should have been when the game
was at its best and offered you
something interestingly different from
finding regular humans but no it's just
the same repetitive mess that's really
more annoying than anything else now
these were all fights would be the worst
part of the game if it weren't for the
few stealth segments that were added see
the game starts off with what looks like
very standard common stealth elements
that are added into an action game you
walk around crouched a lot and you have
to walk up to an enemy to press a button
suddenly kill them the thing is it looks
as though the devs realized that they
created a very standard and fairly
boring stealth experience so to try to
spice things up they added a QuickTime
event to how you silently kill enemies
the thing is what it does now is just
make silently killing enemies all the
more annoying
because if you try to attack them too
quickly they somehow develop superhuman
reflexes turn around and shoot you in
the face the only thing more annoying
than this is the fact that if you have
arranged silent weapon enemies are still
able to kill you with a cutscene death
as soon as they remotely spot you so you
could have your sights lined up on an
enemy's head and if he notices you
before you pull the trigger you lose
complete control of the game it changes
to a cutscene and you get shot in the
face doesn't matter what you do so while
the core gameplay is mediocre at best it
definitely gets bogged down with stale
enemies stale of a design and awful
segments that try to give you a little
variety the only aspect of the gunplay I
really enjoyed is that I think they did
a fairly good job with the gun designs
you get a few of the standards like you
know shotguns rifles pistols but there's
a crew of interesting ones that mix
things up a little bit there's an art
gun that is the most broken thing in the
game it basically plays it for you by
aiming in a general direction holding
the fire button and watch an enemy on
the screen die and there's the thermite
rifle which is my favorite gun in the
game because it's not overpowered like
the art gun but still is very
interesting and unique it basically
involves shooting a cloud of gas around
an enemy and then shooting a flare that
sets that gas often explodes really fun
really interesting probably the most fun
I had in the game was when I was using
the thermite rifle because it was the
one thing that stood out to me as being
a fairly original experience so what
about the storyline oftentimes there are
games where the gameplay is mediocre but
the story makes up for it not really in
this case the story is nothing special
the setting itself is fairly interesting
it's nice to finally see a Victorian
setting in a major video game and does
that whole kind of steampunk mix with
you know interesting weapons and
fighting werewolves and vampires and
such but beyond that it all gets very
trippy very quickly all your teammates
and characters are very stock very
identifiable and very very predictable
and what really makes all this worse is
the fact that while the plot is okay at
the start it falls apart very quickly at
the end once you realize nothing gets
resolved at all it basically looks as
though the designers didn't realize
there's difference between
setting up for a sequel and flat out
ending before the third act see when you
set up for a sequel normally almost
everything gets resolved within that one
game with one loose end you know there's
the one bad guy that's still at-large
there's this one major question that
isn't answered there's that guy that
helped you earlier that might actually
be the major antagonist in the next game
that doesn't happen here instead there
are about four or five different major
plot threads that are brought up and
none of them get resolved at the end of
the game it simply ends after you take
down a secondary bad guy which is just
completely annoying especially
considering the fact that the game is
only five hours long now this of course
brings us the biggest debate about the
game is it worth playing something
that's so short well part of the defense
that ready at dawn had was that it's
only five hours long if you make a
beeline through the entire game if you
take your time exploring and reading
everything it'll take more like 10 or 12
hours no not true at all I spent as much
time as I could exploring every level
every nook and cranny reading every
letter I could find and at most of the
experience was only about six and a half
hours the amount of content that there
is on the side which usually boils down
to a single room attached to a hallway
is never going to add up to five hours
it's an hour at most added and this is
really where I think the biggest problem
I have with this game comes from is the
fact that it's not just five hours it's
five hours without any real reason to
want to ever do any of it ever again
there are so many ways that you could
add length to this game and none of it
was done even if the campaign was left
as it is you could add side modes if it
could be competitive multiplayer it
could be co-op multiplayer against
hordes of enemies which works perfectly
with this gameplay formula and even if
you didn't want to add side modes you
could do two-player co-op in the
storyline to give you a reason and maybe
play it again with a different friend
now if you wanted to keep the game
purely single-player there's still
things you could have done they could
have added collectables that could alter
the ending of the game like having a
hidden cutscene so you have a reason to
go back and re explore levels but
there's none of that you could have
alternate choices and levels that could
alter the storyline ever so slightly or
just change how a specific mission goes
down
none of that occurs once you play
through the game the first time you have
seen basically everything there is to
see which just makes the five hours all
the more insulting I think what really
bother
I mean the most about this game is that
from what's here you could tell that
something better could have been made so
much time and effort was spent on
creating the basic tech for the game it
looks as though at one point the
designers realized oh crap we've created
all this awesome tech but we haven't
made a game around it yet so they just
threw together a quick five hour
campaign to set up a sequel which really
if that's the case the sequel might
actually be a good game if it ends up
being longer uses the same tech and has
more interesting and varied level design
but as this one stands on its own
currently it's just not worth spending
60 bucks on now normally I would argue
with games that I found to be somewhat
mediocre that hey if you don't want to
wait for a price drop because you want
to play the clock it might be worth
spending 60 bucks for you right now
I don't see myself making the argument
with this game at all
you should definitely wait for the game
to drop to at least 15 or 20 bucks
because at that point at least you're
gonna feel like you got your money's
worth as far as the length of time goes
but you're still gonna be a little
disappointed with how the storyline pans
out and how nothing gets resolved so to
sum up the order 1886 is a great looking
beautiful game that definitely could pen
out to being something more in a more
fully developed sequel but this game by
itself just not worth defending 60 bucks
on whatsoever definitely wait for a
price drop fifteen or twenty bucks would
be worth it anything more it's just
gonna be a waste of your money because
you're gonna pick it up finish the whole
game in a single night in five to six
hours and then you'll be done well that
was my review of the order 1886 as
always guys I do have that game linked
down below if you want to pick it up
despite my warnings I'd really heavily
recommend against it this time though if
you enjoyed the video as always make
sure to let me know by hitting that
thumbs up button as well as subscribing
if you haven't yet I've got more content
on the way soon but till then though I'm
Kevin Kenton and I'll see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
