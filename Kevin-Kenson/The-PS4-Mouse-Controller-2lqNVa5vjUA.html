supports the Xbox one is a very cool and
exciting idea and something that I
really hope the other game companies
start jumping on so we can start using
whatever kind of controller we want to
use on all the different main consoles
but this isn't actually the first time
that something like keyboard or mouse
support has come to consoles there's
been a lot of attempts of the past of
adding smaller simpler or just basic
ideas that add a mouse now we have seen
some unofficial options and above
smaller keypads from game sir and even
whore has done designs like this before
for the PlayStation before even that
there is one very interesting and very
weird controller that I'm very glad to
be able to talk to you guys about
finally and that's the tactical assault
commander for ps4 this has only been
released in Japan and yes it is just as
awkward to use as it looks this is an
officially licensed controller we're
pretty clearly the main goal was to make
something it would be more precise for
FPS games as opposed to a more
traditional controller but the way they
go about doing that is by having 1/2 be
a traditional Mouse and then to make up
for the lack of a keyboard on a
Playstation you instead have this half
controller thing so let's take a look at
each part by itself now the mouse itself
is pretty straightforward it's a mouse
moving it around acts like the right
stick the mouse clicks work like l2 and
r2 for aiming down sights and firing you
actually have dpi adjustment right here
and l1 r1 on the sides along with some
sensitivity buttons we'll talk about a
little later now it is a USB mouse but
it's not plugged directly into your ps4
instead it actually plugs into the side
of the controller which is by far the
more compelling element of this combo
now there are some elements of the
controller that are very familiar in
other elements that are more weird where
it's more straightforward is all that we
have on the front facing side the left
side works a lot like a would on a
normal controller you have a stick and a
d-pad although they are switch 2 versus
the normal PlayStation orientation touch
pad in the center you can click in
options button share buttons PlayStation
Home button and then an assign button
that can be used to change the inputs on
all these shoulder buttons which is
where things get a little more
heavy-duty so because the mouse doesn't
have enough buttons to support the
traditional front-facing buttons they've
instead
all been shoved right on to this upper
side here so the idea is that you can
leave your index finger on it and just
press down with either the front or back
of it to hit the X square triangle and
circle buttons which is a lot to have
all in one place
in addition there's also this FN button
on the back which by default you use it
in conjunction with other buttons to get
different effects like is a roundabout
way to get the r-1 button but really
it's basically an additional button that
you can program and then we have what is
probably one of the weirdest parts of
this controller the actual kind of grip
sleeve right here so the whole point of
this is because when you're using a
controller like this one-handed it's not
actually well first off its not very
comfortable but it's also not something
that you can conveniently hold it all
the time if you're moving your thumb
around to go between the stick and d-pad
if you're moving your index finger a lot
you're not necessarily was gonna have a
super solid grip on it so to make sure
that you're able to hold on to it for a
long period of time you have to put your
whole hand in the sleeve and then make
sure that especially if your hand starts
to cramp in any way because once again
using just one hand like this for all
these buttons at one time it wears thin
pretty quickly so that's how all of this
works in theory but let's actually try
out using it so to test it out I've
loaded up destiny to have just started a
new file I just want to mess around very
beginning to kind of get a feel for how
all this works and to be honest I'm not
a big fan of the mouse right away I'm
gonna adjust the acceleration on it
because it's not really being as
reactive as I'd like go to do that I
just switch over the adjust up here on
the switch and then use the d-pad to
change those settings we're gonna turn
it up a bit and that's a lot better I
actually have it maxed out but that's a
lot better yeah I can look around pretty
easily it doesn't feel completely fluid
but it's not bad and then the mouse does
give you a couple other ways to adjust
the sensitivity if you want for instance
on the fly there's these two buttons on
the side which say Q and s so the Q is
for quick and while you're holding that
down everything's gonna be maxed so you
can just look around really quickly
whereas with s if you're holding that
down that's night mode and that's just
gonna make it so it's super low when you
need to really fine-tune your aim on
something I will say the grip on it
isn't as uncomfortable as I imagined it
would be it was really bad at first when
I was trying to use both fingers up top
here which gave me more access to all
the buttons simultaneously if and it hit
things at the same time but the
rip isn't really designed to support
just having two fingers below and
because you don't believe the balance of
two hands on a controller it just you
start to feel cramps right away so you
really need stick with just having one
finger up above it's taking a little bit
for me to still get the rhythm down of
which buttons which on here I'm
remembering that by function like if I
need to jump I know it's this button if
I need to reload I know it's this button
but as soon as the game is like hey you
should press square to do a thing right
now I'm like wait which one is okay it's
this one
I should really kill these guys and stop
talking uh like this is functional it's
working right now I just don't think
this is an optimal choice especially cuz
you're restricting your options up here
well I am able to use each of these
buttons individually pretty fine and if
I need to like mash them I can just
don't even try to reach anything in the
middle here you basically they need to
take your hand off the mouse and reach
over to press something like if I wanted
to pause right now that's what I have to
do you can maybe reach the share button
with your thumb but it's not the most
comfortable decision and is gonna throw
you off a lot if you want to take a
screenshot or something really quick
also the way this controller is weighted
isn't super great for how it's designed
I mean it's very light but you
definitely feel a little off and you're
trying to have it up here it's almost
more natural if I'm just leaving it
slacked on the desk right here yeah I
can't help but feel like this idea would
work better if instead of trying to
emulate a normal traditional controller
design where you have the whole middle
section if they just recreated the whole
thing to be more like a joi con on the
switch or if it was more like even like
how the wiimotes were designed something
is a little more all-encompassing and
designed to actually be used one-handed
instead of just mimicking half a
controller with this sup you are getting
the benefits of a mouse still which is
nice it's not quite as natural feeling
as I think it should be I mean even
adjusting the settings it's gotten
better but it doesn't feel like the
PlayStation really knows you're using a
mouse but it is an improvement all the
problems really stem from this guy this
is one of those ideas where I think
during the design stages in like early
concept art it was a very compelling
idea you're like oh yeah this is this
could be something really cool and
different and then the moment you
actually try a physical prototype just
doesn't really work out at all and in
fact Horry even themselves are very
aware of this fact because after they
released of this they then released the
tactical assault commander Pro which is
the same basic idea with a mouse but
then it just has a smaller keyboard
because that's ultimately really the
better way to go you know kind of one of
those problems where if it's not broke
just don't fix it now this isn't to say
that I think that this is an impossible
terrible controller to use I mean after
playing for a little while I do think
it's something that's viable like you
could get pretty good with this I'm just
not sure why you would versus a lot of
the other options that are out there at
the end of the day I think this was a
cool idea and something that maybe Sony
Hori in general just revisit bringing
more options like this to the
PlayStation just like how Microsoft is
adopting full-blown keyboards</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
