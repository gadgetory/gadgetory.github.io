- Nowadays when people
talk about console wars,
they're always debating
PlayStation versus Xbox
versus the Nintendo Switch,
but back in the 90s was the
first original console war.
Super Nintendo verus Sega Genesis.
- [Announcer] Sega's Genesis
is Nintendo's nemesis!
- Which is really crazy to think about now
because after Sega got out
of the console business,
their games started showing
up on all platforms,
especially Nintendo!
And now, there's even a way to use
a classic Genesis style
controller on your Switch,
with the M30 Bluetooth
controller from 8BitDo.
This is the latest
addition to 8BitDo's line
of retro style controllers,
but it's a little bit of a deviation
from their normal formula.
Usually they'd be very heavy focused
on Nintendo focus products,
making things based on the NES controller,
SNES controller adapters for the Gamecube.
But in this case,
this is their first attempt
at doing something focused
on Sega's legacy, specifically
these six button style
Genesis controller,
and the reason why the name is M30
is because in Japan, the actual
original name of the Genesis
was the Sega Mega Drive.
(speaking foreign language)
- Now, this is an interesting
decision for a few reasons,
but one of the biggest is the fact that,
while I think Nintendo
has a lot of strong
nostalgia power behind it,
because you know they're the
company still making consoles.
One of the big reasons
why a lot of people preferred
Sega back in the day was,
because they considered
the Genesis controller,
the six button one,
to be the more superior
comfortable design,
because it added additional buttons to use
based on the kind of fighting
pads, six button layout,
and its controller grip
was a lot more comfortable
versus the very flat design
of the Super Nintendo's.
This makes the M30 a
very interesting option
to consider nowadays,
because while we do have plenty
of retro controller options
that pay homage to old school NES stuff,
getting the chance to use
a Genesis style controller
that really was the
better option back then
with retro games today is really exciting.
So just like with their other controllers,
this is designed to be
a Bluetooth controller
that work on a number
of different devices,
Mac, PC, Android, and most interestingly,
what we'll focus on, the Switch,
it's also worth noting that 8BitDo
has released a number of
different retro receivers
that allow you to use
their Bluetooth controllers
on old school systems,
and to coincide with
the release of the M30,
they've also made a retro receiver
for the classic Sega Genesis.
So if you want to hook up
your old school system,
and play it wirelessly in comfort,
this is gonna give you that option.
You know, it's really
interesting to take a look back
at that older console war,
and see how some of the
arguments are kind of the same,
yet still very different.
For instance, today we did
talk about console exclusives,
what you can get on the Switch,
or on the PS4, or an Xbox.
But back then I mean we had
a huge iconic characters
that were the focus,
where you have one system
sporting this plumber
that jumps really high,
versus this blue hedgehog
that loves chili dogs,
and runs really fast.
But what's even more interesting
is when it comes to the concept
of how games play differently on a system.
Today it's, you know,
oh the resolution's a little different,
or these visual effects.
But back then there could be a
game released on both systems
that would play totally differently.
And I think a great example of this,
is the original Mortal Kombat,
because it also speaks to how Sega
was really trying to do things
differently from Nintendo.
See, when Sega was making
their way to the west,
they had an uphill battle against Nintendo
that was currently the reigning systems.
So they had to do everything they could
to differentiate themselves.
And some of the ways they did that,
were by tapping into larger
audiences with different genres,
like sports games, and also
having more mature themes,
which is where Mortal Kombat comes in.
The Mortal Kombat was
already making a huge fuss
with how violent it was in arcades,
and when it was made it's
way to home consoles,
we got two very different versions.
The Super Nintendo one
removed all the blood,
and replaced it with sweat,
and even removed the fatalities,
which was basically the
whole fun of the game.
Meanwhile, the Genesis version
kept all that stuff intact,
although you did need to use a cheat code
to be able to access it.
This is one a long way in helping Sega
seem like the cool alternative
to the more traditional,
and family friendly Nintendo,
and it may, or may not be also the reason
why we now have the ESRB,
because once more violent games like that
started making their
way into people's homes,
parents weren't really
super thrilled about that.
Alright, enough history.
Let's actually talk about
how this controller performs.
Now, I've always enjoyed a
lot of 8BitDo's products.
I think they do a good job on
all of their button quality,
front facing buttons all feel really good.
You have concave buttons on the bottom,
convicts at the top, solid triggers,
but the main thing I
really want to emphasize
with this controller is
how much I love this D-pad.
Genesis style controllers
use a circular D-pad design
instead of the normal cross shape
that you see on the Nintendo ones,
and it works out really,
really well in this case.
it has a perfect balance between having,
just that little bit of snappiness
so you feel like you're
really pressing down,
but at the same time is soft enough
that you can make lots of
rolling motions really cleanly.
Now from the position of using
this as a Switch controller,
there's a couple things to keep in mind.
Certain buttons have been
moved around a little bit,
which works better for some games,
and not so much for others.
For instance, you'll
note that there's only
two shoulder buttons which
act as the back triggers
on a Switch controller,
while the front shoulder
buttons have been moved
to these two buttons on the
side of the six button setup.
This can also get a little confusing
when you're using the Switch
if you're not careful,
because it uses the Genesis
lettering of A,B,C, X,Y,Z,
which is actually flipped
versus how Nintendo controllers do it.
So if a game tells you to press A,
you actually have to press B.
It makes sense
as far as where the
position of the buttons are,
but if you're just paying
attention to what the letters are,
you're gonna get a little
confused here and there.
As for all the different option buttons
you need on a Switch controller,
they are still present on here.
You've got the start button in the middle,
which acts as a plus,
and then there's three buttons below
that are kind of camouflaged a little bit
to match the rest of the
body of the controller,
with minus in the middle,
a star button that acts as screen capture,
and a heart button that acts as home.
Of course something we are missing
on this controller are sticks.
Now by default, the D-pad
acts like the left joystick,
because that's the one
that actually does
movement for most games.
However, there is a
kind of hidden function
on this controller that
allows you to change that,
which I'm a little annoyed,
wasn't in the instruction manual
that came with the controller.
I actually found this by
going to their website online.
If you hit the minus button,
and one of the Directional
buttons on the D-pad up,
left, or right,
it will change which
stick this D-pad acts as,
either as the directional
buttons on a Switch,
the right stick, or the left stick.
So any game that needs you to use
multiple of those at the same time,
this obviously isn't
going to workout well,
but if you just need one of them,
you can adjust this to
fit your preference.
So that's all the in
depth stuff it can do.
But at the end of the day,
how does it actually perform?
Honestly, really, really great.
This controller is awesome obviously,
because it is a retro design,
you're not gonna use it for
every single game on the Switch.
You don't want to play Breath of the Wild,
or Mario Odyssey where you
need to use both sticks,
but for playing more retro
style games, indie titles,
Sega Genesis Classics, Sonic Mania,
it all works really well.
And there's one other specific case
that I think it really
excels at, fighting games.
If you prefer using a fight
pad for fighting games,
and you miss having a great D-pad,
this is the way to go.
I absolutely love the
D-pad on this controller.
It is perfect for rolling inputs,
and because it is the Genesis style,
it's using the six button setup
that was so common in a
lot of fighting games,
especially of course, Street Fighter.
Honestly there really isn't that much
I have to say that's negative
about this controller.
I mean there's the obvious downsides
that come with a retro design,
the lack of sticks,
and it is not quite as comfortable
as a modern controller can be,
but as far as retro ones go,
the grip design is awesome.
The only other issue is I have really is
how the controller is
supported information-wise.
Like I said, there wasn't
any clear instructions
on how to use the D-pad modifications.
I had to go to their
website to learn that,
and on top of that,
all the other 8BitDo controllers
have a nice little info pad on the back
that gives you shortcuts for,
oh, if you want to use Switch mode,
here's the button combination.
If you want to do PC mode,
here's the button combination.
That is not present on
the M30, which yeah,
you can go back to instructions,
you can look it up online,
but it's really handy
just to have that easy
reference right there.
And I miss that.
Bottom line, if you're an
old school Genesis fan,
or you're you just looking
for an awesome fight pad
to use on the Switch, and even on PC,
do not let this controller pass you by.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
