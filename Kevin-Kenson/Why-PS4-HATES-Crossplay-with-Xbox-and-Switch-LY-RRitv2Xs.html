videos what do you think so you will
ever adopt cross-play features do I
think they ever will yes
do I think it's gonna be anytime soon or
even during this generation probably not
look cross-play is really cool and
awesome it's great that companies like
Microsoft and Nintendo are starting to
embrace it but as for right now Sony
doesn't really have any reason to Sony
no Bologna I mean yeah they're getting a
lot of hate over the fact that they
aren't encouraging it the fact that you
know if you've played a PlayStation
version of fortnight you can't use that
same stuff on switches stuff that's
terrible and people are angry about it
but they don't really have a reason to
care about it yet because even though
people are angry about it they're still
going to be buying games on their
platform they're still gonna be playing
those versions on their platform and as
long as they have exclusive versions of
those games they're gonna brave profits
from people buying stuff in those
versions the game so they don't really
have a reason to do it yet until they
start seeing some more real competition
and threats from Microsoft and Nintendo
once things start balancing out and
people start wanting to buy other
systems over them yeah they might
actually embrace it to be one more cool
feature of their system but for now
they've been just doing so well this
generation they can kind of do what they
want as long as people keep buying their
stuff and until that changes they're
just not gonna embrace it Xboxes recent
developer acquisition has me excited
which companies work are you most
looking forward to in the future so when
they announced this whole line of new
studios they gained I got to be honest a
couple of them I was somewhat like okay
sure you guys acquired him because I
mean let's face it before it was an xbox
exclusive anyways they didn't officially
own them yet but we're gonna see more
than his name kind of stuff but as far
as like the new interesting studios go I
think the one that stands out the most
for me is ninja theory
ninja theory is a dev team that I always
had kind of a love-hate relationship
with their games there's things I really
like about on things that I'm not as big
of a fan of but something they
consistently really do is nailing an
awesome aesthetic they always have a
certain style that they want to have a
game just you know instill in their
players and they do a really good job I
mean a really great example and probably
the best game they've made so far was
hell blade said it was sacrifice that
was an excellent game before that they
did do some of they liked the Marvel and
which people just kind of pushed those
aside because that's more of just like
fun little stuff but they did the reboot
of DM of Devil May Cry which they call
just DMC which I wasn't a fan of all the
changes in that game but it was
definitely very pretty and was still
really fun to play so yeah I think it's
kind of a hallmark of their stuff
there's always going to be a few things
they missed but when it comes to
aesthetic and just style they just ooze
with it so I want to see what Microsoft
has them do with that I don't know if
they're gonna have them work with an IP
that Microsoft already has I don't know
if they're gonna have them just do
something entirely new I'm just very
curious what they have in mind what
games are you most looking forward to
that were announced at e3 and what games
did you expect to e3 but we're a no show
so starting with ones that were a no
show especially because there were all
those kind of like little leaks that
happened ahead of time I'm really
surprised we didn't see Borderlands 3 I
think that is something that is still in
development and gonna happen but we just
didn't get any news about it which made
me a little sad because it's not my like
favorite franchise in the world but I
always have a lot of fun when those
first come out just because I can jump
into some comp with some friends and
just run through them they're just
always a fun time for me so kind of we
got news on that as far as stuff that we
did see that I'm super excited about
look there's a lot of easy answers I
could give here right now I feel like a
lot of people are just gonna be like oh
you know Super Smash Brothers ultimate
cyberpunk 2077 basically every game that
Sony focused on and those are all pretty
much true but for kind of side ones like
you know slightly more sleeper hits for
me I was a huge fan of basically
everything Capcom announced delve may
cry 5 coming back that is huge for me I
grew up loving that serious and in fact
after they now it's been I already
played three four and even DMC so yeah
I'm really happy that's coming and the
resin peoples who remake I mean we knew
that was happening but we finally
actually saw it and have more news on it
so that's huge one other game real quick
to that Nintendo turn off at the start
of their presentation daemon ex machina
I'm a big fan of anything that puts you
in control of a giant robot and one of
my favorite old series that did that was
Armored Core and while this isn't
technically Armored Core it's basically
a spiritual successor but I mean it's
the same Project Lead it's the same guy
designing the mechs
it just looks faster paced more colorful
which are all great things so that is
huge for me what's your opinion on the
flattening of snakes but in smash
ultimate
travesty should Microsoft make a
handheld or portable console no they
shouldn't I don't think so at least
especially with how the Xbox one did at
the start of this generation I think
they've had the right idea of focusing
on making that bigger and better they
worked on the hardware by making the 1x
they've improved the OS and software of
it offering more services and now most
recently with u3 they've shown a
commitment to try and do more first
party games for the system I think
that's the right move is just focus on
that and if they want to do handheld
stuff they've order kind of hint into
what they want to do which is I think of
the right move is to just focus on
bringing all that stuff to handhelds via
streaming you know don't make your own
thing instead just make it so someone
can take their phone and stream Xbox
games to their phone I think that's the
right way to go do you want video game
manuals to return yes but also kind of
no-look manuals serve their purpose back
in their time and I love them but
there's kind of a reason we don't have
them anymore I mean first off it just
kills a ton of paper but growing up with
game manuals they were so much more than
just being like little info great
graphic things because back then first
off games didn't really have tutorials
very often so you really needed the
manual to actually tell you what you
were even trying to do but they also
served as kind of an old-school form of
art book I mean outside of maybe
commercials or promotionals and
magazines that was the only way you
could really see a lot of art and stuff
and concept work for the games that was
really awesome but nowadays I mean we
get actual fold on art books we have
strategy guys that has our books we act
as you know we just have stuff flowing
the internet we have the Internet is
really what I was trying to basically
say after that and I just didn't</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
