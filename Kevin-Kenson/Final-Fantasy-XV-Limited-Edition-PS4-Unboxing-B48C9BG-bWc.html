having been announced 10 years ago as
Final Fantasy Versus 13 and as part of
celebrating its decade-long development
is this limited edition 1 terabyte slim
ps4 on the front side of the box we see
the system's special design alongside
15s protagonist Noctis and on the back
we see noctis once again along with the
rest of the game's main party members
Ignace Prompto and gladiolus opening the
box up we see in standard Sony fashion
there is a plain white cardboard box
inside pulling that out and opening it
up we first see all the little extra
bits that come with the system
headphones HDMI cable controller
charging cable power cable and of course
a dual shock for now like the system
this controller is a limited edition
design as well albeit a very simple one
sporting the Roman numerals for 15 on
its right handle putting that stuff
aside we get to the real meat of this
unboxing the Final Fantasy 15 ps4 which
I gotta say is simply amazing the moon
edge tin to the top looks beautiful and
I like that they kept the reflective
PlayStation symbol in the upper corner
taking center stage in the PlayStation
logos place is the game's title written
in gold with the game's main cast of
characters listed below while having an
all gloss black top does scare me a
little with how easy it is to mark up
and scratch there is no denying the
effect it has on making this special
design just pop out on closer inspection
it is a little bothersome to see the
game's copyright info edged on the lower
side of the top but thankfully it's
subtle enough to be pretty hard to spot
unless you have in just the right light
and are looking for it overall it's a
damn good looking system now we're not
done here yet because there is one more
thing that comes with this limited
edition bundled we also get the deluxe
edition of final fantasy 15 which for
being a fairly simple special edition is
really nice it comes in the steelbook
case that instead of featuring the
game's normal cover art has some of the
original Amano artwork for the game now
for those you who don't know Amano is
the main concept artist and character
designer for the Final Fantasy franchise
and is one of the dev team members
that's been around since the very first
Final Fantasy back in 1987
now inside the steelbook case we have of
course a physical copy of FF 15 for ps4
but we also get a blu-ray of the tie-in
movie Kings clave which serves as a
prequel to the game story also included
is a digital voucher for some bonus
in-game items including a costume for
Noctis a new skin for the party's car
and a bonus weapon the masa moon which
is a katana that's been featured in
numerous past file fantasies all in all
this is an excellent limited edition the
system is not only beautiful but comes
with a larger hard drive than normally
available in the US the game comes in
one of the best-looking steel cases I've
ever seen and all the little bonus bits
while few in number round out the total
package nicely for being the very first
special edition design for the ps4 slim
it's a pretty fantastic star it's so
pretty in fact that I'm actually kind of
afraid of ever hooking this up and
actually using it I think I need to buy
a glass display case now maybe put it on
a little red pillow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
