special to show off today this just came
in recently now if you saw yesterday's
video or you noticed all the stuff
behind me you'll know I've done a Zelda
theme Nintendo switch set up its The
Legend of Zelda and its really rad those
creatures from gannets are pretty bad
and to complete it I wanted a very
special switch to go with it so I talked
to color where and got a custom-designed
one to match the theme now obviously I
know this looks like how they set up the
order but I haven't actually opened yet
so I haven't seen the real thing
physically so let's go ahead and check
it out right now just open it up oh this
is pretty
okay let's get so I want to do something
that was based more on breath as a wild
specifically because that is the one for
switch so for the main body I actually
got it designed to match with links main
tunic the one that you see on all the
different ads and stuff so those were
the closest blue I could find I think
they called it paradise blue I went for
a matte finish because metallic just
didn't look good to me and of course
white trim for the switch logo which
this looks a thousand times better than
the regular switch I'm sorry black is
always cool but this is so pretty
now that match with that to go with a
little more traditional Zelda to
highlight it I got gold joy cons yeah
now this has a metallic finish I can't
ask you to get that gold look but do it
looks like roll together that's which
sound is still so satisfying every time
yeah that looks awesome I am so happy
with it as though this actually turned
out I mean the picture looks cool but
this this is awesome
one other thing that got customized with
this set cables of stuff don't really
matter the time you guys have seen a
switch probably before you can also get
the dock so I got the dog to match with
the same thing I did on the back
I mean it's black on the back to the
front side is that thing blue that's
right I think this is going to fit with
this set up really nicely now as cool as
this is this actually wasn't the first
design I had I went through a whole lot
of other ideas first mainly because
while we knew we wanted to do an
ultimate switch setup we didn't decide
on the theme just yet though zeldo was a
very likely one so to begin with one of
the first designs actually went for was
something a little more generically
Nintendo and did one based on the
original NES where the main body was
this gray that was very close to white
the logo was red which actually looked
really cool and I even used a black bar
for the kickstand to emulate that black
bar on the original NES another design
idea I had was actually go with the
Japanese Famicom where instead of a gray
color it's more of an off-white cream
you have a dark red cranberry mixed in
which actually might be my personal
favorite design out of all the ones
we've done but while that was cool we
thought might better to go for a more
specific franchise and before you get to
zelda the first one you have to do is
mario so for that one I went for a red
base body I did white on the logo to
kind of match with Mario's hat and I did
blue joy Kahn's to match the overall
that he wears and pants but that one
didn't really work because when you
looked at the switch from the front you
just had blue joy cons and none of the
red came through doesn't really make it
think of Mario also at the same time as
a Luigi design alternative because Luigi
is the better brother so I worked
through a couple other ideas I did a
Metroid one that was red and orange I
thought about maybe doing a Donkey Kong
one with brown and maybe a little yellow
or red for the tie but ultimately we
landed on Zelda being the best idea
since after all breath of the wild was
the big launch title so I actually two
design ideas first before hitting this
one one was to go with a more
traditional designs I thought Nintendo
would do we're at a black switch with
gold highlights which did look pretty
cool but I didn't like really going with
a black backs of the switch because we
already have black switches it just
didn't feel like anything unique or
different so instead I went for idea
that was based specifically on breath of
the wild where I took ideas from links
tunic so he has that blue design like
this here and then for the joy cons I
actually went for an asymmetrical design
like the neon where it was white Dormont
side
white on the other which looked good but
I still miss having that gold so I end
up deciding to collapse the two ideas
which led to this now I know I already
kind of said this at the start but I
really want to drive home how insanely
good the quality on this thing is I mean
I'm sure just seeing it you think it
looks cool but even feeling it in
comparison to an actual Nintendo switch
it just want to feel all that different
I mean it is paint so the texture is a
slightly bit rougher but not in any way
is actually uncomfortable I mean you
barely notice after using it for a
little while and if you show this to
someone it didn't tell them it was a
custom job people could easily believe
that this is some kind of special vision
that Nintendo released I mean it's just
awesome there is one other thing about
it I almost forgot to mention it and
that's I'm giving this one away so if
you watch has to own this thing check
out the link down below description for
all the details also if you haven't seen
the switch set up video all the crazy
stuff happening behind me make sure
check that as well and I'll see you guys
later
good cut the link commercial get these
denim don't go get amino in this mess
who's left you make a mess you bet that
adventures nice here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
