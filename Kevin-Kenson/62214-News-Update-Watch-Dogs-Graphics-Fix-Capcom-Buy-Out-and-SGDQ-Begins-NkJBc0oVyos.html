weekly news update now this past week
was a little light in terms of game
announcements for pretty justifiable
reasons we just got over III so a lot of
the companies have really exhausted
their options for game announcements
right now but we still got a lot of
interesting developments this past week
in here are the highlights to begin with
starting the week off was the revelation
that watch dogs not only still contains
all the files for those pre visuals we
saw back in III 2012 but if you're on PC
they're even still usable this was first
discovered on guru3d but was made
popular thanks to neogaf when modders
only discovered the file inside the
watchdogs client but also found how to
unlock it this raises a lot of questions
for a lot of fans that purchased
watchdogs on launch day and we're
surprised to find the game did not have
the kind of visuals we originally
promised two years ago Ubisoft has made
a statement on their own website arguing
that these files were intentionally left
unused because they led the performance
issues that would ruin the games
experience there have been some reports
on the internet that people have tried
the mod out and have it had a negative
impact on the game they appear to be a
minority there's a lot more people
reporting that they're trying the mod
out and getting the same if not even
better performance than they were with
the unmodded version I myself have been
trying it out and have noticed frame
rates comparable to the game before
modding on ultra settings while still
showing an obvious improvement in
numerous environmental effects like
lighting fog and reflections there have
been a lot of arguments being raised on
the in it from people questioning
whether or not you be soft intentionally
weakened the pc version to make it more
comparable to the console one though it
is also entirely possible that is simply
was something that was not fully tested
and even though the game was pushed back
a full six months still wasn't ready for
launch and so they simply restricted the
files thus why some people trying the
mod might be experiencing those issues
now second up on the more business side
of things Capcom is now open to buy out
to anyone interested in buying majority
shares it was announced this past
Tuesday that Capcom chose not to renew
its takeover defense policies that have
been in state since 2008 what this
basically means is that before whenever
someone wanted to buy stocks from Capcom
and had to go through a rigorous
verification and approval process so
that Capcom could deny it so other
companies couldn't buy them out well it
turns out that at this past investor
meeting it was voted that they not renew
these policies and as a result people
can now purchase Capcom if they are able
to buy up the majority shares this news
comes a day after the announcement that
one of Capcom's most
the directors oh no resigned from his
position at capcom vancouver now what
this all means for the future of capcom
is still very much in the dark you could
find a lot of different arguments and
articles online talking about who should
by Capcom or who's most likely to buy
cap comment for what reasons but as of
right now there really is no official
news yet on what exactly is going to
happen other than the fact that it is
now a possibility last up for today's
news summer has officially started not
only did the season begin yesterday but
there's a lot of gaming related events
to help kick things off and celebrate it
to begin with steam did begin its annual
summer sale meaning a lot of us are
going to be spending a lot of money we
shouldn't on an absolutely crazy amount
of games that we would probably spend a
combined total of twenty minutes playing
but on a more interesting note today
marks the beginning of the charity event
summer games done quick now for those
you that are unfamiliar with this event
this is a biannual event in which a lot
of popular speedrunning personalities
are going to be playing a whole bunch of
games 24-7 for the next week starting
today through Saturday and all donations
from which are going to go towards
Doctors Without Borders now there's a
lot of different donation incentives for
those you watching you can do things
like present challenges to the
speedrunners get to name characters
they'll be playing as or even just win
prizes this is all for a good cause and
not to mention just entertaining to
watch so anyone that's a fan of
speedruns or just giving money to
charity should definitely check it out
so those are just some the biggest
highlights of this weekend gaming if you
guys enjoyed this vid and you want to
see more of them please make sure let me
know by hitting that thumbs up button
and if you're not a subscriber yet hit
that button too so you don't miss out

of these videos so you guys have any
questions you want me to answer hit me

takes more than a single tweet to answer
