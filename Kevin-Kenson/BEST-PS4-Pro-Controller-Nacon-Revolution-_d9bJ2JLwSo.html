European blog revealed two Pro
controllers that are officially licensed
for the PlayStation 4 this being one of
them
then a con revolution so we're going to
open this up and check it out now live
here really fancy box and that's pretty
cool so this is you can tell right away
looking at this that it's more based on
an Xbox one design rather than ps4 right
down to the grip button layout sticks
where you know normal appears for you
them down here Xbox one moves up here
and different d-pad design as well but
you can definitely tell it's for ps4
because it has this giant touchpad at
the top that most games have stop using
so this is a wired controller design
which is better for a pro controller
because it gives you the least latency
possible so we'll set this up and hook
it up in a bit got something else in
here which are adjustable weights
this is something you'll see in a lot of
different procon trailers and like
gaming mice meets mice and mouse mouse
is whatever is adjustable weights you
can have it have the right amount of
heft that feels comfortable to you so
track of these out and see which one
feels right yeah let's go ahead and hook
this up and try it out looking at it in
comparison to the stock Dual Shock 4
aside from the clearly obvious
difference in grips and stick layout
you'll also notice the buttons on the
revolution are larger and much more
pronounced like the DualShock 4 you have
a 3.5 millimeter jack to plug in your
favorite headset and the revolutions
light bar has moved to the bottom of the
controller rather than the top one of
the biggest things missing compared to
the DualShock 4 though is using a micro
USB cable for plugging into charge and
thank the controller instead the
revolution has its own power cable that
screws on to make the connection secure
and requires a constant plugin to be
used with your system no wireless mode
whatsoever now of course as for actual
hands-on with the controller I got to
say it is really really comfortable now
if you are a longtime Sony fan you've
only ever played on Playstation systems
it's going to take a little getting used
to because it does not match the form
factor of ps4 controllers at all but
honestly the grip design which is closer
to an xbox one is a lot better for you
there are a few little things about it
that feel a little up to me I wish the
triggers were a little lower though they
do have just the
amount of resistance and pretty much
everything else all those controller
feels grace buttons feel really good the
six have a really great smoothness of
motion I really like the idea they went
with a concave control stick for the
left because you're going to secure some
on that at all times whereas the right
stick uses a convex design which is a
little better when you have to do sharps
quick movements I also really really
love this d-pad it's a great balance
between a circular d-pad design where
you can do quick rolls but at the same
time there's a very clear definition of
up-down left-right one thing that is a
little weird about this controller
though for me is the macro buttons that
you have on the backside here these ones
on the outside it feels perfect you can
hold the controller and just flick them
whenever you need to
these ones though you can hit them but
they feel like the kind of thing that
it's awkward enough we're in the heat of
the moment when you have to hit it right
at the right time
you might end up screwing up another
thing that's cool too is that it does
have adjustable weights in it so if you
want to have it be just the right heft
for you I like having a really heavy
controller personally you can open up
these handles right here to pop the
weights out put in what you want and put
it back away now since this controller
is officially licensed but not made by
Sony in hell all of the customizing is
done through a PC app rather than using
your ps4 directly with this you can
adjust for different profile settings
which are really easy to switch between
on the controller just flip a switch on
the back change from stock settings to
custom and another button allows you to
switch between four different profiles
on the fly in each profile you can
customize the right joystick deadzone
and acceleration you can remap the
buttons adjust the sensitivity of your
triggers and even customize your own
macros which is mostly handy for MMOs
like FF 14 but can be used for other
games as well for instance let's say
you're playing a fighting game and you
don't care to actually input commands
yourself well you can set up a macro to
do this
so the nikon revolution is an
interesting and definitely more powerful
alternative to the traditional ps4
DualShock controller it's more
comfortable the overall build quality is
definitely higher and for those you who
are deeply engulfed in competitive
gaming the customization options can
have a massive impact on your
performance now right now this is
exclusive to Europe but hopefully it'll
make its way over here to the US if you
do want to grab one though right away
there are a few ways to import one for
instance you could grab it on eBay then
again maybe wait a bit</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
