gaming we just had a bunch of awesome
releases and there are so many more in
store especially for the switch now we
do have a lot of awesome games that we
have no idea when they're coming out
like Metroid Prime 4 or a new Pokemon
game for the switch but there is a lot
of stuff that is already hopefully aimed
at 2018 we're gonna talk about the best
of them
starting with Donkey Kong Country
tropical freeze this is one of the
numerous Wii U games that got awesome
views and no sales because well the Wii
U was a very quickly dying platform and
so now that we're getting a switch
version it's probably going to outsell
the Wii U's lifetime sales in a matter
of weeks tropical freeze is a great
return to the classic 2d platforming
Donkey Kong stylings but with the
ability to play as numerous different
characters we always have their own
little special abilities and the switch
aversion in particular is adding one new
character in the form of funky Kong
which looks like so much fun if you
missed out on this game that we you you
definitely need to check this out when
it comes to the switch sometime later
this year next up is Dragon Quest 11 now
this game did order to come out in Japan
back in 2017 and arrived on the 3ds and
the ps4 but it should be making its way
to the US this year along with not only
those two platforms but the switch as
well once again giving us that nice
little combo of having a game that can
be handheld but still have some great
home console style graphics if you don't
played at Dragon Quest game before
you've been missing out they are some of
the best single-player RPGs that have
this very kind of old-school feeling to
them that's very very comfortable it's
just the easiest way for me to put it
you know they never really hit the same
kind of huge cinematic style that Final
Fantasy or their series went but instead
just focused on this nice old-school
style game that just is so much fun to
play third up is the new Fire Emblem
game exclusive to the switch coming out
sometime this year and that is honestly
all we actually know for sure about it
right now just the fact that it is well
a fire loom game and it's this year and
that alone is enough to get me hyped to
be honest I mean I'm a huge fan of the
franchise firemen wakening was a great
entry that came out a few years ago the
ones after that
were okay so hopefully getting a home
console release version is gonna be a
huge step up for the series game number
four is Halle Knight now yes this is a
game that is already out on PC and Mac
but it'll be making its way to the
switch which will not only be its
console debut but more importantly its
handheld debut which i think is a
perfect fit for the game now if you
haven't got the chance yet to play the
game or even just read into it the basic
idea is that Halle Knight is this
Metroidvania style game with a focus on
exploration defeating bosses but it also
has this very heavy dark souls feel
going on at the same time as far as its
storytelling its world design all with
the little paint thrown on in the form
of everyone being bugs the game has an
excellent difficulty balance where it is
very challenging at first if you take
the time and effort all of its bosses
are definitely beatable as long as you
can read the pattern and figure out what
you need to do if you love 2d action
games you cannot let this game pass you
by and it's on its way to the switch
sometime in the first quarter of this
year next up we have another game that
was originally released on the Wii U and
is making its way to the switch and that
is Hyrule warriors now this game came
out on the Wii U it came out on the 3ds
and each time they've added more content
new stuff but what's gonna be really
important for the switch version is that
we're gonna be getting the Equality of a
home console style game with all the
content that got added three DS plus
costumes based on breath of the wild
this is another title that if you did
not own a Wii U or you just never picked
this game up you need to check it out
these dynasty Warriors spin-offs that
are featuring other properties are so
much fun they're not exactly the most
complex games but if you just need a
great time killer where you can just mow
down tons of enemies playing as your
favorite characters from a franchise
Hyrule warriors is something you have to
check out then this brings us to Megaman
11 the series is finally coming back
after being dormant for way too long
and what Megaman 11 is planned to be a
multi-platform game it just feels right
having a son on a Nintendo system
considering 1 through 7 all found their
home back on the NES and Super Nintendo
there have been a lot of imitators the
past couple years have been trying to
revive that old-school Mega Man spirit
and while some of them have been real
good it's gonna be great to have a
proper core entry once again that's
bringing back a lot of that classic Mega
Man gameplay but something a little bit
new and different all at the same time
this is another game that we still don't
have and exactly stayed on just yet but
it should be arriving on multiple
systems in the fourth quarter of this
year next up is octa path traveler a new
RPG from the same team behind bravely
default which is this really interesting
looking mix of 2d graphics in a 3d plane
and a lot of classical style RPG combat
now what's really interesting about this
title though is the fact that there's
already a playable demo out for it that
screenings is used to gather information
from people about what kind of changes
they can make in fact they just released
a video responding to these surveys and
they're already giving us a glimpse at
some of the changes they're making to
make the game all the better so this
kind of feedback for a title that is
this kind of nostalgic love and this
really awesome art style in mind super
excited to see what the final product
looks like sometime in 2018 eighth up is
Travis strikes again no more heroes now
No More Heroes is a franchise that
originally made its debut on the Wii
where it was a very very strangely
vulgar and violent game to make its
debut on such a kid-friendly system like
the Wii and now with a switch with this
approach being friendly to both kids and
adults is the perfect time to bring this
series back now details are still very
skim about what exactly this new game is
going to play like but if it's anything
like its predecessors it's going to be a
3d action game with a focus on
lightsaber combat and extremely crude
humor the one and only trailer for the
game also hints there'll be crossover
gameplay elements from some other
violent indie titles such as hotline
Miami which is a perfect match made in
heaven if you've ever played both of
these series the point is is that this
is going to be an awesome game to keep
your eyes open for for sometime in 2018
next up is war groove now this is a
multi-platform game so it's coming to
PlayStation Xbox PC all that good stuff
but it feels really at home on the
switch because it's very very obviously
a homage to one of the best games on the
Game Boy Advance Advance Wars basically
the creator's took the core concepts of
Advance Wars filed off all the stuff
that would make it Nintendo trademark
put in a fan
updated with some modern stuff like
online multiplayer and the ability to do
your own map editing to create this
awesome turn-based strategy experience
that I am so so excited for plus it has
dog units which is really stupidly
adorable well we don't have a specific
release date to this one just yet you
can look forward to seeing war groove
sometime in the first quarter of 2018
then we have the World Ends With You
final remix now this was originally a DS
game that was absolutely insane to play
in the DS because the entire core
experience was based around controlling
two separate characters at the same time
with different control schemes using the
DSS dual screens now that's no longer
the case obviously because the switch
only has one screen so be offering a
different combat experience this time
around along with this revised combat
system and redone graphics this versions
also going to be featuring additional
story elements that were not in the
original DS version now this is a game
that you did not play before you should
not miss out this time around it is an
eccentric weird title very much unlike
anything you've probably played before
but it is so so good like most the games
on this list once again we still don't
have a hard release date just yet but it
is planned for sometime in 2018</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
