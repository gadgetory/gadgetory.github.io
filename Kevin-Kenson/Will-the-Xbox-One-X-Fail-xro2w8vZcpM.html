Xbox 1x what do you think about it is
the Xbox 1x still worth it ok so here's
the thing about games come for those of
you that may not have seen it basically
Microsoft's presentation was a highlight
reel of everything they did back at e3
it was a lot of the same trailers which
I loved their e3 presentation but when
it's a new convention months later and
you're showing the exact same stuff
not exactly the great sell in the world
now there was some new stuff but it was
a lot of niche titles or new 4k upgraded
versions of games that don't exactly
move systems like for instance
Disneyland Kinect just not the best sell
in the world and the big problem is the
fact that this is going on at the same
time as we get the announcement that
crackdown 3 one of the biggest Microsoft
exclusives for this holiday season has
now been pushed back to some unknown
date in spring of 2018
so that leaves really only one major
game for Microsoft this year the holiday
season and that's four to seven I mean
we have some indie games as well but
those are exactly huge arguments for why
you should buy a 4k super-powerful
system do I think this is going to
impact the hype and sales for it
honestly not really I think anyone
that's interested in the idea of a
super-powerful home console that's gonna
do 4k gaming for multi-platform titles
and what few Microsoft exclusives would
you have I think they're gonna buy it
still I mean 4k gaming is cool and all
but let's not kid ourselves the big star
of the show is that we have minecraft
themed controllers including a curlicue
tail on this big what Triple A games
would you like to see on switch now this
is kind of a weird one for you because
when I think about the kind of games
that are traditionally considered a big
triple-a titles I don't think about them
really working on the switch I mean it
used to be a weakness for Nintendo but I
think that's kind of a strength now
because the switch demands much more
unique experiences you know I don't
think of games like Call of Duty or Star
Wars Battlefront or assassin's creed
even Skyrim even though it's going to
the switch it just doesn't really make
sense to me I think you need to make
something a little more unique now if
we're talking about franchises I think
could have specific entries for the
switch it's probably inevitable but I
really want to see some final fantasy
stuff make its way to the switch
specifically you know I don't think
mainline stuff would really make sense
but if they did something where they
revived crystal chronicles where it's
this four player co-op experience thing
that is perfectly suited to the switch
and actually the more I think about it I
really want that screenings get on it
right now why do you wear a beanie
what beanie which games you
and for coming before year's end okay
well first off since we've already
talked about Xbox one big game I am
still hyped for a bunch is cuphead aside
from that I'm looking forward to
Wolfenstein to the new South Park game
finally coming out my biggest game is
probably Super Mario Odyssey and then
while it's not really a full game it's
just standalone DLC I am really excited
for Dishonored to death the outsider do
you think destiny 2 will be successful
despite it being fairly similar to the
original destiny look we have to have an
honest moment here when it comes to big
game releases in the gaming industry
right now a lot of them are very similar
to one another I mean it's practically
required with how many franchises have
yearly releases going on you just don't
have the time to do major reinventions
or huge changes yeah you'll get a big
shift here and there but there's tons of
games where three or four games in a row
are all basically the same thing
the only reason why destiny 2 is getting
extra flack for this right now is
because this is the first sequel of the
franchise and because destiny is kind of
an MMO so the first game got us used to
having expansion packs and the question
comes up well why can't we just keep
doing expansion packs instead of having
to do a whole new game but still it is a
new game yes there are a lot of things
in common it has the same classes it has
some of the same subclass types but
there are new ones there are new
missions new story a lot of it is still
brand new so I think some people are
going to complain about it either way
but ultimately destiny 2 is going to get
the sales that's going to get it either
way the only thing that can kind of hold
it back is if it's just as barren as the
first one at launch we don't have enough
content as long as there's content at
launch
I think destiny 2 is gonna do well which
retro system would you like to make a
comeback soon so that's obviously a big
thing going on right now I mean Insano
kick-started it with the NES classic
edition we have the SNES classic edition
coming out soon which is already sold
out everywhere despite not being
released yet and then there's stuff like
Sega's gonna do a better at games really
system of the Genesis Ataris doing
something a lot of people are hoping
we're going to get an n64 Classic next
year but honestly I kind of hope
Nintendo throws a bit of a curve ball
and instead focuses on their portable
systems with Nintendo
we had something that had games from the
Game Boy or even going up to the Game
Boy Color all the way to the Gameboy
Advance
I think that would be really cool not to
mention would kind of shake things up
because we'd have a portable system
instead something has to hook up to a TV
just I think it'd be a nice little
change</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
