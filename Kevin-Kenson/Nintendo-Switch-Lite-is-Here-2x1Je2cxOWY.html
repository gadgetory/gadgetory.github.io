- It finally happened,
this morning Nintendo
has officially unveiled
the Nintendo Switch Lite.
And, it actually lines up
with a lot of what we previously theorized
what exactly it would look like
and what separates it from the Switch.
Now, normally, when Nintendo has used
the moniker of lite, they're referring to
a smaller, trimmed down
version of the system
that's normally a full-blown
revision that just replaces it.
A good example of this would be the DS.
But, in the case of the Switch,
it's actually more of a side version,
it's something that's
an alternative option,
but there are still reasons to own
a regular Switch instead, if you prefer.
So, what makes the Nintendo
Switch Lite different?
Well, the first, big, obvious thing
is the fact that, like we thought before,
it is one, self-contained unit
that is overall smaller than
the size of a regular Switch.
It doesn't have removable Joy-Cons,
it doesn't have any kind
of parts that come off,
it is one solid unit that's
all together at the same time.
Now, based on the images and trailers
that Nintendo has put out,
a lot of the button placements and ports,
and all that kind of
stuff is in the same place
that they were on the regular Switch.
The major changes notable
is that the buttons on the
left side of the controls
are now an actual D-pad,
something that a lot
of people have wanted,
and so I'm really glad they
actually made that change
for the specific model.
And, they've also removed the kickstand
on the back of the Switch,
since tabletop mode doesn't
make a ton of sense for this,
and honestly, that's just the right call,
'cause the regular
kickstand is awful anyways.
Since this is a smaller system,
the screen size has also been reduced.
The regular Switch has a 6.2-inch screen,
while the Switch Lite is
going to have a 5.5-inch,
which is notably smaller,
but still large enough
for most games to still
look pretty clear and good.
Now, those are just the
obvious changes you can see
by looking at the system,
but there are a lot of
internal changes, as well,
a lot of which have to
do with the Joy-Cons,
or the lack thereof.
So, because the Joy-Cons are
now a part of the system,
a couple of features have been removed.
You don't have the IR sensor
anymore, which is a loss.
The bigger thing for me, though,
is there is no HD rumble in these.
Which, honestly, I think really changes
a lot of the experience for some games.
I think a lot of the games
really rely on HD rumble
even in handheld mode, and
so, not having it at all,
I'm a little sad to see it go.
I kinda get it, but I
wish it was still there.
It's worth noting that one
feature that is still intact
in the Joy-Cons, however,
is there still a NFC reader.
So, if you like using
amiibo for certain games,
you're not gonna lose that functionality.
Now, ever since people have theorized
about some kind of new Switch revision
and whether or not it was
going to be a Lite or Mini,
or whatever you want to call it,
one of the big questions was,
&quot;Is it going to support dock mode?&quot;
And, the answer we now officially have
is no, it will not.
The Switch Lite is
purely a handheld system.
It is designed to play games
in handheld mode, nothing more.
You cannot connect it to a
TV, it does come with a dock.
There is no support for that whatsoever.
So, the main goal here, really,
is to make a purely
portable-focused system.
Look, obviously, the main
goal of the Switch Lite
is to make it a cheaper,
more affordable Switch
that's aiming mainly at kids,
and part of the way
Nintendo can achieve that
is that making the system
cheaper to produce.
So, one of the easiest ways to do this
is to make it a weaker system.
So, compared to a regular Switch,
the Switch Mini is going to have
less-powerful tech inside of it
that allows to achieve the
same kind of performance
it has in handheld mode,
which is normally a handicapped setting
on the regular Switch,
but it won't be capable
of the same level of power
that allowed for the dock mode,
which gave us things
like 1080p resolution,
faster frame rates for some
games, so on and so forth.
And, I know, there are a lot of people
that really wanted a more
powerful version sooner,
which is something that
Nintendo is still hinting at.
A Switch Pro is something
in the farther future,
but really, a Switch Lite
makes a lot of sense.
The Switch has been
selling extremely well,
and one additional market
that Nintendo can try
to get that extra boost
in sales in, is kids.
There are a lot of parents out there
that don't necessarily dish
out $300 for one system.
If they have multiple kids,
there is the issue of,
&quot;Well, do I need to buy
a system for each one?
&quot;Are they going to fight over it?
&quot;Sure, they can play in docked,
but one's going to be angry
&quot;when it's in handheld mode.&quot;
It's all a mess.
So, when you have something
like the Switch Lite
that is smaller and cheaper,
it's a lot easier to buy multiple of them.
And, there's more that plays
into this concept, as well.
Because it is one singular system,
it doesn't have things
like removable Joy-Cons,
the system is presumably a lot sturdier
than the regular Switch is,
and based on reports
from some news outlets
that have gotten early Switches,
that appears to be the case.
There's also the fact that,
unlike the regular Switch,
which just comes in a
single plain black option,
this one's being marketed a lot more like
their DS line of systems,
where there are multiple
colors right away.
We have three confirmed at launch,
which is going to be
yellow, gray, and turquoise.
And, there's already a special edition
confirmed for coming out later,
which is Pokemon-themed one.
I gotta admit, personally
I'm not a huge fan
of the set of color choices.
I think, individually,
a lot of them are cool,
I just think that there's just maybe one
or two other options missing.
They went for a heavy pastel push,
which the gray kinda stands out
like a sore thumb in that case.
I'm really surprised, honestly,
they didn't go for a red design,
since that is basically the color
that Nintendo's been
really heavily pushing
as the one associated with their brand.
It's also being reported right now
that the Switch Lite is going
to have better battery life
than the regular Switch.
We don't really have any
super hard numbers just yet,
but thanks to more
efficient internal specs,
a lot of people are saying
it's somewhere around
20 to 30 percent longer battery life
than what you would normally
get on a regular Switch.
All this together shapes
up for what I think
is honestly a really cool,
affordable spin-off version
of the Switch, one that
is not only going to be
a good option for people
to buy for first timers
that want to save some money,
but might even be something
that's tempting to people
that already own Switches
that like the idea of having multiple.
There's an interesting concept here
of using the original Switch
as a dock-dedicated version
when you want to do things
like local multiplayer,
or you want to play games in dock mode,
for those better visuals,
but have a Switch Lite on the go,
and while there hasn't been
any official news just yet,
Doug Bowser has made the statement
that they are working on something
that's going to allow for the
seamless switching of games
between a regular Switch and a Switch Lite
for those people that
want to use both systems.
On that note, there is one
aspect of the Switch Lite
that's a little unclear to me right now,
and that's whether or not
you can do local multiplayer
on the Switch Lite screen itself,
because Nintendo has mentioned
that you are able to use
wireless controllers,
that you can connect
Joy-Cons and pro controllers,
and all that kind of stuff
to the Switch Lite still,
so that way, you can do things
like motion control for certain games,
but, at the same time,
it's not really clear if,
in this smaller, handheld version,
you're going to be able to do things like,
say, play Smash Bros in handheld
mode, and have someone else
with a wireless controller
play at the same time.
There's not really any
reason why it can't do that,
other than it's not really
the most efficient way
to do the situation,
but it would still be
a nice feature to have.
While I know it's not the exact revision
that a lot of people are hoping for.
I'm honestly super excited
of the idea of a Lite.
I really like the idea of using that
as my main portable handheld.
As I've said many times before,
I primarily use my Switch as a handheld,
so one that's a little
more dedicated to that
and more portable, I am
really excited to try out.
But, it also raises some questions
about what exactly the
Switch Pro could be.
Now that we know for sure
what the Switch Lite is,
that can better inform our theories
on what a Switch Pro could be,
and I think there's two
main ways it could go,
since the Switch Lite is
a cheaper, affordable,
alternative version of the Switch,
and not a full-blown
revision or replacement.
One, the Switch Pro could be a revision
or replacement of the regular Switch,
offering maybe a higher quality screen,
maybe upping it to 1080,
better battery life,
more power in general.
Maybe even offering higher-quality
graphics when docked,
like going all the way up to 4K.
On the other hand,
and this is getting a little
weirder and it's something
I don't necessarily think
Nintendo would really do,
but I think it's worth talking about,
and it's the possibility of
whether or not a Switch Pro
is going the same route as the
Switch Lite, in the sense of,
the Switch Lite isn't really a Switch,
in the sense that it
doesn't do the ability
to Switch between two modes.
It's purely a handheld system.
So, what if, in that same vein,
the Switch Pro is purely a docked system?
Really, think about it,
because I know that sounds
really awkward at first,
because they're all called the Switch,
and at that point, none
of them would switch
other than the base system, but
if they are working on a way
to easily switch game
experiences between units,
like Bowser's talking about,
like using an OG Switch dock
with the Switch Lite on the go,
it stands to reason the idea
they could have, as well,
is having a super-powerful Switch Pro unit
that is purely a docked TV
console, that way it's cheaper,
they don't have to worry about screens.
They can just make a powerhouse
system that plugs into a TV,
and then, if you own a Switch Lite,
you can switch experiences
between the two however you like,
or even use an OG Switch
still, if you have one.
Is this effectively retreading the ground
that PlayStation was trying to
do with the PSP and the PS4?
Yeah, kind of, sure,
but it would be a much
better way of doing it,
and something that would
offer a seamless experience.
Now, again, I don't think this
is necessarily the way
Nintendo's going to go,
but I think it's a pretty valid theory.
Of course, it's also possible
that if the Switch Pro
is still a traditional Switch design,
it might not be a complete replacement
of the regular system.
It could be something, again,
that is more expensive,
and offers more powerful docked options,
but that seems less compelling to me.
I want something that's going
to be a full-blown replacement
of the regular system,
or something that's entirely different.
Either way, this has all just
made me even more excited
for the Nintendo Switch's future,
and I cannot wait to grab the Lite
when it comes out this
fall on September 20th.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
