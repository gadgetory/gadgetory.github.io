you part two of my e3 press conference
response videos and this time we're
talking about Ubisoft and Sony so to
begin with ubisoft's press conference
felt a lot like the shortest out of the
four we've seen so far was actually the
same length as EAS but there were fewer
games covered with more time spent on
each one and I have to say that while
the conference did have its ups and
downs for me Ubisoft really knows how to
kick off and end a press conference it
started with the first five minutes a
far cry 4 gameplay which looked really
good it introduced the setting and the
new villain which didn't feel as amazing
to me as Voss was in Far Cry 3 but still
really interesting and then they ended
the show with the surprise announcement
of Rainbow six siege which showed actual
gameplay over a bunch of players just
basically destroyed a house with some
really amazing destructible environments
everything in between those two though
was a little bit of hit and miss for me
we ended up having a nice little dance
segments thanks to just dance 2015 and
the announcement of a mobile game just
dance now as well as a fitness
competition thanks to a new game from
them called shape up which I have to
admit while I'm not a big fan of fitness
games and I'm probably never going to
pick this game up it does the cliq
Ubisoft finally found a good balance
between having a game that wasn't just
fitness but also had fun mini game video
game style aspects to it we also got
some really really beautiful trailers
for Assassin's Creed unity the division
and the crew which really didn't give us
that much more info about the actual
games but does prove that Ubisoft really
knows how to make a pretty trailer now
there was some additional time spent on
Assassin's Creed unity where we did see
some actual gameplay but it was really
kind of weird because they started off
by talking about all the new co-op
features and how that was going to be a
new central part of unity but then all
the gameplay they showed was just single
player now to be fair they did show
co-op gameplay of Assassin's Creed
during microsoft's press conference but
it just felt really were to talk about
it now and then not show it now after
all those other games there's only one
more left to touch on which was
particularly really beautiful and
touching and I'm really excited for it's
actually coming out at the end of this
month valiant hearts which basically
tells the story of a world war one style
era all told through the eyes of a dog
that travels with a number of unsung
heroes which is what I'm really looking
forward to trying out later this month
so overall kind of a hit in miss
conference there were some really good
high points a few awkward lows but
overall pretty solid now as for Sony I
have to say that that was one of the
most bizarrely paste
press conferences I've seen in a long
time there was a lot of good information
and some great announcements in it but
as peppered throughout a lot of really
weird sticks a few other announcements
that we're interesting but we're really
glanced over very quickly and just the
whole presentation felt really awkward
to me now as far as games go we got a
really good mix of multi-platform and
exclusive titles as well as some we
already know about and some brand new
announcements as well as far as
multi-platform games go we got brand new
trailers for destiny and metal gear
solid 5 the phantom pain we also finally
got to see some gameplay for batman
arkham knight which looked amazing we
got the announcement that GTA 5 is
coming to ps4 and by extension PC we got
to see actual gameplay from Mortal
Kombat X which I'm really excited for
and we had another gameplay segment for
far cry 4 because Ubisoft just can't
keep its hands off of everyone else's
press conferences now as far as more ps4
exclusive things go we got a new trailer
with just a touch of gameplay for the
order 1886 we got the official
announcement of the new soul style from
software game called blood-borne which I
was really happy to find out about we
also got to see a live demo of Little
Big Planet 3 which features new
characters with unique abilities
including a really overpowered looking
bird that just flies through most of the
stages and on top of all that we got one
surprise new announcement of a really
interesting looking indie title from a
small studio called no man's sky which
is one of the most beautiful looking
space Sims I have ever seen now
alongside these there were a lot more
montages and a lot more games announced
for ps4 that were really glanced over
very quickly just to name a few of the
top ones that really stood out to me
we're getting a full remake of grim
fandango magic a two for ps4 a new
really gory looking game from suda51
called let it die and an underwater
style game that looks very reminiscent
of journey called ABS ooh there was also
a really big focus talking about games
that we already knew about or are coming
out soon that are multi-platform but are
getting exclusive content just for Sony
including destiny Disney infinity to a
special dungeon for diablo 3 based on
the last of us an exclusive console beta
for battlefield hardline outside of
games we got a bunch of different
announcements for different pieces of
media software and hardware the biggest
too though were the official
announcement of the PlayStation now beta
for ps4 starting on July thirty-first
and the fact that PlayStation TV is now
coming to the US honestly there was just
a lot of stuff that was covered at the
sony press conference I've touched on
most of it but there was just
many things that were quickly glanced
over that just made the whole conference
feel like it took entirely too long and
really awkward but thankfully they did
find a way to end it on a very strong
note one that we did see coming but
nonetheless were all very much excited
for a new trailer for uncharted 4 which
did give it its full title a thief's end
so overall there was some really good
game announcements to come out of the
sony press conference I just really
didn't like the way the conference
itself was handled but I was really
happy to get the info i got especially
for games like blood-borne mortal kombat
x batman arkham knight uncharted 4 and
the biggest prize for me no man's sky so
those just a quick recap and my thoughts
on what we saw for the sony and ubisoft
