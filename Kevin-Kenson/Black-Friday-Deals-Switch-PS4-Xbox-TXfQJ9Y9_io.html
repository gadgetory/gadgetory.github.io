than a week again a lot of you guys are
gonna be looking at ways of getting new
systems new games all that stuff you
want and sadly when it comes to gaming a
lot of products end up having the same
sales everywhere you look at least as
far as major retailers goes but there
are some exceptions so let's go over the
best places to grab an Xbox a
Playstation or your switch stuff to
begin with let's talk about Xbox
now obviously the Xbox one X just came
out but as a result you're not gonna see
that go on sale anymore crazies just yet
but if you're looking for a 1s still
there's a lot of options out there now
the main deal you're gonna see at most
places is they're gonna offer a 500
gigabyte Xbox one s4 189 but there's a
couple places that are going a little
bit of the extra mile with that as for
the Microsoft Store you're still paying
that $189 but on top of the system
you're also gonna get a free Ubisoft
game your choice which it's not any of
the huge recent big hits but there are
some solid choices like Assassin's Creed
the Ezio collection or watchdogs 2 and
you get a free month of Xbox game pass
on top of that now while we're on the
subject of Xbox there are a couple of
the deals to keep your eyes open for
most stores are gonna be doing 20 bucks
off of Xbox one controllers but the
Microsoft Store has another option where
you can do a design lab controller for
15 bucks off so it still comes out to
being a little more than a brand new
controller but in this case it's your
own customized one with whatever colors
you want and then probably one of the
weirdest deals to come out of this Black
Friday out of Game Stop is if you pick
up an original Xbox 360 that's the white
one that had the fun troubles with red
ringing you'll also get a $60 rebate
meaning that it's actually entirely free
as long as you remember to do the rebate
next let's talk PlayStation there's
actually not a ton of places that are
advertising deals for the ps4 Pro the
only big one I've seen is game stops
gonna be selling it for 50 bucks off
however if you're in the market for a
ps4 slim with a one terabyte hard drive
there's quite a few more options most
places are doing a hundred bucks off so
you can get one for 200 bucks but if you
go to Game Stop you're gonna get that
same deal but on top of that you get a
$50 gift card to the store as well so if
you're planning a picking one up that's
gonna be the best choice for you now
aside from that as far as other
PlayStation stuff goes there's a lot of
very similar deals across a lot of
different retailers you're gonna be able
to get some big games from this year
like horizon zero dawn for only 20 bucks
you get a DualShock controller for 20
bucks off so it's only 40 and if you're
still interested in psvr
they're gonna do a bundle with that and
GranTurismo for only 300 and then that
brings us to the switch
sadly kind of not sadly the switch has
been selling very very good this year
and as a result just finding one stock
is a really cool thing so no one's
really doing any major sales on the
switch itself or any major accessories
like the joy cons but there are some
switch related sales that's worth
keeping an eye out for now for games a
lot of the smaller ones like one to
switch Rayman legends Bomberman you're
gonna find some sales for those at a lot
of retailers but when it comes to the
big hits like Zelda and Mario most
places are doing full price but there's
a couple special ones worth looking out
for in particular Walmart is gonna be
doing breath of the wild for only 50
bucks 10 bucks off and that is the
explorers Edition that comes with a
little guide book as well meanwhile at
Best Buy you can get Super Mario Odyssey
still at full price but you do get a
little commemorative coin provided they
have enough stock for everyone that
picks it up now as for accessories like
I said stuff like the joy cons there's
not really any major deals popping up
but there are some other related ones
you can look up the best deal though
looks like it's coming out of Game Stop
where you can get an upgrade kit for 50
bucks which has a lot of useful stuff in
it aside from the switch there is one
other Nintendo deal I want to talk about
but it's a little weird does not
actually a deal it's just a special
they're doing they're gonna have a
special edition 2d s original 2d s based
on The Legend of Zelda it's going to be
a green design that comes pre-installed
with a copy of Ocarina of Time this is
no cheaper than getting an original 2d s
otherwise right now but it is a limited
edition design for those of you that
want to get something a little special
so those are all the best deals we can
find right now with all the ads to come
out early I'm sure more information is
gonna come up as the week goes by and
the day of there's probably going to be
some surprises so make sure to keep your
eyes out I'll tweet out any awesome
deals I find during the day and I'll see
you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
