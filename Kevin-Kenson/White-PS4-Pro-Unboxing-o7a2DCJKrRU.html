more importantly for this video ps4
because not only is the game come out
but alongside it is this special limited
edition white ps4 pro that comes bundled
with the game now it's worth noting that
until now the ps4 Pro is only come in
the standard black so this is the first
and currently only other new color that
you can get the system in so you've been
looking for something different this is
gonna be your option right now so let's
open up and see what it looks like in
person user guide don't need that I've
opened enough of these by now alright
now this is the exact same controller
that comes with the white ps4 slim I
mean it is a wide DualShock you got the
slightly different darker white on the
back side right or white on the front
and these are the newer line of ps4
double shocks so it does have that
little light bar line here and does last
longer than the older people shop white
and a copy of destiny 2 they just fell
out of the box
oops so this is definitely the same
color as the white ps4 slim which they
call a sure white where it's making use
of that black accents in the middle
which I really actually like on the ps4
Pro I've talked about before how I
really am NOT a huge fan of how the pros
look I mean I think that the slim just
looks better when it's just a little
smaller and it's more compact system but
the wily helps to kind of tone down the
size of it you know I think something
about having the contrasting white and
black just ends up making a better
looking system one thing I do really
like about this thing looking at it
though that is different from the
glacier white ps4 slim is the logo
something that bothered me on the
glacier IPS force limit is that the logo
on it was this kind of frosted design
that didn't really stand out very much
who played into the whole idea of being
glacier you know ice this one the other
hand is using the reflective logo which
they've used on the gold and silver PS
wars and stands out way more as a
contrast to the white on the system well
let's go ahead and set this thing up put
in Disney 2 and check it out
now as I said earlier the only way to
get this special white ps4 Pro right now
is in a bundle with destiny - but you're
not just getting destiny - you're
getting a whole bunch of bonus content
for the game as well it is the premium
edition of the game so you're gonna get
a legendary amout a special emblem and a
legendary sword that you'll unlock at
level 20 you also get the pre-order
bonus which is the exotic cold hard gun
another weapon you have to wait - level
20 to get and includes the expansion
pass for the game which covers two
upcoming pieces of DLC
we don't actually know what the DLC is
gonna entail exactly yet I mean it's
gonna be the usual bit of more weapons
more story missions so and so forth but
the specifics we don't know yet but hey
you're gonna get them if you pick up
this bundle so there we have it the
white ps4 pro destiny - bundle you know
I gotta say as far as ps4 models go I
really like this one I think the white
is a solid upgrade over the black if
only for the fact that it offers that
contrast that I am such a sucker for but
I even think it's an upgrade over the
glacier white ps4 slim just because as
small of a reason as I think they did a
better job with the logo awesome design
let me do this thing in the comments
below and I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
