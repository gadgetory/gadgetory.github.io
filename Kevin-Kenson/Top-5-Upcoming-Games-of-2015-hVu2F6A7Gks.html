favorite games of 2015 so far so to
follow up on that I want to show you
guys the five games I'm the most excited
for that have yet to release now these
aren't the five objectively best games
coming out I'm not saying these the most
hyped up these are the five that I'm
personally looking forward to the most
now if you haven't caught on by now I'm
a huge RPG nerd and that's exactly what
a lot of the games on this list are the
first of which is probably one of most
obvious games to go on it and that's
fallout 4 if you've played any bethesda
game that came out in the past two
decades you know exactly what we're
looking for in this game a large open
world in depth character customization
and tons and tons and tons of content
what makes fallout 4 even more exciting
though is that it looks to offer the
most amount of customization we've ever
seen you not only have a ton of control
over how you customize weapons armor and
even your own personal power armor set
but you can now also construct your own
home base from wreckage you find in the
post-apocalyptic landscape and build up
defenses for it personally I'm not a
huge fan of the move to a voiced main
character but looking at all the other
stuff this game has to offer from
gameplay demos i'm pretty sure i can
overlook this one pet peeve now going
from one wespro RPG we have a pair of
Japanese RPGs starting with persona 5
now I'm a longtime fan of the shin
megami tensei series and one of the
things I really like about the later
persona games is they do a very good job
bridging the sort of dark philosophical
roots that the overall franchise has but
also making it a little more
lighthearted and episodic and feel and
almost a little more slice of life so it
balances out and makes it a much more
accessible game five is doing things
even more differently though from three
and four because whereas those ones had
kind of a detective vibe going on this
time around at your cat burglars now how
much this affects the storyline or the
actual gameplay we don't know yet
because details have actually been very
skimmed atlas has been very adamant
about the fact that the game is coming
out this year but we haven't gotten any
full details just yet however TGS is
ongoing right now so we should get those
details hopefully very soon third up and
the other JRPG on this list is Xenoblade
Chronicles X now if there's one thing I
love more than a fantasy RPG it's a
fantasy RPG with big-ass robots that let
me blow
shut up and that's exactly what this
game offers the original Xenoblade
Chronicles was a great RPG on the wii in
fact it was for the best one on the
system but it did have its problems it
suffered from a lot of grinding and a
ton of fetch quest which if that's fixed
in X could make it a huge surprise hit
for this holiday season in fact it's
already been out in Japan since this
past April where it's been doing
extremely well and receiving a ton of
critical praise at number four we have
below now this is a game I've been
waiting on for quite some time because
it was one of the titles that was first
teased when the xbox one was announced
and we've only really gotten trickles of
info here in there since in fact the
last date you were given was 2015 but
that was quite some time ago so it might
even be pushed back to early next year
but I want to believe will get it soon
I've been a big fan of other games
released by capybara and looking at the
gameplay demos and previews for this
game it just looks like it's gonna be a
ton of fun having roguelike elements
fast paced and deadly combat in just a
huge dungeon area to explore with
fantastic visuals like I said the
release date on this one isn't solid yet
it might get pushed back but here's
hoping it keeps that 2015 date now last
but definitely not least is probably one
of the most hyped up games on this list
and that star wars battlefront which I
am really excited about but it's also
probably the one title on this list that
I'm the most cautious of see I'm really
excited for it because I am a huge fan
of the star wars franchise and while the
FPS genre has never been my number one
favorite I've always enjoyed the ones
that have a sci-fi twist on top of that
some of my favorite games growing up
where the x-wing vs. TIE fighter games
on PC and Rogue Squadron on the n64 so
I've been waiting for a game to bring
back dogfights from the Star Wars
universe at the same time though the
thing is I really haven't cared for a
lot of dice releases these past couple
years both battlefield 3 in battlefield
4 were fun but not really the best games
and there's a lot of work that could be
done on both of them and while this new
battlefront is trying to emulate the
feeling of the original ones that
doesn't mean it's going to actually
properly execute it all the previews
have looked great but that doesn't
always mean the final product will
control as well or run as well as we're
all hoping so I am excited for this one
it's just that I'm very cautiously
optimistic about it well those are the
five games that I'm personally
most excited about this holiday season
there are a whole lot of other big
titles coming up that I'm also looking
forward to and once the released might
even end up over taking some of these
including the likes of halo 5 and tomb
raider which ones end up being for sure
my top five games of 2015 you'll just
have to find out at the end of the year
one they all come out as always if you
