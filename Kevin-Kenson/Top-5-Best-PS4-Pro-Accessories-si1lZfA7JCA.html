slip and now you're looking for some
great accessories to outfit it with well
I've got a list for you of some
essential ps4 accessories to help
perfect your setup first up one of the
big necessities every multiplayer fan is
going to need to grab a headset and for
ps4 the best way to get the most for
your dollar is to stick with the
official Sony headset now this one here
is the Sony Gold wireless headset which
is a nice mid-range option there's a
silver option that's wired if you want
to go maximum cheap and a platinum
edition if you want to go all-out but to
get quality audio with a wireless set-up
all for under a hundred bucks the gold
is perfect it's the right balance of
simple but still good-looking with that
sleek black and blue coloring but even
more importantly it's super comfy making
it not a problem to play online for
hours on end or just play something late
into the night
without making a ton of noise for
everyone else around you the headset
market is frustratingly dense but
thankfully Sony's own option is an
excellent one for those of you that want
to keep things simple second up is the
Ortz ps4 power bank one of the ps4 s
biggest weaknesses is its controller's
abysmal battery life dying in a single
long session of gameplay even if you
started off with a full charge sure you
can buy a better battery and open up
your controller to switch it out
but a simpler option for those you that
don't want to deal with that is this
external battery pack it's easy to
attach doesn't really affect your
comfort and doubles the battery life of
your controller and you can still charge
it the same way never having to deal
with any kind of separate charging
station or wall plug in nothing is more
annoying than joining a long gaming
session on the weekend only to get
interrupted by your controller yelling
at you in dying mid game and this thing
is going to save you from that now next
up we have the PlayStation TV this is
something that I'm really surprised a
lot more people haven't jumped onto yet
especially considering how many price
drops a tad basically the PlayStation TV
is a super cheap Vita that hooks up to
your television allowing you to play
Vita games or PlayStation classics on a
handy little black box and it'll sync up
to your ps4 controller that alone is
pretty awesome for the price but what
makes this thing a great companion to
your ps4 is that you can stream ps4
games to it so
if you want to have multiple TVs in your
place that can play ps4 on without
having to buy a whole nother system or
move the one you have around constantly
this is an elegant and pretty affordable
solution fourth we've got one of my
personal biggest must-haves for any
system a carrying case and for ps4 there
is a great officially licensed Sony
option from RDS industries now this case
was designed for the original ps4 they
haven't made one specifically for the
slim yet but they really don't need to
despite being smaller it still fits nice
and snug into the bag so it's not going
to shift or move around a lot and since
it's thinner it's easier to fill the
other pocket with everything else you
want to carry around like all the cables
you need a controller or even some games
anyone who finds themselves on the go a
lot with their system constantly moving
from one place to another will find this
to be an absolute must-have for number
five we're upping the price tag a teeny
tiny bit okay maybe multiplying by ten
but seriously the PS VR is really
freaking cool while not offering as high
of a resolution as some other dedicated
gaming VR headsets out there the ps4
looks good enough to still accomplish
the most important thing to make vr
gaming fun immersion and more
importantly it's easily the most
comfortable gaming VR headset out right
now thanks to a solid frame with an
adjustable headband and design that puts
most of the weight and pressure against
your forehead rather than the bridge of
your nose despite being out for only a
little while there's already a lot of
games on it some of which do definitely
border more on being expensive tech
demos but there's a lot of surprisingly
really good psvr exclusive games like
rigs and until dawn rush or blood as
well as games the VR compatible mode
like res infinite and thumper and that's
just what we have right now there's a
lot more great games on the horizon like
Farpoint and Resident Evil 7 it ain't
exactly cheap but compared to other VR
options out there this is by far the
most affordable and accessible and
thankfully a ton of fun now last up I do
have one bonus item for you guys and
that's the ps4 vertical stand it's a
stand
you can put your system vertically with
it you get the idea</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
