year is the possibility of Nintendo
releasing some new kind of switch now
when we talked about this before it's
mostly been the idea that maybe they're
working on some kind of switch Pro with
better graphics better battery life
something that's just all-in-all more
powerful but a lot of rumors lately and
something a lot of people been
discussing is that it actually looks
like Nintendo might be working on
something that's in the opposite
direction a cheaper more affordable
switch mini now before we get to whether
or not this is a good idea let's break
down what exactly a switch mini would
entail and I think the leading logic we
need to use here is that Nintendo would
want to make something that is more
affordable now of course making a
smaller switch also just make something
that's more portable but don't think
that's really the lead goal I think the
lead idea is to make something that's
going to be lower in price tag for a lot
of people because I think a big sales
strengthen in Tendo has it in the past
is making affordable system options like
the DS line and even the original Wii so
what would it take to make a cheaper
switch something that's maybe in the 150
to 180 dollar region well of course
making the smaller strives results in a
smaller screen but I think they're all
supposed to be the focus in the idea of
making something that is overall weaker
than a switch now I don't mean that they
should make a system that is weaker not
going to run games as well but instead
they make a system that is only able to
run games as we know them in portable
mode there's a lot of power the switch
isn't using when it's portable and it
saves for when it's in dock mode so if
they want to make a dedicated smaller
handheld version certainly a way to cut
down on cost is make something that's
just strong enough to run what we
normally see in portable mode another
big change would of course be moving
away from traditional wireless droid
cons but instead just have traditional
controls be part of the overall unit now
of course you could still use other joy
columns with this conceptual system if
you bought some other ones or you
already had a switch you could still use
them with it but there were just already
be once attached to the system that
you're not having to pay extra to get
wireless functionality or and that kind
of stuff now the upside of this is once
again makes it cheaper and it could
afford them certain choices they can't
get away with on joy cons like having a
d-pad on this side the downside is if
you don't end up buying any other droid
cons or anything you do limit some of
the control options in certain games a
lot of them
do rely on some motion controls it will
also make sense for some like being able
to aim a weapon using the tilting
function on those system itself any game
that requires more nuanced motion
controls just wouldn't really work here
these two major possible changes open up
a lot of questions about what other kind
of features could be added or removed
from the system for instance like I said
if the droid clones are permanently
attached why not have a d-pad and if
it's designed to be a smaller portable
system it might be designed only for
handheld mode in mind and therefore
might not even have a kickstand which
I'm kind of okay with the most
interesting question though is what
happens to the switches main feature its
namesake the fact that it switches
between portable and TV modes because so
far while talking about this possible
switch meaning we've really been
thinking about in terms of just being a
dedicated handheld but does it actually
have to remove the ability to connect to
a TV I mean obviously there would be
certain limitations but the necessarily
mean has to have the feature removed
entirely you know the couple problems it
could have are pretty obvious first off
if it is a smaller switch in design it
probably wouldn't be able to fit in
current Nintendo switch docks after all
if it's a smaller design everything's
gonna be brought more in the sticks and
buttons are gonna get in the way of
course they could maybe just have a
giant gap between the screen and
controls but then that would just look
bizarre and maybe not the best idea the
other issue is once again if they weak
in the system the word only really
supports the quality and performance
level that we see in handheld mode it's
not gonna actually give us that TV mode
performance which depending on the game
is either not that big of a deal or
absolutely awful the obvious issue there
of course is that we're not going to get
a very good resolution on a big-screen
TV if you're taking something that is
720 and just upscaling it to a modern
television it doesn't always look very
pretty and not even all games achieve
720p resolution when in portable mode on
the switch titles like xenoblade
particles to would just look honestly
terrible and this is a problem we've
seen other companies experiment with for
instance when PlayStation was messing
around with the PS Vita one of the
products that released was the
PlayStation TV a very small console that
would allow you to play your Vita games
on a television at the exact same video
quality though and you're seeing these
games that look great on a Vita screen
all of a sudden upscale
large screen TV and it just doesn't
translate at all and in the case of the
switch resolution isn't the only problem
there are some games that also just run
at a worse framerate when in handheld
mode and so if you're getting both at
reduced resolution and worse framerate
on a big-screen TV it kind of hurts at
the same time though is it really the
switch if it can't switch at all I mean
is the name switch mini even appropriate
should Nintendo come up with something
else including such golden titles that
have been suggested by people around
here at the office as the stuck because
it's only in portable mode or the new
Nintendo DS doesn't switch and then
there's another possible issue with a
switch mini that I think Nintendo needs
to figure out which is how they handle
their account management now for a lot
of people you're obviously either going
to stick with your regular switch or
maybe you picked the switch mini because
you've been waiting for something that's
a cheaper alternative or maybe you're
getting it for a kid or something but
there's going to be that small
percentage of people who I think would
be interested in the idea of owning a
regular switch they keep docked and used
as a home TV console and then maybe buy
switch mini to have a more portable
option when they're on the go
the thing is with how Nintendo handles a
cancel switch is right now you run into
some problems when you do that see
currently you can attach a single new to
no account to multiple switches but only
one switch can be the primary switch
which opens up certain limitations on
the other switches namely if you want to
play a game that you own digitally you
have to be connect to the Internet
initially to be able to make sure that
yes you own this game you can use it and
in the case of something you want to
share with family members only the
primary account will allow other users
to play games that you own digitally so
in the potential situation that you own
both a regular switch you use at home
and you switch mini that you use on the
go which of those would you actually
want to have be the primary account
because in the case of having it on the
home TV great other people can use it
and they can play whatever games you own
digitally but in the case of the one you
have on handheld you can't actually play
any other digital games if there's no
internet which kind of defeats the
purpose of a portable system on the
other hand if you have it be your
primary account on the portable one well
now only you can actually play games on
your home switch unless other people are
buying their own games separately but
hey you're
at least has all your games now there's
also the issue of how fluid would be
constantly switching between these two
systems because if you want to make use
of Nintendo's which cloud saves way you
have to be a Nintendo switch online
member which makes sense but then
there's also the issue of how those
saves are handled so you can have it
automatically backup your saves on your
primary account but on any other account
you need to download or upload the saves
manually so every single time you want
to go from one switch to another you
need to make sure you're on the right
save file you have to back it up if you
haven't already you might have to
download it it just ends up throwing the
rental thing it's kind of a similar
issue that Sony has with PlayStation 4s
but obviously you're not constantly
switching between them because it's like
different home units in this case it's
actually on the go or at home despite
these issues that I think Nintendo is
going to need to address if this
Nintendo switch Mini is real I do think
the concept is a really really good idea
and it's something that makes a lot of
sense for a Nintendo now don't get me
wrong a switch Pro also sounds really
cool and that is something that I would
make use of but at the end of the day I
don't think that's the right call for
Nintendo as far as actually tapping into
a larger audience yes the switch has
already been selling well and I'm sure
there are those people out there that
are saying I don't want to buy one yet
until they make one that supports 4k or
has smaller bezels or better battery
life whatever yes all valid things that
I think there are people out there that
want but ultimately would result in a
more expensive to produce system for a
smaller number of people out there I
think something that Nintendo is more
interested in trying to recapture is
kids sure the switch has probably
already sold to a lot of different
families but in a lot of cases is
probably being treated as something
that's used for the whole family people
need to take turns it's something that's
mainly just used on the TV so on so
forth as opposed to something like the
DS where for a hundred twenty bucks
here's a small cheaper personal handheld
that one kid can have and so if they
made a smaller affordable switch that
was sitting in that same price range
that opens up a lot of potential sales
they currently are not seen it also
allows Nintendo to do things with a
cheaper system that they are doing with
a switch currently for instance color
variety the Nintendo switch has a lot of
different joy Kong color options and
they do have different bundles for that
but as far as the main switch body
itself goes it is a basic plain black
system even with special edition systems
it's primarily just a black main body
where it's the switch mini could tap
into stuff they've traditionally done
with the Game Boy in da sign where we
see a whole bunch of different colors I
mean imagine if all the joy come colors
we have right now turned into full
handheld systems that'd be really cool
whether or not any of this is true we
honestly don't know it's been a lot of
rumors but Nintendo has been very very
tight-lipped on it and it's kind of
given the standard responsive like we
have nothing to talk about regarding
anything we're releasing this year
now it's very possible that they just
have no new system this year at all and
we've all just been grasping at a bunch
of straws but if they do have a new
system in the works
I think of mini is much more likely than
a pro</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
