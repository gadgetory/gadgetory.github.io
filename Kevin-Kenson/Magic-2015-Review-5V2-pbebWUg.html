bringing guys a review of a game whose
genre I've never really covered before
on this channel but it is a series that
have kept up with over the years and
that's the latest iteration of the Magic
the Gathering video game magic 2015
Duels of the Planeswalkers now this is
the fifth game in the dual series and
for those of you that are unfamiliar
with it it's basically taking the Magic
the Gathering card game and trying to
make a slightly more simplified version
of it for a video game forum
now all the prior games in this series
took out the issue of deck building for
the most part players just got to choose
between varies pre-built decks and as
they used them they could get additional
cards to lightly customize them but the
idea was was that each deck maintained
its own unique flavor and play style
this really helps it feel to be like
something a little different from just
regularly playing magic there was this
fun meta game going on with which deck
you pick whether or not it counters what
your opponent chose and if you're
playing in a 2v2 match trying to pick
pre-built decks that complement each
other really well well magic 2015 has
chosen to do things a little differently
this time and has done away with this
mechanic but it's instead treating this
like playing just regular Magic the
Gathering but with a very isolated set
of cards to choose from you start the
game off by choosing one of ten decks
which are really just five different
half decks put together in each way
possible with just a couple little
variations and then you have to grind
your way through the game's campaign to
unlock more cards to further customize
your deck or build entirely new ones
this approach comes with both its ups
and downs it's more different than it is
straight up good or bad
on the one hand you have more freedom to
customize and build your own deck which
adds another layer of complexity to the
gameplay but at the same time it feels
like a lot of the cards don't have the
same degree of flavor or consistent
themes that we would see in previous
versions basically there's a little less
style and flavor in exchange for more
freedom now the one weird thing they
choose to do with this though is that
they've made sort of a half step where
they've opened up deck building but have
also restricted it in a really odd way
by limiting the number of cards you can
have based on rarity you'll only ever
get three copies of an uncommon card to
of a rare and one mythic rare which just
seems like an odd incredibly arbitrary
design decision I could maybe see
restricting them more of mythix but even
that's a stretch now another big issue
with this deck building approach is how
it restricts your early on options for
what you can use to handle certain
opponents basically once you pick your
starter deck that's all you have to work
with
for a good while until you take time
defeating a lot of opponents to grind
out more cards to choose from and
actually maybe even build a new deck
down the line until then though you're
stuck with what you chose and the
problem with that is that you might find
yourself in a situation where the deck
you picked is just awful at handling a
particular early on opponent and there's
nothing you can really do about it
adjustment wise because you don't have
any other cards or decks to work with
really now of course you could just take
the difficulty down to its lowest
setting to deal with those situations
but that doesn't excuse the fact that
something like this shouldn't happen in
the first place and is definitely one of
the drawbacks of this new approach so
once again the move to deck building
from pre-built decks is something that's
both good and bad in different ways and
really you can chalk it up mostly to
personal preference but there are some
other problems in this version of magic
duels the Planeswalkers that we also
need to cover starting with its
multiplayer multiplayer this time around
has been extremely simplified down to
just two three or four player
free-for-all and that's it previous
versions usually offered some kind of
special game mode some of which were
good and some were bad and consistently
also offered other options for full four
players such as the 2v2 format known as
two-headed giant none of these are
present in the game leaving simple
traditional free-for-all being the only
multiplayer option which to be fair by
itself is still really fun but for being
the fifth entry in a series it's
somewhat mind boggling to me that this
game features the fewest game modes and
I don't really see an obvious reason as
to why other than maybe a concern the
shift to deck building would affect the
special game modes balance but it works
with real cards too so why not in this
game it's just a frustrating step back
in content now the other big issue with
this one the other ones didn't have as
much is its approach to DLC now earlier
Duels of the Planeswalkers games did
have DLC in the forms of expansions or
specific decks you could purchase but
they all came out sometime down the line
and usually didn't screw with the game
balance that much but this time around
they now have a unique set of premium
cards that are available right away for
purchase basically there's a collection
of cards you can use to further
customize your deck that are only
available via paid DLC to make matters
even more annoying you can only gain
these cards in the form of ten
random booster packs that cost $2 a pop
so even if you just want one specific
card you have to keep buying packs
hoping you get the right one and if you
end up wanting to unlock all the cards
in order to have the game's actual
complete collection you'd have to buy a
total of 14 premium packs effectively
boosting the game's total price from its
initial $10 to 38 this also ends up
creating a paywall content-wise
giving players that chose to pay more an
advantage in multiplayer so all in all
this is by no means my favorite entry in
the magic duels of Planeswalkers series
now the change detect building like I
said earlier you could just chalk that
up to personal preference you might like
it you might dislike it but the
restrictions on deck building the
paywall content and the lack of
multiplayer modes just ends up souring
the whole experience at 10 bucks it can
still be worth picking up if you just
want the latest iteration and need to
kill time on an MTG based game but value
wise you're definitely not getting what
you used to in past titles even when
compared to those earlier ones that
launched at 20 bucks well that was my
