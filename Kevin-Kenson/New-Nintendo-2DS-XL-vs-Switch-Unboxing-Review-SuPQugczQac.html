week from now in the US will be seeing
the release of the Nintendo new 2d s XL
that's a very long name okay so normally
I skip over this part of an unboxing or
trying to glance over it but actually
want to emphasize this it has a power
cable now the reason why this is
important is for some reason the new 3ds
and the new 3ds XL did not include power
cables I think the assumption being that
Nintendo thought everyone was going to
upgrade it's only 9 10 bucks to get
power cable separately anyways the point
is it's honestly kind of annoying so the
fact is the new tds comes with one thank
you and then of course we have the new
two DS XL now well this does have the 2d
s name in it it's actually really just a
revision of the new 3ds XL the big
difference being aside from aesthetics
the fact that it lacks the 3d feature
there's also a lot lighter than 3ds XL I
mean probably because they remove the 3d
function but like you really notice it
right away I've used a 3d excel before
and it's much heftier yeah so there we
have the inside so this is clearly a new
PS design let's actually break down all
the different stuff in the name means
for people that haven't kept up with
every single revision in tendo's done to
the system so starting with new at a
certain point and tend to started making
new 3ds which is a very confusing name
but it is a very different system it is
more powerful so it's able to support
certain games so the old 3d esses cannot
it has additional buttons like this
stick right here and these two shoulder
buttons on the inside and has a built-in
NFC reader so you can actually scan
amiibos directly on it rather than
having to buy an adapter now as for the
2d s part like we've already talked
about
it supports 2d gameplay only no 3d like
the 3d s is do although honestly that's
a function that's been dying off more
and more with every game release as for
excel well that's just known in fact it
is the larger overall design giving
bigger screens for more viewability and
more importantly really if you're an
adult it is a much more comfortable grip
compared to the smaller designs which
can very easily give you hand cramps if
you're over the age of like 13 now like
I said earlier the main thing that makes
this one different from the 3ds XL is
the exclusion of 3d functions but
there's actually more to it than that
there's a lot of changes to the actual
physical design of the system well it
does look a little
our first glance aside from having this
little border design and a little
grating here which actually really liked
the look of this is a just better
looking system to me once again I always
load systems that have a 2-tone approach
not just one single color but one thing
that's immediately kind of weird is the
fact that it actually is a flap here for
revealing the DS card normally it's just
an open thing that you just put in right
away they have to open this flap here
which reveals not only where you put the
DF cartridge but more importantly also
the micro SD something that was really
really annoying about the new 3d F and
new 3d excel is that the micro SD slot
was behind the back plate so I mean we
have the audio file right here
Oh stylus which is really tiny why is
this so small okay no honestly I think
this is a solid upgrade over the new 3ds
XL my only complaint really being the
stubby little stylus everything else is
perfectly fine I mean yeah it doesn't
support 3d in games but that doesn't
really matter so cue games actually make
full use of it in an interesting way and
it just honestly it ended up being more
of a gimmick than something actually
functional and this thing beats the
3dsxl out in every other way I mean just
the design of it not having stupid
little designs like having the SD card
hidden behind the back plate it's just a
solid upgrade at a lower price but
that's not the real question the real
question is in 2017 when the switch
exists is it really worth grabbing the
6th version of a system that came out
back in 2011
maybe obviously there are situations
where upgrading to a system like this
just does not make sense for instance if
you already own a new 3dsxl
or even just a new 3ds this isn't going
to offer you anything interestingly
different for paying $150 all over again
for a new system aside from being
probably the best-looking out of the
group however if you never owned a 3ds
before this is honestly the best and
really final time you should be grabbing
one and even if you own one of the
original systems it's actually kind of
worth spending a hundred fifty bucks to
upgrade to this I mean there's a number
of games straight up require a new
system to work such as you know blades
3d there are other games that don't
necessarily require it but honestly run
really terribly without it
Hyrule warriors and they're also a full
catalog of SMEs Virtual Console games
that can only be played on new 3ds
systems ever since the switch was
released though there's been this
ongoing question of which exact systems
is it replacing is it only replacing the
Wii U is it replacement to 3ds is it
both and honestly I think by this point
it's pretty clear that it's only
replacing the Wii U I mean really let's
look at what these two systems have in
common they're portable systems released
by Nintendo that is it I mean the
experiences from them are very different
the switch is much more traditional
gaming that can be done at home or on
the go well the 3d F line is offering
games that offer this dual screen and
touchscreen experience that is unique to
it now of course you can make the
argument well the way you also had two
screens the way you also had a
touchscreen interface why is the switch
succeeds that and not the 3ds and the
answer is well it really didn't make use
of its touchscreen in an interesting or
meaningful way made evidence by the fact
that all the biggest games from the Wii
U have been making their way to the
switch if the question is is it worth
grabbing a 2d SXL when the switch exists
the answer is yes if your question is
which one should I grab first
that's little murkier do you want to
spend 300 bucks and get the new hotness
with all the new games coming out in it
go for the switch do you want to spend
half that much money to get a system
that has a library full of games six
years in the making
go over the 2d s either way it's a great
decision and honestly it's worth
grabbing both</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
