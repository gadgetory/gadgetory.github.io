questions and I've got answers so let's
check out the November Q&amp;amp;A
if you could change anything about the
switch what would it be well you know
there's just some general performance
stuff it's kind of boring I could tank
and hope for like oh it'd be great if
this thing had better battery life or
you know maybe just a little bit more
performance but honestly if there's one
like physical aspect of the system I
would change I hate this kickstand so
much I don't even use the thing in like
tabletop mode very often it's true the
fact that it's constantly popping out
what I'm using it in portable mode or
what I'm trying to dock it it might even
come out and make it before I can't
actually slide it into the dock properly
it's just really annoying so yeah for
the one you could change upgrade this
ASAP do you think that games in early
access like player unknowns
battlegrounds should be nominated for
Game of the Year this is a weird
situation because even just the term
early access I feel like it's been
changing more and more as time has gone
on it used to be that a game would do
early access or beta and people would
just try it out for a couple months and
give feedback but now we have games that
go into early access like a full title
and people play it for half a year full
year multiple years and it never
actually sees a full release until way
later and pub G makes this even weirder
because while the game we know of right
now is an early access it does
technically get its full release in mid
December making it a game that did come
out this year are we awarding the early
access version are rewarding the actual
full version how different are the two
it's really confusing I mean if it's
just a simple yes or no answer no I
don't think an early access game should
be up for nomination but just the
concept of really access in general has
gotten so weird right now do game on a
PC if yes what games if no why not well
I do play on PC as well I'm not just
strictly a console gamer admittedly I
spend a lot more time on my consoles
just because I enjoy the simplicity and
comfort of like getting home hitting the
couch and just laying back playing game
of the controller but there are times I
will play on PC and it's there only
because either a game is entirely
exclusive to PC like for instance
Starcraft 2 or more recently divinity
original sin 2 or there are some game
genres that I just prefer having a
keyboard and mouse for for instance if
I'm doing any kind of like multiplayer
FPS like overwatch I'll do that on PC or
like old-school style pause and play
RPGs like pillars of attorney
the I'll do PC for that as well so I'm
not strictly just a console gamer but I
don't really do a ton of gaming on PC
just for those handful of games where it
feels right for me what's your most
favorite game of 2017 and I'm actually
beginning this question a lot right now
cuz we've only got a month left in the
year so everyone's wondering what that
game of the year list looks like and you
know be a little unoriginal I gotta say
my favorite game this year has to be
alleged as out of breath of the wild I
mean it's just I've been a longtime
Zelda fan the game did a fantastic job
of reinventing the series kind of
injecting some of that older style with
newer gameplay mechanics I loved it for
something a little more different they
want to know so my runner-up choices I
really really like to Nier automata
that's kind of an outside choice a bit
of a niche game that's not for everyone
but I loved it another game that was
absolutely fantastic was pyre from
supergiant games I've loved everything
those guys put out it's this great
unique experience and really cheap to
pick up - if you haven't looked at the
game please do it's incredibly now to
kind of go ahead and here with that
another question I got was we all know
of the major titles which will be
nominated for game of the year but what
about those hidden gems the media
doesn't highlight you know I gotta say
this year in general has been incredible
water for gaming one of the best ones in
a long time and not only from triple-a
titles but for indie stuff - there are
some incredible indie games that come
out this year and two that really come
to mind for me are hollow knight and
dead cells how long it's gotten a little
bit of media attention it's this game
that's basically a 2d action platformer
that's got some dark soul style vibes
going on for the storytelling it's also
got this heavy like insect art style to
it really really cool game worth
checking out another one that's kind of
similar though it's dead cells which is
another kind of Metroidvania design but
it's also a roguelike where every time
you die the world changes a little bit
you have to unlock all these different
upgrades and power abilities in order to
be better at each attempt you make
really cool games make sure checking
both out another question I was getting
a lot this time is talk about what I
think about potential upcoming systems
the main examples being with the recent
releases of the Xbox one s1 x and ps4
pro do you think that these console half
steps are what we should expect in the
future also how long will this console
generation last original Xbox and ps4
are starting to fall behind I think and
that's really the main reason why I
think that the idea
doing lots of half-steps in the near
future are very unlikely because while
the 1x and ps4 Pro are more powerful
than the original systems they're still
being tied down a bit by them because
any game that's made to work on the 1x
and 4k still needs to make sure it can
at least run at a decent resolution on
the original Xbox so I think that we for
sure at least have one more full
brand-new generation that could be as
soon as 2019 I think 2020 is probably
the most realistic hard day that we're
gonna see a lot of new systems start to
hit the market and then after that it's
a very possible we might see companies
start to adopt a more smaller generation
gap kind of system we're getting more
and more performance bumps and
eventually some games are just not going
to work on the oldest version of the
model but we'll see</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
