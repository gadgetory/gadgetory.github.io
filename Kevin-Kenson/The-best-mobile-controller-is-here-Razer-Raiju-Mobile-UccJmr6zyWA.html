announcing a bunch of upcoming hardware
including two new Razer laptops and
their Razer - phone which is supposed to
offer the best gaming experience of Abel
on mobile with a hunt wente Hertz
refresh rate awesome colors lighting and
great speakers but it's actually a
peripheral tight into the Razer - phone
that I'm really interested in and that's
the Razer Ryu mobile
now if you're not familiar with them the
ratio controllers are razors line of
traditionally pro controller options on
the ps4 the grease to the original razor
I drew quite a few years ago and more
recently they released newer versions
the tournament Edition and Ryu
ultimate and this controller design
seems to be very heavily based on the
tournament design it offers a lot of the
same features and functions but some new
things as well that make it specifically
fitted for mobile phone use so what
exactly does this controller get you
over other mobile phone options well
first off this is a full-fledged gaming
controller there's a lot of mobile
options out there that are focused on
trying to be also portable or
pocket-sized or some kind of way to make
it conveniently portable not in this
case this is focused on being like a
real controller which is going to give
you a much more comfortable experience
now like I said the rise of mobile is
based primarily on the termination rise
u controller for ps4 first let's talk
about a bunch of features that are
somewhat standard across a logic pro
controllers but the rise u does really
well to begin with it has a great crypt
design really comfortably use over a
long period of time and it does feature
for remappable buttons giving you a
little more customization over how you
can control gains now two of those
buttons are located on the lower back
side of the controller so you can reach
them with the fingers you're using to
grip it really easy and comfortable to
use and there's two additional ones that
are on the top of the controller kind of
inside and in between where the triggers
are just requiring you to reach over a
little bit to grab them all four buttons
are really easy and comfortable to reach
though so they give a lot more options
on how to control your games
it also features adjustable triggers
there's the little switch you have to
flip on the back of the controller which
allow you to either have a traditional
full pull trigger or a short stop quick
trigger now one more uniquely razer
features that this controller has and is
honestly one of my favorite aspects of
the riser line controllers is their
Meccano tactile buttons basically they
have a different button designed to use
for the floor front facing as well as
for some of the programmable buttons
that gives it this very sort of
mechanical switch feeling you'd have
from like a keyboard and it's really
satisfying it makes it super simple to
do things like really fast button
presses if you ever have to just mash a
button repeatedly it is so much easier
on this style of button versus a more
traditional controller design
and I'm not gonna lie there's also just
something very oddly satisfying about
the sound of that little click
now all these features so far are things
that are shared with the tournament
edition riser controller that they have
for ps4 but where things get more
uniquely different for the mobile is
instead of having the touchpad that you
would have for a ps4 controller it's
replaced by a phone grip now this is an
adjustable home grip that is designed to
work with a variety of different phones
obviously the razor to phone is the hook
they're gonna want you to use but the
controller is designed to work with any
Android phone that is working off of
Android 6.0 or above and you can connect
it either wirelessly while it's in the
vise grip which is really simple it
makes a nice clean look or if you'd
rather a wired connection you can plug
it directly into the phone with a short
USBC cable now along with being able to
fit a variety of different sized phones
the Vice is also designed to tilt up to
six degrees upwards so that way you
don't have to play where you have the
controller like this and the phone just
straight above it you're able to hold
the controller in a more natural
position where it's leaned more forward
now the hands-on experience I did have
was not with a final version of the
riser mobile it is a prototype one but
one of the last ones before the full
production models so it's very close to
the final experience and it's shaping up
to be really nice all the buttons feel
really snappy the grip like I said is
super comfortable and I think the
overall just designed being based on the
termination but adapting it for mobile
phones works out really great
now as for pricing and availability not
everything is fully set in stone just
yet they have said they're going to be
releasing the phone in the holiday of
2018 so it is on its way very quickly
you can order through razors website and
they're gonna make it available
worldwide as well and I'll be riding at
an MSRP of a hundred and fifty dollars
now if you're not used to pro controller
100 bucks sounds like a ton of money and
it is but that's really the kind of
standard allow these pro controllers one
for once again this is basically the
same design as their term edition on ps4
it offers a lot of the same functions
and quality but reams towards mobile and
that's how much those run for as well
it's expensive but you get what you pay
for</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
