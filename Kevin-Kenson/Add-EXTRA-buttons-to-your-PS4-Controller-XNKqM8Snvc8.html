controller specially designed just for
PlayStation the Vantage and I'm here III
where they actually invited me to unbox
one check it out look at all the
features firsthand and kinda just get
sort of a first look at it and there's a
lot of cool stuff going on here so let's
start by just getting this package open
take a look at it and go over what
they've changed okay
that is really pretty I've ranted to you
guys before that
pardon me hates myself for this but I
love silver designs and this just looked
really good in the silver I would love
to use this with like a silver PS or
slim I think it'll just look great
together let's go ahead and take it out
and get a look here now something that's
really important to talk about right
away is that past scuff controllers for
ps4 have all been modified dual shocks
so they had the Infinity which added the
paddles and a few of their signature
designs to a regular girl shop or they
made the impact which was the kind of
same idea but they also added a new
shell which was a big improvement but
this guy the Vantage is a brand new
controller built top to bottom so this
is not any kind of modified thing this
is a just built pro controller and you
can just tell the difference right away
just picking up and feeling it I really
like the grip design on this guy it's
really comfy there's a lot of stuff here
that are kind of standard features of
scuff controllers but there's a lot of
new stuff too so let's gonna start with
what's returning we've got the back
paddles of course which are different
shortcuts you can use they're shaped a
little differently so it's really easy
to access these outer ones the inner
ones take a little more effort to reach
in but it's not that bad these ones
though super comfortable now to top off
these two they have added two more
shortcut buttons on the side which the
idea here is that when you're gripping
the controller you can hit the top
bumpers using your fingers and if you
want hit these side ones you just lift
up right here and it's a little weird at
first closely like the idea I get it but
it would definitely take some training
to really kind of start developing the
reflex to do that comfortably what's
really cool though is that if you don't
like this you can just easily pull them
off like that so if you don't like using
this feature you can get rid of it not a
problem at all
now another big thing with scuff
controllers is just all the
customization items
while there have been a lot of them
before one of the main issues was that
you had to use a lot of different tools
to point it all together and you need to
get these different keys to unlock
different things change different stuff
they've simplified a lot of that town
which I am a huge fan of because while
all the tools were handy you could lose
them and they were small and it was a
little annoying
so with this guy but they have going on
first off is on the back for adjusting
the trigger stops you can just do it
yourself with your finger so you can
have the short stop or the full stop
really easy and if you want to change
out the sticks or anything you just lift
the whole base plate off like it's
really easy to do - it's just magnetic
so that's super super simple there's
some more stuff going on in here but I
want to go back to that later the main
idea here is that all the customization
and stuff you want to do does it really
need tools anymore the only one that
still does is if you want to adjust the
tension on the triggers you still have
to use the key there so you have a
single key to deal with but as far as
features go this one's honestly kind of
a minor one and if you figure out the
trigger tension that you like just set
that up when you first get it and you're
good to go
what are your things that's coming back
to is they do have a changeable triggers
for the back so you get these extended
ones but a change this time is that
these new ones have like a rubberized
grip to them so it feels a little
different it's a little more tactile it
kind of just grips to your finger a lot
more easily so that's more comfortable
personally I've always liked using just
the standard triggers but for those of
you that like the extended ones this is
a big upgrade now I mentioned there's a
lot of new things on this controller one
of them is the side buttons I talked
about already another one are these
touch controls right here for audio so
if we're using a plugged in headset
you're able to adjust the volume by just
brushing this pad right here for raising
it or lowering it and if you want to
mute your mic you just tap it really
quick so super simple another big change
is that like I showed earlier you can
remove the faceplate this makes it
really easy to change out the sticks all
that good stuff but the other thing too
is that you could actually take out the
rumble features so if you want to make
your controller lighter or you don't
want any kind of vibration function for
a particular game
just rip these things out super easily
or you can put them back in really
simple so yeah there's a lot of new
functions going on here but I think the
biggest thing honestly just really
impacts my personal experience it's just
how easy it is to change everything I
mean with older scuff controllers
customization is cool but it was always
really annoying when you had to deal
with oh where did I put this key or
where did this oh that's another thing I
almost forgot
so remapping controls remapping controls
used to use a side tool as well where
you have this little magnetic key that
you would put on the back which yeah
that's cool but what if you lose the key
now it's just a little switch at the
bottom of the controller you just enter
remap mode or turn it off and use that
in order to map whatever buttons you
want to these different shortcut keys
way easier to customize and just change
stuff out really quickly and easily you
not to worry about losing any tools like
I said the side buttons are something to
get used to but I really like the idea
of them especially as far as just adding
two more shortcuts that are really
easily in reach the grip feels
comfortable access to all the buttons is
great they've also added mechanical
buttons for a lot of things the d-pad
uses mechanical which feels really nice
the top bumpers all mechanical yeah this
is a definite upgrade over the impact
now something you're doing different
with this guy as well is that normally
they always focus on customization where
you're you know buying all little of
different upgrades and stuff this time
it's just one package you buy altogether
which you can grab from their website or
from Gamestop this time which is really
neat if you want more customization you
can spend more money on their website to
get like other color options there are
different specific sticks but this one
does come in a prepackaged with also
taller dome sticks as well so you're
gonna get some of those options right
away with just that base package now
this guy comes in a wired and wireless
option the wired one is giving you give
you that just kind of standard Pro wired
connection if you want to spend more
money though you can get this guy which
does wireless was really cool about the
wireless one though is that we're gonna
get a carrying case as well but if you
want to use it wired by plugging it in
you're still gonna get the connectivity
of a Wired experience not just giving
power to the controller it's actually
going to give you that faster response
time so Wireless is gonna give you the
best of both worlds you're spending more
money for it
I
really excited to get my hands on this
guy for an actual like full test cuz
this is just me hearing all the features
and just checking it out I'm really
excited to give it a full test once it
comes out these are up for pre-order on
their website I believe they said
they're shipping in August so I've
already got mine set up I'm excited to
really give it a full run in a few
months</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
