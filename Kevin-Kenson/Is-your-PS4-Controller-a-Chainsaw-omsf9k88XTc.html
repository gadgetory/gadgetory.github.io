- Released back in 2005 by
a company called Nuby Tech,
this was a controller
designed to celebrate,
the release of Resident Evil 4,
and at that time, Nuby Tech was a company,
known mainly for making
just a lot of different,
cheaper off brand controllers,
one of the many cheaper
accessories companies out there,
back during that time,
but with this,
they decided to kinda change directions,
and focus more on making more,
kinda cool collectible controller designs,
instead of ones that were
just cheap knock offs,
and I think this did a really good job,
of accomplishing that.
Now there are actually
two different versions,
of this controller that were released,
originally, when Resident
Evil 4 was thought to be
a Gamecube exclusive, they released
a yellow chainsaw
controller for that system,
and later on in the year,
when the PS2 version came out,
they released this orange one,
which not a lot of people realize,
actually has quite a few
different upgrades over it.
The original Gamecube controller,
was very uncomfortable to use,
as an actual controller,
and while the PS2 version,
still definitely has its problems,
which we'll talk about in a little bit,
it was considered to be a
more comfortable upgrade,
and there were a whole lot of features
added to the PS2 one,
which just made it,
honestly just a whole lot cooler.
For instance, the original
Gamecube controller,
had a simple finish on the chainsaw blade,
that was just kind of a plain gray,
whereas this one had this
nice, chrome reflective,
kind of actual metal-looking finish.
It also added the rip chord,
which counts as the start button as well,
so you can use this to start the game up,
or you can pause it,
and there's a motion control
built into the PS2 controller,
for when you raise it,
it counts as using the
aim button in the game,
which specifically when
using the chainsaw,
would make Leon raise the chainsaw,
which was a cool little idea.
Also to kind of celebrate the idea,
that these ones were
a little more limited,
or a little more special,
they actually numbered the
releases for the PS2 version.
There were 50000 made,
and the number is located
right on the chainsaw itself,
and the display diorama
for it was a lot cooler.
The original Gamecube
one just kinda came on
this simple stand that looked
like kinda rocky terrain,
where the PS2 one, has a
lot of cool stuff going on.
Speaking of cool special edition stuff,
that's tied into Sony products,
we got this special
edition Spiderman PS4 Pro,
which we unboxed, did a video on,
on like Spiderman and shortly after,
we got this insanely cool
promotional box version in,
so now we have two Spiderman PS4 Pros,
and we don't need two Spiderman PS4 Pros,
so we are going to give this one away,
check out the description down below,
into how you can get a chance to win it.
Now what we have right here,
is actually just the plain stand,
for the PS2 controller.
There's actually a whole
glass case enclosure,
that goes over it as well,
which really plays up this
whole kind of cool theme,
for Resident Evil I think,
which involves the kind
of mansion aesthetic,
where you have the nice
little red floor here,
and all the different,
like wooden compartments,
there's actually storage below,
for some of the additional accessories,
that go with the controller,
and a really nice, weird touch,
that I think a lot of people miss,
on the PS2 design, is
where the chainsaw rests,
is actually a picture of Leon,
so it looks like he's
getting cut into half.
Another really cool detail
that these chainsaws do,
that I think a lot of
people aren't aware of,
is the fact that the
blood splatter design,
on every single blade is actually unique.
No two PS2 or Gamecube Controllers,
have the same design,
because they basically just
applied random red paint,
all over it, to give it its
own little unique aesthetic,
which is a really cool little detail,
and that combined with everything else,
going on with the PS2 edition controller,
I think makes for an
amazing display piece.
You could use it as a
controller if you wanted to,
but honestly at the end of the day,
I think the main point of this,
is just to be a cool thing
to show off to your friends,
and the company behind it, Nuby Tech,
might claim otherwise,
I mean back when this and
Gamecube version came out,
there was this whole spiel of like,
oh it's a really useful controller,
for tight spaces, and when
you have to fight off zombies,
that's not really true.
It is true that the PS2 version,
is a more comfortable controller,
but not by a whole lot,
and there's a lot of
problems you still run into.
Now we wanted to show you guys this,
and we were actually
planning on doing this video,
a lot earlier before,
but last time when we were shooting,
we ran into a bit of a problem.
Overall, I think it's pretty fair to say,
that the PS2 version of this controller,
is a lot better looking
than its Gamecube variant,
and there's a little, some
good old display cases as well,
on the back here is a little,
kind of drawer slider area,
where you can store the
instruction manual for it,
and down below, there's a
drawer that stores the cable,
That is not in here, (beep).
So, staying true to the
fact that I like using
the chainsaw controller
more as a display piece,
than an actual controller,
I haven't fully taken
it out of its packaging,
since the last time we used it a video,
almost three years ago,
and apparently, after we shot that video,
we didn't put the cable back away,
and we don't know where it ended up,
so that's kind of a problem,
especially because it turns out,
that the cable for the
chainsaw controller,
is relatively unique.
It's a PS2 adaptor, that
is male on both ends,
so it's not as simple as just buying,
like a PS2 extension chord,
and putting the female
end into the controller,
you can't do that.
So, we decided to try something out,
that we weren't entirely
sure it would work or not,
and we bought two extension PS2
controllers and modded them.
Basically what we did was grab
a pair of extension cables,
for the PS2 controllers,
we popped the female
end off of one of them,
and put the male cap from
the other one, onto it,
we had to solder the cables into place,
and it actually wasn't that hard to do,
at least if you know how to solder,
and while it isn't the
prettiest looking cable,
and I'm a little bit
worried about using it,
you know, a little roughly,
you don't want to break.
We hooked it up to the PS2, and it works.
This already feels weird.
So, I do know one of the reasons why
this more comfortable
than the Gamecube one,
is because this handle on the Gamecube,
goes out a lot more,
and so it's really
weird to like hold that,
and use the stick at the same time,
and as far as that situation goes,
this controller is
definitely more comfortable,
but it's the placement of everything else,
that's really weird.
You kind of have to reach awkwardly,
for any other buttons,
and I'm also kind of
having a problem right now,
because Resident Evil 4,
is one of those games that,
it really heavily inspired,
like over the shoulder shooter,
but because of its age,
it doesn't use any of kind of controls,
that later games like that style did,
like for instance, instead
of using both triggers,
to aim and fire, I use one trigger to aim,
and then I can't walk or move,
and then I still use the sticks,
to like look around and fire using X,
it's different, it's weird,
but I mean I'm able to play so far,
so that's good,
our cable is working, I think.
Ow.
So, so far just playing with it,
for a little while,
I mean, yeah it works,
and it's definitely a
controller you can use,
if you want to get through the whole game,
at least that's how it feels right now,
maybe with other weapons,
it gets a little more annoying,
but the big problem here,
isn't that I can't play the game,
it's that, this just
isn't comfortable at all.
Like I can already feel my hands,
being, not happy with this situation.
But wait, I didn't even
do the most fun part
on the camera yet, hold on.
There's no reason for
me to do this anymore,
because the game has already started,
but hit the start button.
(chainsaw noises).
I paused it.
(chainsaw noises)
Herb, I need that.
Now one other thing I'm noticing,
this might be because of our cabling,
I think we fixed most of the issues,
I think there might've
been something special,
about the cable that comes with though,
because, yeah I'm not
doing the aiming with this,
although actually,
well doing that broke it.
