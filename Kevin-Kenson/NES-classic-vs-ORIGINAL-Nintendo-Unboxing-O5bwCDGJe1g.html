really love about it is the attention to
detail and the clear drive it had to
appeal the peoples of nostalgia from
which games they picked to the replica
NES controller and even the system's
interface and this goes all the way to
how it even recreates the actual
packaging of an original NES and to show
you guys that my local retro game store
pixel vault hooked me up with this
complete in box NES control deck and
we're gonna unbox it alongside the
classic opening it up you do see one
difference the original NES is using
this big ol styrofoam to package
everything safely while the classic is
this nice condensed cardboard now both
of them have their fair share of
paperwork and one thing they have in
common is a fold-out poster the classic
editions is double-sided with
instructions on one side and on the main
side is a recreation of an old-school
style NES poster meanwhile the poster in
the original NES is much much larger and
features a list of several big hit games
at the time that it was trying to
advertise now you'll see in the classic
Edition we did get a single controller
that has a way shorter cable but it's
otherwise the same exact size as a
regular NES controller while the control
deck bundle not only has longer cables
on their controllers but it actually
comes with two of them rather than just
one so after that we make our way
through all the little additional cables
and bits that come with both systems for
power and for video which you'll see are
way different now and we make our way to
the actual NES systems and just look how
small the classic is compared to the
original which just looks like a giant
but at the same time how much attention
was given to making these two look so
similar so the control deck NES was the
original entry level way to get an NES
though there were several variant
versions of it that would include things
like a free game like Super Mario
Brothers fun fact when this thing came
out in 1985 it was a hundred and
ninety-nine dollars which if you adjust
for inflation now is four hundred and
forty six dollars and if that doesn't
sound crazy enough keep in mind that
there was also a deluxe set that came
with Rob the robot which was two hundred
and ninety-nine dollars putting it at
six hundred and seventy adjusted for
inflation see
think about that when a brand new ps4 is
400 it's interesting to looking back at
this system what's changed and bundling
like how the NES you'd get two
controllers right away for two-player
gaming whereas now the standard is to
always get just one and have to buy any
others later for extra and even the
classic edition follows this logic
gaming has certainly evolved and changed
in the last 31 years since the NES came
out but it's cool to see Nintendo knows
how to pay it homage with the love and
care that they put into the NES classic
unlike a certain Sega classic system
seriously what the hell is meatloaf
