different today now lately when you can
sing most of my videos it's in this set
right here but this isn't actually where
I do most of my gaming that's actually
over here this is a lounge area of our
offices where we don't really do a lot
of editing or anything we'll
occasionally shoot up here but the main
point isn't the place for people to
decompress or in my case play games in
between videos so let's take a look
first let's take a look at the wall of
peripherals now the main point of this
section is the top shelf where I keep
all the different controllers for
different systems that I use including
some dual track fours for the ps4 and
silver and gold we've got a number of
different joy cons here on an actual
switch itself also on these grips I
never really use them on actually play
games but I like having them as a way to
display other joint con colors also a
couple of knee bows rounding it out my
favorite link one and cloud which
actually just picked up today these just
launched and further back there are all
the different Xbox one as controllers we
have right now I just did a video on
these plus a couple designs we got
before from getting different special
edition systems now to kind of fill in a
lot of space here just for display there
are a number of different collectibles
that I have some are ones that I've
bought straight up on their own like
other amiibos or the pixel pals but
there's also some that belong to
collector's editions for some more
recent bigger games for instance I've
got a Lloyd over here from horizon zero
dawn and further down the mask from
dishonored too to fill that space down
there now all this isn't necessarily
just for show we have a couple other
things we've picked up over time for
instance I've done a couple videos
ranking all the different colors of
different special ition systems so for
instance here's all the other Xbox one
the white ones missing right now because
it's actually hooked up to the TV and
ps4 slims as well which I just ranked
more recently on top of all that we have
a few other peripherals aside from
controllers some are a little more for
display such as the laser scope here
kind of just a lesson history and things
not to do when you're developing another
kind of controller and this game will be
coming out in April I retired of it in
glory but we also have further down the
PS VR which we do hook up every now and
then to the ps4 Pro for playing some
games it's just it's a big mess of
cables if you leave it hooked up all the
time so we saw it over here in the
corner when we're not using it now let's
take a look at the background
now this next area might look familiar
to some of you because we've actually
done a lot of shooting up here right
here on this couch so behind me I
usually try to showcase some more of my
collectibles right now I've got the Mega
Man vendo and my titanfall pop there's
also a very small collection of games so
this isn't my full shelf obviously it's
just a couple games I bring in there
either
and hits or stuff in my backlog I'm
trying to get it into now there's also a
couple Call of Duty games thanks to
Ralphy which speaking of which the
really big centerpieces on this back
wall are these huge LEGO sets that
Ralphy has recently built on his new
channel build play repeat and I kind of
round those out are a trio really
awesome posters that I'm so glad it
finally made their way into a video I've
had them for a while but we just haven't
found the place to fit them yet so
really cool you guys get to see these
finally before talking about the TV
though let's take a look at the setup
beneath it showing off all of our
systems those in the show if we got at
IKEA the top row is all of our recent
systems we've got the ps4 pro on one
side Xbox 1s on the other although later
this year that's going to get replaced
on the one X comes out and kind of
breaking the combo in the middle is the
Wii U obviously the switch is newer but
having an enclosed space like that
doesn't really play nice with the dock
so we keep that up above and the way you
still get some use now and then so there
it's right there on the bottom row are
some older systems some of them are a
little more for display we were giving
Sega a little bit of love with the
Dreamcast on one side Genesis on the
other and in the middle is the analogue
NT that's actually a more recent system
that lets you do old-school and ask
gaming but in 1080p on nicer TVs and to
really make these systems pop out we
actually had these two strips set up on
the back of the shelf which gives a nice
separation between the systems and the
back wall right now we're rocking purple
color which i think is the perfect
accent in this room and then of course
is the TV this is an LG OLED TV I don't
remember the exact product number off
the top my head we'll put that link down
below but the point is it's a really
pretty TV I'm going to be honest with
you guys it's not necessarily the best
choice if you're doing like hardcore
competitive stuff the latency on it is a
bit serious but when it comes to playing
just single-player games things are
focused more on visuals and the kind of
cinematic feel it is an incredible
choice so that wraps up our little tour
of the gaming room here at the office if
there is you guys saw in the video they
don't really talk about ask me down
below in the comments I'm also going to
link some of the cooler stuff down below
as well I'll see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
