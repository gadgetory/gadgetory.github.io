and well we had a lot of amazing stuff
come out gaming wise on the hardware end
it's been a little slower now this makes
sense because last year we got both the
Nintendo switch and the Xbox one X and
PlayStation is still riding the success
of the ps4 slimmin and pro so we didn't
really see anything new coming out this
year but when you look at the horizon
what's in the future for 2019 and even
beyond that there is a lot of stuff
going on first let's take a look at
Nintendo predictions because unlike the
other two major companies who are still
waiting on doing actual next-gen systems
we just got a new system with the switch
just last year so they're not looking to
do any kind of major new hardware or any
kind of revolutionary change instead
we're more likely gonna see some kind of
hardware refresh now what this means for
this which in particular could actually
be a couple different things
now there are already very hard rumors
that Nintendo is working on something
for sure and then it's looking to come
out sometime in 2019 but how that
refresh looks there's a lot of different
theories now on the one hand it could
just be a very simple straightforward
refresh whether that's a Nintendo switch
2.0 Nintendo switch slim something like
that where we could just see some light
changes to it maybe an improved
kickstand smaller bezels and some light
improvements and maybe upgrading some
features that are missing from the
current switch like bluetooth support
increased in the battery life or giving
just a little extra power to make sure
performance is a little more balanced
across most games on the other heads
possible that this new version of the
switch could be something significantly
different there's two avenues you can go
with this first off there's the idea of
0.5 console which has been really
popular lately I mean obviously we had
that with the ps4 Pro Xbox 1x and even
Nintendo did kind of a smaller scale
version of that with the new 3ds and new
3ds XL so it's not that insane to see
something like a new switch that
supports higher resolutions maybe even
doing something like 1080p and handheld
instead of 720 and full-blown 4k 1 dot
another possibility is that something
we've seen intended to do with a lot of
their handhelds is the idea of something
that's significantly different in some
kind of design choice whether that's
making a larger version with a bigger
screen that could be like the switch XL
something that's smaller with a smaller
screen like a switch light there's a lot
of different ideas Nintendo could do to
do something kind of a mixed up
difference to where it's not necessarily
a straight-up upgrade so everyone who
already owns a switch has to buy the new
thing but instead it's an alternative
option for someone that wants something
little different of the three companies
Sony has been the most tight-lipped in
regards to what they're working on for
the future and that's for good reason
because this generation they've pretty
much consistently been on top they
station predictions I mean the switch
has been doing great right now but
Nintendo still kind of balancing out the
Wii U years and while Xbox has done a
lot to improve their hardware and
software the launch the Xbox one has not
done it really real favors so while
Playstations been doing very strong they
don't really need to do much to build a
pipe right now because people are still
buying their products very happily now
what we do know is that the next system
presumably a PlayStation 5 is in the
works to some degree could be very early
planning stages but it's probably not
gonna come out any time super soon most
analysts and different rumors have
placed it in kind of a three year spread
being as late as 2021 or as early as the
holiday season of 2019 which is possible
but would be very surprising and the
main reason why they would maybe push
that fast is because which we'll get to
in a bit Xbox is likely releasing
something in 2020 so if they want to try
and undercut and beat the competition
that's the way to go now if they want to
take their time and really something
more powerful that's gonna take a while
as for what form this new system might
take well once again they've been pretty
tight-lipped so there's a lot of
different theories and rumors but
nothing with any real concrete evidence
on the one hand they could be focusing
on just doing business as usual creating
a traditional home console maybe making
some major changes to it like removing a
disk drive or focusing on streamable
games but it's still gonna be a fairly
traditional home console on the other
hand a rumor that's been going around is
that they could be focusing on trying to
do what Nintendo has done with the
switch either with the next Playstation
or maybe with a new handheld considering
you know the Vita and PSP didn't do
super great in the US but it is a thing
that Sony has a history of looking at
these successful things Nintendo has
done and doing their own little spin it
for better or worse Microsoft has been
very forward with their plans of what
they want to do with the next Xbox
Spock's predictions they've been teasing
so many different things because like I
said earlier the Xbox one did not do
quite as well as they hoped even with
all the updates and changes they made
for the better so they really want to
get people excited for what they have
going on in the future and the way
they've been doing that is just teasing
so so many project names that it's
really hard to keep up with with things
like project scarlet and more recently
anaconda
what's interesting about this is the
number of devices that might be in the
works from Microsoft because Nintendo
just has one new switch refresh maybe
PlayStation might be working on a single
new PS 5 Microsoft has as many as three
different new systems in the works
starting off with sometime in 2019 we
might be seeing a final new Xbox one
design something that instead of the 1x
being the premium expensive awesome 4k
system they might be releasing something
that is a cheaper more affordable option
to get people into their console for
instance something that has the power of
the 1s but it's cheaper by being smaller
and not including a disk drive after
that is where things get interesting
because they have talked very plainly
about releasing new systems as soon as
2020 a new generation of X boxes that
would maybe be release with two
different options something like we have
right now with the 1s and 1x but instead
of it being something that happened to
over time it's right there right away at
launch where you can spend more money to
get the awesome 4k capable cool system
with all the features and support well
you could save money and get a cheaper
stripped-down smaller version that might
even have things like less power in
exchange for focusing more on streamable
games and that's what's really exciting
I think about what Microsoft's working
on is because more than the other two
right now they're really trying to
tackle and do something differently to
change what people think of as a console
they've been experimenting a lot lately
with game Paz focusing on the idea of
people just paying a membership fee and
just getting access to all these games
upfront and I think that's something
they want to take into the next system
something that focuses on yeah having
this cool piece of hardware but it's
focused more on Xbox as a service
something that offers backwards
compatibility with all their systems
something where you just pay a fee and
get access to all the brand-new games
and something that focuses more on
streaming them directly to the system
relying on the cloud
instead of having to have super
expensive hardware in one unit no matter
which console you're a fan of or have
you balance across all three what's
important is that we're in a time right
now where all of them have something
interesting new in the works and that is
so exciting</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
