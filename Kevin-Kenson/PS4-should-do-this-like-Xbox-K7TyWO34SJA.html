- [Narrator] This is the Razer Turret
keyboard and mouse combo for the Xbox One.
Now, it's been a few months
since Microsoft has opened
up keyboard and mouse support
on the Xbox One, but this
is the first keyboard
that has been released,
branded and designed
specifically to be used on the Xbox.
Now, this makes it a little bit different
from some of the other keyboards and mice
that we've talked about before
in terms of using them on a console.
A lot of times, when we talk
about console keyboards,
they're not actually keyboards.
They are devices that are
mimicking controller inputs,
and just doing the best job they can of
making it feel like an authentic
keyboard and mouse experience.
That's not the case here.
This is a real keyboard and mouse.
You could hook it up to your
PC if you wanted to as well,
so it's gonna give you
that true experience.
What's special about this combo, though,
is how several aspects of this setup
have been tailored to
specifically being used
in a couch kind of setup with a console,
instead of the more traditional
keyboard and mouse on a desktop.
So, fun fact.
While this is branded for Xbox,
and obviously is all aimed
directly towards that,
it's still basically
just a normal keyboard
that's entirely wireless, so
as we've said, you could
use that with a PC,
but a more interesting and possibly
even kind of taboo option,
is it will also work on a PS4.
Unlike Xbox, Playstation
is currently not doing
any kind of major
keyboard and mouse support
across their platform, however,
one specific game does allow and have
native keyboard support,
and that is Fortnite.
So, once you've actually
logged into the game,
you've gotten past your
Playstation launch screen
and all that kind of stuff,
if you've got a keyboard
and mouse plugged in,
you can start using it and have the actual
full kind of keyboard and mouse interface,
and be able to play in online matches
with other people that are using keyboard.
Now obviously, this won't allow you to
make use of all the features
available on this keyboard,
like some of the customization stuff,
but if you just want a
really comfy couch setup,
and you really like Fortnite on PS4,
this is actually an option.
So, what exactly do you get in this combo?
Well, the keyboard has a Tenkeyless setup
that has Razer Green switches,
that's their very traditional, tactile,
slightly clicky sounding ones,
that personally, I like to use a lot.
The mouse has a 16000 DPI sensor,
and both of these are wireless.
You can use them wired if you prefer,
you do get a number of cables with this.
One to connect the keyboard directly
to your Xbox One or PC,
it also can connect into an
AC adaptor for wall power.
There is a cable that goes from the mouse
to your Xbox One or PC,
and then a very short charging cable
that can connect your mouse
to they keyboard directly,
when you want to charge them both
at the same time with wall power.
The battery life when you're
using these wirelessly is pretty good.
If you don't have any of
the lighting effects on,
so you just get the maximum
battery life possible,
the keyboard is gonna be the one
that holds you back a little bit,
and goes for a total of 43 hours,
which is really good,
but that's also without any
of the lighting effects,
so where's the fun?
If you turn all that stuff on,
the mouse takes a little bit of a hit,
but the keyboard loses
a lot of battery life,
and takes it all the way down to 11 hours,
which is still long enough for
one solid sit through of playing games,
but you're definitely gonna need
to charge it a little more often.
Thankfully though, with
the wireless setup,
you could always just
plug it in to wall power,
and not have a cable running
all the way to your system.
So, what exactly makes this
keyboard and mouse design
for Xbox One?
Well, there's three main features that
really stand out to me.
First off is just the design
of the keyboard itself.
You might be noticing that
while it is a Tenkeyless one,
it's got a pretty big footprint.
And the reason why is because it has
this very large, noticeable
built-in wrist rest.
That way, when you're
playing with it on your lap,
it's gonna sit nice and stable,
it's not gonna feel like it's too small,
or gonna slide off,
and it gives a place
for your wrist to rest,
that way it doesn't start getting strained
when you're playing for long hours on end.
The second thing is the built in mousepad.
So, the keyboard actually has a mousepad
that you can slide out right here.
It's just large enough to be able to
give you a good enough room
to move the mouse around.
I do wish you had just
a little more surface area to work with,
but considering the overall size,
I think it's a good compromise.
But what's really interesting about it
is that the mouse and mousepad are
actually slightly magnetized,
so that's gonna make sure
that while you're playing,
the mouse is gonna have this nice kind of
sticky feeling to the pad,
it's gonna slide around nice and easy,
it's not gonna fall off,
but it's just enough little force
that if you need to lift the mouse,
it's not really noticeable or a big deal.
Three, and I know this is gonna sound
really minor to some people,
but I think it's actually really important
in the case of using
this with the Xbox One,
both the keyboard and
mouse connect wirelessly
to the same little dongle,
so on the Xbox One, where you only have
three USB ports to make use of,
this is gonna make sure
that the other ones
are freed up for things
like a USB headset,
or external USB SSD.
Plus, it's also small enough that
you can put it in one
of the back USB ports
and still be able to have the Xbox
closer to a wall, without it taking up
a bunch of space.
It's also worth noting that like
a lot of Razer's other wireless mice,
the Turret does come with
a little space in the mouse
that you can store the dongle
whenever you're not using it.
That way, it has a nice
little safe place to stay
if you want to switch it
between different Xboxes
or even move it between
an Xbox and PC setup.
As of right now, the list of games
that support keyboard
and mouse in the Xbox One
is still pretty small, but thankfully,
out of that list, a lot of them
are very popular, multiplayer games
with a lot of replayability.
Stuff like Fortnite,
Warframe, even Vermintide 2.
Now if you're more of a
single player kind of person,
there's Metro Exodus right now.
Which is what I'm playing.
Now, something that
people might worry about
with a setup like this is
yeah, cool, you can use
a keyboard and mouse,
but if it's wireless, is
it gonna have any kind of
noticeable heavy input lag?
And honestly, not really.
One of the cool things about this
is that it makes use of Razer's
adaptive frequency technology.
It's something they use in a
lot of their wireless mice,
and it's constantly changing
the frequency it's on
to make sure that it's
giving you the cleanest,
best signal possible,
which is really cool.
I mean, using it, it just feels seamless.
And if you're really
worried about it, again,
you can use this in a
wired setup if you prefer.
Something else that's
really cool with the setup
that not a lot of games can use just yet,
but Microsoft does have plans
to have it in more games,
especially their own
exclusives, like Gears of War 5,
is this thing called
Xbox dynamic lighting.
What it does is it takes
the lighting effects
on the keyboard and mouse,
and matches them up to things
that are happening in-game,
which is a really cool concept.
Speaking of the lighting,
something that I really
appreciate they did
as sort of an extra step on this,
is that they brought a
version of Razer Synapse
to the Xbox One, for
the Turret specifically.
So, if you want to do anything like
customizing the lighting
effects on your keyboard,
or you want to adjust the sensitivity
and pulling rate of your mouse,
you don't have to hook this up to a PC
to make that work, instead,
you just download the app on your Xbox One
while you're connected,
and you can open up
all the settings you wanna change,
including lighting effects
on the mouse and keyboard,
whether or not you're making
use of dynamic lighting
for those games that have it,
mouse sensitivity, and
even power saving options
if you wanted to start shutting off lights
if you're not using it very often.
Something I really wanna emphasize too
while I'm actually actively using this is
how comfortable and
natural this all feels.
Part of the problem of
bringing keyboard and mouse
to systems before is that
keyboard and mouse is traditionally
a very sort of desktop-oriented thing,
and not something you'd necessarily do
from the comfort of your couch, but
the way this one's sized, at least for me,
is just right to fit comfortably
in any of my chairs, or laying on a couch.
Sits nice on my lap, and I'm just able
to reach all the keys.
It just feels right.
Using the Razer Turret a lot
has made something very apparent to me.
Keyboard and mouse support
need to come to consoles
a lot sooner.
Just bear with me here.
For a long time, we've
always accepted the idea
that for certain genres of games,
there are specialized
controllers you can pick up.
Oh, you really like fighting games?
Well, you should buy a fight pad,
or maybe even a full-blown
arcade style fight stick.
Oh, you love racing games?
Well, pick up a racing wheel.
But when it comes to the FPS genre,
or other genres like
RTS that have just been
mostly blocked off from consoles,
we never really fought
to bring keyboards over.
Now to be fair, keyboards do take
a little bit more work to incorporate,
because there's a lot
more keys to make use of,
and then mice work very
different from control sticks
or steering wheels.
But there's so many amazing games
that have just been left to PC only.
Part of where this
comes from, too, I think
is this long standing concept
of console vs. PC gaming.
You know, PC gaming, you have
the powerful gaming rig
on your desktop setup
with keyboard and mouse, while
console, you're just laying back lazily
with a controller, and yeah,
I get it, that made sense for a time, but
it doesn't really need
to be that way anymore,
and I think that's something that Xbox
has been working towards.
This concept of just
making games available
to any platform that you like,
and use the kind of controller
or setup that you're comfortable with.
And so being able to
play these style of games
with a keyboard and mouse on
the comfort of my own couch
that's designed to work just that way
is this really liberating experience, and
just makes me wish there
was more options like that.
Again, sadly, right now,
that list of games that
support a keyboard and mouse
on Xbox One is pretty small,
but after using the Turret,
I want to see that list grow,
and grow a lot faster,
and not just in terms of,
&quot;Oh, I want more FPS games
&quot;that will let me use keyboard and mouse,
&quot;because I find them more comfortable,&quot;
but also for more tactical
experience style games,
and even starting to
accept more ports of games
that traditionally wouldn't
really work on a console.
There are so many great games
that haven't made their
way to a console setup,
because the idea of playing them
with a regular controller
seems utterly insane,
but having the ability
to use keyboard and mouse
no longer has that limitation.
I'm not gonna make any crazy,
sweeping statements like,
&quot;Oh, the Razer Turret
is the amazing, best,
&quot;ultimate keyboard mouse combo out there
&quot;that you have to get, no other choice!&quot;
That's a crazy thing to say.
Look, it's a really expensive
keyboard and mouse setup,
and I get it.
There are cheaper options out there
that will work on your Xbox
One if you make them work.
What the Razer Turret does, though,
is it's specialized for
this very specific purpose
of bringing you that experience
of keyboard and mouse
and allowing you to use it comfortably,
on your couch, at home,
playing an Xbox One,
and it does that job beautifully.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
