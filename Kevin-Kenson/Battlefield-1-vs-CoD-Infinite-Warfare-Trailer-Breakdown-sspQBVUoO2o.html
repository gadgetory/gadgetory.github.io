trailers for the two biggest budget FPS
games coming out this holiday season
call of duty infinite warfare and
battlefield one and the response to
these two trailers have been pretty
noticeably different now there are some
specific reasons that are pretty obvious
why people are a lot more angry at
infinite warfare but I want to take a
look at both trailers for the games and
really break down why one of them is so
much more effective at building height
starting with the infinite warfare
trailer I think one of the things that
immediately puts a lot of fans on edge
is the decision to go with a far future
sci-fi setting which is a little weird
for the series given Call of Duty has
never been exactly about having a super
accurate depiction of war but it's
always been based on real wars for the
most part whether that's World War 2 the
Cold War or modern warfare and while
they have been experimenting with sci-fi
more recently it's all been more near
future based on things going on now and
the move to sci-fi is kind of a jarring
one because when you look at other FPS
games that focus on a sci-fi setting
they're established settings that are
constantly used all of the Halo games
take place in the Halo universe
titanfall created its own universe that
it focused on with Call of Duty since
everything is so localized within a
specific game or two it's weird for them
to have to try and construct a new
setting just for this game which is what
this trailer takes a lot of time trying
to do painting us the picture of who the
factions are and why you're going to war
rather than jumping straight into the
action and what action we do see in the
trailer has this really odd simultaneous
effect where people who are fans the
older games might be turned off by how
different looks by moving to a
futuristic setting while people who have
never really paid that close attention
to call of duty don't see that much of a
difference in this one other than the
fact that it has a sci-fi backdrop with
the same looking kind of combat
basically it's weird for series fans but
not all that interesting Lee different
people that haven't tried that out yet
and one thing I didn't really like about
the trailer was their song choice it
didn't really give much impact to the
visuals and it just felt like a weird
attempt to tug on people's heartstrings
by using a Bowie song even though it's a
cover and on top of that what makes it
really weird is that while the song is
superficially about space it's really
about being drugged out of your mind
which by the way if that ends up being
the plot of the game where the entire
space war is just a giant loose nation
of a guy
tripping out on drugs I take it back
that's an awesome idea great bait and
switch go for an Activision so after a
good solid two two and a half minutes of
the trailer trying to build up hype for
this new setting and convincing people
that going to sci-fi is a smart move the
trailer decides to backpedal a little
bit by announcing something that people
have been wanting an HD remake of mana
warfare hype is built again but then
they decide to also announce that the
only way to get this version of the game
is to preorder and buy a limited edition
of infinite warfare meaning that if all
you really want is a remake of modern
warfare you still have to pay 60 bucks
for a game you probably don't want
overall the trailer for warfare just
didn't do much for me it felt drawn out
it was trying to paint a picture for a
setting that no one's really that
interested in because at the end of the
day people play Call of Duty because
they wanted a more modern warfare style
game if they wanted sci-fi they would
have jumped into Halo or titanfall now
in comparison the battlefield one
trailer is way way more succinct because
they don't have to take any time to
explain anything to you you know right
away that it takes place in War 1 which
tells you who the factions are when it's
taking place what kind of technology
there is so the entire thing isn't
focused on narrative and instead just
shows really fast paced action for the
kind of things that you might want to
see in a world war 1 style game the
entire trailer is just back-to-back
quick shots of things like biplanes
gas masks chemical warfare trench
warfare tanks horse riding Zeppelin's it
doesn't have to explain anything to you
is just back-to-back action and it's all
paired up with a song that adds impact
to every explosion that happens in the
trailer because the bassline matches it
and this is what I think is really
genius about the decision to go to World
War 1 because it's something that's
simultaneously interesting to people
that haven't kept track of battlefield
lately but it's also a way to pull in
long time series fans it has a certain
nostalgic factor that links back to the
gameplay of the older games in World War
2 which of course isn't going to be the
exact same as this because they are
different wars but it is a lot closer
than we've been seeing lately with
modern warfare style games and meanwhile
we've never really had a big-budget
triple-a game that takes place in World
War 1 so people that have always kind of
just had a cursory glance at the
battlefield series might see this as a
reason to give this one a shot
and this is something that dice and EA
are very acutely aware of just look at
the DLC packs they've already been
announcing the Harlem Hellfighters
Lawrence of Arabia the Red Baron all of
these things while they might just be
simple DLC packs that add unique load
outs and some weapon skins they all have
certain things that they're referencing
and evoke certain emotions and thoughts
to people that know things about war war
one which is awesome now of course all
of this is based on a pair of trailers
that combined total less than five
minutes of footage the vast majority of
which isn't actual gameplay so we don't
actually know how this is gonna turn out
until we really get the final product
for all we know battlefield one could
just end up being a reskin of
battlefield 4 that people lose interest
in really quickly and call of duty
infinite warfare could end up meeting
Activision sales goals and be a
surprisingly super fun game although
currently I really don't think that's
the way it's gonna go the point is how
you create hype for your game is really
important with the first trailer and
these are great examples of how to do it
right and how to do it wrong but let me
know what you guys think down below
which game are you more excited for what
are your hopes or your fears what do you
want out of them just let me know in the
comments down below as always if you
enjoyed the video hit that thumbs up
