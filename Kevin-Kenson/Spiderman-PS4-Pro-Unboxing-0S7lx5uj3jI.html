it's finally September 7th well a fun
time you guys are seeing this video but
the point is at spider-man on the ps4 is
finally here and one of the absolute
coolest parts about it is the limited
edition spider-man ps4
in this bundle you are of course getting
a copy of the game that comes with all
the benefits of the digital deluxe
edition but on top of that you're
getting this awesome amazing read ps4
pro with a match controller and I gotta
tell you this system is just completely
beautiful I mean it helps a little bit
that my favorite color is red so might
be a little biased here but I'm so happy
to have a ps4 Pro not only in this color
but one that just looks so nice now on
the subject of the color really quick
too by the way before I talk more in
depth about what I think of the system
one little detail I do really appreciate
is that on the Box when they talk about
what design the system is the color term
look normally I'm really bothered by the
fact that systems can't just be a color
it always to be it has to be like you
know it's not a blue system it's cobalt
blue steel gray whatever normally I find
that annoying but in this case I
actually think it's really fanatically
cool this is called amazing red and it's
not just like a fun thumb addict name
but I think it's actually accurate to
the system to you I think this is a
really excellent shade of red that looks
great on the system you don't see a ton
of red consoles these days there's a
heavy reliance on different Gray's
blacks white steel variants you don't
see a lot of just bright colors and I
think it works really well here you know
I think it's a great looking system in
fact part of me when I first saw it and
was thinking about it somatically I kind
of wish they did add a little blue to it
just to give a little bit more that
spider-man feel whether that's adding a
blue section to the mid stack here or
maybe adding blue lines to the side too
custom late the suit but honestly I
think that stuff that just makes it more
thematic Lee spider-man as far as pure
looks ago I think this really was the
right way to go and something else I
think is really appropriate about the
system is that when it comes to at least
superheroes and gaming spider-man really
is one of the biggest ones and to
finally have a system that really
celebrates that is awesome
spider-man has betrayal open games as
far back as 1982 back on the Atari 2600
which back then the game was called Bo
spider-man and since that time there
have been numerous spider-man games have
been released in fact just totaling up
all the games for he's the main
character and the title is you know
something spider-man just guess how many
that is go ahead guess commented just
I'll give you a second 33 33 games that
are simply called spider-man that's not
including downloadable mobile games
that's not including times where he made
major appearances like bar vs. Capcom or
from marvelous medallions and not even
counting all the times where a single
spider-man game comes out but it's
actually three different games because
they decide to do something different on
a handheld or a lower power system and
will they all haven't been winners I
gotta say this game is definitely
shaping up to be one of if not the best
spider-man game and arguably one of the
best superhero game is made just period
because look obviously I haven't
finished the game yet but I've already
been putting a bunch of time to it I've
been watching other people play it I've
been seeing just a whole bunch of media
surrounding it and my main takeaway
right now just the feeling that it gives
you is if your grand our franchise that
you really deeply loved and you start
thinking about things that you want to
see from it whether that's movie
adaptations or games or whatever you
start building up visions in your head
of what it would be like of what the
feeling would be and this is that game
you know it's the one of the things
where you just jump into it and you feel
like yeah this is what I wanted a
spider-man game to be like whether it's
how quickly your web slinging through
the city or how you take down a bunch of
bad guys and just plop all these crazy
moves it's just it just gives the right
feeling you know like I've said many
times before and unboxings like this I'm
always a big fan of less is more when it
comes to the limited edition design
systems and I think this really nails
that idea it's just two colors the red
and the white and it's just the big
spider-man symbol plastered right in the
middle of the system it's specific to
the ps4 version because that's the
version of the symbol that's on his
chest and at the same time it gives
anyone who sees that a clear idea
this is spider-man they don't have to
put the name on it they don't have to
put any kind of additional symbols or
anything to get the point across it's
the one main symbol and it does the job
perfectly and this is that it works
really great as well on the controller
where there's not really any symbols or
anything here they sometimes you'll see
in special editions they'll put like a
symbol on the right handle or maybe
we'll do something special with the
touchpad none of that's going on here
honestly this year has been really
really good for Sony and as far as kind
of upping the game a little bit with
PlayStation special editions I was a
little hit and miss last year but with
the days of play ps4 the God of War ps4
and last week the 500 million ps4 I
think they've been doing really good on
special edition systems this year and
this is no exception honestly if it
worked for the 500 million coming out
last week this would be my new favorite
ps4 Pro and it's very very close because
I love the color red I think the design
here is just great it's just I'm such a
sucker for that clear see-through blue
they did in the Pipers million but this
is really nice</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
