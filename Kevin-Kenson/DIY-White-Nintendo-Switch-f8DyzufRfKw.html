want to get one soon but you're not
really a fan of the colors that it comes
in I mean the main unit is really just
in black right now and the joy Collins
have plenty of very bright fun colors to
choose from but that might not be for
you now there are places that do offer
custom paint jobs but this can get
really expensive so if you're on a
budget what exactly can you do well
recently in Amazon there's been a huge
pop up of these replacement shells that
you can do yourself for way cheaper but
is it easy to do
that's what we're gonna find out right
now I personally don't do a lot of
actual like opening up and modifications
of my system so if you're like me how
hard is this to actually do on your
first try we're gonna start with
actually switching out the back plate on
the switch itself because believe it or
not this is actually the easier thing to
do because we're not doing anything with
the front we're not changing anything
with the screen we're only changing out
the back so let's see how this goes I
might even be stripping the screws a
little bit
this one's easier use those realizing
this is the Nintendo likes using these
y-shaped screws a lot for a lot of their
stuff which is also why it's basically
impossible to open these if you don't
buy like a specialty teardown kit
alright we have a working switch stand
okay so as I'm almost done screwing this
thing back closed I just realized I
forgot something
I moved the kickstand over which was
good do I did not move over the game
flap so back at it kickstands gone back
gone let's put this back together again
all right so after some trials and
tribulations and one missing screw we
have switched out the back of the well
switch and it actually looks pretty nice
I'm not a big fan of having a different
logo on the back but yeah that it was
actually pretty easy
other than a few little mix-up is on my
part but like I said this is the easier
thing to do so now let's see how the joy
cons go over so we got the back off now
here's why the joy cons are more fun the
switch with a switch or just only moving
the back plate off and that was it
everything else was staying with the joy
cons though if we want to change the
front back the whole thing we actually
have to fully gut it and then refill all
those insides into the new joy Cohn
covers okay so this is the inside of the
joy con you can see right here this
little big thing on the bottom is
actually the HD Rumble which is what
we're gonna remove next then we have to
unplug a lot of this other stuff still
so let's do that one thing we are going
to do from putting it together though is
that along with the new case covers this
also came with buttons we can change out
so instead of using the plain black ones
that are enjoyed cons we're gonna go for
a more classic kind of Japanese Famicom
style we've got the four colors
I just can't get these two frickin plug
back in
guess I didn't do put the front bumper
in I am NOT good that was almost a third
one gone okay so after losing a couple
screws and I think possibly putting a
screw in the wrong place I have put the
controller back together and actually
all the buttons and stuff feel fine okay
I definitely messed up on the trigger
yeah other than messing up the trigger I
actually almost did this right
so yeah the trigger and the release
button right here are messed up so I'm
probably enough to reopen this I am also
missing two of the screws that actually
keep the backplate on so the other two
seem to be enough to keep it together
but yeah not the best changing hub on my
part so yeah if you've never done stuff
like this before it is possible to do
this correctly if you're careful you
just have be more careful than me and
also don't do this over a carpet where
you will lose any screw that falls down
here we have the finished switch I took
care of the right joy con as well and
then I did a few fixes to the left one
that had some issues with like I said I
messed up the lock button which was
really easy to do I just had to turn the
button sideways and then the trigger
wasn't actually my mistake the molding
on the replacement one was a little off
causing it to not have the right amount
of push back so you'll see I'm actually
still using the greyjoy con center piece
and I did that for the right one as well
just so they're matching I also read
that the buttons on this one I made it
so that they're matching when they're
both sideways and joy' conformed because
that just seems cool to me you know I
gotta say this was very intimidating to
start with you know I mean especially
the droidcon because you're basically
gutting the whole thing and if you've
never done something like this before
there's that real fear that you're gonna
you know brick a joy con which is you
know you're out 50 bucks but after
you're having to reopen and do this one
a couple of times and working on the
right one it's really not that bad I
mean as long as you have a little bit of
experience and a good tool set this is
something that you can actually pretty
easily do making it definitely worth the
money
now as for the actual replacement parts
itself like I said earlier I'm not a big
fan of having this different logo on the
back I like having the colorful buttons
though and that really wasn't that hard
to change out otherwise I'm not a huge
fan of the actual white it is it's a
little too creamy for me I kind of wish
it was more of a very pale stark white
which would be a good contrast for the
parts of the switch that are just gonna
be black no matter what cuz you can't
exactly change out the screen and such
but the really cool thing about this is
because all these replacement parts come
is just you know a few bits of plastic
on the side this would be very easy to
just pick up on your own and paint
whatever color you want I mean anyone
looking into doing an actual custom
design switch pick up one of these and
paint them instead of actually changing
the shells in your current switch that
way you have the original parts for a
backup but also the white makes it a lot
easier to change up a customized if you
want so for 40 bucks this thing is
actually a pretty awesome investment I
mean yeah like I said earlier there are
professional paint jobs you can have it
done but that's gonna cost you over a
hundred bucks maybe even for just the
joint cons alone so if you're on a
budget it's really not that hard to do I
mean yes it is a little intimidating at
first but once you actually start diving
into it and get a little more confident
it's just not that big of a deal</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
