finally here the Nintendo switch has
arrived so we're going to open this
thing up try it out and let you guys
know whether or not it's worth throwing
your hard-earned money down for so let's
go ahead and just open this thing up and
wow this is actually really tiny I mean
you see pictures and you get the idea
supposed to be small I always kind of
had in my head this would be like a Wii
U tablet controller because the screens
are the same size but it's actually a
lot smaller is really into like you
could fit this in your pocket actually
there's phones that are barely smaller
than this
let's see what else we got we have joy
Khan's as well now this is the thing I
was most worried about because in all
the illustrations and despite everyone
saying it's not that bad I had trouble
believing because it just doesn't look
great to me absolutely news now these
are actually pretty nice that's actually
a lot better feeling I thought what
about like sideways because that's
that's more weird to me yeah that's a
little not as much but this is actually
really nice now this is the other way
you can use the controller is the grip
so the idea is take these and then just
hop oh that's nice that's really nice so
yeah those go away you can use a few one
he's like a regular controller and I got
to say already I actually like those
less than when I was using them free
hand these grips are really small enough
very comfortable yeah that's better and
laughs we're going to go ahead and skip
those cables no one cares the dock now
there are going to be how you actually
use the switch with your television you
just set this up somewhere got two USB
ports on the side and back here is where
we have everything else so USB C for
plugging in power additional USB port
and HDMI out you can hook it up to your
TV go ahead and get this all set up and
give it a try
this thing definitely lives up to its
namesake as it's super easy to switch
between all the systems different modes
whether you want to play games on the
big-screen TV at home sit down on the
couch and play in handheld mode or set
up a switch on its little kickstand to
play it like a little monitor now if you
want to have one of you to take around
your own house I
actually giving one away with Jon from
TLD so make sure to check out the link
down below for detail I definitely have
enjoyed using the system and handheld
mode the most where the switch feels
like a true powerhouse while using it on
the TV is still a satisfying game
experience but game visuals do take a
hit if they aren't true 1080p I haven't
used the switch in kickstand mode very
much the kickstand propping it up is
honestly just not very good it holds up
fine on a flat hard and stable service
but anything otherwise it just falls
over a lot the portability factor is
definitely one of the biggest strengths
of this system the screen and main body
is small enough to fit in your pocket if
you keep the joique on separate and
while the screen is only 720p thanks to
its small size gameplay looks fantastic
on it the only downside is its battery
life is really bad
last thing only as long as three hours
if you're doing some serious gaming
thankfully though one of the best new
features of the switch over Nintendo's
Taft handhelds is that once the battery
gets sufficiently low enough it'll enter
a suspended save state mode the eShop is
just as clean and organized as the main
UI neatly dividing things between recent
releases coming soon or just searching
for specific games while adding friends
at least right now has sadly confirmed
that we still have to use friend codes
because who doesn't enjoy remembering 12
random numbers to add their friends
instead of just a user name the one
thing that is going to throw some people
off is that the switch only comes with
an internal hard drive of 32 gigabytes
now if you're like me and you're really
stubborn and you're still buying games
physically this isn't as immediate of a
problem until you start buying DLC but
for everyone else when you're buying
stuff digitally or you want a lot of
digital only games this is going to fill
up really really fast there is a
built-in way to expand storage really
easily via an SDXC card slot hidden
underneath the kickstand the biggest
surprise for me though after actually
having spent some time with the switch
is just how much I prefer using the Joye
cons as opposed to putting them in the
comfort grip each toy con rests super
comfortably in each hand and unlike the
Wii Remote which had your hands tethered
together using a pair of joy' cons you
can just let your hands lie wherever is
most comfortable meanwhile the comfort
grip is anything but the handles aren't
particularly shaped well unless you have
smaller hands and it tracks from the
overall portable strength of the joy
comm I'm also not a very big fan of the
droidcon wrist straps using them for a
single droidcon does make the shoulder
buttons more accessible but they don't
really add anything for someone using
both joi cons and are extremely annoying
to remove especially compared to how
satisfyingly easy the joy con staff into
place on the main tablet as things
currently stand the game library for the
switch is pretty small which is normal
for a launch but Legend of Zelda breath
of the wild alone makes a pretty
compelling argument for why you want to
rush out and grab one right away even
when considering is available on the Wii
U as well how easily adaptable it is to
so many different situations is really
damn cool and provided the game library
grows with time including some more
strong first party Nintendo titles and
hopefully just a little bit of
third-party love I think it's safe to
say the switch is worth every penny</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
