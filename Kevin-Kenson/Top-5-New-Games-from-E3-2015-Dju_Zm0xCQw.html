the dust has have a little time to
settle from e3 I want to talk to you
guys about my five favorite brand new
games that were announced this past week
i'm not talking about stuff that we
already knew about and we got a little
more info on like fallout 4 halo 5 no
man's sky i'm talking about games that
we had no idea existed until this past
week starting with for honor now this
was probably the most pleasant surprise
i saw at ubisoft press conference it
looks like a very interesting fusion of
two very different war games chivalry
and dynasty warriors the basic idea is
that you have two teams of four players
taking the form of different really
popular historical factions of warriors
you've got nights Vikings and Samurai
and while there's only four players on
each team it does that whole sort of
Titan vol thing where you also have to
deal with armies of computer-controlled
enemies so while there's actually a
pretty small number of player characters
there's a lot of action going on on the
screen what makes its game really
interesting though is its approach to
combat it's not this fast paced
third-person hack and slash instead the
whole thing is very methodical looking
you have to be very careful what stance
you're using where you're blocking and
what a text you're using based on your
opponent's stance so it's a lot more
interesting looking instead of just
seeing people swing swords left and
right till things die I love the core
concept I love the art direction the
only thing I'm not completely sold on is
the 4v4 aspect of the game I kind of
want to have a little more action going
on that which may be a little add more
modes as time goes on because there's
still no release date projected for it
yet so it might be a little time before
we see this one now setup is a game that
admittedly we don't know a whole lot
about yet we've just got the opening
trailer to go off of and that's a recore
which is going to be exclusive for xbox
one now like I said we don't know a ton
about this game yet we really only have
the teaser trailer guava but from the
looks of it this is going to be a
post-apocalyptic game where you work
together with robot allies the trailer
and specific showed a dog shape to one
that works with you over a bit blows up
but then you put it in a new body which
is basically a huge giant and from the
rest of trailer it looks like you're
going to get more than just one robot
ally at a time now given this isn't a
ton of information to go off of but one
other thing we know for sure is that
it's being developed by concept which is
led by keiji inafune a the creator of
megaman so this is definitely in what I
would at least consider good hands and
definitely a title I want to know more
about given the
fact that we only had a teaser trailer
and there's no projected release date
this is probably something we're going
to see gameplay for and next year's e3
which I look forward to now third on the
list is a game that shares actually a
lot of similar ideas to wreak or but
takes it in a very different direction
and that's horizon zero dawn which is
going to be an exclusive ps4 game from
guerrilla games now where horizon is
similar to record is that it's a
post-apocalyptic game with an emphasis
on robots but like i said it goes in a
very different direction first off
instead of just being some kind of
recent apocalypse where there's a lot of
barren wasteland and dead things this is
farther in the future so you're going to
see a lot of ruins of modern-day
civilization but surrounded by lush
green forest so it's kind of have this
interesting mixture of primitive but
also futuristic vibe going on on top of
that while there are robots in the game
they're not working with you in fact
you're actually hunting down and
fighting them and they also have to be
shaped like giant dinosaurs which is
freaking awesome we did get to see some
early on footage of the gameplay during
Sony's press conference which given this
early on you kind of have to take it
with a bit of a grain of salt but if the
final product looks anything like what
we saw in the demo this game could be
absolutely stunning Guerrilla Games has
said this is going to be taking place in
an open world which as long as it's nice
and dense with interesting ruins and a
lot more robot monsters I'm totally in
you know I after a bit I've never really
been a huge fan of guerrilla games his
flagship series kill zone but if horizon
does end up being as tactical and as
intense as the demo made it look out to
be I could quickly shift my opinion of
them now fourth up is a game that was
probably one of the biggest surprises at
this year's e3 it was the sole moment of
emotion and soul during the entire EA
press conference and that's unraveled
now this game really blew up in
popularity right after the press
conference because it's one of the few
games that we saw at a press conference
where the developer stood up and really
just talked about it sounded like an
actual labor of love for him and not
just what kind of game is going to get
the biggest sales margins now given when
you look at a game like this the whole
yard aesthetic isn't exactly something
new we've been seeing a lot of this
lately but what makes unravel
interesting is that it looks like the
yarn is actually to play a very central
part in the game's mechanics when you
use the string that makes up your knees
body to connect two things or swing from
place to place that's actually using up
some of the yarn that creates him so as
you
was more and more of it you're gonna get
smaller and smaller and eventually run
out so a lot of the game is going to be
focused on not only using yarn to get
places but doing it smartly so you don't
run out the indie style platformer is
definitely something we've been seeing a
lot of in the past couple years and
starting to be a very very dense genre
but unravel looks like it has enough
interesting unique things and a great
aesthetic to really help it stand out
amongst all the rest now we don't know
for sure what platforms this is all
going to be available on just yet the
only one we know for a fact is that it
will be available on PC because you can
already rode it on origin for twenty
bucks now last and somewhat least on
this list is the legend of zelda
triforce heroes you know honestly
overall I really didn't care for
nintendo's press conference this year
but this was the one game that actually
stood out to me because admittedly I'm a
pretty big fan of legend zelda but i'm
also a huge fan of co-op focused games
you know i'm really happy to see that
nintendo is re exploring the hole for
sword style dynamic but i like the fact
that are actually trying to also
reinvent it by adding a lot more
mechanics to make it stand out a little
more specifically the fact that you can
now pick up other players to move them
around or create a totem pole there's
now a class system where you can
actually specialize each of your links a
little differently so you can each have
a different strengths in the party and
there's an emotes ystem so even if
you're playing online you have ways of
signaling and telling other players what
you need them to do in order to solve
puzzles this is far from being one of
the flashiest announcements at this
year's e3 but honestly it's one of the
ones where I can really see myself just
having good genuine fun want to get
together with a few friends and play it
now I'm gonna cheat just a little bit
because I know I said five games I was
excited for but there's one more i want
to talk about and it's one that I got
really hyped for when I first saw the
trailer but as time went on I've had a
little more time to kind of be more
morbidly curious than anything and
that's the Final Fantasy 7 remake you
know growing up final fantasy was easily
my favorite franchise but in the past
decade it's really kind of turned into
something more of almost an abusive
relationship and wall square does have a
lot of great base material to work with
the fact that this is going to be a
proper full remake and looking at what
they've done in recent years I can't
help but wonder what kind of changes
they'll make and whether or not it's
going to be for the better because
honestly I really doubt we're going to
see it just be a graphical remake you
know we're going to see a redone combat
system redone gameplay mechanics and
maybe even some minor changes to the
plot
change on its own is fine but like I
said looking at their more recent work
I'm not sure how they're going to end up
handling it so am I excited for it yeah
but there's also this voice in the back
of my head constantly going it's
probably not going to be what you're
hoping it's going to be and you're gonna
end up getting disappointed but we'll
find out you know given the fact that we
really only got a teaser trailer we're
probably not going to see this game for
a while I'm willing to bet were not
gonna see it till 2017 because that
would be the 20 year anniversary of when
ff7 was originally launched so there you
guys have it my favorite games that were
announced at this year's e3 there were a
few other titles that showed up and of
course more information on titles we've
already learned about so make sure to
let me know down the comments what games
you were really excited to hear about
this year as always if you enjoyed this
video hit that thumbs up button to let
me know and subscribe as well as follow
me on twitter I'll be seeing you guys
soon with more content but until then
I'm Kevin kenzan and I'll see you guys
later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
