Dragonball Fighters and if you're a huge
fan of the franchise and this is one of
your first fighting games you might be
thinking to yourself you want to get a
fight stick or some kind of fighting
game focus controller so what are the
options out there for you first let's
talk fight sticks now when you're
looking into fight sticks generally
you're gonna see them fall into one of
two different size categories the
smaller and more affordable which can
look like this now this one is branded
for Street Fighter 5 but the main point
of this controller is to show that a lot
of these smaller ones like to use a 6
button setup which if you've just
started Dragon Ball fighters might worry
you a little bit because it seems like
the game needs all eight buttons it uses
all four front-facing and all four
shoulders but in fact you actually can
use it like a six button fighter because
you can simulate two of those eight
buttons by using simultaneous button
presses for example you could use light
and medium attack at the same time to do
a dragon rush so with that in mind and
some fun reconfiguration you can use a
six button setup like this no problem
and Dragon Ball although honestly for me
personally I still like using an a
button setup because that means you
never have any situations where you hit
four buttons simultaneously you're only
ever gonna rely on either two or one
button press now the other hand if you
want to get serious and throw down some
real money you can get a full sized
stick like these big guys right here now
these are both examples per what you can
get on the ps4 and they just some the
more popular options this right here is
the horror real arcade pro 4 and it's
for the knowing that they do make an
xbox one version of this stick as well
and over here we have the even more
expensive option which is the combi
obsidian now first let's actually talk
about this more expensive one right here
and why it's expensive so the main
reason of the pricing on this one is
that this makes use of what are called
Sanwa densey buttons and sticks which if
you haven't heard of them before
that's basically the industry standard
for arcade systems that's like the
serious buttons that you'll see at
actual arcade setups and it's basically
the go-to for a lot of the pro players
now on the other hand with the real
arcade pro this is horror using their
own manufactured in-house buttons which
they call the Hayabusa stick and buttons
which are still
good just not quite up to the same stuff
as these ones right here especially
since this actually has like some name
power behind it you forgot to say Lord
as for how this actually plays out in
first-hand experience for being 50 bucks
less the real Arcade Pro for actually
comes very very close to the Obsidian
now if you're like a really high level
player you know how to notice all the my
new differences yes you're probably
gonna have it pains about which one's
better and honestly I'm not sure why
you're watching this video but for
people that are new to fighters and just
want to get investing into a stick this
is a really solid option the main place
you're gonna notice a difference is when
it comes to those buttons I was talking
about earlier there's a reason why the
Sanwa Tenchi are a sort of industry
standard they have a perfect balance of
needing just enough pressure to activate
but they're not can that be
accidentally pressed too often the
Hayabusa one's the real acade pro 4 on
the other hand are a little more
sensitive it's enough to where you're
not gonna be accidentally pressing
buttons all the time it's not as though
the slightest breeze is going to
activate all these buttons up here but
if you are very particular and you have
a habit of accidentally flailing a
little much the extra sensitivity of
these can be an issue also if you're the
kind of player that likes to flail
around a lot having the options button
up here with all the others can be a
problem because if you're hitting stuff
constantly and you accidentally graze
this thing you are going to pause
mid-match which is well a problem
otherwise though we're just talking
about the build quality in the body the
stick quality everything else here is
pretty much on par so if you're looking
to invest in an actual serious fighting
stick for starting to play Dragonball
Fighters this is going to be an awesome
option 50 bucks less and if you want to
go all-out the obsidian is going to be
the one you want to look at well they're
both using square gates which you can
modify to an octagon if you prefer yeah
yeah I know
now of course fight sticks are not the
only option you can choose just stick
with a good old-fashioned game pad and
while you can use the stock one that
comes with your system you can look into
those that are made specifically for
fighting games in mind one of the most
popular of which is the fighting
commander from Horry which is available
on both PlayStation and Xbox
the fighting commander is an awesome
controller for most fighting games but
for Dragon Ball in particular there are
some things to keep in mind that might
win or lose you over it first off this
thing was designed for six button
fighters in mind like Street Fighter so
it has the six button setup on the front
which like I said you can treat dragon
ball like a six button fighter but it's
a little more awkward on a gamepad than
it is on a fight stick because when you
want to hit these buttons simultaneously
you gather have to quickly wrap your
hand around to hit two or kind of just
smash to it once with your thumb which
really isn't the most precise gesture
you do still have shoulder buttons so
you can use those if you prefer but
because the fighting commander was
definitely made for Street Fighter in
mind the shoulder buttons are well not
that great they'll get the job done
they're just not as good as the
front-facing buttons are that aside this
controller does have some awesome
benefits over regular ones for instance
if you like using d-pad for your
fighters this one is just a much better
option the ones that are gonna come on a
regular Xbox one or PlayStation 4
controller so if you like using d-pad
and you don't mind using the kind of
okay shoulder buttons this is an awesome
alternative option if however you prefer
using stick and you don't like the idea
the six button setup on the front
honestly the stock Xbox one or ps4
controller is still a great option for
dragon ball fighters</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
