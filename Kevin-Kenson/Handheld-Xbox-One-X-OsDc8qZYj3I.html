a video idea that was something that was
extremely unnecessary over-the-top and
not at all something functionally
someone chair ever do but at the same
time is really cool so let's do one of
those
the idea here is simple Nintendo has the
switch the 3ds all the handhelds they've
ever done Sony has the Vita but Xbox
still has not really dived into doing
handhelds just yet and it's just got me
thinking more to be like to have
Microsoft franchises on a portable
handheld device so we made one kind of
now obviously at this moment we cannot
take an entire Xbox 1x and cram it down
into a small hand out
that system is already as it is very
compact so instead the idea here is that
we are taking an Xbox one X and
transmitting that signal to a portable
setup in this case we're using a 7-inch
small HD screen rigged onto our Xbox one
controller which looks successful right
now but there were a few trials and
errors with this idea the original idea
we had was to grab one of those Xbox one
controller phone clips you know the
things that you attach that you can
watch Netflix or do a phone call or
something at the same Hema gaming I'm
honestly actually not sure why a lot of
people use those but the idea was we
were gonna grab one and attach the
smaller HD screen which was a 5 inch and
clip that on and use that where they
became an issue though is that while the
5 inch screen isn't that heavy the
receiver for the wireless HDMI signal
we're using is much heavier so when you
have that whole package together the
phone clip really wouldn't handle it all
would just snap off or maybe even
scratch the controller it was just it
was just not gonna work it was a bad
idea so instead we upgraded to using one
of these camera arm clips which this
screen is actually designed to lock on
to perfectly fine so that works really
well and the Xbox one controller happens
to be just the right size for it to
still clip comfortably on - so how is
this all working we've already explained
the monitor on the arm of the controller
that's all setup but how are we getting
the video signal so on the back of the
small HD is this thing called the
Teradek a really high quality HDMI
wireless transmitter and receiver
package it's usually used for filming on
TV sets that kind of thing it basically
allows you to transmit a 1080p signal
over a pretty good distance while having
virtually no latency so now that we've
got this whole thing rigged up I mean
it's a little bit of monstrosity but it
works and on the One X's end it's really
simple you just take a 1x hook it into a
wall for power and then for the HDMI
signal you plug in the transmitter for
the Teradek and once you have that all
together you have a functioning handheld
Xbox one X I mean it's a little heavy a
little unsightly a little awkward actual
to use but you can pick it up and play
games handheld I mean we even have cut
head running right here and yeah just
walk around playing the game so it works
the only thing about it though is that
as we have it set up right now it's not
really a 3ds or switch or Vita kind of
situation it's more
the Wii U Wii U you're still tied to
being in so much distance from the Xbox
itself I mean you're not even just
limited by how far the Teradek can
communicate but also by the controller
when once you're out of range for the
Xbox one controller to work with the
system it's just not really a worthwhile
setup so we had a even crazy ready to
take this one step farther
the solution is simple if you need to be
within a certain range of the Xbox just
bring the Xbox with you so all we did
was get a backpack with some
breathability so the Xbox doesn't
overheat but we have the Xbox hooked up
to a portable battery that's giving it
all the charge it needs all lit being
plugged into the tear duct which has its
own battery as well so you just keep
this guy on your back and you have
plenty of clothes ative distance to
still use this little portable setup
right here so is in practical and insane
and kind of dumb as this idea is which
by the way make sure to scribe for more
stuff like this but doing it actually
really kind of giving this idea
I can't wait for hint Hill to reach this
level I mean don't get me wrong I love
the switch as it is right now but it
still limits you to a 720p resolution
screen and even when you're playing more
pretty games on it they're not really
hitting the same graphical levels as
something could on next box 1x where
you're getting you know a 4k image
that's super sample then brought down
and in 1080p resolution ends this
beautiful handheld experience I want
that to happen hopefully soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
