of the bloodiest gaming franchises ever
to exist and the third game to come out
of NetherRealm Studios is coming out
tomorrow before you guys pick it up
here's five things you should know that
are they're going to get you hyped up or
kind of worried about the game starting
with the single-player mode with only
two other games under their belt
NetherRealm Studios is already building
a really strong history of offering the
best single-player story modes for any
fighting game at least in my opinion it
offers the perfect mixture of cinematic
and almost movie like storytelling but
seamlessly switching in and out of
fights while changing from different
character perspectives
you know honestly it's a very rare that
I would ever recommend any kind of game
with a focus on multiplayer like
competitive shooters or fighting games
solely for the single-player mode but
this is one of those franchises or it
can actually be completely worth it
second up is the game's fighting style
system one of the things that Mortal
Kombat X is doing a little differently
this time is the fact that every
character has three different versions
you can play so if you've got a
character that you absolutely love but
you don't like the first fighting style
you try out for them well there's going
to be two others to choose from that
just might fit your play style
now this isn't like what they've done
before they did do it with something
similar to this where characters could
change between different fighting styles
mid combat but this is actually three
completely different versions of the
character where some moves might be
shared in common like you know really
signature special attacks but they all
might have their own unique little spin
based on which style you're using third
up is another returning and remixed
mechanic which is brutalities now the
game still has the whole series
traditional fatality where once an
enemies downed you can enter the right
button combination to do a really gory
finish but what makes brutalities
different is that they require you to
finish off your opponent in a very
specific way what's awesome about this
is that not only does it give you more
variety and ways to finish off opponents
but it's kind of a built-in way of
taunting someone the fact that you can
finish an opponent off with a very
specific move and they know that's what
you were going for that whole time which
is a really aggravating feeling when you
can't stop them from doing so now the
fourth point has a little less to do
with Mortal Kombat X and more to do with
nether realm themselves as a studio and
that's the fact that they are a really
responsive dev team more than any other
fighting series out there Mortal Kombat
9 and injustice both featured a lot of
really quick and responsive patching to
any problems found within the
game well there's bugs that people
discover or massive imbalances where one
character is clearly better than
everyone else NetherRealm constantly
works hard to bring out patches more
consistently than any other dev team to
make sure the fighting game experience
stays consistently balanced and
entertaining now I know so far these
points have all been positive but I do
have one pretty big negative about this
game that does bother me and that's the
way they're handling DLC now just like
in both Mortal Kombat 9 and injustice
this game already has an announced
season pass with four characters already
fully revealed who you're gonna have to
pay for later on the season pass costing
you a whole extra 30 bucks meaning
you're basically paying another whole
half of a game for four more characters
now in their defense this time around
there is an interesting new feature
where you're going to be able to try
these characters out before having to
buy them but that still doesn't change
the fact that you're turning a $60 game
into a $90 purchase if you want the full
thing on top of that looking at series
history both Mortal Kombat 9 and man
justice had a complete edition released
later on in one case 10 months later
another one only 5 months later where
you could just buy the game with all the
DLC included at the same launch price or
even lower at 40 bucks so it's kind of
hard to justify buying a game at launch
date when you can just wait half a year
to get all the content together at a
lower price overall now of course all
this info is based on developer previews
interviews and early reviews so a lot of
this could end up changing in my final
review which I'll let you guys know
after I pick the game up tomorrow until
then though as always guys if you enjoy
the video hit that thumbs up button to
let me know subscribe if you haven't yet
I'm Kevan Kenson and I'll see you guys
later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
