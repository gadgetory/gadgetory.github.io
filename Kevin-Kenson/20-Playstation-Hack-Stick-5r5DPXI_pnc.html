is not exactly done well within a month
of its release it price dropped to
almost half its price from $100 down to
60 and some places even sell it below
$50 so it's pretty clear that Sony's not
exactly recaptured the same kind of
popularity that Nintendo had with the
NES and SNES classic now there are
numerous reasons why this happened we'll
get into some of them but there's one
company that might actually have a
solution that at least partially fixes
some of the major ones and that's 8-bit
dough with this little controller
adapter so why did the classic fail well
once again there are a whole lot of
things but I think there's two main
reasons why it didn't do well one game
selection which there isn't a whole lot
you can do about that post-release
outside of actually full-blown hacking
homebrewing just putting whatever games
you want on it and that's somewhat
defeats the spirit of what it's supposed
to be about although I do agree game
choice not the best possible ones the
other big problem however is the lack of
options something that the NES intestine
II editions did that it was really
appreciated by a lot of people is how
much you could customize the experience
of the games you're playing changing the
aspect ratio adding borders having
scanlines
all kinds of different changes and the
PlayStation Classic basically offered
none of that and to top it off all the
games that are being run are running in
their pl versions meaning that they're
playing at 50 frames second instead of
60 which a lot of people in North
America would be used to and a lot of
games just honestly look and play worse
as a result that's where this adapter
comes in so this is actually the same
kind of USB adapter that a pedo is made
in the past you might have seen it in a
more Mario brick-red design which allows
you to use a variety of different
controllers on other consoles for
instance you can use on the switch an
Xbox one controller ps4 controller so
and so forth well this is the same idea
made for the PlayStation Classic and it
allows you to once again use a lot of
different controllers wireless so you
couldn't do normally and that's by
itself already an appreciated thing
because well I get the idea behind
having wired controllers on a classic
system it's kind of a bit too much
novelty versus functionality it's great
having a wireless controller but what
this does beyond that that's really
interesting is that it gives you access
to basically a secret menu on the
PlayStation Classic see the PlayStation
Classic is basically
a very simple computer that runs a
dedicated PlayStation emulator an
emulator that if you were running on say
a computer would give you access to an
emulation menu where you could change
all kinds of settings
well when Sony shipped the PlayStation
Classic obviously there's no way to
access that menu using a traditional
controller but what if Bedok has done is
that with this adapter and you're using
any kind of wireless controller whether
it's an Xbox one a Dual Shock one of
their Bluetooth controllers whatever you
have access to a special shortcut where
if you hit the shoulder buttons and
start at the same time voila
you have access to that emulators
options how much does this impact the
experience in the classic and can it
save it let's check it out the first
thing we need to do is set up the
adapter with the PlayStation Classic
which is actually really really easy to
do all I have to do is plug it into the
slot and then you just have to hit the
syncing button and whatever control you
want to use you use a different button
combination how you want to sync it so
for instance on a DualShock 4 controller
you're gonna hit the normal home button
that you'd use for pairing sometimes
button you're gonna hit it with the
share button at the same time that's how
you use the DualShock 4 controller with
a variety of different Bluetooth devices
and it works and so right now we're
using with the DualShock 4 controller
because that just makes the most sense
you know playstation but again you can
use this adapter with a variety of
different controllers including Xbox one
or just a pin to Bluetooth controllers
in general so the interesting thing here
though is accessing that menu so first
we have to go into a game I've already
got a session of Final Fantasy 7 running
so we'll just go there so once we're in
our game of choice you can access the
emulators menu using this adapter by
hitting the shoulder buttons and options
at the same time of Duloc the controls
vary depending on what you're using so
just hit that and there's our menus so
there's actually a lot of in-depth stuff
you can mess with here you can redo
controls you can do save and load States
although there's already a slightly
prettier way of doing that built into
the PS classics menu however we're most
interested in is messing with the
display properties on this gun or
options so right here in region it's set
to auto and we can actually change it to
NTSC and that's going to change the
framerate the games being played at now
obviously in a video you can't actually
see the difference of framerate but we
can also turn on an FPS counter so you
can actually see it in the bottom of the
screen you can see in the bottom that we
are gonna getting basically 50 frames a
second so if we switch it back Oh
we're gonna change this again and this
time we're gonna leave the FPS counter
on but we're gonna switch it to NTSC and
there we go the game is now running at
60 frames so it's a little smoother
looking and just honestly it's just more
appealing to the eyes especially if you
grew up only on 60 Hertz screens this is
just this the game looks right now now
this isn't the only thing we can change
with this once again there's a lot of
other options you can get in-depth on
for instance we can add scan lines so
for that we just go to options go to
display and then there's toggle for
turning scan lens on or off and then you
can also adjust the brightness of them
so that'll change how exactly those
lines look so if you really want an
old-school feeling like if you grew up
playing your original PlayStation on a
CRT this is gonna capture that
appearance a little more faithfully so
yeah here we have the game now running
at 60 frames with scan lines which just
honestly looks a lot better than if we
had left it the way the PlayStation
Classic wanted you to play it without
having them and running at that lower
frame rate now these are pretty in-depth
emulator options if you've never messed
with an emulator before you might want
to be a little careful about what you
messed with because sometimes you're
gonna have pretty funny consequences for
instance let's take a look at messing
with the frame limit if you go into the
Advanced Options on the settings you can
go to what's called disable frame
limiter and what that's saying is that
hey instead of the game running at only
50 or 60 just let it run as fast as it
can run and that might sound really good
if you're used to messing with settings
on modern games but older stuff isn't
always programmed that way so if you do
that not only is the game going to run
at a higher framerate but it's actually
going to be running in a fast forward
way with even the music playing faster
which might not always be best for a
gameplay but can be really silly looking
another thing worth noting with all of
this is that all these settings can
adjust and mess with they are
temporarily saved it is not something
that's going to be on every time so each
time you launch a specific game you need
to reopen the menu to make any
adjustments you want to make so if
there's anything that a certain specific
way you like to play the game where you
have the scanline set to a certain way
having such a specific region you got to
do that every time the game launches so
the important question does this adapter
save the PlayStation Classic a little
bit look
there still are some major problems the
system has in general I mean the game
library while there are a few individual
great hits I don't think it's really a
great overall crowd-pleaser but when it
comes to at least getting more out of
those individual games in the experience
compared to how I launched it was $100
to come with wired controllers and all
these locked settings but now after
price drops and buying this little
adapter for 80 bucks assuming you have
some kind of controller that will be
compatible with the adapter you now have
a full set up that is wireless and
offers a lot more control over how the
games play I still think it doesn't
match up to the same level of quality
we've seen with what Nintendo's done
with their classic editions but this
undoes a lot of the damage and I think
if you're a hardcore PlayStation fan
it's actually something really worth
looking into</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
