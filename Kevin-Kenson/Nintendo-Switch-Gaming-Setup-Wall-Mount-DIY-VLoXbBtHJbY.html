the channel lately is bringing guys some
different gaming setup ideas what an
excellent they wanted to do with a
switch gaming desk setup which this is
the kind of basic idea what we'd have
you know monitor dog you little
knickknacks charging station but I got
really bored of the idea and it occurred
to me that the switch really is a
traditional gaming system you know a lot
of the stuff that we've done in setups
in the past don't necessarily have to
apply to the rules of the switch so I
thought instead of doing something
traditional like this what if we did
something a little bit different
the idea here is to do away with any
kind of entertainment console or desk or
any kind of actual main thing to put the
system on instead just build the whole
thing on the wall now for here in this
room I decided I want to make use of the
support beam this isn't necessarily an
option for everyone obviously so a lot
of this can also be done on a wall we'll
walk through all different options but
first we need to actually put a TV up
here now if you're going to set up on a
trigger flat wall you can just make use
of any kind of TV wall mount setup but
since we're using a beam here
we're instead going to be using a car
bleeding clamp this is just something
that's used in a lot of different like
TV set stuff we had it lying around and
it fit our purposes but there's plenty
of other options out there so we're just
going to set that up right here alright
so we get that fastened on there so now
let's go get our TV okay so I lied a
little bit when I said TV we're not
actually going to use a TV we're going
to use a monitor this monitor which
actually features recently in my back
school gaming accessories video it's a
1080p monitor all you really need to the
switch don't exactly have to worry about
stuff like 4k so color sharpness all
good everything we want in a switch
monitor
okay next we need to find a way to
secure our switch talk to the wall
though there's a few ways you can go
about this but the way that I've chosen
to go with our command strips this is a
really simple and easy way to attach to
the back of this give a way to remove it
easily later if you need to and to be
nice and securely safe on here a single
one of these is meant to support sixteen
pounds of weight considering that a
switch in the dock with joy cons is
about a pound and a half one is more
than enough but also considering the 300
system I'm going to use two anyways make
sure this is centered we want to before
we press down too hard and
we might have to seal that now we stop
to take care of some cabling and stuff
but really these two objects alone are
pretty much all you need for a
functioning switch setup but you can add
more stuff if you like I mean you can
have shelves put amiibos or you know
places to store extra controllers or
other accessories for me the bare
minimum that I'd like to add is a place
to charge additional joy cons so I want
to keep it this whole vertical aesthetic
going on to probably have it down here
relative because this is going to be
ridiculous that's just silly don't do
that that's a dumb idea
so yeah probably down around here next
is everyone's favorite part of any setup
table management now thankfully this is
a very light setup as far as cables go
there's really only four we have to
worry about there's power for the TV
power for the switch HDMI from the
switch to TV and there's gonna be a USB
charge cable running from this charge
dock right here into the switch now if
you're doing this against the wall
there's a couple ways you can do this
you could arrange the cables in a ways
it's actually kind of artsy and
cool-looking or you can just hide it
using conduit here those since we're
using this support beam all we can do is
just hide them right behind so we've got
all the functional bits set up but it's
created this rather nice-looking
minimalist setup but what's the point
being this minimalist if there's just
something a little extra make it really
stand out so we want to add one more
thing to make it a lot more flashy Huw
strips set up inside of the support beam
right now we're going with colors that
match the joy columns and give a lot
more separation between the setup and
the wall behind it
so there you have it a minimal switch
setup the next use of no shelves no desk
no entertainment console just an open
wall that you have available which is
really kind of the beauty of it it's a
simple setup that shows you don't need
to have a lot of stuff and it's really
customizable if you do want to add more
things I mean this is just kind of the
basic kit right here but you can add
additional shelves or companies to do
things like hold extra joy cons pro
controllers display amiibos all kinds of
options that the way this setup can be
adapted to different living situations
which is really just the beauty of it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
