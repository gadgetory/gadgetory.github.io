guys a review a little bit later than I
originally planned III really derailed a
lot of my other work but I'm really
stubborn better late than never so
finally here is my full review of
watchdogs available on ps3 ps4 xbox 360
xbox one Wii U and the pc all the
gameplay are going to be seeing here as
well as my personal experience on the
game is based on the pc version so let's
draw for getting the one really big
obvious elephant in the room out of the
way about this game watch dogs looks
nothing like what we originally shown or
promised back in III of 2012 and in fact
there's even mods coming out already
making use of unused files in watch dogs
to make it look like it was originally
promised to look like while those of you
on console are basically stuck with what
they gave you there has been talk of
performance updates for the console
versions as time goes on but the fact
that matter is that as the game ships
watch dogs is nothing like what we
originally promised as far as it goes
visually and even for how it looks the
frame rate and just how it runs overall
is just really sluggish that being said
a belief that I've always held for
myself is that at the end of the day
visuals and graphics alone do not make
the game it's not the reason why I'm
picking up in the first place it's
definitely a really big plus when it
actually is done correctly and it's what
we were promised in the first place but
it alone will not destroy the game so
let's take a look at how watchdogs
itself actually plays so as far as the
core gameplay itself goes the easiest
way to sum up watch dogs is grand theft
auto Assassin's Creed the gore gameplay
is pretty familiar to anyone that's
played a grand theft auto title or a
similar Open City focused game but the
one thing really setting watchdogs apart
is focus on hacking which really comes
down to just pressing X while looking at
something and interact with it in some
way whether it's steal money from a
person's account interact with an object
at range or hack from camera to camera
otherwise this is all pretty much very
familiar territory gunplay is decent
making use of cover controls at a focus
mode to make lining up headshots super
easy stealth gameplay is actually pretty
good up until you figure out how abusive
some powers are namely blackout and
driving is by far the game's weeks link
featuring vehicles with awkward handling
ridiculous collision physics and some of
the most aggressive insane cops I've
ever seen in a game like this even buy
GTA standards this wouldn't be that big
of a problem if it wasn't for the fact
that a lot of the mission
end up relying a lot on car chases
either by you hounding down a single guy
which really isn't that bad since your
car is almost always unstoppable or
having you run away from thugs or cops
the first of which is usually better
solved by just getting out of your car
and killing everyone while the latter is
easily solved by just going to the
nearest body of water and swimming out
because apparently Chicago has no police
boats and helicopters don't believe that
people can actually swim so everything
involving cars is pretty much terrible
but as far as the actual gun plane
stealth goes as I said earlier is
actually pretty solid and its really
helped out by the game's hacking
mechanics while it is possible to shoot
or sneak your way out through most
situations hacking free making you see
the environment really is one of the
game's most satisfying feelings taking
out enemies that are hanging by some
sort of explosive raising a protective
barrier to hide behind or even just
using cameras to scope out enemy
locations and remotely take them down
before even setting foot on restricted
territory cameras are actually some of
the most interesting parts of the game
for me using them to scope out enemy
bases or leading other characters to
safety or just figuring out really
complex ways to find a switch you need
to hit to move on now where Assassin's
Creed comes into play in all this is
basically just how the gameplay flows
and watchdogs there's a certain
formulaic pattern we're seeing a lot of
Ubisoft's action games with free roam
elements in which you have to go to a
tower or some kind of central point to
unlock the rest of the side quests and
abilities you can use and then you just
take part in really really repetitive
side quests what watchdogs does though
to make these more appealing is the
game's progression system there are a
lot of different things you can do on
the side in this game and pretty much
all of them can end up rewarding you in
some way whether it's unlocking a
vehicle or a gun or unlocking a talent
you can purchase that's really useful
like upping reload speed or lengthening
focus time and this is where my main
overall issue really comes with
watchdogs it feels like there's just so
many different ideas and so many
different types of content the
developers really wanted to cram into
this game but they just made it all fit
in without really taking any time to
polish any of them individually some of
them are genuinely really fun but others
are just really painful for instance
most of the vigilante quests like
stopping crimes or destroying gang
hideouts are just incredibly repetitive
once you've done one of them you've done
them all and you just feel zero impulse
to keep doing them unless you really
want to get a certain weapon or talent
unlocked which just ends up feeling
tedious on the other hand though you
have stuff like the digital trip
it's especially spider tank which are
really fun fully developed side
minigames that actually found more
enjoyable than most of the core game
then there's the game's multiplayer
modes which were really hit and miss for
me the main multiplayer option is
invasion and hacking in which a player
can invade another one's world quietly
and they can start tailing or hacking
into the other player system forcing a
cat-and-mouse situation where the
invader tries to hide but stay in range
while the home player searches for them
there's other modes to like racing
featuring the use of hackable obstacles
3v3 competitive matches focused on
decryption and even the ability to just
have multiple layers share one world to
free roam around in free options are
great for doing things with friends but
honestly I didn't care that much at all
for the main hacking minigame especially
as the invade II mostly just because
whether you win or lose it just feels
like it was an interruption to what you
were trying to do in the single-player
game and wasn't even that interesting of
an interruption because now you just
have to spend time running around and
just look at the right person or if
you're in the invader just find a stupid
easy spot to hide in plain sight and
just watch while the other person runs
around blind I can see what they were
trying to do here in terms of trying to
make a sort of spy vs spy minigame which
is really cool sounding in concept but
the way it was implemented in a free
roam open world just didn't really work
in my opinion in the end my final
thoughts on watch dogs is exactly what I
said earlier there's just a lot of stuff
crammed in here all at once some of
which works some of which doesn't it
just doesn't feel like any of it got the
full degree of attention it needed I
don't want to give you guys an overall
super- look at the game it's still fun
to play and the single-player story was
a lot better than I expected it to be
and some of the game's side content is
really enjoyable and worth playing if
you're looking for a game to do some fun
silly free roam stuff in then there's
other games in this genre that have
handled it better but if you want a free
roam game with a solid story mode and a
handful of solid minigames then watch
dogs is worth playing at least some
point down the road by no means is it
the must by blockbuster Ubisoft built it
up to be but at the same time it still
has its strong points and fun bits to
experience well that was my review of
watchdogs if you guys are interested in
trying out the game for yourself I do
have a link posted down to the
description with pricing and
availability and while you're down there
