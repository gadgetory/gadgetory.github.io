the emphasis was on three things
PR VR and well more VR and after having
gotten a chance to try out all three the
major headsets back-to-back the oculus
rift PlayStation VR and HTC vive I've
drawn some conclusions first off the
games and demos being shown off and in
development appealed to two very
different audiences interested in VR one
that's focused on the simulation aspect
trying to create immersive almost real
feeling worlds for people to interact
with at the expense of anything overly
gamey
on the other hand there's people that
want video games in virtual reality
now when it comes to the more simulation
II stuff the vibe is definitely the
front-runner of the three the emphasis
on full-body VR gives the by the sense
of immersion that you just can't capture
with other headsets that have you sit
down holding a controller on the flip
side though the emphasis on having you
do the movement yourself within a small
area also limits the kind of games and
experiences available on it as an
example the two games I tried were
Everest a mountain climbing game and
Star Wars trials of Tatooine
now everest was an awesome experience
from the viewpoint of being able to look
around from the top of a mountain and
see your progress across it but the
emphasis of the experience was clearly
on just sucking you into this virtual
realm and didn't really offer anything
that I would call game-like on the other
hand the Star Wars game was pretty
freakin awesome from the standpoint of
being inside of Star Wars seeing the
Millennium Falcon fly over your head but
at the same time felt oddly restrictive
boiling the game mechanics down to
simply pushing some buttons when told
and then play laser baseball against
some stormtroopers since the limited
field of movement restricts you from
running up to them both experiences made
for brilliant tech demos but neither
felt like something I'd want to rush out
and buy for the game experience alone
though in all honesty I might just get
child of Tatooine because I'm not awful
of a Star Wars fan on the other hand my
experience with both the oculus and
PlayStation VR felt like much more
familiar and fully formed game concepts
that just had some kind of interesting
new twist
thanks to VR I think one of the best
comparisons of this was my experience
with Crytek's the climb using the oculus
rift versus what I did with Everest on
the by once again Everest was a super
cool immersive experience but you had to
take your time with what you're doing
while playing the climb was a much
faster paced game something akin to
Mirror's Edge focused solely on climbing
yes it wasn't anywhere near as immersive
but it felt more like something I would
want to buy in play and had gamey
aspects that honestly felt almost
impossible with the vibe such as being
able to finish a stage within a certain
time limit and comparing that to my
friends
now given the jump to VR in general
whether seated or standing does present
some questions about what kind of games
are exactly feasible an obvious answer
would be anything with a cockpit whether
it's a spaceship diving vessel or a mech
like in rigs for the psvr the thing is
though VR has applications that aren't
very obvious to most people when they're
applied to current game formulas and
easily the best example of this to me
was Chronos from gunfire games Chronos
takes the traditional third-person
action game as we know it's something
along the lines of a child between Dark
Souls and Darksiders but applies the use
of VR in an interesting way the whole
game is played with what you might
consider fixed camera positions but ones
that you have full 360 control of so you
never have to keep your eyes directly on
your character you're free to look
around explore the backgrounds take a
look at what lies across the bridge
which gives players a new sense of scale
that was previously impossible with a
regular TV setup and this is honestly
where VR gets me more excited and why
I'm personally looking more forward to
the oculus and psvr
over the vibe the vibe creates the most
lifelike experiences of the three but
it's such a jump forward that there are
some between steps I think we're missing
for seeing where games can go I'm not
saying that I won't have cool and
awesome game experiences on it and
honestly it will have the most unique
ones but the focus on full body movement
combined with the highest barrier of
entry thanks to pricing and spacing
needs leads me to think that it's going
to have the lowest density of strong
games to experience leaving it's
something that will appeal mostly to
people that are just diehard fans of VR
Aztec and the future potential it holds
meanwhile the rift and PSP are are
looking to be the first choice for a lot
of people PS VR has the benefit of not
only being the cheapest headset to grab
by itself but also cheapest overall if
you compare the price of grabbing the
headset with a ps4 end camera versus
grabbing an oculus survive and building
the PC me-ness
use them it does offer the least
graphically intense experience of the
three but the gap isn't so large as to
make it seem awful in comparison and
when it comes to form factor and comfort
it was easily the best one for me
oculus on the other hand will be a first
pick for anyone dedicated to having a
gaming PC over a console and it's not
only cheaper than the vibe but once
again it's easier to integrate into your
desk setup since you can just play
seated in your chair rather than having
to set up a dedicated room or space to
it all that being said all three
headsets have their strengths and based
on what I've experienced with them all
of them are gonna open up new
opportunities in gaming that's just
gonna get cooler as the years go by and
I cannot wait as always thank you so
much for watching if you want to show
