now and the Xbox 1x has just finally
been released and that means that it's
officially time for Xbox one X versus
PlayStation 4 Pro I'm Bill Gates
chairman of Microsoft in this video
you're going to see the future
to begin with let's take an in-depth
look at the hardware of each of these
systems and what it's going to cost you
starting with the Xbox one X you're
getting an 8 core processor that's
clocked at 2.3 gigahertz you're getting
a GPU that's capable of 6 teraflops 12
gigabytes of RAM and a one terabyte hard
drive all of the cost of $500 meanwhile
on the ps4 Pro you're still getting an 8
core processor but it's clocked at 2.1
gigahertz a GPU that's only capable of
4.2 teraflops you're getting 8 gigs of
ram plus one additional gig of a slower
Ram type so it just adds a little more
power and you're still getting a 1
terabyte hard drive so overall across
the board the ps4 pro is definitely the
weaker of the two systems but this does
come at the benefit of it being a more
affordable system at $400 now as for the
physical ability of these systems
despite the fact the One X is the more
powerful of the two it's also the
smaller as well they're mostly the same
as far as the width and height goes the
One X is maybe just a hair taller and a
little less wide but where you really
see the difference is the depth of the
systems where the ps4 pro has this kind
of square design on the top which makes
it a lot larger and have a much bigger
footprint on your shelf as for the ports
there's a lot of similarities going on
here they both offer three USB ports
with the ps4 pro having two in the front
one in the back
the Xbox one X doing the flip of that
there was giving you an Ethernet port
and an optical out as well the One X has
a couple of other options on top of that
however with an HDMI IN and an IR port
and then for the looks honestly I kind
of think that both these systems are
actually kind of light downgrades from
their slim versions I think both some
consoles just look a lot better but
we're talking about just these two
against each other I got to give the
looks to the Xbox one X it's just
smaller its sleeker I like to kind of
just clean box monoliths design that has
going on the ps4 on the other hand while
the triple stack has kind of grown on me
still not my favorite now of course the
big question when it comes to these two
systems is which of them is gonna offer
you the better 4k gaming experience
because after all that's the point where
this point 5 generation that we've been
getting over their predecessors and the
two systems have taken very different
approaches to this
now obviously like I said earlier with
the specs the Xbox one X is the
much more powerful system that's because
this approach is just brute force its
way into getting native 4k in its games
so for big first party titles like Gears
of War 4 4 to 7 you are seeing native
real 4k resolution while some other
games are some of the more taxing ones
like quantum break
I almost said quantum leap
aren't displaying at 4k but get very
close and then upscale to meet the
difference on the other hand the
PlayStation 4 is entirely reliant and
this idea of using upscaling even their
own big first party games like horizon
zero dawn don't display a native 4k but
instead make use of what's called
checkerboard upscaling a technique that
while not as good as native 4k gets
surprisingly very close where depending
on the size of your TV and how far you
sit from it honestly the difference is
almost indistinguishable now things get
a little murkier when it comes to third
parties because there's always that fear
that instead of putting in the extra
work to make sure the One X gets a
better version and is using all the
resources they'll instead just make one
Pro version that will work just as well
on the ps4 Pro and One X and thankfully
that doesn't seem to be the case a lot
of games out right now are showing
clearly better versions on the One X
verses of ps4 Pro some of them are very
close margins but others are very large
for instance even within two is a game
that on the Xbox one X is running an
innate aversion of 1800 P while the ps4
pro version is only at 1280 P now for
reference if you don't know the
technical term for 4k is 2160p so the
Xbox one X version is much much closer
to that so for the money the ps4 Pro is
giving you an excellent 4k like
experience for a lot of their games that
for most of you is gonna matter in a
normal entertainment setup but if you're
looking for true actual 4k and getting
the highest resolution possible in every
single game the One X is the winner here
so that's how the 4k gaming experience
works up between these two systems but
what about everything else what about
the regular user experience between the
Xbox one X and the ps4 Pro well to be
honest back when these systems first
launched I definitely preferred the user
experience on the ps4 but as time has
gone by Xbox has put a lot of work into
upgrading a lot of their UI and services
to making what I think is now a better
system starting with UI for instance
while I think ps4 is is a little more
intuitive Microsoft's once you get the
hang for it is really really good you
remain page right here where you see all
the recent games you've been playing
you'll go down to your pins showing all
the stuff that you've picked
specifically that you go back to
whenever you want
going back up you can go to mixer
community stuff entertainment for things
like TV and movies or the store to buy
more games in DLC and if you ever want
to go to your list of games you already
have you just hit the Xbox button go
right here BAM all the games you have
installed or all the games you've owned
that you'd install later on just overall
it's such an awesome experience once you
get the hang of it
meanwhile the ps4 like I said earlier
things are a bit more intuitive at first
but it's also more limiting on the main
menu have this main line right here that
has all the different installed games
and apps that you have along with
updates and the store and going up above
you could find everything else you need
like friends lists notifications
messages settings all that good stuff
the problem is is that it's not really
that easy to actually a find control
over where you want things to be all the
games and apps they have listed here are
based on what you've most recently
launched you can organize them into
subfolders like this which makes a
little cleaner but ultimately things are
constantly shifting ground based on what
you're starting up when which really
gets annoying over time compared to the
Xbox we're able to easily strip between
different menus and always have to go
back to this main one and then find your
way to different subsections it's just
gets a little tiresome it's perfectly
usable but at the end of the day
comparing to Xbox 1x it's just a little
more clunky while there are of course
differences between these systems
there's a whole lot they have in common
as far as the regular user experience
goes for instance multimedia they both
offer a lot of the same big-name apps
like Netflix Hulu crunchyroll HBO Go
YouTube and for some specific ones like
Netflix they both offer 4k HDR video
support they also both offer Spotify for
music something that was originally
exclusive to Sony but made its way to
the Xbox more recently they both allow
you to stream to twitch they both have
kind of faked broadcast TV options like
PS vu on the ps4 and sling TV on the
Xbox one and as far as their memberships
go they're basically the same idea now
where they have the same price they both
allow you to play games online and they
both give you a small handful of free
games every month we start seeing some
differences again though with some of
the more unique services on each system
for instance on ps4 you can get
PlayStation now a service that allows
you to stream play games over the
internet with a large catalog of ps3 and
some ps4 titles which also acts as kind
of the backwards compatible option for
the ps4 the point is is that it lets you
stream play games for a monthly fee on
the other hand with Xbox you've got Xbox
game Pass and EA access to separate
services that also charge a monthly fee
but instead of having to stream play
over the Internet which can sometimes be
a really big problem for those you with
worse internet connections you just
install the games and play them right on
your cyst
which leads to a much better experience
but both of them have catalogs that are
much smaller than PS now there's also a
difference in terms of what kind of
additional gaming options you have on
these systems for instance the Xbox one
has pushed very hard on having actual
full-blown backwards compatibility
offering the ability to play 360 and
even some original Xbox games on your
Xbox one now it's not the full catalog
for either of these systems but the list
is continuing to grow with a very large
number of 360 games available right now
and more original Xbox games planned for
the near future on the other hand with
the PlayStation you don't have any real
backwards compatibility I mean they push
that you can do ps3 games through
PlayStation now and there are some
select ps2 games that you can buy
digitally but neither of these allow you
to just put the disc in your system and
play them like the Xbox one does on the
other hand something that ps4 does offer
the Xbox one doesn't have at all is we
are gaming with their own headset the
PSV are given the list of games and this
isn't gigantic but if vr gaming is
something that you're really interested
in getting into that's currently
something that you can only find on the
ps4 as far as console gaming goes
another unique benefit of the ps4 Pro
worth mentioning is that while both
systems allow you to remote play on a PC
the ps4 pro has the additional option of
remote playing on the PS Vita giving you
a way to play your ps4 games handheld so
so far thanks for looking pretty good on
the xbox 1x I mean it's got the more
powerful hardware great updates to the
user experience some awesome services
but there is one big wall the system is
still running into and it's one of the
defining things about this generation
and that's game exclusivity I mean just
look at 2017 on its own you can list all
the big-name Xbox one exclusive on one
hand Super Lucky's tale Halo Wars 247
cuphead and soon player unknown
battlegrounds will at least be console
exclusive to them meanwhile the ps4
you've got neo Nier automata persona 5
horizon zero dawn GT sport higher hell
blade a new uncharted so many more games
that I can't even just list them all
right now that just Dwarfs the list in
comparison this isn't to say that the
exclusive the Xbox one has are
necessarily worse it's just that there's
not as many of them so chances are if
you're looking for more games that will
cater your tastes sony is gonna give you
more options now you may love Gears of
War halo and not care about Uncharted or
any the games the PlayStation great but
Phil
you're just looking for the most choices
Sony is winning that market hard right
now you know back when this generation
started there was a lot of favor in ps4s
camp it had the better hardware they had
more exclusives and just overall the
sales supported that it was the more
popular console but as a result Xbox has
been fighting tooth and nail to deliver
better software and more recently better
hardware and as a result
honestly if software libraries were the
exact same I'd have to say the 1x is
definitely the better system but within
the context of what games are available
what you can grab at a lower price point
the ps4 Pro is a very tempting offer you
know if you're the kind of person that
just likes to play big-name triple-a
games that are available on every
platform the 1x is definitely the solid
choice but if you want to have as many
games available at your disposal with
only one console the ps4 Pro still has a
huge advantage</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
