oh yeah baby surface new dimension in
when it comes to officially licensed
controllers for the switch there's
really three main third-party companies
that are pumping options out PDP power a
and Hori and what we've seen wired
options for all of them come out
wireless has been a little more slow
going we've gotten to from power a
that's it but today we have a new one
from Horry so we're gonna take an
in-depth look at what this one does well
and not so well and compare it to the
other third-party Wireless options out
there first let's just take a look at
the design and button layout of the
controller and how comfortable it is so
at first glance this is very similar to
search pro controller it uses the same
kind of default stick and button layout
one of the immediately noticeable
differences however is that this is a
much larger controller in always the
grips are larger the button sticks
everything is just a little bigger ons
controller compared to other options out
there and I think that's something
that's a really big strength this
controller versus competition is that it
offers something that's a little more of
a unique alternative in that it's a lot
more comfortable for larger hands you
can even just holding this controller
you immediately feel the difference in
the grip and how it accommodates for a
bigger hand size a lot of the official
switch ones and even once from power a
are very small grip sizes and don't
really work out well for everyone and I
think this is a good alternative and
it's even accented by the fact that this
design has this little grip texture on
the side it's very similar to the kind
of grip texture you get on the official
switch pro controller and I think it's a
nice little addition now where this does
run into some problems is the button
quality which isn't anything
particularly new or unique to it as far
as third-party controllers go I think
where it's really most noticeable and
maybe a light issue is the main front
facing ABXY buttons they just have a
tiny bit more stickiness to them they
just want to stay down a little longer
it's not a big deal for most people if
you're just gonna play games casually
with this but if you're in any kind of
competitive pro scene kind of thing not
gonna be a great choice otherwise
everything else in this controller is
fine actually like the sticks on it the
d-pad is okay same goes for the
shoulders there's nothing stellar on
here but nothing too terrible either
another thing that do define to be a
small and communis but this controller
too though is the weight which I know is
a common complaint I have about a lot of
third-party controllers I always want a
little more weight than these normally
give you but it just seems
more apparent with this one because a
it's a larger controller so I think my
brain just wants to have a little more
heft to begin with and B this is
actually a rechargeable controller
instead of being one that uses double-a
batteries which I do like but with a lot
of the other options out there when you
add the batteries that just gives that a
little bit of extra weight you want to
have this doesn't have that and so the
weight just never really increases on it
and it's not the thing that never really
ruins the experience of the controller
but I think a lot of people have this
very major cree action of light
controllers feeling cheap it's not
necessarily true but that's just the
reaction people get because you're so
used to actual mainline controller as
having all these things in here like
rumble packs and extra stuff that just
adds a little heft and you don't get
that here I will say something that I do
like about these controllers that kind
of balances out as well is aesthetically
I really like the visual design of them
they've made two different ones this is
the Mario red design featuring Mario's
logo right here and just little shades
of a star 1up mushroom and question
block they also have a black controller
option that features the Hylian crest in
gold which looks really pretty as well I
think as far as just being a good
looking controller goes Hori did a good
job here now of course being a
third-party controller there are some
features and functions that are missing
here it does still have motor controls
which is looking to become pretty common
for a lot of the wireless options which
I do appreciate
however it is still missing Rumble which
is a big deal for me personally and it
doesn't have the ability scan amiibos
which that alone isn't that big of a
deal so overall this is actually pretty
solid controller I mean has the subset
has downs but I kind of like it it just
has one very big specific problem that
bothers me a lot and that's their
approach to recharge your battery no I
really like the idea of going with
rechargeable battery because their other
competition so far has really focused on
using doublea's which is fine there are
people that prefer to that but there are
other people out there that just like
the idea of just plugging in charging
whenever you need to and I like that
personally however it's very odd how
they chose to approach this because
they're using a microUSB cable which is
not the standard for the switch and that
would be maybe okay except it also
doesn't come with the cable for this at
all if it was either one of those issues
alone I'd be a little more forgiving
because yeah whose USB see but have the
cable fine you probably have one laying
around for your switch you can at least
charge it with the switch power cable if
it came with the microUSB it'd be like
oh that's weird it's not the same thing
but hey I've got the cable but both of
those at the same time it's just
it seems annoying especially when you're
paying that much for a third-party
wireless controller option so how it is
compared to the other wireless
controller options out there for the
switch well when it comes to the
officially licensed one the Hori is now
the fourth choice there is of course the
official Nintendo switch ones which I
would say quality wise are the best ones
out there you're just spending more
money on them especially you want to get
some kind of special edition design
there is of course also the power a
GameCube style controller which is bit
more of a specialized option because
it's a very different roller shape so
specifically I'm going to compare the
Hori controller to power a's wireless
controller option now once again the
immediate difference you can notice here
is just the overall size of the Hori
controller everything about it is just a
little bigger which i think will work
out a lot better for a lot more people
and while I am very annoyed with how
they chose to approach a rechargeable
battery it still stands at it's a were
chargeable controller which a lot of
people do prefer over having to worry
about batteries sure batteries can last
a while but as soon as they're out if
you don't have any sitting in these
drawers guess what you have to run to
the store and that's really annoying
with that in mind though I do to say
that when push comes to shove if I have
to tell you which of these ones I think
the better controller is it's still the
power a you know just overall I think
the buns everything are a little more
crisp they're still not quite the same
level as the official switch ones but
they aren't an improvement and it does
give you the extra function of having
the reprogram buttons on the back
whereas the Hori well it still has
motion controls which the power array
has as well but that's really where the
whole line ends it's not the worry is
necessarily a bad controller I think
it's actually a pretty fine one the only
issue I had once again is that light
stickiness to the front facing buttons
which for most people is honestly pretty
ignore Mille I think at the end they
that big thing with the Hori is that if
you like a bigger controller if you
don't like how small a lot of the switch
options out there are this is gonna be a
great choice for you but for everyone
else
stooop with power a or the official
switch one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
