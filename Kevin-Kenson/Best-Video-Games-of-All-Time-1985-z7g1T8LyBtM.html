weird place thanks to the games crash of
1983 arcades are still doing pretty well
but home consoles are suffering big time
that is at least until near the end of
that year when we saw the release of the
original Nintendo Entertainment System
it was during this time that we got a
lot of important game releases that
shapes the future of the gaming industry
and here are the five that I think are
the best starting with gauntlet now the
big deal about gauntlet is that it was
one of the first games to really push
full four player co-op and it did things
with comp that no other games did up
until that time one of the biggest being
the fact that while you were working
together with friends you could also
accidentally screw each other over if
you played any game where you get angry
at your friends because they grabbed an
item that you needed or they destroyed
something the party could use well you
can thank gauntlet for being the first
game to do that because in gauntlet
players could accidentally destroy food
which were to cover your health the
thing is in gauntlet health was also
gained by spending quarters so if
someone destroyed food they were
literally forcing you to spend more of
your own money if you want to stay in
the game as long as possible it wasn't
the most complex game but it was a ton
of fun and revolutionized the way people
approach cooperative gaming inspired a
lot of future titles including one of
its best descendants gauntlet Legends
which came out in the late 90s the
second up is Space Harrier now 1985 was
a really good year for arcade shooters
including the likes of commando and
Gradius but what made Space Harrier
stand out above these two was the big
leaps it made in technology especially
for graphics this was one of the first
games to have sprite scaling which
created a pseudo 3d image something that
players never saw before then it also
was one of the first games to make use
of an analog control stick offering a
degree of precision that previous
designs didn't have this is also one of
the most bizarre looking games to come
out on arcade thanks to the fact that
well first off it came out in the 80s
and second off it was inspired by Buck
Rogers featuring all kinds of weird
sci-fi fantasy stuff like using a
jetpack laser gun fighting against
aliens robots space ships floating
statues shooting lasers out of their
mouths dragons and Cyclops mammoths it
was fast paced a big leap in technology
for both graphics and gameplay and is
arguably responsible for the creation of
future hit 3d shooters like starfox now
of all the games on this list this next
game is arguably one of the most
influential but at the same time one
that has not
aged well at all and that's Ultima 4
originally released on the Apple 2
Ultima 4 started taking the series in a
new direction that was really a new move
for the RPG genre as a whole see up
until that point RPGs were all focused
on a very simple storyline
you're the hero there's evil make bad
guy ruining everyone else's fun go into
the dungeon kill him and save the day
instead Ultima 4 plot focused on the
player characters moral development
traveling from city to city proving
themselves to be compassionate honorable
honest so and so forth in other words it
was the first game to really give
players a sense of consequence to the
actions that their character took it's a
bit of a headache to try and go back and
play now especially if you didn't grow
up with RPGs of its style but for its
time this was a huge achievement for
computer role-playing games and led to a
large number of sequels as well as a
much more user-friendly port on the NES
next up is ghosts and goblins back in
the older days of gaming a major source
of playtime was just the fact that games
had soul-crushing difficulty not
actually having that much content but
forcing you to deal with the same small
amount of over and over and
over because you're just dying so often
and no game has accomplished this art
more than the original ghosts and
goblins anyone who thinks that Dark
Souls is a hard game needs to go back
and play this heartless monstrosity
because it will crush you so much more
first time it only takes two hits for
your characters to die enemies are
extremely tenacious and everywhere and
what do you think you've beaten the game
you actually have to run through all
five stages one more time if you want to
actually face the final boss despite all
of this that would just infuriate
brand-new players it was still the right
level of challenges that just kept you
suck in trying more and more continuing
to pump quarters in the machine or buy
one of the later console ports and
sequels that were released years later
now of course you can't talk about 1985
in gaming without mentioning one of the
singular most important releases in
gaming history the original Super Mario
Brothers on the NES this is the game
that spearheaded the third generation of
consoles and helped to boost
side-scrolling platformers as one of the
main dominating genres of the gaming
industry featuring the now iconic Mario
and his Pelt swapped brother Luigi and
two-player super mario brothers offered
one of the best design games of its time
with what was then precise platforming
control
great level design and a lot of
different little secrets for players to
an earth that was just satisfying it was
this game combined with the Nintendo's
later hits that really brought the home
console market back to life and began to
make arcades a lot more barren until the
early 90s not to mention being the first
release in what is now one of the
longest-running franchises in gaming
with a ridiculous number of sequels and
spin-offs so there you have my list of
some of the best games that came out
back in 1985 there were definitely a lot
of other great titles that just didn't
quite make my list so make sure to let
me know down in the comments what some
of your favorites were if you liked this
video make sure to let me know by
hitting that like button in two weeks
I'm going to be doing this all over
again but for 1986 so make sure to
subscribe so you don't miss out on it as
always guys thank you so much for
watching and I'll see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
