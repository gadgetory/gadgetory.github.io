is sponsored by Oculus quest.
VR technology has been seeing a lot
of growth of the last few years.
And it's this concept that's
really appealing to people.
The idea that you can
truly immerse yourself
in a piece of content,
which is really cool
for something like a VR experience
where you can explore or
look around at something,
but where it truly gets
it's most exciting,
is the concept of VR Gaming.
The only real big barrier
that's still been around,
is the idea of wires
being tether or cabled
to different things and
restricting your movement.
That is until now.
(techno music)
This is Oculus Quest.
(techno music)

Look.
Obviously I'm being paid
to talk about Oculus.
But, honestly, I've been so
excited about Oculus Quest
ever since it was first announced.
I've used other VR headsets in the past,
and I love the idea of VR.
I think there are so
many awesome, amazing,
neat gaming experiences
you can have with that.
But it's never really been
convenient enough for me.
I don't like dealing with wires.
I don't want something that I have
to put away in a bag and
get out to re-set up,
or just leave out all the time
and it's just a big mess.
And I don't want to have to deal
with other stuff too.
Like setting up towers.
There's all kinds of
extra, additional steps
and Oculus Quest gets rid of that.
I really do think this is
the perfect gateway into VR gaming.
Anyone who's been curious about it before
but was worried about not
having a good enough PC for it,
or not having a safe
enough room to use it with.
This is the most convenient
way to really dive in.
And I think it's worth grabbing over, say,
incremental system upgrades.
If you already have an Xbox One or a PS4
and you've been debating buying
a point-five version of the system
like the Pro or the OneX,
I think that money is better spent getting
a more unique, different
experience with VR
instead of just getting
slightly shinier graphics
for the same games.
(high pitched distortion)
The dream of Virtual Reality
is something that people have had
for a long time.
It's been a central
part of a lot of fiction
and as technology has
progressed over the years,
engineers have revisited the
concept over and over again
trying to make the tech come to life.
One of the earliest examples of this
goes all the way back to the early 60's
with The Sensorama.
This was a piece of tech developed
by a guy named Morton Heilig,
which was trying to bring it together
the idea of a truly
interactive form of media.
The way he did that was by making
basically a giant arcade cabinet
that would envelop all
the way around your head
and you would watch short films.
But accompanying them would be
a whole lot of secondary effects.
Like there were fans to
create a sense of fake wind
or chemical compounds that would smell
like different familiar things.
As the years went by, we eventually had
the rise of video games that became
a new central point for the idea of
what if we had content
that was more immersive and interactive?
And some of the earliest ideas
came from Nintendo in two
major different forms.
The first was the Power Glove,
which didn't really give the sense
of VR where you're actually
experiencing or seeing another world,
but did toy with the idea
of actually having more
direct control over something
by having an actual
peripheral on your hand.
Later, Nintendo visited
the idea of VR again,
but this time, from the visual perspective
with the Virtual Boy.
Which again is probably a slightly more
infamous that famous example.
Because Nintendo wanted to
make something affordable
that could be at peoples' homes
instead of some kind of arcade
or major, more expensive experience.
It ended up being just
single colored laser lines
that, while did have a
pretty cool sense of 3D,
didn't really offer anything interesting.
And ultimately kind of
missed out on the whole point
of what people were looking for with VR.
More interesting advances were made by
Nintendo's chief rival at the time, SEGA,
when they worked on the concept of a
SEGA VR headset to go
with the SEGA Genesis.
Now this, actually, never made
its way to actual production
where people could buy one and use it,
but in the early development phases,
it was working with an actual LED screen
which would give you way
more interesting visuals
than what the Virtual Boy was capable of.
Sadly, the SEGA VR ran
into the same problems
that a lot of its competitors had
and that the tech just
simply didn't exist yet.
While it had a more
interesting visual look,
there wasn't really any kind
of advanced tracking technology yet.
So the experience
wasn't nearly as seamless
as it needed to be,
causing it to be disorienting.
Skip ahead 20 years, and we
are once again in a time where
VR is being heavily explored,
and much more successfully
leading us to Oculus Quest.
(high pitched distortion)
All I have to do, is take the headset,
put it on my head, grab the controllers,
find a safe, open area to play.
And it is extremely easy to set up
and very intuitive.
It walks you through the whole process
where you can actually
see through the headset
the area around you and
draw the boundary line
that you're gonna be
able to walk around in.
And even brings up this whole grid wall
to ensure you know where
you can and cannot pass.
What's even cooler,
is if you do end up passing this wall
it'll revert back to that same camera
where you see it through the VR headset.
So immediately, once you're
no longer in a safe area,
you know what's around
you and what's in the way
and how to get back to
the safe playing zone.
Outside of that,
the only other setup stuff
that you need to do is
make sure you charge the headset,
check the AA's that you
have in the controllers.
And when you first initially set it up,
you do have to sync it to a phone
so that you can do any
updates that are necessary
as well as create an Oculus
account for buying games.
And I know for some of you out there
the idea of wires isn't that bad,
but honestly, it's just the convenience
of how much easier it makes it
that I can just do it at a
moment's notice when I want to.
I don't have to worry about
whether I have room to
set up some sensor towers,
or if I'm able to hook it up
to a convenient nearby PC.
Or deal with any-it's-there's
none of that.
I just take it out of the carrying case,
wear it, and I can
immediately start playing.
Everything about the headset
feels like premium quality.
It's not just solidly built itself,
but it's the comfort too.
The front part of it lies on
your face nice and softly.
It's not something that feels too tight.
And it's got three straps
in order to make sure that you
adjust it just the right way
so it's going to sit on your head
and give you a nice, clear image.
The controllers also feel great.
And again, completely wireless.
They're not plugging into the headset
or anything else.
You just pick them up
and you're good to go.
Each of them has their own control stick,
along with two traditional
front facing buttons,
and various other buttons you can reach
by doing different grips,
which allows you to
simulate different things
depending on the game you're playing.
Letting you do things
like pick objects up,
point at something,
or even give a thumbs up.
It's worth noting too,
that the headset relies on an
internal re-chargeable battery
that you just plug into wall
power whenever you need to.
While the controllers each just rely on
a single AA that lasts a really long time,
and it's super easy to add and remove.
There are a whole lot of other great games
you can download and play right away.
Whether you want something
that's a little bit more
of like an FPS style action,
there's Rule of Recall.
There's sports games that
can get a little more wacky.
This really is the user
friendly VR experience
that I've been waiting for for so long.
And I'm so happy that it's here.
