now both been out for a little over two
years and then the past year we've seen
a few more changes to hardware software
and game exclusives that might change
your idea about which system is right
for you now before we start talking
about changes let's just look at how
both systems performed over 2015 now the
ps4 still holds a very strong lead in
sales over 2015 they sold sixteen point
five million units which puts their
total sales at a little over 36 million
now as for Xbox one we don't actually
have the hard numbers on that because
Microsoft stopped making those figures
publicly available but the best
estimations that a lot of different
sources have is that they sold about 8.4
million units over 2015 putting their
total somewhere around nineteen and a
half million now this actually surprised
me a lot because while I wasn't sure if
Xbox one was going to overtake in sales
for 2015 I thought they were at least
going to close the gap a little bit
thanks to some software updates and
having what my opinion were some larger
exclusives for the holiday season but
that didn't happen in fact the ps4 is
still almost at a two to one lead over
the system and it's interesting to note
that when you look at the US alone the
numbers are actually very close but
throughout Europe the ps4 is outselling
the Xbox one three to one in Japan
basically continues to ignore that the
Xbox even exists in the first place
so what change has happened over the
course of 2015 that might affect which
system you want and cause those sales
that we saw over that past year well
between the two systems the Xbox one has
actually had the most changes first off
the entire interface has had a remodel
that works a lot better than designed we
had at launch that a lot of people
complained about there's also been a new
hardware version of the Xbox one made
available which features a hybrid drive
which makes loading times a little
faster on games that are completely
loaded from the hard drive rather than
disk on the other hand the ps4 also
received a hardware revision in 2015
with newer models now featuring better
cooling reduced fan noise and
front-facing buttons that were actually
buttons rather than a touch interface
which a lot of people didn't like now
hardware and software are cool but
really the main reason why you should
debate one system or the other is once
again which
exclusives each one has and this is
something that I thought Xbox one was a
little stronger on last year but clearly
wasn't enough to ship sales going with
ps4 first they started the year with the
release of the order 1886 which was
critically panned but did do pretty well
sales wise followed by blood-borne which
received much better critical praise and
sold quite a bit more later in the year
we also got an HD re-release of the
original Uncharted games called the
Nathan Drake collection which is
actually the top-selling ps4 exclusive
right now mainly thanks to the fact that
it was bundled with systems during the
holiday season last but not least is
until dawn
which didn't have the best sales for ps4
exclusives mainly because it was
basically an interactive movie but
because of this fact it was also one of
the most watched streamed games during
the month of its release
now as for Xbox one there's basically
three major exclusives that came out
last year first off was the Gears of War
Ultimate Edition which once again sold
really well because it was bundled with
systems during the holiday season next
up and more importantly is Halo 5 which
is the game that I thought was really
going to tip the balance of which system
sold more during the holiday season and
in fact out of exclusive games on both
systems halo 5 sold more than any other
it just wasn't enough to counterbalance
all the momentum the ps4 has going for
it and last is rise of the Tomb Raider
which for the holiday season was a timed
exclusive for Xbox one and despite
getting really good critical reception
this game sold horribly mainly due the
fact that was released on the same day
as fallout 4 which completely
overshadowed it so why did the ps4
continue to outsell the Xbox one so much
during 2015 well despite the fact that
the Xbox one had a really strong
exclusive in the form of Halo 5 ps4 was
able to counter that a bit thanks to the
fact that it opened the year with a
strong release like blood-borne also
while they didn't have as many strong
titles during the holiday season there
was the promise of a lot of big games
coming up this year in 2016 that made it
a major holiday purchase as a gift now
one other thing that I completely
underestimated is the fact that
Activision is showing a lot of love for
ps4 which is causing a lot of the Call
of Duty fanbase one of the most selling
games in the u.s. to completely move
over to that system selling 11
units worldwide on ps4 and only a little
under 6 million on Xbox one now all that
being said these are games that have
already been released you've probably
already read reviews on them and figured
out which ones you like or don't like so
the real question is what games do we
have to look forward to in 2016
now given it's still early in the year
so some of these might get pushed back
but we have a lot of exclusive to look
forward to this year more than we've
seen in past where we saw two or three
games for each system in 2015 we're
looking at five to six on each one for
this year for ps4 we just got the
release of Street Fighter 5 which is
also available on PC later in the year
we're going to get persona 5 for those
you that are JRPG fans horizon zero dawn
which is one of the biggest attention
getters in e3 2015 no man's sky an indie
game that a lot of us have been waiting
on since its debut The Last Guardian
which was stuck in devil forever but is
finally getting released hopefully
Detroit become human for those of you
that are fans of Quantic Dream and enjoy
more intractable movie style games and
of course one of the biggest exclusives
that got pushed back to 2016 uncharted 4
now as for Xbox one we have a number of
games that are called still exclusive to
the system but are going to be on PC as
well for instance we have quantum break
a game that we've been picking up a
little bits of information about over
the years just trying to fuse gameplay
elements with a sort of TV show approach
to storytelling recore a game that we
found out about at e3 2015 which is
being overseen by the creator of Megaman
Keiji Inafune a cuphead an indie game
that's been getting a lot of attention
due to its unique animation style sea of
thieves a new game from rare which is a
pirate style MMO and as of right now the
only two games that sound like they're
completely Xbox one exclusive and not
getting a PC port are Gears of War 4 and
Halo Wars 2 now as I said it's still
early in the year so a lot can still
change about these titles we might see
some of them get pushed back to 2017 but
they're definitely some of the biggest
ones to look out for for this year so
with all that being said if which system
is right for you well my main argument
that I've made in all of these videos
and I still stand by is looking at which
exclusives really appeal to you and go
for that system and if that fails look
at what system your friends are grabbing
so you can make sure you could play
stuff with them online in coop now if
after this you're still stuck well the
last thing I can say is
if you just want to focus on games games
games I do land a little more on the
side of the ps4 mainly because when it
comes to multi-platform titles you are
going to see better performance on it
whether that's a better frame rate or
games having actual 1080p resolution as
opposed to something that's sub 1080p
that's getting up scaled on the other
hand if you just want a multimedia
device that also plays games the Xbox
one was designed to be that from the
start so that's gonna appeal to you a
bit more
as always guys thank you so much for
watching the video if you enjoyed it hit

well as subscribe if you want to pick up
either console or look a little more
