fallout 4 trailer went up this morning
which has caused a lot of get hype on
the internet if you haven't seen yet
take a second go watch it now I'll wait
okay you watched it good so I just want
to take a moment to go over all the
things that I noticed in the trailer
that we can safely guess are going to be
in the game as well as infer a little
further so to begin with what we can
pretty safely say we know for sure first
off the game takes place in boston
you'll notice a lot of Boston monuments
come up in trailer most noticeably the
USS Constitution with a jet propulsion
system attached to the side of it second
off the main character this time around
is once again a vault dweller like in
fallout 1 and 3 which I've always been a
fan of because it's a nice way to ease
people into the setting whether or not
you played past games because obviously
everything you see is new to you because
you spend your whole life living
underground in a bunker now third off
this trailer does have a very heavy
emphasis on showing a dog companion
which is something that we've had in
past games as well but the way they've
shown it in this trailer looks like it's
gonna play a much larger role probably a
companion that you get a lot sooner and
we'll have a bit more functionality
aside from attacking things and maybe
going out to find an item or to last up
this game is really colorful compared to
other past Fallout games well three new
Vegas were very Brown and bloom and
greys and just dark tones everywhere
this one actually has a lot of
saturation very clear blue skies and
popping colors like red vending machines
you'll also notice that a lot of the
character designs look just a little bit
more cartoonish not full-blown Blizzard
status but definitely a step in that
direction which personally I'm okay with
I'd actually kind of like a little more
color in the game as long as it still
maintains the same dreary tones for its
storytelling now these are the things
that we can pretty safely assume based
on what we saw in the trailer but
there's a whole lot more that we can try
to infer for instance at the end of the
trailer the vault dweller actually says
something which might mean that this is
the first fallout game that actually
have a fully voiced protagonist which
depending on who you are could either be
really cool or a big red flag because by
having a fully voiced protagonist it
might limit the kind of options
characters have as far as what they can
say because the more things character
can say the more work it takes to voice
at all especially when you can create
your own character because you have to
make sure you at least have to full
voice sets for male and female
characters second off the trailer spends
a lot of time comparing scenes before
and after the font which might mean that
the story this time around emphasizes
the character finding out the history of
what happened in how the current setting
became this post-apocalyptic wasteland
which would be a cool direction for the
series to go and it would make Boston a
great choice because it is a city that's
very rich in US history now last up and
by far the most reaching idea is that
closing scene where you see that garage
with a brotherhood of steel armor set
and a bunch of weapons in the wall like
an armory that might be a sign that
characters in this time around will
actually have a safe house right away
now this is something you could do
before where you could buy a house to
store all your stuff but this might mean
that you get one right away early on in
the game that might do something a
little more than just being a place to
put things in boxes so those are of
course just things that I've inferred
from seeing the trailer there are a lot
of things that I'd hope for out of this
game for instance I really hope they use
a morality system like in New Vegas more
so than 3 because 3 put a really heavy
emphasis some sort of good guys versus
bad guys where new Vegas made it more of
here all these different factions they
all kind of have their upsides they all
have their downsides some more than
others but none of them are truly good
guys it's just which one you're more
willing to live with which i think is
much more appropriate for
post-apocalyptic setting than just these
are the good guys saving the day also
I'd really hope this game not to be a
buggy mess at launch but given
Bethesda's track record that's what I'm
not gonna happen so that's what I got
out of the fallout 4 trailer let me know
down the comments below what you guys
thought of it and what you're hoping to
see in the final version of the game as
always if you enjoy the video hit that
thumbs up button let me know subscribe
to follow me on twitter I'll be seeing
guys soon with more content but until
then I'm Kevin Jensen and I'll see you
guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
