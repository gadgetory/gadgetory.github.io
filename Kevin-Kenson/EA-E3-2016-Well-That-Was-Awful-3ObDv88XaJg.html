back in my life EA press conferences are
kind of an interesting thing to me
because every year i see the exact same
format and every year i think that
they're finally going to change that or
do something a little different and it
never happens every single time I mean
this year was pretty much there was not
a single new game announced they talked
about one new indie game they're working
with cult fee which does look pretty
interesting cool but that was the only
real new game they talked about and then
outside of that it was really just
talking about games we already know
about and even then didn't give us a lot
of hard info it was a lot of very
heavily edited gameplay trailers that
were very quick and just gave us very
bare-bones information we didn't get any
in-depth looks at gameplay at all they
spent a solid sixty percent of that
press conference talking just about
Madden and FIFA and basically just threw
what little scraps they could do us for
titanfall to Mass Effect Andromeda and
even battlefield one and I understand
the logic behind this a little bit I
mean after they do this press conference
they're focusing on just showing
straight-up gameplay for battlefield one
and they're gonna be hosting their EA
play event where people can actually go
to the show floor and try out titanfall
to battlefield one fifa madden but that
still doesn't feel like a great excuse
to me for your main press conference the
main thing that most people eyes are on
and just don't really show us anything
and that's not entirely fair they did
show some new info and we got two new
trailers for titanfall two one of which
was leaked a little early that confirmed
that the single-player campaign is a
thing that's happening and a multiplayer
trailer that showed us more actual
gameplay including the fact that
grappling hooks are going to be in the
game which is awesome Mass Effect
Andromeda not a whole lot really it was
a combination of behind-the-scenes
interviews and kind of just general hype
field for the game without really giving
us any hard info about it at all and
then benefit one once again lots of hype
talk but still no actual gameplay
because they're going to show us
during the play event afterwards it just
seemed like there really wasn't any
actual new information except for the
fact that FIFA is getting a story mode
as i said earlier titanfall has a single
player mode and they're working on
another indie focused game which is fee
that's pretty much it the one that
especially boggled me really was the
star wars announcements because they
played the Star Wars theme and built up
all this hype for it and then it just
turned into watch this video where we
talk about games that have already been
released and we'll show you a snippet a
moment of the fact that there are more
Star Wars games on the way specifically
battlefront 2 and some kind of new third
person action game that's coming from
respawn it just it it really was an
announcements for the most part you know
originally when I was gonna shoot this
video I was thinking I was gonna do some
kind of five list like the best
announcements worst announced minced
best and worse to come from EA but
there's not really enough information to
do anything with because that was a
whole hour of stuff we already knew with
a handful of scraps that didn't give us
any hard details about any of the games
that I think a lot of people are
actually excited about we already know a
new Madden's coming we already know a
new FIFA's coming sure they're adding a
story mode to it that's cool that's
interesting different great for you guys
but for anything else that's not a
yearly release we basically got handed
nothing I mean needless to say it's
pretty obvious I'm not a big fan of how
this press conference went over and I
think unless other companies really
screw up this is easily going to be my
least favorite press conference out of
this year I mean there was just nothing
there was just nothing good there wasn't
a single new game announced no new
sequels given part of that is because
they born announced some games in
advance you know where he already knew
about titanfall 2 they've already teased
bad if it won but not a single new game
that you save for this press conference
the main thing a lot of people are
waiting on not a new EA sports game
bringing back something people have
wanted like skate for or a new SSX no
nothing just let's talk about stuff
we've already shown you and then just do
nothing for an hour until we wait for
the actual gameplay for people to watch
it just ha that was terrible</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
