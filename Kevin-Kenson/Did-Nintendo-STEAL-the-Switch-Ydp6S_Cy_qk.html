their second lawsuit from the company
game vice now if you have no idea what
I'm talking about back in 2017 when the
switch was first coming out a company
called game vice filed a lawsuit against
Nintendo saying the swoosh was violating
one of their patents and back then it
was specifically about a product they
had made before called the wiki pad the
wiki pad was this Android tablet that
was focused on gaming that basically
came with like a controller sleeve you
would dock the tablet into the sleeve
and that would give you traditional
controls which is kind of a similar idea
to the Nintendo switch now they dropped
that original lawsuit but are now
reimbursing with a new one that's more
focused on their more recent product the
game vice now obviously this isn't the
exact same thing as a switch it doesn't
have its own system or anything in it
but it's designed to work with a number
of different phones and tablets
basically the same idea as the wikipad
but instead of having to buy their
specific tablet you can use it with one
you already own now the reasoning behind
this lawsuit is that the patent game
vice has regards the idea of controllers
with a bridge that connect alongside a
portable handheld device so it isn't the
switch in general that violates this
idea it's the simple fact that the
system can do this
if the Joye cons never attached to the
side of the switch if they were always
Wireless you had to do tabletop mode
ring like that it'd be fine but because
it can do this that violates the pen
they're saying that because it is a
similar computing device and is doing so
well they potentially lost out on a ton
of sales because of it now yes they did
follow suit before and dropped a bow
makes this time a little more serious is
not aware they find lawsuit they're also
requesting that the US International
Trade Commission investigate whether or
not the switch is infringing on their
patent and if it is they want them to
stop all importing in sales of the
switch to the US now is this something
that's going to happen no idea probably
not I am NOT a patent lawyer we're
lawyers I obviously can't I'll give you
the guys the full in depth on how
actually possible this is and how good
the claim against Nintendo is what could
happen with it no idea but it's a really
interesting argument to follow and
whether or not the Nintendo is actually
maybe kind of ripoff at least the basis
of this idea maybe I don't know let's
try out the game vice for ourselves
alright so we actually
one of these game vice guys right here
so I'm gonna try it out and kind of see
how it compares to the joy Khan's I mean
obviously it's not gonna be the exact
same thing but let's just see how much
the idea is actually the same oh yeah so
I mean it's very true to the name game
vice it just goes on the side of the
controller it's kind of comfy I mean I
can already think of a lot of ways how
this is not really like a joy con I mean
I get the idea it's still a detachable
controller or maybe it's better to say
that this is attachable because it
doesn't exactly work apart from the
device I like by the way to that this is
the same a vxy set up as an Xbox
controller but they flip the colors like
no this isn't the same thing guys this
is a totally different design
alright BX Y is different Rx is yellow
it is nice that just works right away I
didn't have to do any kind of like a
setup or anything you know using this
thing I gotta wonder like I I see how
the argument can be made that this and
the switch have a lot in common that
there's these attachable controllers but
that's kind of the most just the vaguest
simplest definition and there's a lot
that's different for instance with a
switch it's all one package you know the
controllers are part of the switch
tablet that's it this is a side
accessory that you attach on its own to
multiple devices but not only that but
it's the fact that this just attaches to
something and adds controls wrist of the
switch you know it's one thing you can
use or you can take them off and still
use them you know it's sort of like
these are attachable switch droid cons
are detachable its yeah by the simplest
definition they're similar but that's
about it I mean I'm not an attorney just
focus on the law concept why is this
video aside this actually is like a cool
thing and I can actually see myself
using this more because I like having
the portability of my phone for certain
games but I don't necessarily want to
keep a controller around for not using
touch controls
so yeah this is kind of a nice midpoint
where I'm able to still keep one nice
little portable package but give me way
better control than touch controls
I got say to like looking at the photos
thing I thought controls are gonna be a
lot less comfy because it's very blocky
looking there's not exactly a lot of
curvature going on but it's shaped just
the right way that you still kind of
have a grip on the back and it's pretty
comfortable it's not I mean I definitely
would prefer like an actual normal
controller but for this kind of just
add-on kind of thing it's actually
pretty comfortable almost more so than
the switch is actually with like the joy
cons on its one tablet cuz you at least
kind of have a grip shape to it it's not
just one flat back
so did Nintendo steal the switch okay
that's probably little too extreme of
line but really think about it because
yeah the switch in the game vice are
very driven things I mean the switch is
some gaming system it can dock and
connect to TVs the joy cons can do a lot
more than just attach to the sides and
the game vice is basically a really cool
controller adapter for phones and
tablets but when you look at the basic
idea behind the switch one of the
starting points of how it was probably
designed is that yeah it's a portable
gaming device that has controllers that
attach to the sides and in that respect
there is a similarity and it's not like
the game vice is this brand new thing
that came out at the same time as the
switch I mean the wikipad came out in
2013 the game vice came out in 2015 and
both them were announced even before
then so knowledge of these products was
out there when Nintendo was making the
switch so what's something the switch
was inspired by did Nintendo actually
actively try to copy the idea or was it
just coincidence they had a similar idea
not knowing this was out there I don't
know I don't work it in Tendo I mean you
personally I lean towards the thought
that it is just coincidence but that's
just me
let me know what you guys think down in
