for gaming hardware wise the Super
Nintendo has finally arrived to the US
and in Japan Sega releases the mega CD
but what's even more important about
this year is what games came out because
this is when we saw the release of a few
games that either started whole new
franchises or completely revolutionize
the genre as they were in and here are 5
of the best to start let's take a look
at a sequel to one of the best games I
talked about for 1990 and that Secret of
Monkey Island 2 now what made the first
game great was its new approach to
storytelling and puzzle solving that set
it apart from other point-and-click
adventure games but what made 2 even
more amazing was how it refined in
streamlined pretty much every single
aspect of the first game with better
visuals better puzzles easier controls
the option of an easy mode that was
still fairly challenging and an overall
story and adventure that was much
greater in scope than the first
not to mention still being hilarious
making it quite possibly the best
point-and-click adventure game of all
time one of the sad aspects about this
game though is that it has a cliffhanger
ending that's never really properly
resolved as the third game in the series
was made by a new team that basically
ignored the plot and direction to was
going in it's still completely worth
playing though if you haven't yet and
just like the original you can grab a
remake of it super easily for PC that
displays in both the old and redone
visuals next up is the first game to
land on the SNES from one of the NES is
largest hits in Japan
final fantasy for this game set a new
standard for the console RPG genre and
introduced the active Time battle system
a combat mechanic that would be in every
Final Fantasy up until 10 which made
combat a lot more frantic and timing
moves a lot more important it was also
the first Final Fantasy to have a set
group of heroes who not only had
established personalities but also
specific jobs and play styles whereas
the earlier ones had blank slates with
classes or heroes that were basically
Jack's of all trades this was also the
first Final Fantasy to come stateside
since the original leading to a bit of
confusion as SNES copies here are called
a Final Fantasy 2 not to mention the
game was heavily modified into what's
referred to as easy
as it featured reduced difficulty fewer
abilities for each character and a
different final boss we'd eventually get
the real version of this game when it
was ported to PlayStation and later got
remade imported again and again and
again for Game Boy Advance DSP SP mobile
devices and PC making it the most remade
file fantasy of them all now third up is
arguably the most important game that
came out this year because it completely
revolutionized the fighting game genre
and is pretty much responsible for a
rebirth in arcades during the early 90s
and that's Street Fighter 2 the first
Street Fighter was an OK arcade game
that gave players one single playable
character and allowed for two player
mirror matching whereas SF 2 introduced
and basically set up the entire format
most fighting games till this day are
built around having a cast of distinct
stylized characters with ridiculous
moves coming from all across the world
several of which handled very
differently from one another it also
accidentally created the idea of a combo
system as players discovered through
bugs that they were able to chain moves
together for continued free hits which
ended up becoming a mainstay feature in
pretty much every fighter since the game
ended up being remade several times with
five official different versions in
arcades and several console ports
including three different Super Nintendo
games and the franchise has experienced
continued success with several spin-offs
and crossover fighters and four more
core games released afterwards the most
recent being Street Fighter 5 now as the
80s ended and the 90s just began Sega
has been scrambling to create or find a
mascot of their own to compete with the
Nintendo's wildly successful Mario and
in 91 they finally found that character
Sonic the Hedgehog
rather than try to make a similar clone
or another platforming game focused on
jumping on enemies and avoiding pits of
death Sonic instead chose to tweak the
platforming genre by speeding everything
up after building up some momentum Sonic
could cover stages and ground way faster
than Mario with skilled players being
capable vaulting through whole stages
extremely fast more traditional
platforming mechanics of course found
their way in but the resulting games
stood apart from what all the rest were
doing slap on a good soundtrack and
impressive visuals for its time and it's
easy to see why Sonic became Sega's
shining beacon with a huge number of
sequels spin-offs and reinventions
happening over
years not to mention the battle between
Mario and Sonic has been an iconic
representation of gaming in the 90s and
even with Sega no longer being a console
manufacturer this rivalry lives on
through crossover games like Mario and
Sonic at the Olympics or Sonic's
appearance in Nintendo's Super Smash
Brothers series now last but not least
is my personal favorite on this year's
list one of the most iconic Super
Nintendo games ever made The Legend of
Zelda a Link to the Past
after the middling and Confused sequel
that was links adventure a Link to the
Past went back to the formula used for
the first game and refined it a bunch
having a much more cohesive albeit still
bare-bones story incredible dungeon
design and while the game had a linear
path to the end it featured a fairly
open world with tons to explore
including all kinds of hidden goodies to
prepare link for his adventure really
this is just one of those games that
serves as a great example of something
that just knocked it out of the park in
every way possible visuals gameplay
story sound music pacing controls it was
all just so perfect especially for its
time
the first Legend of Zelda may be a
classic for the NES but it was this game
that ensured the series would become one
of Nintendo's largest</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
