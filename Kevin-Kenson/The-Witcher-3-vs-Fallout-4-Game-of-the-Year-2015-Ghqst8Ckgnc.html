and even with all the great titles that
have come out there's two in particular
that have stood out amongst the rest to
a lot of people that probably deserve
the title of game of the Year 2015 and
those two games are The Witcher 3 and
fallout 4 now given the years not done
yet there could be some kind of surprise
upset and something that really just
tears both of them apart but looking at
these two games alone I won't talk about
which one I think deserves the title and
I want to break it down into three
different main areas presentation
storytelling and gameplay now
presentation is really two main things
sound and visuals and from a sound
perspective they both have really
excellent scores but I got to give the
win to fallout 4 because while both them
do have great soundtracks phone for
effectively gives you three different
ones with the use of its in-game radio
and which station you're listening to or
just not listening to one at all has a
major impact on the tone of the game
whether you're listening to the epic
score while going through the main
questline
or you're just screwing around blowing
stuff up while listening to butch repeat
visuals on the other hand though are a
very clear and obvious win for The
Witcher 3 and not just talking about the
quality of graphics and the fact that
fought for is already a little outdated
we're also looking at character
animations facial animations and just
the concept art going into it a given
fallout 4 does have a bit of a
disadvantage here because it's more
difficult to make a post-apocalyptic
landscape interesting looking compared
to this huge magical realm but when you
just look at things like the costume
design the attention to architecture
there's just so much more going on in
The Witcher 3 fallout 4 did have a huge
upgrade from three in New Vegas and that
it actually embraced using colors
outside of grey and brown but compared
to everything The Witcher 3 brings to
the table it's just not enough
now storytelling is a little bit more
rough of a thing to say which one is
flat-out better because they both have
very different approaches to quest
design Witcher 3 is much more linear in
nature it does take place in an open
world where you can take what quests you
want but everything is quest driven you
accept a quest you're supposed to go to
this place do this quest ends so on so
forth and while there is plot branching
it's all motivated by just making a
decision during a major piece of
dialogue fallout 4 on the other hand has
a much heavier emphasis on the freedom
of the player even the main quest line
has multiple ways it can be completed
because you end up taking certain quests
or you choose to allow yourself with
certain faction
there's also a lot more focus on letting
the player just do what they want to do
there's more of a feeling volume to
explore somewhere just to explore it
whereas witcher 3 is always sending you
different directions based on quests you
take now honestly most the time i do
prefer the open-ended faction approach
that fallout 4 has taken but in this
case I really do have to give the win to
the witcher 3 because it does something
that not a lot of games do fallout 4
included and that's making the side
quests actually interesting fallout 4
does have its share of side quests that
are a little funny or have a little plot
going on but for the most part a lot of
them can be boiled down to go here and
kill these guys or go here grab this
item and come back and a lot of this is
due to the fact that it makes use of the
radiant quest system that was introduced
in Skyrim The Witcher 3 on the other
hand gives lots of story to everything
that happens even a quest that's as
simple as find this monster and kill it
oftentimes gets companied by things like
finding out how it became the monster it
is now learning plot twists about how
the killings actually weren't done by
said monster and saw and so forth
there's just so much more plot crammed
into every little detail of The Witcher
3 now last by far not least is of course
the gameplay now this is another area
that's a little harder to argue which
one is flat-out better because while
they are both open-world RPGs their poor
mechanics are very very different so of
course personal preference can be a bit
of an issue now The Witcher 3 is
greatest strength in my opinion is the
core combat because it makes enemies
something more interesting than just
being a visual representation and a pile
of hit points they all have specific
weaknesses in ways that depending on how
you approach them can have very huge
outcomes on how easily the battle goes
you can research them to figure out what
weapons are good to use what grenades
what potions to drink all kinds of stuff
you can figure out on the other hand the
customization aspects of the game while
solid are all things that we've seen a
hundred times before you can equip
different pieces of armor and weapons
that you find that come in different
rarities you can find diagrams that you
can use to make new weapons and armor
with resources that you gather and you
can customize Geralt a little bit by
spending experience points to specialize
in different forms of gameplay it all
works but it's not exactly anything
original and this is I think a big
strength that fallout 4 has over it
customization because while they did
streamline certain things from fallout 3
and new Vegas they added a whole lot
more new mechanics that just give you a
gray
deal of control over your environment
first off it has the best character
creator tool we've seen to date in a
triple-a game but past that the crafting
system is just so dense you can
customize all the weapons and armor that
you find and you can also build and
customize your own full settlements
creating buildings sending up defenses
setting up a power grid it's because of
this that when it comes to just pure
gameplay I have to give the win to
fallout because while I did enjoy
getting through the main story of The
Witcher 3 it was the plot that was
ultimately pushing me to go for whereas
in Fallout 4 I can just spend a ton of
time screwing around blowing stuff up
building things just cuz I have fun
doing that in and of itself
so overall obviously I like both of
these games I think they're both
definitely worth playing but at the end
of the day I have to pick one of them to
be my personal choice for Game of the
Year 2015 and here's the thing over the
course the rest of this year and next
year I'm probably going to be putting a
lot more hours into fallout 4 because
gives me more stuff where I can just
mess around are more interested in
making new characters to try out
different builds that being said though
the time that I've spent with The
Witcher 3 I found to be a lot more
enjoyable there's a few specific things
that fallout 4 does really well but The
Witcher 3 just hits every single note
near perfect with great visuals a great
soundtrack great gameplay good
storytelling now of course there is DLC
on the way for both of these games so
when those get released it could change
my opinion but as things stand right now
if I got to pick a game of the Year 2015
between these two I have to give it to
The Witcher 3 so those are just my
thoughts on those two games if you're
interested in grabbing either of them I
do have them linked down below as always
