big fan of the stock joi con grip for
the Nintendo switch sure it allows you
to emulate using a traditional
controller but you're losing the comfort
and freedom of using a joy cunning each
hand in exchange for something that is
honestly just not very comfortable with
a terrible grip now my first
recommendation is just use a pro class
controller instead but those cost 60
bucks and if you just want a regular
grip that's cheaper what if they're
better options are out there so let's
talk about the best joi con grips can
get for your Nintendo switch
now the first design I want to talk
about is probably the most common one
you'll find aside from the official
Nintendo ones and that's the power a
comfort grip now obviously this one here
has a splatoon design going on on the
front and aside from that though you
might think it looks pretty much the
same as the Nintendo one until you take
a look at the back the grip is actually
a lot more different on these ones first
off they're shaped to be a bit more
curved and actually fit into your hands
just a lot more naturally and
comfortably and more importantly the
fact that it's not using the same hard
plastic all around like the Nintendo
ones are instead it actually has this
rubber on the back that is still pretty
solid but it's just a little bit softer
and gives a little more push if you
decide to grip it tightly your hands are
gonna get worn out nearly as much if
you're playing for long periods of time
now unlike the Nintendo ones this one
does not come in a charge grip variety
but as you can see they have released a
number of different special edition
designs this one is the only one right
now that's out which is for splatoon
it's technically only exclusive to Game
Stop you can't find it online but people
are reselling it for a lot more money
don't fall for it they do however have
other designs you'll be able to pick up
coming out soon they can grab online for
instance forward Legend of Zelda or
Mario so don't pay extra for these go
ahead and preorder one of those and grab
them when they come out
now another grip you can get that is a
bit more of a Swiss Army knife option
for the switch is the Nyko power grip
now first officers talk about the
comfort level of this thing it is
similar to the power a one and that the
back grips are a little more curved so
it's more comfy for your hand but it
does still have a hard plastic all
around so that can get a little but
still an upgrade over the switch design
what makes this one special though is
the very large number of additional
functions and powers that it has first
off this is a charge grip so it's gonna
charge super drug cons at the same time
provided that you keep this thing itself
fully charged up really interesting
addition to that though is it actually
as a USB out so you can use it as a
battery bank to charge other devices as
well for instance maybe your cell phone
and that's where the other major point
of this case comes in mind is that you
actually have a little clip they can
place on the front of it
to hold your phone now the main reason
for this is you're playing something
like splatoon to where you can make use
of the Nintendo phone app for
multiplayer this is gonna give you a way
to rig it up and still have a controller
all in one situation at the same time
and you can even charge your droid cons
and your phone
also one other kind of interesting bit
is at the front here is actually a
storage case where you can put switch
games and SD cards for additional places
to keep them on your you know on the
move now well it does have a whole bunch
of extra little functions that are
pretty cool there are some downsides
about this grip that we do have to talk
about first off this is the most
expensive grip option out there for the
most part I mean it's still cheaper than
grabbing a pro controller it's even
cheaper than grabbing some of the
third-party wired controllers but
compared to getting like just a Nintendo
grip or the Powerade grips you are
spending a little bit more for this
thing the other problem is the fact that
the actual latches where the dirt comes
go into aren't very strong it's just
enough resistance to where the Jo cons
will stay in place but every time that
you add or remove them it seems to get
just a little bit weaker now if you're a
very calm player this is not that big of
a problem but if you're the kind of
person that gets agitated
you're gonna start holding your
controller moving it around a lot but
adding a lot more force there is
actually a distinct possibility that you
could pop these things out of place
while playing which is a pretty big
problem so the answer is this either be
a calm player and grab one of these or
put your joy cons in and never remove
them so the resistance stays at full
power at all times otherwise you might
want to look at one of the other options
out there now as a third option for a
grip we could go the opposite direction
both Nyko and powera are recognizable
names when it comes to gaming
accessories the things you can trust you
could also instead of looking for
quality third-party options instead just
go for the cheapest stuff out there now
if you look online there is a flooded
market of different rip designs coming
from different companies that are
somewhere in China or Europe just making
very cheaply made grips or you can go a
little more creative and find something
on Etsy like this now admittedly if the
main premise here is to look at grips
that are more comfortable than the one
you get with the switch this actually
isn't the best answer but the racks are
really kind of cool-looking I mean
you'll find so many of these things on
Etsy where people are just 3d printed
different controller grip designs they
don't actually add any back grips it's
really just a way to kind of connect
your two controllers together but for
display purposes or having something
that's just a very different design
these are actually really cool and
really cheap dimensionally most of these
3d printers
designs are gonna cost you at most ten
bucks so you're just looking for a
little variety in your collection this
is actually worth taking a look at so
there are some of the best grip options
you can get for your Nintendo switch joy
Kahn's like I said earlier though
honestly in my opinion it's just better
to save up and grab a pro controller
instead there is just so much that thing
has to offer and honestly I still think
the joy cones are at their best if
you're just using one each hand
comfortably but if you want that kind of
middle option if you want a classic
controller experience and not spend
sixty bucks all at once these are some
great choices that are going to beat out
the grips that comes with a Nintendo
switch normally</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
