the future of video games,
a big debate that has come up a lot
is this concept of an all-digital future,
where there are no longer
any physical copies
of games being sold, but instead,
everything is made available
either by downloading it
onto a hard drive, or, even more so,
just streaming games straight-up.
And there's a lot of people
that are afraid of that future.
They should be.
(ethereal music)
♪ On the mark, get set, we're
riding on the Internet ♪
♪ Cyberspace, set free,
hello virtual reality ♪
- To get an idea for why
this can be a problem,
let's go back in time, way back further
than I think a lot of people realize
digital games were actually
even starting to happen.
The mid-'90s, in Japan.
(singing in foreign language)
It was at this time that Nintendo
partnered with a broadcasting
company called Sento.GIGA
to create an attachment
for the Super Famicom
called the Satellaview, an
amazing piece of technology
that was way ahead of its time,
and just basically a very simple version
of what we now see in
a digital marketplace.
(speaking in foreign language)
- [Narrator] Satellaview!
(upbeat music)
- The Satellaview gave
Super Famicom owners
an interesting and different
way of gaining access
to a library of games that
couldn't be played anywhere else.
The only problem was, they
couldn't be played anywhere else,
so once Satellaview died, it
took that library with it.
The way the system worked was
actually really interesting.
So, the Satellaview
itself was an attachment
that went on the bottom
of the Super Famicom,
likely in a spot that was meant
to be for the CD peripheral
that never actually
came out for the system,
and involved a cartridge
that would be loaded
into the top and would have a
memory card slot inside of it.
The attachment on the bottom
would act as a receiver
for the Super Famicom
to get broadcast signals
from Sento.GIGA, and the
cartridge inside of it,
which has a very long name I
cannot pronounce in Japanese.
(techno music)
(speaking in foreign language)
When you play this game,
it would actually act
as an interactive menu
for interacting with Sento.GIGA's service.
So, you would actually
be in a little town,
you would make your own little avatar
by picking whether you're a boy or girl,
name yourself, and then you
could go to different shops
that would change based on
when you were visiting the service,
so depending on what
week or what day it was,
different games could
be available to visit.
When you visited these games,
it would download that
information, via the broadcast,
on the memory card you had slotted.
In fact, it even came with
multiple memory cards,
so you could download different
titles to different ones,
and even add your own little labels
to keep track of what game
was stored on which card.
Now, the Satellaview had an
interesting variety of games,
because you had some titles
that were completely original
and unique to the library,
you had other games
that were side stories/remix remakes
of very popular Nintendo titles
from the Famicom and Super Famicom,
and then another category
that kind of crosses over
with those other two, are the
concept of SoundLink games.
And a really good example of
this is Zelda no Densetsu.
This was a unique series of games
released on the Satellaview
that took elements from
other popular Zelda games
and had very similar
look to Link to the Past,
but featured people
playing as their avatar
from Satellaview instead
of playing as Link.
And the really crazy part about this
was how SoundLink worked.
So, you couldn't just play
this like a regular game;
you had to play it during
a very specific time of day
on a specific day, and while
you're playing the game,
you're going to, at the same time,
receive an active live
broadcast from a narrator
that would give you tips or tricks
about where you're supposed to go,
what you're supposed to do,
and even add some extra narration,
extra layers to the story.
It was a super intense
concept for its time,
and part of the shame
of the Satellaview dying
is that there's not really a
way to recapture that at all,
because while there are
attempts from people
to download the information
from those memory cards
and be able to re-access that game,
there's no way to access the
narration that accompanied it,
because that was a separate signal
actively airing from Sento.GIGA,
so if you weren't playing
at that exact time,
well, you can't really play
it the way it was meant to be.
While there are a lot of Satellaview games
that are sadly permanently
dead, like Zelda no Densetsu,
there are some games that
thankfully were able to survive,
now as ROMs that were
dumped onto the internet
and didn't require that
aspect of SoundLink.
I think a really cool example of this
is Radical Dreamers, a game
that is actually a sequel
to the really popular Super
Famicom game Chrono Trigger,
and continued its own story.
Now, this has never been
made available any other way
outside of that ROM dump.
However, it did serve as the basis
for what then became Chrono
Cross on PlayStation.
Getting a little off-track, something else
that was really interesting
about the Satellaview
was how it not only
precipitated this concept
of digital downloadable games,
but even the idea of online multiplayer,
where there were some games
that were made available
that players would have
to play at the same time
and try to beat each
other for high scores.
There was no direct multiplayer,
but it would keep track of
how each person is doing,
and it would log later,
hey, this is they guy
that did the best on this game
that everyone was
playing at the same time.
The Satellaview is
honestly one of my favorite
weirder parts of Nintendo history
that sadly didn't make
its way over to the U.S.,
but it serves as an excellent example
of the worst-case scenario
of what an all-digital future could be,
because if the thing hosting
it in the first place
stops existing, well
then it's just all gone.
(logo dings)
Now, to be fair, the
example of the Satellaview
is an extreme one.
The modern equivalent would be
if the entire PlayStation
Store went down forever,
and you lost all the games,
or the Microsoft Store, or Steam.
But there are still
examples in recent history
where games can cease to exist
for one reason or another,
and there's actually a
few ways this can happen.
First, there's the issue of licensing.
(ethereal music)
- [Narrator] Licensing.
- Back when you had games that were made
using third-party licenses,
you didn't really have to worry about it
when it came to physical games,
'cause the assumption would be that,
by the time the license runs out,
well, they've already produced
all the physical copies
of that game they're going to do,
and they're sold or gone or whatever.
Issues completed.
But with digital games,
when a license goes away,
that means that, technically,
it can't even be distributed anymore,
digitally or physically.
One of the key examples of this
is Scott Pilgrim vs. the
World: The Video Game,
a side-scrolling beat-'em-up
that was based on the
original graphic novel
and motion picture adaptation
that was super fun and
had an awesome soundtrack.
The only problem is, it was
also a licensing nightmare.
See, the game didn't rely on
having just a single license.
Another example would be something like
Ninja Turtles: Turtles in
Time, which had a remake
that also got taken down because, oh,
they didn't have Ninja
Turtles rights anymore.
But with Scott Pilgrim,
they had to worry about
the rights from the
original graphic novel,
the rights to Universal Pictures,
the rights to Anamanaguchi,
who did the soundtrack,
and Ubisoft, who developed the game.
Once the licenses ran out,
and the game just didn't
perform well enough
for Ubisoft to try and keep it going,
well, it stopped existing.
- Mother.
- Anyone who didn't get
a chance to buy the game
while it was available digitally
missed out on a chance
to gain it, permanently.
And even people who owned it before,
if they had deleted it,
have to now jump through
additional hoops to try and download it,
which, by the way,
actually happened to me.
I thought I still had it
installed on my old 360,
I was wrong, but found a way to do it
by going to my download
history and re-getting it,
which was a bit of a pain,
but I'm glad it's still there.
And it's worth noting that,
in situations like this,
sometimes people wanna make it work.
In fact, both the original
author of the graphic novel
and Anamanaguchi have expressed interest
in making it happen again,
but they also need Universal
and Ubisoft to care
so they could all actually come together
and renew that contract, which
clearly has not happened.
And on that note, there are games
that have been able to come back
from this licensing issue, like Alan Wake.
Alan Wake, when it was
originally released,
made use of copyrighted music
that they had a license for,
but once that license ran out,
well, they weren't actually
technically allowed
to sell new copies of the game anymore,
or have it available digitally.
A year later, however,
Microsoft worked with
Remedy Entertainment,
who had developed the game,
to renegotiate that contract
and be able to get the rights back,
so the game was put back
on digital storefronts,
at least for PC.
So, licensing can be a real mess,
but is something that
you can recover from.
Something that's a bit more of an issue
is if you run into lawsuits.
(ethereal music)
- [Narrator] Lawsuits.
- And a perfect example of this
is what happened to Silicon Knights.
And this was a company
that had gained some fame
for their work on GameCube titles,
like the Metal Gear Solid
remake and Eternal Darkness,
and later on, worked
on titles for the 360,
and two of them don't exist
anymore, thanks to lawsuits.
The short version of
what happened is this.
See, Silicon Knights was
using an early version
of Unreal Engine 3 to
develop some of their games,
specifically Too Human and X-Men: Destiny.
And at the time, Unreal Engine 3
was still in its early phases,
as it was being made for
the first Gears of War.
Well, at some point,
Silicon Knights decided,
you know what, this was
way too much of a hassle
to work with, this has been a big problem,
we're gonna sue Epic Games
because the engine they
gave us doesn't work.
Well, that didn't go great for them,
because in response, Epic
Games counter-sued them
over the issue that, first off,
you knew that going
into using our software,
and second off, we know
you've been working with
other companies with that software
without our permission or license.
So, they counter-sued for damages,
and after winning said lawsuit,
not only caused the digital
versions of these games
to get de-listed, but even demands
that all unsold copies in retail
be sent back for destruction.
So, while these games still do exist
with copies floating around,
there's not nearly as many in circulation
as there could've been,
nor are they nearly as easy to access
with digital games,
thanks to that lawsuit,
which, by the way, the
amount of damages owed
was so high that it caused Silicon Knights
to go bankrupt, closing
doors, and it's prevented us
from ever getting an Eternal Darkness 2,
which is really sad.
Now, a third way that games
can get de-listed
digitally and cease to be
is probably the most
depressing way possible,
because the company said so.
(ethereal music)
- [Narrator] Because the company said so.
- Either because they
wanna make the release
some kind of special limited time thing,
or purely out of spite.
Now, thankfully, we
have two great examples
of both of these.
So, in the case of
making something special,
a good example is The
Legend of Zelda: Four Swords
Anniversary Edition,
released on Nintendo 3DS.
If you were playing 3DS,
there was a limited time
you could download, for free,
a version of Legend of Zelda: Four Swords,
which featured redone and better visuals,
and changed-up content.
So, this was really cool deal
for anyone that was playing their 3DS,
but if you missed your
chance to download the game,
well, that's it, it's gone.
Now, that hurts, but what hurts even more
is probably one of the biggest examples
of what can happen when a
company de-lists a game, P.T.
Back in 2014, Konami was working
on a new Silent Hill game
that would be led by Hideo Kojima,
the guy that was in charge
of the Metal Gear franchise,
which was something a lot of people
were super psyched about the idea for.
And a way to hype up
this potential new game
was a playable teaser,
which has now become of
the most infamous examples
of a very small-form but
amazingly scary game.
However, shortly before the
launch of Metal Gear Solid 5,
things went south between
Konami and Kojima,
causing him to be let go from the company
and ceasing all production
on his future works,
Silent Hills included.
And just to really rub salt in the wound
about that happening, Konami removed P.T.
from the PlayStation store.
Removed it so much, that not
only can you not download
the game anymore, but if you had it before
and deleted it, you can't re-download it.
It's just gone forever.
Now, since that has happened,
there have been numerous fan attempts
to recreate the experience,
people making their own spinoffs
or things based on the idea,
but it's been really
difficult to recapture
what exactly that game
nailed down so correctly.
And despite the fact that
it was basically a trailer,
it's an experience that is
gone, because Konami said so.
What's really scary about
the negative aspects
of an all-digital future
is the fact that it's,
well, probably inevitable.
There are some great arguments
for why physical games should still exist,
but they're mostly from people
who are really into games
and want that way of collecting
or holding onto something,
and it's not really the way
the industry is moving anymore.
As the years have passed since the digital
first became available,
numbers have flipped completely
with more people buying
digital copies versus physical,
because it's just so much more convenient.
You don't have to go to a store,
you don't have to wait for
something to ship for you,
and if you wanna play a game at midnight,
the moment that it's
technically available to play,
you can do that!
And from the standpoint of the companies
selling and making these
games, it makes perfect sense.
You don't have to spend any money
on creating box art or
designing a box for it,
you don't have to ship
copies out anywhere,
you just make the game and
make it available digitally
and can produce as many
copies as you want,
because it's digital.
And we're seeing moves
towards this more and more
as time has gone by.
Microsoft just released
an all-digital version
of the Xbox One, which doesn't
have a disk tray at all,
and multiple companies are
looking into the concept
of streamable games,
where instead of even
buying a digital copy
that's yours specifically,
you can just play a game over a stream.
No doubt, there are some amazing benefits
to an all-digital future.
That's why it's probably going to happen.
It's just really scary to
think about what we might lose.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
