can't decide between throwing down for a
shiny brand-new slim or save your money
and go with the original well I've got
five reasons why you should get the Xbox
one s reason one you want to maximize
your shelf space one of the obvious big
selling points of the slim is how much
smaller it is compared to the original
Xbox one in every single dimension and
it's not just about the size the slim
saves a lot of room through its form
factor for instance the slim has a
front-facing USB port as opposed to the
one awkwardly placed on the side like on
the original the slim also has an
internal power supply as opposed to that
big ol brick that the original had which
makes cable management and finding the
right spot to put your system a lot
easier reason two you want a system that
looks good
there's no point mincing words the
original Xbox one was ugly and this is
something the slim has improved upon a
lot the sharp edges the contrast of
black and white and most importantly the
choice of going with a matte finish as
opposed to a glossy one something that
might look stunning at first but ruins
just way too easily if you want a system
you can proudly display on your shelf
the Xbox one S is the easy choice with
the original sticking you in awkward
situations where you have to explain to
your friends while you still own a VHS
player in 2016 Marty Shh you'll scare
the fish we're missing a big football
Jack's my VHS home video recorder is
taping it right now reason three you
share my pet peeve of how annoying touch
power buttons are I cannot begin to tell
you how many times I've gone to move my
system where I take the time to shut it
off properly walk up to it only to have
something anything rub up against the
power button turning it on right as I'm
pulling out the power so now my xbox one
is pissed off at me I'm pissed off at it
and just no one's having a good day so
thankfully the slim has an actual
mechanical power button as it should be
reason for you have a 4k TV and you want
to get the most out of your me
one of the big performance changes in
the slim is that it supports 4k video
allowing you to get a much more detailed
image in movies than the original Xbox
one could capped at 1080p reason 5 you
want to get the absolute most out of
your games that's currently possible
along with supporting 4k video the slim
also lets you play games an upscaled 4k
resolution which isn't the same thing as
native 4k where things are going to be
really detailed but it's definitely a
step up from watching something in 1080p
and is going to look way better on a 4k
TV the slim also supports HDR which
basically adds a lot more color to games
that use it for instance it's going to
make the paint job of your car pop a lot
more in Forza horizon 3 and it's gonna
let Gears of War 4 take advantage of so
many more colors like vibrant reds deep
blues yellows and oh wait now it's still
just brown you get brown</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
