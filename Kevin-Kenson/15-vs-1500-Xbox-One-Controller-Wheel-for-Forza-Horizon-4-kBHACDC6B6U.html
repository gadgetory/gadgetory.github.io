of fun I've been playing it and while
playing I remembered something we saw a
while back on the internet and we didn't
have a chance to use until now this
little guy this is an attachment for
your Xbox one controller that turns it
into a little itty-bitty tiny steering
wheel this made by a guy called uncle
Jesse's got a few videos on excels modes
Etsy shop we picked one up and we're
gonna see how well this guy fares but
you know once we picked it up we could
have a thought how can make this just a
little little more ridiculous so we're
going to compare this to playing on this
this insane looking contraption is the
fort sedition fanatic wheel bundle it's
the wheel right here the base is
attached to the pedals and then we
bought the chair separately but the
point is this whole setup costs roughly
a hundred times what that little etsy
wheel does so you know presumably it's
gonna be a better experience just
slightly maybe I mean not let's find out
so this is definitely like a very
because I've been playing forwards up
but I've been doing it all on controller
and this is definitely a very different
experience I mean first off you're using
an actual wheel I was after remember one
of these buttons do like which ones are
which cuz there's a lot on here it's a
little bit to try and look at the wheel
and the camera and oh god I'm gonna
crash this is actually really cool
like I'm not admittedly I'm not huge
into racing games but this would make me
play them more I think like having this
whole kind of setup it's very old-school
or Katy viable most like I'm a member
I'm having flashbacks just playing games
way back in the day where you'd have the
full setup okay that's what we call it
rewind moment we're just gonna that's
okay switch the buttons yeah just rewind
that that's that's much better
so I'm in last I'm gonna go ahead and
blame that on talking to you guys and
we'll just that'll that'll be our
agreement okay okay okay okay we're good
we're good
this definitely makes like the overall
experience a lot more interactive too
because I feel like especially in parts
where you're in between the major races
sometimes it's fun to really explore and
try and do some of the tricks and stuff
in this but then there's other times
where I just want to go to the next race
and this just makes it a lot more
engaging the whole time like even just
doing the free roam parts of fourths of
horizon I just it's fun because you're
constantly trying not to crash because
you're bad wood feels like I am all
right little guy we can do this let's
try this out okay so this already feels
a little weird cuz like it's actually a
really cool idea that you have this
whole little like gear system for just
moving the left stick but it's also kind
of bizarre feeling you have to make sure
you're really kind of holding on the
little like thumb the holes I guess they
made for it because otherwise you gotta
lose track where you are and you don't
have that
same kind of precision while turning
okay alright this is Morgan I'm still
getting used to it but I can turn so
that works I feel like I would
definitely like this better if I was
just using automatic because then I'm
really just relying on like the two
triggers and then I can just stay seated
right here as soon as I have to hit
other buttons it gets a little a little
weird because I I feel like I have the
most precision control when I'm like
holding both down this actually isn't
bad I was kind of expecting this to be a
bit more of a wreck than it was going
then then it's turning out to me like I
get actually playing just fine in fact
I'm actually starting to better yeah
this is actually this kind of worked out
cool I mean look the wheel is definitely
cameras over here this is actually kind
of cool I mean the wheel is obviously
cooler I mean who are we kidding it's
really expensive really nice and a ton
of fun but you know for like 15 bucks
this is actually pretty cool but here's
the thing I'm not good at racing games
if you couldn't tell
so let's go ahead and bring on some
experts that might have you know a
little better insight on this hi hi I'm
Richard I'm the best racer here
well I was doing much better before the
camera turned on I just want to know
that much back yeah I like the force
feedback just cuz it gives you uh kind
of just some feedback in terms of what
the car is doing like you can kind of
feel if the car is like gonna spin or
whatever you kind of catch it yeah yeah
it's super immersive it's just fun to
play with like a wheel and pedals and
stuff feels like you're like actually
driving a car or it before I even know
how to use this thing this thing like
it's kind of cool seeing how it works
like just like when you're turning you
see all the like I guess the gears of
this like turning the the joystick
you're like this makes it harder to play
that maybe it's just cuz I need to spend
more time with it I think what the wheel
does is like kind of gives you an idea
what the car is doing like I don't know
if I'm turning enough with this cuz it's
just like kind of weird I guess
yeh I'm dead last oh but this thing's
kind of cool that's a neat idea I think
just have to spend more time with in
Prague get better hopefully now the
takeaway here isn't something as simple
as oh this really expensive racing wheel
is better than using some little
printout thing from Etsy I mean yeah
it's an expensive and cool controller
and you get what you pay for but what I
think is really important to focus on
here is there's a lot of other
controller options out there aside from
using just a standard controller design
and for certain games like racing it
really changes the way you interact with
the content it can make it a lot more
fun</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
