video is up Microsoft has officially
rolled out their backwards compatibility
for original Xbox games on the Xbox one
how does all work out actually really
really well surprising now just like
when they rolled out backwards
compatibility for 360 games this is not
a situation where all of a sudden every
single Xbox game is now playable on the
Xbox one
instead Microsoft is working title by
title to make sure every game is
perfectly compatible with the emulation
software on the Xbox one and that
they're getting the best performance
possible so right now there are only
about thirteen games available to play
now these are all representatives of
some of the biggest hits on the original
Xbox like Crimson Skies Prince of Persia
Psychonauts and one game that I actually
still own physically which worked out
perfectly for testing the system Star
Wars Knights of the Old Republic so a
really cool thing is that if you are a
dinosaur like me and you love to just
buy actual physical copies of games and
you still have your copies of older
titles like this one right here
you can actually pop this in your Xbox
one it's gonna download a patch for the
game which is actually just the full
game install it on your hard drive
you're still going to need to leave the
disc in the system because it basically
acts as a disk check to make sure that
you do in fact own this game and they're
gonna be able to actually play
old-school Star Wars nice little
Republic better looking than ever on the
Xbox one or if you're actually living in
the future and our a civilized person
you could also just buy these games off
the Microsoft Store download them and be
done with it but there's no fun in that
so now that you've had your old school
game installed on the Xbox one what is
the actual experience like playing it
well it is amazing visuals are crisp and
clear in a way that you would not expect
for playing a title from back in 2002 on
a modern day system now there are some
exceptions to this there are some things
where for instance text will sometimes
have little jagged edges if there's like
an icon symbol for something it can be
blurry when blown up and of course if
there are any pre-rendered cutscenes in
the game those are just going to look
awful but as far as actual gameplay goes
it looks incredible now this is all
thanks to something that Microsoft is
calling the huger method hugie or quake
II it's HEU
TCH why uh√© it's not hooch it's just
for touching which is not anything it
modifies the games themselves these are
not any kind of patches or updates these
old-school Xbox games it is the original
game code but instead it has to do with
the method of emulation where it's
making use of all the resources
available on the Xbox one take it the
best possible image for these old-school
games where even though they came out
you know almost 15 years ago when the
original Xbox was released we're instead
getting visuals that look like something
that was recent
obviously the textures aren't the best
in the world but it still looks crisp
and clear like it was a recent albeit
maybe lower budget game and the actual
gameplay experience is seamless I mean
even though the original Xbox controller
had a different button layout it still
had the same number of buttons all they
had to do is move a couple things around
for instance the black and white buttons
are now just your left and right bumpers
and you're also making use of most of
the gameplay modes in these games the
only thing that is missing for any
titles is that because obviously servers
don't exist anymore you're not gonna be
doing any actual online gameplay with
these original Xbox titles but you can
still do co-op that is local and you can
do system linking with Xbox ones you can
do multiplayer games from the original
Xbox all this put together leads to an
experience that far exceeds anything I
would have expected for backwards
compatibility happening in 2017 I mean
there was very clear love and care put
into this system so that people can play
favorite games that are two generations
old on a modern day system with an
experience that is seamless and honestly
even improved which is amazing and the
best news is there is more of this to
come like I said there are only thirteen
games currently available but they are
planning to add more coming in spring
2018 and not only that but using the
same method I mentioned earlier which
makes these original Xbox games look
better on the Xbox one they're also
going to be adding improved versions of
360 games that will play on the Xbox one
X now for that we don't have a full list
just yet but Microsoft has talked about
a couple titles that are going to get
this treatment including the likes of
fallout 3 oblivion and of course
halo 3 because it's a little surprising
that halo and 1 &amp;amp; 2 are not on the
original games list but hopefully
they'll be part of that spring update
point is then we're getting the ability
to play some of our favorite old-school
games in modern times in the best way
possible</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
