there aren't a ton of wireless
controller options out there,
I mean, of course there's the Joy-Cons,
there's the Switch Pro controller,
but when in comes to third party,
it's a little limited at the moment.
Now one option we've talked about before
is this guy right here,
one of the many Bluetooth controllers
that have been made by 8Bitdo
and while it does get the job done
and brings back a bit of a retro feeling
with the SNES design,
it is a little limited
compared to other options out there.
But now the same company that made this
has released this, a
very very literal named
USB receiver for Switch, and the idea
with this guy is that you plug
this into your Switch dock,
you can also use it with
the Windows PC or a Mac,
but when it's plugged in,
you can sync not only one
of these guys to it, but
also a PS4 controller,
an Xbox One controller, and
even a few more options,
like the Wii U Pro controller,
PS3 controller, or a Wii-mote.
Now like I said, this does
work also with the PC and Mac,
but there's always been lots of options
for using different
controllers with those,
what's really interesting
here is using it on the Switch
and it's actually really,
really simple to set up.
All you have to do is take
this little guy right here
and plug it into your Switch's USB port.
Then, you just go over to your settings,
and you wanna change controller settings
for Pro Controller wired communication.
So what's gonna happen
is while this is on,
it communicates with the
Switch Pro controller
via the USB port rather than wireless,
usually it just helps to make
the signal a little faster.
But for this situation, what it's doing
is it's reading this USB adapter
as a Switch Pro controller
that's plugged it, so
it's basically just faking
that it's an official controller.
Once it's hooked up, you just
hold this button right here
to start syncing, you take
your controller of choice,
we'll start with an Xbox One for now,
and in this case, we'd
hold the Xbox home button
and the sync button at the same time.
And now that it's all synced together,
it works just like a
Switch Pro controller,
which on the Xbox One can
get a little disorienting
since the ABXY is all flipped around,
which once you're used
to playing a game is fine
but if you're mid playing
and it says to press A
for something, you're not
pressing A on the Xbox controller,
you're pressing B and so on, so forth.
So, it can get a little annoying
but as you can see, the
actual experience of using it
is super comfy, now with
the Xbox One controller,
there is some functionality
you're losing out on,
mainly just 'cause there isn't
enough buttons for everything
the only thing you're
actually losing though
is a screen capture button,
so you can't do that
with this controller, you're
also not gonna be able
to make use of the motion
controls in the game
or rumble features as well,
but as far as just using
core functionality stuff,
moving around, playing the
game, it's honestly seamless.
So, Xbox One controller works excellently,
but let's try a different
controller on it.
Let's switch over to PS4,
so we're gonna put him aside
for now and we're gonna resync
with this guy right here.
Now if you haven't seen this before,
this is actually a special
design PS4 Dual Shock we got
from a guy named XLTeam over on Etsy,
we actually recently commissioned him
to do a special edition Xbox as well
that we're giving away
that's Sea of Thieves themed,
so make sure to check that out
'cause that thing is really cool looking.
So anyways back to this
video with using controllers.
Now I will say, in general
I do normally prefer
the comfort and shape of
an Xbox One controller
but for this specific instance
using the USB receiver
the PS4 controller is actually
a really strong choice
'cause it offers a few additional
buttons of functionality
that you don't get with the Xbox One.
First off, like I said
on the Xbox controller,
you don't have a screen capture button
on the PS4 Dual Shock,
you just hit the touchpad
and that acts as screencap,
which is really nice.
Now one of the bigger
things though is that
when you are using a PS4 controller,
it'll actually support
reading vibration functions
and use motion controls as well,
so if you're playing a game
where you wanna use motion controls
like aiming a bow in Zelda
or anything like that,
you can actually do that
with the Dual Shock 4
and it works just like it would
using a Switch Pro controller,
which is really awesome.
So the Xbox One is giving you the comfort,
the PS4 controller is basically giving you
all the functions you would get
using an official controller
but in a, in my opinion,
much more comfortable grip.
Now, while this does
work for the dock mode,
there's not really a
comfortable way to use it
if you want to do table top mode.
However, something that
we have done before
is a trick for wired controllers
is you can use a USB-C to
USB-A adapter like this guy
right here, I actually
haven't tested this yet
so let's see if it works, you know what,
I think we need an adapter
that doesn't need power
being pushed, so if you'd
like to do it this way
it's not working, at
least with the adapter
that we're trying to use, so...
So yeah, this works out as a really nice
little elegant solution and for 20 bucks,
it's totally worth it, I
mean if you don't really care
for the Switch Pro controller
or you don't want to buy one
and you already own an Xbox
One or a PS4 controller,
or any of the other ones I've listed,
I just think that these two
are the best ones to go with
as a 20 buck fix, this thing is awesome.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
