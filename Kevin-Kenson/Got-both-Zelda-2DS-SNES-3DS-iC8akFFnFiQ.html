coming to an end soon before it does we
are going to do something a little
different today
unboxing not one but two special edition
3d s's the Black Friday Legend of Zelda
original 2d s and the Amazon exclusive
SNES new 3ds XL King things off we're
gonna unbox this Zelda one first now
this is an original 2d s so it's only 80
bucks it's cheaper but because it's not
a new one it's gonna be a little less
powerful not gonna support some of the
newer games so this is definitely meant
to kind of be the Black Friday cheaper
deal for people that want to get a
system that alone play games but not
necessarily have the best experience so
carefully pull it out here got the AR
cards and the instruction manual power
brick because the original 2d s still
comes with them thankfully oh you know I
gotta say actually I like this a little
better in person than I thought I would
when I first saw pictures I was kind of
like and not fully sold on it
Oh woah actually this is one detail you
don't really see on the box I thought
this was just gonna be like a black
trimmed everything but it's actually
like kind of a dark gold and you've got
the main green which is supposed to be
like links to Nick and then yellow
buttons for kind of just the accents
like his sheath and such all based on
Link's character design now as I said
earlier this is one was released as part
of Black Friday they weren't selling it
for any kind of like extremely low price
but it is a limited run meant for this
year
that does come pre-installed with Legend
of Zelda Ocarina of Time for the 3ds
which was one of the oldest titles for
the system so you're not getting any of
the crazy new stuff but really saw the
title and a good kind of starter pack
for anyone that's jumping on the 2d s a
little later especially at the pretty
low price point of only 80 bucks moving
on next we're gonna unbox the SNES one
now Japan did get their own version that
is a Super Famicom 3dsxl but that
actually came out over a year ago and
took this long for us to get our own
SNES versions now because this is a new
3ds XL even though it's a special
edition it is going to continue having
that same annoying issue which is you're
getting the system and all the
literature today our cards but no
charger I mean I know the expectations
supposed to be that by this point you've
probably already owned a system and
you're upgrading but still a really
annoying thing I'm glad that with the
new 2d s's they send them but 3s is
still no
let's get this thing out oh okay so it's
actually all around - you got design on
the back on the front so everything is
maintaining the SNES color theme we have
this kind of off of grey for the main
design some darker gray accents for the
d-pad and some of the buttons and then
for the AV XY we're using that kind of
two-tone purple they've used on the
controllers way back when which looks
really nice also even though it's just a
tiny minor one actually really like they
use that same purple on the 3d switch
right here kind of a shame the volume
one doesn't have it though overall
really cool retro look so overall these
are both pretty solid designs you know
for the legend is all the one especially
I really didn't think I was going to
like this one and to be honest it still
isn't my favorite 2d s design but it's a
lot better in person than it looked in
photos I mean I really like the gold
trim I think it's a little bit of a
missed opportunity they went with a grey
thumbstick still I mean you have all
this yellow here and then still playing
grey which seems like an odd fit but
overall really good looking I think it's
also cool that this is a Zelda design
that is going for something different
than the usual kind of black and gold
thing to go for they've never really
done one that has been focused on links
colors so I think it's a cool thing kind
of differentiates it a little bit more
from past special editions on the other
hand the SNES 3ds XL I really like I
mean I'm always a sucker for anything
that's retro themed I mean that's why
did those joy cons over in the atomic
purple and this feeds on that exact same
vibe I think the purple accents are
perfect I wish it was maybe just one or
two of them a little extra like on the
switches here it's more of the symbols
but overall really really neat design I
mean I think the poke of all new 2d s is
still my favorite one but this comes
very very close so there you have two of
the last special editions to come out
this year I'm gonna put links down below
for both of them like I said earlier
this one is exclusive to amazon so it's
gonna be the only clothes you're gonna
find it first hand at least the 2d s on
the other hand was meant for Black
Friday so it's in stock at a lot of
different stores it is on Amazon as well
but those are a lot of people reselling
the ones that picked up from Best Buy's
targets Game Stop so on so forth so only
both of them check
out see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
