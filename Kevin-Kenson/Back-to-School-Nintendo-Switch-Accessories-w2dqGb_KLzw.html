its way again that's right school is
starting up and while there are lots of
great games on the Xbox and Playstation
to play there's only one console you can
actually bring with you try and maintain
a little sanity while you're at school
and that's the atari lynx two minutes
okay maybe not that's 489 but nowadays
it's the switch and there are a lot of
accessories out there to make sure that
you get the most out of it when you're
on the go so whether you're playing the
switch before after or during college
classes or you're in high school and you
wanna play at lunch or maybe skip class
and you can't go home to use your dog so
you need to play on the go here's all
the accessories to get the most out of
your switch in portable mode first let's
talk about comfort because while the
switch is portable it's not exactly
comfortable to use especially with its
flat design so you need to get a grip
case and there's a lot out there but my
personal favorite comes from skull and
co so this is a nice little thin case
it'll fit your switch gives a little bit
of protection to it as well
but it gives you buttons for using the
shoulders and adds grips on the back
with two different options of what to
use if you want a larger or smaller grip
design and it's still thin enough that
you can use it with your doc if you just
want to leave your switch in it all
times and while it does out a little bit
of bulk to the swished or it's not gonna
fit in a lot of different carrying cases
they actually have their own design you
can buy bundled with it
which is a little larger and it fits the
switch perfectly with the grip case on
it it also lets you carry those
additional covers and also games in a
lot of room for any other accessories
you may need now this is great for a
handheld mode but let's say you want to
play some stuff in tabletop mode now pro
controllers are really expensive and
while wired controllers are a great
cheap alternative they're not exactly
useful for tabletop because they have to
have that USB plug in which unless
you're using adapters and stuff it's
just a whole mess so you're gonna need
to rely on joy Congress now once again
there are a lot of out there but my
personal favorite comes from PDP this
grips handles are a huge upgrade over
the official Nintendo ones that come
with the switch when you first buy it
it's just a lot more comfortable plus it
has a way of walking the joy comes in on
the top which also gives you some
improved shoulder buttons to top all
that off this is a charge grip design so
it comes a little stand where you could
charge additional joy cons along with
the ones that are charging in your dock
by the way if you're watching this
wondering why am I watching this I don't
even want a switch yet well good news
for you we got a solution
that we actually have a switch giveaway
going on right now that's ending really
soon just in time for school so check
the link down below on a way to win it
next let's talk about charging solutions
because if you're gonna use the switch a
lot in Portland mode the last thing you
want is for two dallying you and be
completely useless and yeah it's easy
enough to say that you could just carry
around a brick and charge it whenever
possible but outlets are not always a
convenient option so that's where a
battery bank comes in now honestly I
started talking about it and realized I
was holding the logo upside down
and like I wasn't even trying to think
about there being a logo but as soon as
I noticed I was like this is silly
looking I need now obviously there are a
ton of battery banks to choose from but
when it comes to the switch one of the
best specific options comes from anchor
with their battery bank that's actually
officially licensed by Nintendo
these are high-capacity there's two
options to choose from and they're both
very portable and on top of that because
they are designed to specifically work
for the switch they're gonna make sure
that you're able to recharge your switch
back to full power as quickly as
possible now for when outlets are a
convenient option and you want to play
in tabletop mode especially for any kind
of local multiplayer situation a great
little pick up is this charge stand from
Nintendo now this is gonna give you a
way to send up tabletop mode as opposed
to using the kickstand on the switch
which if you've watched any of my videos
you'll know I absolutely hate that thing
so this is gonna give you a much more
stable convenient way to play in
tabletop and it gives you an easy way to
plug in the AC adapter so you can charge
and do tabletop at the same time which
is not something you can normally do
once you buy some kind of other special
stand this is gonna give you all of that
in one option super easy so so far we've
covered some stuff that is functional
and affordable so next let's talk a
responsible spending on something that
is completely unnecessary but more
importantly really cool and that's the
Ojo projector dock for the switch this
is a projector that also operates as a
switch dock so you just have to place
the switch in it and then will project
the image on whatever surface you're
trying to portray it on it also has an
internal battery so you can use this
completely portably not plugged into
anything at all which is super
convenient now admittedly the resolution
the image of pushes is not the crispest
but more importantly it is a bright
enough image that you can use it in a
dimly lit room and it's response time is
low enough that you can comfortably play
games this isn't something that you
would use as your
main setup necessarily but it gives you
this awesome little package you can set
up an impromptu gaming setup basically
anywhere there's a flat surface so you
could be dorming and just put it on a
nearby wall and you can set up all kinds
of impromptu out-of-nowhere multiplayer
games so there that's Mario Kart or more
importantly coming soon Super Smash
Brothers if you want an easy way to find
out who play Smash Brothers on your
campus this is going to get their
attention</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
