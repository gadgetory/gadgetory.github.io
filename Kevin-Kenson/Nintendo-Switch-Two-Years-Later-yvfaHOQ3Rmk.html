two years old very soon,
and time has flown by so fast.
There have been so many
games, accessories,
updates, and changes.
And, it's just all happened so quickly,
and yet, I can still so clearly remember
that first day I picked up my Switch.
(playful guitar)
♪ Go to sleep ♪
Fast forward two years later,
and the Switch has been
doing phenomenally well.
It already had a great first year,
thanks to games like Breath of the Wild,
and Super Mario Odyssey,
and the whole concept
to the Switch itself,
but the second year has
really kept up that momentum.
In fact, Nintendo reported
that, at the end of 2018,
they have sold 32.27
million Switches total.
And, that is a lot for
a two-year timeframe.
In fact the Switch is the
fastest selling console ever
in a lot of the regions
its been made available.
It's been selling so fast,
that it's already passed up
the GameCube and its well on its way,
and if it hasn't already passed with sales
we haven't recorded yet,
probably gonna pass up the N64.
To put that further in perspective,
Nintendo set a pretty
lofty goal for themselves
of selling 20 million Switches
in their second fiscal year,
which actually isn't over yet.
That's at the end of
March, but already so far,
it's at 15 million for that year,
so they don't have too much more to go.
And, even if they don't quite reach it,
it's gonna be so close, that honestly,
still an amazing sales year.
So, that's how it's been selling,
but let's actually talk about
what's changed over the last year,
starting with the system software itself.
There's basically been
three major updates,
at least numerically.
The first of which was the 5.0 update,
which happened shortly after
the first year anniversary.
Now, this update was
kind of big, kind of not.
It was mostly a lot of
quality-of-life updates,
for things like adding friend suggestions,
if you tied your Nintendo
account to a Facebook or Twitter.
Improved functionality
for buying games online
and downloading them to your Switch,
and some more icons to choose from.
The real big update, though,
came later in September, with the big 6.0,
that brought us Nintendo Switch Online.
This is the update that
brought a lot of functions
we were waiting a long time
for to come to the Switch,
including cloud saves,
so you could actually have a safe place
to store your save data,
aside from the Switch itself,
if it ever gets damaged,
the ability to link a Nintendo account
with multiple Switches, not just one.
So, you could play games on one,
and then keep playing another,
especially if you're
sharing with family members,
where there's just
multiple ones going around,
and also adding, of course,
a number of retro games
that has been building library over time,
including a lot of awesome classics,
and some interesting
remixes on them, as well,
like a version of Legend of Zelda
that just gives you all
the items and upgrades
right at the start.
This was definitely the
most significant big change
and update that has
happened over the last year.
There was one more, the 7.0,
which happened in December,
and basically added
new profile pictures
from Super Mario Bros.
That's about it, not a lot.
One other big change that
happened earlier this year
is that we finally got one big
media update to the system,
YouTube made its way to the Switch,
opening up a lot more options
of what you can do with the system
as far as being able to watch content
and not just play games,
but the system is still lacking
a little bit in this area,
as we still don't have any kind
of dedicated music app, or even Netflix.
It's basically Hulu and YouTube.
Good step, just need a little more.

♪ Of lovely things ♪
♪ And awake to find them real ♪
Well, Nintendo made lot of
software updates to the Switch,
they weren't really able to address any of
the hardware issues that people have
slowly been more and more
complaining about on the system.
So, lots of third party companies
and Kickstarter stepped in
this year to really try
and address these issues.
While the first year of Switch accessories
were a whole lot of carrying
cases and cover grips,
this last year was straight
hardware improvements.
And, one of the biggest was Bluetooth.
During the first year, the
Switch was a huge Kickstarter
for the GENKI Bluetooth adapter,
and after numerous copycats
starting coming out during this last year,
we've finally got the GENKI itself
adding Bluetooth support on the Switch.
You can use your favorite
bit of wireless headphones,
and even AirPods.
Another big thing was D-Pads.
While it makes a lot of sense
why Nintendo doesn't have
a D-Pad on the stock, standard joy con,
'cause it defeats the whole
purpose of using it sideways,
that hasn't stopped a lot of people
from missing having that control option,
especially when you're using
your Switch in handheld mode.
So, a lot of companies started offering
alternative ways to fix that,
including adding your own
D-Pad, using a shell exchange.
A D-Pad that just attaches
to the top of the buttons,
and even HORI released their
own third party joy con
that doesn't really have
any of the normal functions,
and isn't wireless, but
hey, it gives you that D-Pad
that everyone has been wanting.
And, of course, with the release
of Super Smash Bros. last year,
a big focus to the holiday season
was GameCube-themed accessories.
The Nintendo Switch
already started supporting
GameCube adapters leftover from the Wii U,
with a software update
during its first year,
but over this last year,
we saw Nintendo re-release
the adapter for Switch,
releasing new GameCube controllers,
and all the major third party
companies offered their own
Switch-compatible
GameCube-style controllers
from HORI, PDP, PowerA, and
even 8Bitdo got into the mix,
adding their own GameCube
wireless adapter.
And, while the Switch has
been selling really strong,
we haven't seen any
kind of major price drop
on the system itself.
This year did see a lot
of new bundles coming out,
with different games included.
And, even starting to see a big uptick
in special edition designs,
that are still a little
rough around the edges,
but are getting better and better.
The special editions for
Super Smash Bros., Diablo,
and probably my personal
favorite, the Pokemon edition.
One thing that we haven't
got in the US, though,
that Japan got, that's really interesting,
I'm surprised we haven't seen yet,
is a dockless Switch option,
where, yeah, it still works with the dock,
but if you already own one Switch,
and you want to get one for someone else,
you don't necessarily need
a whole new dock for it,
there's one at a discounted rate,
that I really hope we
see here, sometime soon.

Accessories, special
edition bundles, sales,
that's all well and good,
but the most important
thing is, of course,
the games, and while this last year had
a lot of great games on all platforms,
the Switch, in particular,
had a lot of awesome, amazing
first party exclusives
and to top it off, a lot of games
that were ported from the Wii U
that were great for their
time, but just, sadly,
didn't get the chance they deserved
because the system died so soon.
We got Kirby Star Allies,
which maintained the classic
gameplay of the series,
but putting it all in this co-op adventure
that was just so much fun,
and admittedly, also really
cute at the same time.
Nintendo introduced us to Nintendo Labo,
which, honestly, for adults,
wasn't necessarily the biggest hit,
but was this amazing
concept or idea for families
that was not only a lot of
fun, but really educational.
Mario Tennis brought us
another really fun
Mario-themed sports game,
although I can't help but feel like
it may have deprived us of
another strike or a Switch,
I'm a little bitter about.
Octopath Traveler brought us
an amazing retro RPG experience
that had this intense visual style
blending old school, 16-bit style graphics
with this 3D effect.
And, while it was technically
a multi-platform game,
Starlink: Battle for Atlas
had so much amazing Star Fox
exclusive content for Switch,
it basically made it the go-to version.
And, of course, you can't
talk about great Switch games
without mentioning two hits
that came out at the end of last year,
two games that are already amongst
the top five selling Nintendo
Switch games, period,
Pokemon Let's Go, which
revisits and reinvented
the classic Pokemon-style mechanics,
but with a fresh coat of paint,
and of course, Super Smash Bros. Ultimate,
which brings back all the
characters from past games
with some great new additions.
And, of course, those Wii U ports
that got a second chance at life.
We got Donkey Kong: Tropical Freeze,
Hyrule Warriors, Captain
Toad, Treasure Tracker,
Monster Hunter Generations,
and Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe.
While all of those games
made for a great last year,
there is still so much
more on the horizon.
There are a lot of games
that they've announced for the Switch
that are either coming up really soon,
like Yoshi's Crafted World.
Not too long after that,
Fire Emblem: Three Houses.
There's also a ton of games
that we've gotten hyped up for,
but we don't have an
exact date for just yet,
that will hopefully be
coming within the next year.
Games like Bayonetta 3, Metroid Prime 4,
Super Mario Maker 2,
a new Animal Crossing,
a new actual, full-blown Pokemon game,
and a Link's Awakening
remake they just revealed
that looks really cool.
And, all these games
are not the only thing
we have to look forward
to this coming year.
While Nintendo's remained
very tight-lipped
and constantly refused to acknowledge
any possibility of a new
version of the Switch,
it has been heavily rumored
that a new model Switch
is on its way within the next year.
But, what form that'll take,
we just don't know yet.
The two popular theories
that a lot of people are
debating are either a Switch Pro,
something that's gonna offer things
like a better battery life,
better graphics, more functionality.
Or, maybe a slimmed down, cheaper version.
A Switch mini that is smaller
with joy cons you can't remove,
but be something that's much
more accessible to kids.
And, those aren't the only changes
that might be coming to
Nintendo within the next year.
A lot of stuff is going on right now.
There's been a lot of rumors
about possible close
relationships with Xbox,
bringing Xbox-published
games like Ori and Cuphead
over to the system, and even adding things
like Xbox Game Pass and
cloud streaming to it.
And then, of course, we have to mention
the biggest change
that's happened recently,
Reggie is leaving us.
We're gonna miss you, man.
