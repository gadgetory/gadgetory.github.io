strongest Nintendo exclusive franchise
just saw the release last week of the
first of two new entries in the series
Super Smash Brothers for the 3ds which
also marks the series debut on a
portable system a platformer that
historically hasn't been the best choice
for fighting games so the questions are
these what does this one do differently
from past entries what game modes does
it have to offer and probably the one
question on most people's minds for this
particular version how does it handle on
a portable system and these are the main
questions I'm going to weigh in on on
today's review so first off how does
this one handle compared to previous
entries in the series well the stated
goal of Super Smash Brothers for is to
be a balance between the series last two
entries the competitive crowds favored
melee which featured faster combat more
advanced techniques and much faster
Falls leading to a lot more fast deaths
and the more casual friendly Super Smash
Brothers Brawl which just featured an
overall much floatier and slower game
making recoveries a lot easier so this
one's meant to be faster than brawl but
not quite as fast as melee now another
noticeable design decision in this one
is that this generation features a big
decrease in random effects the trip
mechanic introduced in brawl has been
removed meaning that you'll never fall
down for no reason though the effect has
been partially brought back through
items or some character moves that
caused it several characters have had
some of their versatility and random
effects simplified as well examples
being dual form characters like Zelda
and Sheik having been split into their
own singular options and the order in
which orlimar summons pickman's is now
set rather than randomly generated so
while it's not as fast as melee it does
look as though the direction for this
game was trying to make a more
competitive friendly environment by
creating a better sense of consistency
and balance across all characters
although I do think that it wasn't
really necessary to split up the dual
types
now stages this time around consists of
returning favorites and new ones with
most of the new ones now featuring
pretty interesting minigame mechanics
such as boss enemies that grant some
benefit to the player that kills it or
collectible items that offer a boost
once you've gotten so many of them and
the game now also offers the option of a
Omega mode during stage selection which
will effect
turns every stage into the simple super
flat plane that is final destination
now other little changes in additions
that are really appreciated in this
version as well include an increase in
the number of costumes or palette
options per character now reaching eight
and in some cases these are completely
different character models such as
switching between genders or Bowser jr.
featuring each Koopaling as an alternate
costume not only that but the game even
remembers what pal option you last
picked making that the default the next
time you choose that character which
admittedly is at minut detail but it's a
pretty nice one to have now new
characters added in this one for the
most part feature interesting new little
sticks and gimmicks to help them stand
out though some of the new and returning
character clones do feel a little bit
tedious such as Lucena being a near
carbon copy of Marth whose only
mechanical difference is the damage
distribution across her blade otherwise
featuring the same stats or dark pit who
does handle differently but feels like
an awkward decision considering how
easily he could have just been a pallet
swap now those grievances aside the rest
of the cast is still pretty interesting
and this is the largest Super Smash
Brothers cast numbering at 51 if you
include the three different customizable
meet characters which brings us to one
of the most interesting new mechanics in
this game
customizable move sets while me fighters
can be customized with one of three
different specials for each move slot
the other 48 characters all feature
changeable specials as well in some
cases like Megaman and palutena these
are radically different moves while in
most cases they're simply interesting
retweet versions that feature things
like higher damage with lower startup or
different execution properties like how
the character moves characters can also
have their stats alter to using
equippable items making them faster
stronger or more defensive but the
expense of other stats or adding some
other kind of special benefit or
drawback now this is where we come to
the one big complaint I have about this
game which is the fact that these custom
moves which are honestly my favorite new
mechanic are locked behind random drops
you don't start with any of them
unlocked right away instead you have to
spend time grinding away to all the
game's different modes and there's some
additional problems with this as well
first off not only is finding these
items a matter of luck but they're
actually grouped into the same category
as me outfits and those stat changing
items you're not even guaranteed to
specifically get a custom move and not
only that but it's even possible to get
multiple copies of the
move making those new copies useless and
while the character you're playing does
have a higher chance of getting moves
that are relevant to them it's not even
100% that you will and instead you might
just get moves for characters that you
never use the statue injuring items and
me appearance options I can totally
understand as having would be random
discoveries but locking such an
interesting sight system find something
you have to grind endlessly for just
really ruin some of the buzz for this
game now speaking of the modes that you
can grind out in of course the game
offers its traditional smash mode that
can be played solo against the computer
and a local group of friends or online
in pre-designed match types split
between the more item focused and casual
style for fun and the more competitive
items off mode for glory connectivity
wise how smooth matches goes seems to be
entirely based on the internet
connection your opponents are using I
found that on average 1v1 matches
consistently offer way smoother games
due to less players having the chance of
ruining it for the rest as for playing
games locally I've rarely experienced
any issues the game might occasionally
pause or freak up for a moment but it's
rare enough to never really ruin the
experience now other modes include
numerous little minigames like the
classic homerun bat challenge and
multiband melees or a StreetPass
minigame using little bumpers for
single-player we've got two returning
classics in the form of all-star pitting
you against all the game's roster back
to back and classic which has you take
over 6 stages of enemies including an
end boss and a slots minigame for
unlocking trophies and customization
items as well as a training mode to
practice different characters moves
combos and using items last though is
the newest mode and one that is unique
to the 3ds version smash run smash run
can be played by yourself with computer
enemies or in a local group of friends
players travel throughout one huge stage
beating up enemies to collect stat
upgrades and power-ups as well as try to
tackle special challenges to get a
little extra boost once time runs out
all combatants are brought together to a
final stage which may just be a simple
game of smash but sometimes might offer
an alternative challenge that favors a
specific stats such as a foot race or
tower climbing challenge now the mode is
pretty fun to try out and is a good way
to grind out trophies and custom items
and there are be some groups out there
that really find it be a fun way to play
casual multiplayer but in my personal
experience any game with local friends
is always going to boil right back down
to traditional smash
now all these different modes and new
additions aside the fact that matter is
that this game is a new smash game which
is reason enough alone for a lot of
diehard fans to want to pick this title
up but the one question a lot of people
having for this particular version is
how it handles on a portable system
well first off I'd like to praise the
team's design choices for this
particular version because a lot of
thought clearly went into making this
one being portable it's clearly lacking
any large stages not because they don't
think they're fun but because playing on
one of them on such a small screen would
just get horrifying if everyone spread
out so all the stages here range from
being either very small or medium in
sides also the game has this great
little feature of a training room where
you'll wait for multiplayer matches to
begin since you don't all share one
screen rather than having to wait for
everyone else to make their choices to
move on you can kill a little time
waiting by practicing moves on a
training dummy and/or up which is a
feature I absolutely love now all that
being said though I do have to admit
that there are some problems with this
game being on the 3ds not because of the
game itself but because the platform
it's on the 3ds slide pad is just not
optimal for precise controls and while
you can get used to it and still perform
pretty well there's always going to be
those moments that moves aren't executed
the way you'd like because you didn't
move the slide pad just right it's just
not the same as a traditional stick not
to mention the numerous reports of
people breaking their slide pads though
I have gone quite a few weeks playing
this version and the demo without
incident so that might just come down to
how rough of a player you are the other
issue is just how comfortable your hands
are role-playing for extended periods of
time on the 2d s I've been able to play
for a whole day and experienced only
mild discomfort by the end but a regular
3ds leads to arthritis City after just a
couple of hours so is this the best
version of smash to prove your
competitive chops in well that's up for
debate considering the slide pad but as
for the game itself it's still pretty
damn awesome and aside from that one
complaint I had about unlocking custom
items I have loved just about every
moment with this game this past week
having the ability to just play smash on
the go and easily set up local
multiplayer games anywhere is fantastic
if you're a fan of playing for player
games
I do recommend seeing if you have any
friends grabbing at first because online
does get a bit spotty with big groups
but if you're the kind just to convert
to player games and this will handle
great both locally
and online now if you're the super
serious type that needs to have the most
precise version of the game then just go
ahead and wait for it on wiiu because if
this is a sign of things to come that
version will be just as enjoyable
without the worries over how the slide
pad will affect your performance me
personally I just like to have fun with
friends and the slide pad in my opinion
is forgivable provided that's how you're
aiming to do well that was my review

you're interested in grabbing the game I
