on this channel before and not all of
them have been the most affordable so
let's talk about 25 accessories you can
grab those 25 bucks are under starting
with some essentials like this
protective case right here this is a
hard case design to put the entire
switch inside of when you're in portable
mode so it's not going to allow you to
actually take the Joye cons off or
anything while it's in it but that's
actually a really good thing especially
if you buy this for a kid because if
they drop the system it's all gonna stay
together and stay real nice protected
since it's a combination of both hard
and soft materials so it can absorb the
impact really well now another really
important thing that everyone should get
for their switch is a screen protector
now there are a whole lot of different
screen protectors on the market and
different designs the one that I think
is the most important thing though is to
go for a glass one do these are going to
offer great protection way more than
plastic ones and still be honestly
really affordable now cyber protection
another really important thing to
consider is comfort and something I've
ranted about a lot before is that I'm
really not a big fan of the official
Nintendo Joy Congress and instead I
really like the one that power a made
now yeah might look like basically the
same shape at first glance but the
actual grip designs for your hands is
way more comfortable and it's also kind
of rubber instead of a hard plastic to
be honest this particular splatoon
design is a little hard to come by now
but they've made so many different ones
for Zelda Mario a plain black even
minecraft so there's a lot of these can
grab that are really useful now aside
from the joy con grips there's also the
fact that when you use the joy comes by
themselves sideways not a great
experience but when you get something
like these this is gonna fix that a lot
you just put the jerk on in sideways and
it turns it into a little mini
controller that is way way way more
comfortable so it turns multiplayer
situations into just a better experience
overall now lastly on our little
essentials section right here is
something that everyone definitely needs
for their switch and that's more memory
you can get a little SD card you get
onto your switch and if your price
budget is 25 bucks surrender you're most
likely gonna find about a 64 gig maybe a
128 because those prices do fluctuate a
lot that's definitely the way to try and
go for one thing to keep in mind though
don't deal with the actual official
Nintendo branded ones they're just gonna
charge you more for name power now
moving on from essentials let's just
talk about some cool
that's all seemed after The Legend of
Zelda starting with this controller from
power a now this one does come in a few
different designs they've also had Mario
and stuff but I really think this is
Elda one is one of the best-looking ones
they've done and this is a pretty solid
wired finish for all around I like the
comfortable grip one of the cooler
things about it is that it does allow
you to actually switch out the sticks
for a couple different designs and
unlike some of the other wide
controllers out there you can actually
unplug this one which is really handy
for storage purposes now some other
stuff you can get the Zelda theme that's
really cool
hybrid cover they make some of these
that are also just plain black but the
Zelda one looks really nice especially
that little leather design this is gonna
give you a way to protect the screen of
your switch when you're transporting it
around but it also doubles as a better
stand setup instead of having to use the
one little kickstand on the switch which
just usually doesn't end well now this
is useful over carrying around the
switch but if you want to bring actual
games with you you got to grab this guy
right here now I love buying physical
games and I like having all the cases
but I don't want to bring them
everywhere with me instead I'll keep
those on the bookshelf at home and I
want to have games with me I put them in
a case like this I can carry up to 12 at
once and the Zelda logo gives a nice
little stylish Flair to it so you don't
confuse it with any other kind of cases
so we've got our storage solutions stuff
covered but now let's talk power with
this Zelda dock right here this is
really cool because it's gonna let you
charge both a switch pro controller and
two joy cons all at the same time while
sporting this cool legend is Elda design
on the front so you just set it up
alongside your dock and you're gonna
have all your stuff charged whenever you
need it
now last step for the Zilla section is
honestly when I first two favorite items
you talk about this guy a few times the
dock dock light up doc whatever you want
to call it you put the dock in this
thing hook it up and you get a really
cool looking subs design up front
there's a Mario option as well but let's
face it the Zelda one looks a lot cooler
it's not gonna add any real functional
benefit but it does make your dock look
way better now moving on from some Zelda
stuff now let's talk Mario starting with
one really important essential item a
dock sock then the entirety of this is
that antenna switch stock has a bit of a
problem that it can scratch screens if
you're not careful every time you're
taking it out and putting it back in and
a really easy way to fix that is one of
these right here where all you do is
slide it over the front and makes it a
nice softer surface and you get a whole
bunch different designs like this Mario
one right here now another thing that
Nintendo released early on for the
switch that is really handy is starter
kits basically this is just a collection
of a whole bunch of items all seemed
after Mario they did a Zelda one as well
most importantly getting a carrying case
and a little protective cover for
individual joy Kahn's you got a couple
other things like screen protectors and
headphones but these are the real stars
of that kit next something that not
everyone may need all the time but it is
really handy especially with how the
switches battery life is is a car
charger and this one in particular rocks
that POW block design which is really
nice so especially if you have a kid
wants to play in the car constantly the
backseat this is gonna make sure that
thing does not die while you're on long
car trips now next up something that
isn't really Mario themed about at least
for right now is pretty much exclusive
to a Mario game is a wheel for Mario
Kart now me personally I like using just
a straight-up controller but there are a
lot of people that like using the joy
cons of motion controls and this makes
the feeling a lot more natural compared
to just holding that thing and moving it
left and right and lastly something that
isn't really an accessory but come on
it's super cool
capi hat from super mario odyssey just a
great way to celebrate your love of the
series so that's it for fun thumb attic
stuff let's get back to some of the
important functional things you should
get for your switch specifically
charging solutions there are a lot of
accessories you can get to make sure
that you keep your controllers and
switch fully charged one of my personal
favorites is this charge case from on
tank this is gonna give a little
protection to your switch but more
importantly it increases your battery
life considerably in order my favorite
little things is that it actually gives
you new kick stands that work way better
than one will switch there's also a
little storage place up here that you
can put your games so it has a lot of
extra functions now something that
follows kind of a similar design
aesthetic but from another company is
this joy come grip from Nyko now same
idea this is going to be a charging
solution as well and it give you a place
to store games the other stuff is going
to do though is it's charging your joint
cons rather than the switch itself and
actually has a little phone clip you can
attach up here so when you're using the
chat services it's a nice little
all-in-one experience now you don't
really use a grip like this very often
but you still want a way to charge the
Droid clones
even more you can grab one of these guys
right here this attaches around just the
droidcon by itself and gives you a ton
more battery life and it's really easy
to switch out because you just have to
use some double-a batteries that you
take in out replace super simple now if
you're looking for a more all-in-one
charging solution a really cool option
is this guy right here this is gonna
allow you to charge 2 pro controllers
and up to 4 joi cons simultaneously and
are really
nice little aesthetic bonus it has is
that these are the light strips right
here they light up when joy cones are
plugged in so it lets you know whether
they're charging or fully done so really
good functional purpose but has a great
aesthetic look as well and then we have
another of my personal favorites which
is this charge case now I really like
having a portable case to put all my
switch stuff in allows me destroyed my
switch games maybe a couple little
accessories extra joy cons but what's
really cool about this case in
particular is it actually has a battery
built-in that you can charge up so you
can charge your switch whenever you're
on the go and not actively playing
really great way to increase your play
time so that's it for charging solutions
now for this last set of items honestly
I don't actually have a theme in mind
I'm not that creative it's everything we
have starting with these two controllers
from Horry now this is their pokken
design which is specifically proposin
but works great for a lot of different
fighting games or simpler ones this
other controller it's just a really
solid wired design with a changeable
d-pad now something else that's a bit of
a necessity is a stand like this the
main reason being that the way the
switch is designed you can't really
charge it when it's in tabletop mode
this is gonna give you a way to do
tabletop mode and charge at the same
time super handy now probably my top
favorite item on this entire list are
these changeable joy conch-shells
there's a lot of cool joy con colors out
there but if the one you like doesn't
exist yet screw it make your own just a
little effort now I got one item look
why would you throw this at me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
