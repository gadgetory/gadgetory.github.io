controllers out there for the switch and
a lot of different ways to modify and
upgrade them so today we're gonna look
at the coolest first let's take a look
at some stuff for the pro controller now
we've looked at shell exchanges before
and normally when we've done that's
because people make different thematic
designs or ones that are kind of like if
Nintendo did a specialization as
controller here's how do they do it but
something that we found recently that I
thought looks super cool is these now
this may just look like a regular pro
controller with blue handles but there
is a very important difference here
these are going the dark there's
actually a few different colors to
choose from for these but I wouldn't put
the blue ones because first off I have a
bit of a soft spot for blue lights I
think it just looks really cool so
having it on the pro controller I think
is a really nice touch but it's also
something that's a little more different
from what we've seen available before
the switch you know with splatoon we get
the green and pain with Xenoblade
there's kind of that magenta look but we
don't have blue yet so I just thought
this was a really cool different choice
for those of you that are curious about
doing this and you haven't seen any
shell exchange videos before it's really
easy to do on the pro controller and
it's especially easy in this case
because we're only changing up the
handles where all you have to do is take
out two screws bottom ones right here
take one off put the new ones on rescrew
them in and you're done like I said
earlier there are a whole lot of
different other shell exchange options
out there if you're interested in these
glow-in-the-dark ones particularly
though you can find these on Etsy we'll
have them linked down below along with
everything else in today's video now
another way you can improve your pro
controller that is even easier but also
affordable and gives a great improvement
to gameplay our thumb grip attachments
now there are a ton of these out on the
market but the ones that we're using
right here are from control-freak
they're a little more expensive than
some of the competition but I think the
quality is really worth it now the main
benefit of thumb attachments like this
if you haven't used them before is they
add a little extra height to your sticks
which gives you a greater range of
control and more precision and it's a
different texture that's a bit grippier
so make sure your thumb stays on the
control sticks at all times now with
control freak in particular there are a
whole lot of different colors and
designs they've done some are even tied
into specific games so it's really easy
to pick one out that also matches the
style you want for your controller for
instance we're rocking these green
on the splatoon controller so it matches
a little bit what are those interesting
admittedly kind of novelty controllers
for the switch is the Polka ball this is
released for Pokemon let's go and well
it doesn't exactly have very many
buttons it has everything you need to
play a Pokemon let's go without problems
but it also adds this really extra fun
layer to it the problem is at the same
time it isn't exactly the most
comfortable controller out there so a
solution for this that we found is this
little grip right here just opens up put
the pokeball inside put the cover over
it and bam it turns into basically a
nunchuck from the Wii where you still
have access to the thumb stick which is
also clickable there's this button on
top that hits the button on top there
and you still have of course the full
motion controls but all in a much more
comfortable package it also comes a
little display stand that has a nice
little place to put the strap so you
just rest right there so you're not
actively playing she's little place to
sit down we're not using it anyone who
picked up this in Pokemon let's go and
it's still playing well it's a more
comfortable way to use the Pokemon
controllers this is an awesome little
pick up now sticking with the pokeball
control a little longer
another profit has is charging solutions
because you have to open up this back
flap here to reveal a USB C port and you
don't always want to have to unplug your
switches dock or find this cable or you
may not have any extra cables have to go
buy one so another option our dedicated
charging stands there's a whole bunch of
different options out there we have a
couple of them right here including this
officially licensed one that's made by
Horry it's designed to look a little bit
like the Pokemon Center which is a nice
little theme along the fact that this
plays the Pokemon Center theme when it's
charging
the way it works is just has this little
attachment right here that plugs into
the back of the pokeball it even gives a
little place to rest the little flap and
you just place it right in here anytime
you need to charge now again this is the
officially licensed one that Horry makes
which as a resolve is a little expensive
for a charge roll that does look really
cool as well if you want to save a
little money there again a whole lot of
other options out there for instance
this one that comes from retro fighters
really basic design same idea we just
plugged the controller into the USB port
and it gives a little place to show off
your pokeball wallets charge another
great way to customize your switch pro
controller enjoy cons is skins like
these from today's sponsor dbrand they
have a whole line of switch skins that
are completely safe to use then make
them for the controller's the Joye cons
the switch itself and even the dock they
have a whole bunch of different colors
and designs to choose from so check out
the link down below if you want to learn
more now sometimes the way to get a
great controller in your switch isn't to
upgrade a controller that works for it
but instead take a different controller
and make it work on the switch and a
great example of this is the g bros
adapter for the gamecube controller oh
yes of course
there is the official Nintendo GameCube
adapter which has those four great ports
so you can do multiplayer games to smash
but there's one very awesome thing about
the G bros adapter it's wireless you can
just wrap up the cable to make sure it's
not laying around everywhere plug it
into the G press it after and bam you
have a wireless old-school actual
GameCube controller that you can use on
your switch to play comfortably whether
you want to do smash brothers which is
of course the customary choice for
GameCube controllers or use it on any
game you want you're missing a couple
buttons here and there that might make
it a little restrictive for some
specific titles but across the board
this is an awesome controller into this
day I still like using this more than a
lot of modern ones it's worth throwing
to that while the main goal this is
giving you a wireless GameCube
controller option for the switch it does
open up a couple other options as well
you can switch it over to an X input
modes you can use this with PCs if you
prefer or there's another ports you can
connect a number of different controller
designs to it like a lot of the classic
controllers that have come with the NES
and SNES classics if you need to connect
a whole bunch of controllers all at once
then yes the official antenna switch
adapter might be a better way to go but
if you just need a great way to use a
GameCube controller by yourself on your
system this is the best option as far as
I'm concerned of course we can't talk
about
different upgrades for switch
controllers without talking about the
initial default option on the switch joy
cons now what I have on these right now
is a clear case made by Nyko called the
swivel grip something we've talked about
a few times the past actually ever since
the switch first came out is that using
two akan sideways isn't always the most
comfortable experience and since then
there have been all kinds different
little grip designs you can use and I
still highly recommend all those will
link sometimes down below as well but
the swivel grip is an interesting option
because it accomplishes a similar design
while still having not some of the same
downsides the way this works is just a
very simple little clear case that snaps
over the body of the joy con and adds
these little well appropriately named
sole grips on the back you can bring out
when you want to use the controller
sideways now I will admit buying an
actual dedicated grip case can be a
little more comfortable but the benefit
of this is that it's giving you the
option to switch between using this kind
of grip or folding them back down so you
can still use it like a regular joi con
and even leads the slide rail open so
you can still attach it to your switch
the only real major complaint I have
about these is that the weights design
does cover up the unlock button on the
back they've added a little kind of tab
to make sure it's easier to reach but
it's still not super convenient so it's
a little annoying when you want to
remove it from the switch then we have
one of my personal favorite upgrades to
apply to any joy con and it takes a
little work but it is oh so much worth
it adding a d-pad one of the big
complaints a lot of people have had with
the switch design is that you don't have
a traditional d-pad on the Left joique
on it it kind of makes sense Nintendo
has the reasons cuz when you want to use
it sideways doesn't make a ton of sense
but honestly when you're especially when
you're using the switch in portable mode
a lot you really miss that d-pad we
talked about a couple of different
methods you could add deep pads droid
clones before there's covers you can buy
there's the dedicated hoary d-pad joy
cons you can get but honestly I consider
doing a shell exchange the absolute best
way to get a great feeling d-pad while
still keeping all the major functions of
the joy cons I will admit that if you've
never done a shell exchange before it
can be very intimidating at first and
there is that very real possibility that
you might just end up breaking the
controller or at least breaking one of
the buttons but if you have the patience
and you take the time and you're very
careful the rewards for this are great
not to mention you can get a whole bunch
of different color options if you're
like me and you miss the d-pad and you
want on your switch this is the way to
do it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
