edition gold ps4 slim with one terabyte
hard drive which no one else got at the
time but now in Europe they have that
and a silver ps4 slim which only comes
with a 500 gig hard drive but also two
controllers now this is currently only
in Europe I actually ordered this off
Amazon UK to import it which it said it
didn't ship to the US but here it is so
as per usual we have a second box inside
that's just plain and white this is
actually a slightly different thing than
I usually get with the u.s. ones it
actually says ps4 on the box and it
opens differently here is the side flaps
lips this one comes with two controllers
open them up yeah there's actually a lot
like the gold one to where it's got the
silver reflective as like the main body
but on the back it's still that kind of
just matte plastic look one thing that
is different though is the fact that
different power cable because obviously
this was designed for the UK thankfully
since this is a system that works with
voltages across you know the entire
world we can just plug in a cable that
we have for one of our PS Wars and work
just fine as a clarification if you're
not crazy like I said now in a ton of
ps4 is you can just buy one of these
cables by themselves for pretty cheap
price and then we have of course the
main reason we're opening this thing up
and that's information about how to
protect your ps4 that's actually really
pretty it definitely has a really strong
sheen to it like the gold one did but it
doesn't bother me quite as much with the
silver you ask you I've actually always
had a thing for silver systems
I love the Platinum GameCube and the
silver ps2 now is kind of worried that
maybe that wasn't true anymore cuz I've
had system and silver since then but
look at this one actually ii really like
this if you didn't know that this is
imported you wouldn't be able to tell
otherwise and everything is the same
ports buttons so let's take a closer
look at this thing
now wow this is the first slimness in
silver this is actually the first silver
ps4 in Japan there was actually a
limited edition Dragon Quest warriors
ps4 that had a little like slime design
on it and here we also got a Batman
Arkham Knight edition that had a little
outline of Batman on it but those were
both original PS floors and they had
some kind of decal or design this is the
first just straight silver design that
they said earlier it's a slim one and I
got to say I really like the way this
one looks
I touched on this a little bit during
the unboxing but I've always been a huge
fan of silver systems and it's not
really a color style we've gotten a lot
with more recent systems especially ones
that are just plain silver and not
having extra little designs and stuff on
them like the gold one I really like the
fact that it has this black trim which
offsets a bit of the flashiness of the
sheen on this thing which once again can
definitely blind you in the right light
Wow now this is currently exclusive to
just Europe there is no word yet if it's
coming to the US but that was also the
situation with the glacier white ps4
which we did eventually get here just
kind of silent relief so there is still
hope for you but if you're impatient and
you just want to import one of these
like I did it's really not that big of a
deal I mean physically once again this
is the same thing as a ps4 here the only
difference is the power cable you get
you don't have to worry about things
like voltage differences you don't to
buy a converter all you have to do is
get a different power cable so it works
with the wall unit here and it'll run
just fine there's also no region locking
for games on the ps4 the only times
different issue is if you own a physical
disc from different region than your PSN
accounts so as long as you're using a
u.s. PSN account and you're buying games
here everything's going to run perfectly
fine the only time region locking is an
issue that is a bit of a downer is if
you like watching blu-ray movies on your
ps4 this will not support blu-rays
released in the US so if you like using
it as your media device that might be a
reason to pause but otherwise Netflix
Hulu all that stuff still going to work
just the same and if you're worried
about price that actually isn't really
an issue either this is listed on the UK
Amazon fight as 249 pounds but when you
ring up for international shipping it
actually drops it down to 203 which in
US currency is basically 260 bucks so
it's actually cheaper than a ps4 slim
here which goes for 300 it is only a 500
gig hard drive but you're getting two
controllers a controller by itself is 60
bucks so it's actually a really good
deal and it's not that hard to switch
out the hard drives if you want to
upgrade later so there you have it the
silver PS force live now if you're
actually including all the colors that
have been released this is the fourth
color for the ps4 slim five if you
include special edition system so it
might be time to rank them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
