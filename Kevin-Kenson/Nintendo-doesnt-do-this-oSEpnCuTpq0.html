the book council wars was that you know
I sort of imagined at first it would be
like you know these two great
heavyweight who slugged it out like
Magic Johnson Larry Bird and deal they
hit really like each other at the time
but they had respect for one another and
pushed each other to new heights but
twenty eight years later talking to the
people who work at say on people who
work in attend oh they hated each other
still people of sega thought that the
people in attendance and the people at
Nintendo thought people saying it were
frauds who had to the stylet of
substance that was all marketing
I love replicates I love the ability to
boot up an old-school game that I grew
up with and relive that nostalgia or
even find old hidden gems that I never
knew existed hers never gave a shot
before and there's a lot of different
ways to play retro games but they're not
all equal some are really accessible but
don't really give the best way to
re-experience these games others are
more expensive and sometimes you just
want to rig up an old-school CRT with a
system which works too but isn't always
practical these days and an option
that's been really growing on me the
last couple years is the analog line of
retro systems they started off with the
NT which allows you to play with
old-school NES games then they released
the super NT for Nintendo and now
they're giving us the chance to relive
one of the greatest and most defining
moments in gaming history the console
war between Nintendo and Sega this is
their latest system the mega SG a
console it allows you experience not
only Sega Genesis games but a variety of
other sega systems
thanks to a number of different adapters
this combined with the super NT allows
you to relive one of the most intense
and most important moments in gaming
history when Sega went against Nintendo
with two very definitions of what
exactly is okay for a game something
that really defined the modern gaming
landscape I think a lot of people don't
really give the Sega Genesis the credit
it deserves I think when a lot of people
talk about Sega in terms of consoles
they go oh yeah they were really
neck-and-neck the Nintendo back in the
day and then they lost and that's not
really entirely fair I mean yes the Sega
Saturn did not do great and probably
even more depressingly the Dreamcast
failed but the Genesis was a huge deal I
think the way Sega went about opposing
Nintendo and the kind of tone of created
for that entire console war really
shaped modern gaming and to really kind
of get more at the core of this where
she talked to Blake Harris and author
behind a book called console wars which
does a whole deep dive into that entire
competition and is really enlightening
back in the late 80s and early 90s I was
just a kid and I was a soldier on the
front lines these console wars and so in
1989 when the Megadrive pan and the Sega
Genesis in the United States came out
Nintendo literally or almost literally
had a monopoly you know they had 95%
plus and Ammar
get one of my favorite archival finds is
an advertisement that basically says
there's no such thing as a Nintendo
meaning that Nintendo was becoming so
synonymous with videogames like Kleenex
is with tissues or jacuzzis with hot
tubs the Nintendo was trying to protect
the trademark and so when the genesis
came out in 1989 they were just an app
in Nintendo's mind there's two things
that are really appreciated about the
analog series of consoles one the
physical design of the system's
themselves and two the actual gameplay
experience you get out of them now
getting both of these upsides together
doesn't come at a super cheap cost but
no one else is really doing this kind of
work for retro games first the physical
build so like the Super NT the Mega SG
is very much designed to be sort of like
a micro scaled-down slimline version of
the system it's based on it's not trying
to mimic the exact appearance of it like
a classic edition system but instead it
just has little kind of notes and
references to its design while having
the small compact shell in the make s
G's case it's this ring that runs along
the top having different colors for the
front buttons which match the designs on
the Sega Genesis and mega drives
themselves and one little note that I
like is it also adds this little in
depth info of what kind of graphics and
quality it runs for the games which is
very reminiscent of the old-school
Genesis having that line of
high-definition graphics on the top now
like the Super NT this one does come in
four different colors three of them are
based on the different designs that Mega
Drive / Genesis had in different
countries and honestly all very similar
they're black systems that just have
light different accents this is the u.s.
one but this red and white up front the
Japanese version looks very much the
same but is blue right here instead and
the European version has more white and
gray accents as a fourth option that is
entirely different from all of them you
can also just get a straight-up white
out version visuals aside but I really
want to emphasize about just the build
of the system though is that it is a
solid little brick it is a dense tiny
system that doesn't feel frail at all
and keeps everything nice and clean
looking you've got the two ports up
front four controllers a headphone jack
reminiscent like the original Genesis
and then on the back just two ports HDMI
for visuals and audio and a micro USB
for power something that's really
interesting about looking back at that
console war is that a lot of people
don't realize
that while it was during the 90s the
Genesis is actually an older system it
came out in the late 80s and just didn't
really get full attention what really
ended peeping everything was around the
time that Nintendo launched the Super
Nintendo and two things that happened to
Sega here in the United States where the
console wars were fierce between say you
know 10 we think about this this crazy
heated marketing driven amazing game
battle but it didn't really heat up
until 1991 so two years after the Sega
Genesis came out and that was largely
because of two things one was the new
CEO at Sega of America tom kalinske our
sales right now are up about 50 percent
versus year ago at the consumer level
the market is down I think that's an
indication of where the consumer is
going and then Sonic the Hedgehog
you know sonic changed everything Sonic
came out in the summer of 1991 and then
the Super Nintendo came out in the fall
of 1991 and that is history
something the analogues really excel at
is this concept of versatility where it
appeals to I think two very different
kinds of people you've got the hardcore
enthusiasts that I've been collecting
games for a long time and then you've
got the other people are just like oh
yeah I grew up with Sega that was neat
I'd like to play those games again and
the way the SG does this is with his
approach to settings when you first boot
up the Mega SG you're greeted by a very
simple menu it has the option to run the
cartridge that is currently in it the
option to play ultra core which we'll
talk about a little bit later and most
importantly the settings menu and within
the settings menu probably the most
robust section is video which is how
you're gonna be able to craft all the
visuals about how these old-school games
are gonna appear on a modern TV now by
default it's designed for people that
don't really want to go all that
in-depth so you can do things like
choose which resolution you want a few
different pre-designed height and width
ratios and choose whether or not you'd
like to have scan lines on the other
hand if you want to really get into the
nitty-gritty and just fine-tune the
image exactly how you want it even by a
specific game by game basis you can
change to the Advanced Mode options
which opens up so many more choices if
you're a die-hard retro fan this is all
great because it gives you the ability
to fine-tune each and every game as you
start it up and figure out what looks
best on the other hand if you just want
to be able to pop in Sonic every now and
then and not care about it you can just
basically ignore all these options aside
from maybe the scan lines and still have
a great experience in fact you can even
change the menu settings themselves to
where every time you turn the system on
it just skips the settings entirely and
jumps right into whatever game is
currently sitting
system what I can attest to as someone
who lives you know who's who's fighting
this battle on the playground basically
like what each company represented it
was almost like Sega represented freedom
and choice and then intend
overrepresented control and control
probably has a negative connotation a
sort of authoritarian connotation and
there is some truth to that with
Nintendo but what I really mean is that
Nintendo had you know the Nintendo CEO
of quality they had very rigorous
standards they wanted games to be very
cartoon like family-friendly and Sega
had sort of more of a burden ripping
strategy which was important to develop
effort because developers are in their
20s 30s 40s 50s they wanted to do more
mature content they also Sega did a lot
to push of licensing licensed games
sports games
so really Nintendo was all about
Nintendo games and and developers and
consumers for a Hold'em salmon a certain
type of game that is on the Nintendo and
Sega really did represent freedom and
then they also tapped into this 90s
zeitgeist sort of this MTV generation
idea
partnering with MTV having commercials
that really resembled MTV's flash quick
cut style
what the heck was that
I forgot what it's gonna say
welcome to the next one Hope which by
the way was also by practice saying it
was having less money in the Nintendo
and needing to do things quicker um but
you know Sega their marketing campaign
welcome to the next level and that is
largely what they succeeded in doing
they welcome gamers to it more mature
current level of gaming where anything
went even though you know six bit
graphics maybe not all that much
anything you can do but compared to you
know Mario and Zelda was a little bit
different I also wanna take a moment to
talk about the controller that it ships
with this is the m30 controller from
8-bit dough we did do a video focused on
this before but this is actually
technically a different model which is
really easy to tell when you have them
side by side you're not really so this
is the 2.4 gigahertz here is that unlike
the Bluetooth model which can connect to
a variety of different devices including
8-bit dough's own receivers this guy
right here only connects to a dedicated
receiver so the downside of this is that
it's not gonna be able to work with as
many different things it really just
works on the Mega SG or an actual Sega
Genesis but the upside of this is this
model is going to give you way less
input lag like the Bluetooth version of
the m30 this is designed as kind of a
crossover between the 6 button Sega
Genesis controller and the Sega Saturn
controller and honestly I just love it I
think this might be my favorite retro
style controller I've used which is
insane because like I've said I grew up
with Nintendo but this is honestly just
so comfortable the shaping of it is
awesome especially for design that isn't
a more you know kind of modern grippy
one it has the best d-pad I have ever
used and just all the buttons everything
feel really nice and snappy on it
another really interesting aspect to the
design for the SG that actually
separates a bit from what analogs done
before the NT is there pushing this
concept of also running more adapters
into it now again this can play Sega
Genesis and Sega Megadrive games which
are basically just different region
versions of the same system and you can
also get up to a Sega CD sadly it will
not work with a 32x
on top of that however when you buy one
of these it actually ships with an
adapter so you can also use it with Sega
Master System games and while the option
hasn't been made available just yet the
plan is that to be sold separately
they're going to
more adaptors to allow you to play
things like the sg-1000 one of the
oldest things Sega has made and Game
Gear adding a kind of super Gameboy
approach to it the experience the sense
of giving you is honestly beautiful and
something that's really interesting for
me personally when dealing with this
system is that when I messed with the NT
and the Super NT I grew up in an ostendo
household so it was a lot about
re-experiencing games that I grew up
with being able to go oh yeah this looks
beautiful now on an HDTV versus with the
Genesis I played some of them a little
bit growing up but this has really
become the opportunity for me to go back
and actually explore this library that
was always kinda out of reach for me so
having a system like this opens up that
possibility to actually hunt down these
old-school games that I never played pop
them in hook him up to a modern TV and
actually play them like it was some
modern India release that's just trying
to pay tribute to retro games don't get
me wrong there's always going to be that
soft warm and fuzzy spot of being able
to hook up an actual CRT and play games
like they were designed back in the day
but it's just not always the most
convenient if I just want to be able to
hook it up to the main TV I had set up
that I also use for Xbox Playstation or
the switch that's just a lot easier and
super fun
something that really stood out to me as
being super important to is this concept
of Sega focusing more on bringing games
to adults it's not that there were no
games that appealed to adults before but
a lot of them were older I'm pretty
dated when Nintendo started making their
way to the west because when they did
they focused along the concept of oh the
Nintendo is a toy it's a kids thing here
all these fun family-friendly games
where as Sega didn't really want to
pigeonhole the entire genre into them
they wanted to make sure that there was
stuff where people who were older would
find things that were fun to play to you
know epic time things were just
perceived as childish playthings they
were sold in Toys R Us they were sold in
KB toys they were considered toys and
Sega under Tom he helped transform them
into consumer electronics you know I
remember playing video games with my
brother when we work must've been you
know eight and six years old and we
would play with our father and add and
play with us because he's an awesome
father but he would play with us the
same way a parent would playing with a
child
you know having a fake tea party like he
was yeah there was something kind of
bending about it you know he's like
video games are this kissing and and
that changed with Sega
the bidding was important in expanding
what's what video games were all despite
the fact that Sega's follow-up systems
didn't do that great and eventually
caused them to stop making consoles
entirely in favor of just focusing on
games I think it's really important to
focus on this concept of how the Genesis
really opened the door for all the other
companies that started getting into
gaming you can even see in today's
landscape where Nintendo is still
associated as being this sort of
family-friendly
more kid aimed games even though they
have a little more mix going on but
because of that we have Sony and
Microsoft bringing a lot more attention
to videogames to something that's for
everyone especially focused on more
adult themes and that really might just
be because negative first I think that
without tom kalinske Sega would have
just been a blip on the radar and and
there's so much that came from that
battle was between Sega and Nintendo you
know I think the most important lasting
legacy is videogames becoming more of a
mainstream form of entertainment and
skewing older you know took one of tom
kalinske
primary strategies was to try to succeed
where Nintendo was not dominating which
was kids or adults older than 14 years
old so going after teenagers going after
adults and turning video games much more
into what they are today was a little
more mature content a little bit of
blood as we know from the Mortal Kombat
stuff and so without tom kalinske i
think it's a go he would have been more
successful than he's you know also-rans
in the past and Sonic the Hedgehog would
have been a good game but you know
pac-man was a good game Frogger was a
good game Crash Bandicoot was a good
game didn't spawn an iconic character
that 25 years later lives on and so I
think that without tom kalinske we don't
have the industry that we have today and
and that also includes the fact that you
know Kilkee idea that Sega and was able
to compete against Nintendo for a
certain amount of time able to surpass
Nintendo they proved that the console
market was bigger than just one player
there was room for more than one company
at a time so I don't know if we have
Sony I don't know if you have Microsoft
we definitely a very different landscape
