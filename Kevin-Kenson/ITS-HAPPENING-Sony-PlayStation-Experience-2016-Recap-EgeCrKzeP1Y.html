just ended and it was certainly a press
conference not nearly as strong as what
we saw earlier this year at e3 which is
a little disappointing but you can kind
understand it because they got so much
out of the way back there and now we
just have a few still pretty big
announcements but not nearly as many
there are basically three huge things we
learned and then a lot of other stuff
crammed in the middle of this press
conference that might appeal to some
fans but not anything that was super
huge hype inducing so what was the
strong opening well we had a trailer
that I think a lot of people weren't
really sure what it was until the very
last second we got a big reveal that we
are getting a new Uncharted game that is
a spinoff not starring Drake but instead
Chloe who we last saw in uncharted 3 now
what's really interesting about this
trailer is that Uncharted is normally
seen as a very sort of action adventure
platforming kind of focus game which
there's still elements of that in here
but this looks much more like a stealth
game there's been stealth gameplay and
uncharted before but it's been terrible
so to see a game that actually focuses
on that using the Uncharted formula I'm
really curious to see how this final
product looks because it could be a very
welcome change or not a great idea
seeing the franchise Livan though with a
different character really interesting
now the second announcement and by far
the biggest for me is the rumor has been
confirmed Marvel vs. Capcom 4 is
happening except it's called Marvel vs.
Capcom Infinite probably playing on the
Infinity stones that take a big plot
point for the Marvel Cinematic movies
now this trailer was very short it only
showed us four characters for Marvel we
got Iron Man and Captain Marvel who is
going to be one of the later movies
happening in the universe and on the
Capcom side we got Ryu who is in
everything from Capcom and more
importantly for me Mega Man X he is
finally back in something even though
the series has long been dead these are
my favorite characters when my favorite
games of all time so seeing him is
something new I am just so happy to
finally see my child back now it was
after this point that the press
conference got a little more mixed we
had a really kind of hodgepodge mixture
of a lot of different mounts Mints some
cool some not so much one of the things
that I felt kind of mixed about is that
we got a lot of HD collections but the
way they presented them it almost looked
like we were being teased something new
from these fan cult hit franchises
no not really they're just HD remakes
which is kind of cool but not quite the
same level we're getting a wipeout
collection we finally saw a game play
for the crash collection which does look
phenomenal and we're getting a 20th
anniversary remake of Parappa the rapper
with a demo going live today now along
with this we also got lots of new
trailers and this was one of the really
big weak points of the conference for me
was that we focused on new trailers for
stuff that we already know thoroughly
enough about yes horizon zero dawn looks
like it might be one of the coolest
games of 2017 we've seen enough trailers
yes Last Guardian is finally coming out
in three days we don't need a new
trailer for height and yeah risen evil 7
we're getting a new demo but once again
we've seen lots of trailers already a
quick announcement would have been
enough we also got the announcement of a
lot of ports for a PlayStation 4
PlayStation Vita and PlayStation VR lots
of games that have already been
available on PC that yes if you haven't
got the chance to play them before is
cool but it wasn't really enough to keep
the hype train rolling the only one that
was really awesome is that we are
finally getting a localization for
Yakuza 6 and Yakuza kiwami
aside from that a lot of stuff that
you've already able to play for quite
some time now peppered in all of these
little mixed announcements we did get a
few new games some of which are exciting
some which not so much nack to a game
that I'm pretty sure almost no one was
asking for but it's happening it's
adding co-op which might be cool but not
exactly game a lot of us expected to
hear back from again one that looked
really interesting to me was next MOC
Inanna these are from the same guys that
did resogun which was a very simple
arcade game that came out when the
PlayStation 4 was launched it was very
pretty it was very simple but it was
extremely addictive so something new
from then that seems to follow in the
same vein hopefully adding some kind of
co-op option as well looks really
exciting one of the more interesting
things that happen during this press
conference is that we actually got a lot
of games announced for releasing today
some of these others ports I was talking
about earlier like Ultimate Marvel vs.
Capcom 3 one of the most bizarre ones
though
the new game from grasshopper
manufacturer let it die which we've
heard about forever and all of a sudden
has come out today and is a free to play
ps4 game which I'm definitely dive into
later day hopefully it's good
I love No More Heroes so we'll see how
this is so after all of that all these
kind of middling announcements of things
that were kind of cool not cool of
things weird to know about and things
that only matter to ten people on the
earth we finally got the closing
announcement and it's something that
we've heard about before something that
you know we thought was a rumor that was
dispelled but it's happening The Last of
Us part two and I don't know how I feel
about that now don't get me wrong I
loved the original Last of Us it was an
amazing game and part of what made it
amazing was its perfect ending it was a
closed circuit it told the story it
needed to tell so to make a new game
that continues this on even using a time
skip even maybe adding new plot elements
or calling back to the events of the
original game in some way it just feels
like a very easy opportunity to ruin
everything on the name of something that
you know is going to make a lot of money
damn it please don't let this be the
matrix all over again</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
