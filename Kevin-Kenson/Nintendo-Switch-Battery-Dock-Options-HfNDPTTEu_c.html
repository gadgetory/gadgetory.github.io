switch and after playing us a little
while you're starting to realize just
how short three hours of battery life
really is sure you can dock it when it's
low or carry out an AC adapter we need
to plug it into a wall but that's not
always an option so let's talk charging
solutions for your Nintendo switch now
of course an obvious solution is battery
banks now the switches power draw is
pretty intense but it's just low enough
that most conventional battery banks you
buy today that will support tablets it's
Kim charge just fine it's not going to
have a very fast charge but it's going
to keep it alive while you're actively
playing now something to keep in mind is
as it turns out the Nintendo switch only
accepts up to 2 amps while charging so
that means that if you were thinking oh
I'm going to buy this better battery
bank that is up to 6 amps out because
I'm charge even faster not the case it's
going to perform just like this one so
there's no reason to spend extra on this
so when you're shopping for a battery
the main thing you really got to pay
attention to is max capacity the switch
has a just over four thousand milliamp
hour battery so a good rule of thumb
it's very 4000 your battery bank has
that's another full charge now you might
be tempted to grab a novelty charger
like this pokeball
but really you're better off just
sticking to a more traditional battery
bank because the more easily fits in a
portable carrying case of all
accessories Nintendo has been really
pushing portable switch cases with tons
of different designs already in the
market sold individually and starter
kits or even as part of the Zelda
collector's edition these are just
perfectly large enough to fit your
switch a battery bank to switch AC
adapter for extra charging when need be
and of course slots to fit any of the
games you own physically like I said the
charge game from a battery bank will
only be enough to barely counterbalance
the switches power draw you're going to
need to keep it plugged in constantly if
you want to play non-stop with the
system getting barely over ten percent
of battery after an hour now one of the
benefits of the switch using u.s. PC as
opposed to any kind of proprietary
design it's just how much third-party
support and options are out there
already if you own any other USB C power
devices chances are you have an AC
adapter that will be compatible with the
switch or you can shop around
third-party options instead of having to
buy Nintendo's official design one of
the weak points of the Nintendo switches
design is that the only way to charge it
is the USB C port on the bottom the
logic being that's also how you use the
dock but this leads to problems when the
system is in kickstand mode as you can't
exactly easily plug in a cable if you
want to charge and play at the same time
using a phone dock you actually have a
method of keeping the switches screen
standing up and charging at the same
time with the option to plug it into a
nearby wall outlet full run it into a
battery bank making for an excellent
portable setup if you want to do local
multiplayer games on the go without
needing to take breaks for the system in
charge like I said before my review the
switch is at its absolute best when used
in its different portable modes so this
is all stuff to keep in mind to make
sure you get the most out of it
