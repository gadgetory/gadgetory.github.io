the Metroid franchise and after almost
10 years of neglect and not really
having any huge titles this series is
finally getting some much-needed love
from Nintendo with a bunch of coinciding
releases coming out today and we're
gonna kick things off by unboxing this
Samus edition new Nintendo 3ds XL so
let's check it out alright because the
usual paperwork on top with some AR
cards that I still don't think anyone
has ever really used since 2012
pretty straightforward unboxing because
right away is the system I forgot that
since this is a 3ds XL and on a 2d s XL
it still does not come with the AC
adapter which is kind of annoying stuff
let's see this pretty thing
oh man that's actually a lot prettier
than I thought it was gonna be so
something that you don't really get
across on the boxart for this it's just
how kind of like lightly shiny and
reflective it is it's not too much but
there's definitely kind of just a light
that this gives off that you don't
really get from the box art which just
makes it look like a plain simple you
know orange on the front and yellow on
the back Samus on the front Metroid
symbol on the back well it's not simple
for Metroid's but you know that means
simple to use for the series and the
inside is fairly standard 3ds design now
the new 3d s excel is not the only thing
that came out today there's also of
course the game that it's tied to
Metroid Samus Returns and as part of
this whole thing they released a special
edition of the game that is fairly
lightweight it's like 10 bucks more than
the regular game but it comes with a
couple little goodies one of which is
really cool so let's open this up real
quick to take a look now the first of
the bonuses is a fairly standard thing
you see in a lot of special editions and
collector stuff a CD featuring some
tracks from the game hold up before we
move on I realized I made one mistake
these soundtrack comes with it is not
actually a selection of tracks from
Samus Returns itself this is a
collection of tracks from across the
entire franchise so it's a lot of
basically a greatest hits album of
tracks from the entire series
now cool and all but the really awesome
thing is actually on the game itself now
at first glance this is just a regular
copy now for those of you that didn't
know this is actually a remake or kind
of a reimagining of an older Metroid
game Metroid 2 for the Game Boy and
something that has been doing lately for
their remakes especially in their
collector's editions is
reversible cover art that is actually
designed after what the original box had
so if you want you can just go ahead and
flip this around and I am going to
forget what the cover art in the other
side looks like it because I'm never
reversing this thing back this is
freaking cool now sadly this is actually
unique to the special edition of the
game if you get a regular copy it is not
gonna have this so if you really want
this reversible cover art start hunting
now because these things are gonna
disappear quick and then of course it
would not be a launch of a Nintendo
first party game if there wasn't one
very important tie-in amiibos now these
ones came in a two pack that are
releasing today along with the game and
the system and these are really freaking
awesome these are actually the first
Metroid amoebas they've been released
that actually have like their own
original Metroid base all the other ones
so far like Samus and zero suit samus
have the Smash Brothers base so you
actually has this kind of dark blue
design and the symbol for Metroid on the
bottom this is a really this is a much
better amiibo version of Samus by the
way I mean if you have the other one it
looks good but this one has sort of a
reflective paint effect to it which
makes the armor look much more metallic
there's way more detailing going on
as for the Metroid itself this would
actually caught me off guard because I
thought I heard this before but I didn't
actually think about it until I actually
open it and tried it out the Metroid
itself is actually squishy you know I
wouldn't say these are my absolute
favorite Noomi bows but they're
definitely awesome designs and I think
it's more further proof of just how the
quality of these things is just getting
better and better and better with every
release I mean you compare this to the
original samus amiibo freaking night and
day so there we have all the releases
today from Metroid Samus Returns finally
coming out you know after so long in the
series being just a little bit neglected
it is so good to see all this stuff come
out I mean obviously I haven't played
the game myself yet but reviews have
been amazing I'm probably going to lose
myself in it this whole weekend
these amoeba signs are great I love the
reversible cover and this new 3ds XL is
just so shiny and pretty you know after
so long it's just awesome to see so many
amazing designs celebrate such a great
game</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
