started dropping today and one of them
is the special edition military green
Xbox 1s now if you've seen one of these
unboxings before the rhythm is getting
to be a bit obvious these systems are
all packaged pretty much the same at the
very top of the box is a simple IKEA
style manual giving a visual
step-by-step process for how to set up
your system underneath that and to the
side is a box filled with most of the
other bits we need to get this system up
and running including a power cable an
HDMI cable and of course a thematic aliy
paired controller this is of course the
new s style controller so it features
that lightly textured grip and internal
bluetooth and it matches the system's
military green color even in the buttons
which is a nice little touch with a dull
grey trim accenting all of it now
putting all that stuff to the side we
have of course the system itself all
wrapped up still along with a cardboard
case filled with everything else we get
with this system including a physical
copy of the early in Lister deluxe
edition of battlefield one this will let
you play the game three days earlier
than the official launch on the 21st and
includes a few bonus DLC packs like the
Red Baron pack Hellfighters pack
Lawrence of Arabia pack some vehicle
skins and five battlepacks this box also
contains the stand for the Xbox 1s and a
few extra pamphlets and papers like a
free month of EA access and 14 days of
Xbox Live Gold which by the way I'm not
gonna use either of these so go for it
internet before you say that you've got
to tell us before we look at this video
what is an internet so after all of that
finally we have the special edition Xbox
1s
this is a one terabyte model and
currently the only way to get this
military green color is this bundle with
battlefield one it's a much simpler
collector's edition compared to what we
saw recently with the Gears of War
Edition system where that one featured
all kinds of symbols patterns neaten
physical modifications to the system
with its own startup sounds this one is
really just a straight-up color swap
from a regular Xbox 1s the color is
exclusive but that's really it there's
nothing else different or special about
this design and I gotta say personally
I'm really not a big fan of this color
choice it's just dull and dark enough to
where it doesn't really stand out or
make the console pop like all other
special editions or even just the
regular Xbox 1s I get the idea of
wanting to have a military theme but
it's so drab it just needs something
extra balance out the color like fake
battle damage dents bullets or something
hell even adding a light camo pattern
with a few brighter colors would have
been an improvement if you really badly
want a military themed gaming setup then
by all means this one's gonna fit right
in but from a peer of just regular
aesthetic standpoint this is definitely
in my bottom tier 4 limited edition
systems</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
