on this channel and normally when I
review them I do my best to be pretty
objective about it what I think is its
strengths its weaknesses what kind of
people might want one version or the
other that's not today's video today's
video is I am rounding up all of my
favorite switch controllers that we have
covered and I've used and still used to
this day either because it's my regular
go-to or it's one night to breakout for
certain specific games or special
occasions so let's talk about my
favorite switch controllers
when it comes to more specialized
controller designs than the switch that
are officially licensed there's really
not that much out there just yet it's
mostly normal controllers enjoy culture
news but what we do have our fight
sticks I love fighting games I'm not
particularly great at them sadly but I
love playing them and I love using a
fight stick because it gives me this
feeling of old-school nostalgia playing
on an actual arcade cabinet and for the
longest time I actually used the ps4
version of this stick right here the rat
4 and once it was able to get this one
on the switch it just felt like home the
fighting game genre has been growing on
the switch in fact we just got the
release of Mortal Kombat 11 so there's
starting to be a lot of great excuses to
pick up a fighting stick and I just love
the design of this one it uses Hori zone
in-house button and stick designs and if
you're not a fan of those or you want to
get the really high-end stuff these are
two pretty easy to customize if you want
to open them up and replace it with what
you prefer now while I am a huge fan of
this stick in particular whore he's
actually also got an alternative stick
design they've just recently released
which is also a great option to pick up
which is over here on the side now this
is their mini pet now the Hayabusa is a
great stick but also pretty expensive
this is meant to be a more portable
affordable option that is way less money
and works really great still good
buttons good sticks and a lot easier to
carry around with you well I love using
the wrap 5 as sort of my at home switch
fight stick it's not something I really
necessarily want to carry around with me
whenever I'm going to a friend's house
or playing somewhere else so this ends
up being a great portable option for me
if I want to play fighting games and
still have that stick in our face but
not be lugging around this giant thing
the only downside of the stick is that
the stick only acts as a d-pad which for
the vast majority of fighting games is
not an issue at all that's what most
have used for controls but because this
is designed for switch there is one
specific example where it's a problem
and that's Super Smash Brothers if you
want to use Super Smash Brothers with a
fight stick this one might work for you
because this is only gonna cause you to
taunt and you'll not be able to move
around
but for anything else if you just want a
small portable and affordable option to
use a fight stick on the switch great
option the power a GameCube controller
now I know there are those purists out
there that are always gonna argue oh no
if I'm playing smash I'm using a real
official Nintendo GameCube controller
I'm gonna use the adapter or maybe one
of the wireless mate but oh nothing
comes between a man in this game
controller new for Nintendo GameCube
that's cool that's fine
this gets the job done perfectly for me
it's giving me that feeling of a
GameCube controller and while it isn't
perfectly exactly the same when it comes
to the feeling of the sticks or the
button presses it is so very close while
giving me the benefit of having
additional buttons that make it a
full-blown switch controller and is
Wireless this is my main go-to for Super
Smash Brothers ultimate and also use it
for a couple other games in docked mode
the main reasoning behind it is whether
or not I think the design of the game
fits the ABXY setup on the game
controller if you haven't heard me rant
about this before one of the things I
love about the game controller design is
the different approach to ABXY and it's
something that doesn't work out great
for all games but for any kind of game
where the a button is a central focus
and everything needs you to access the
other buttons by rolling from it it is
so great for those it's a very
specialized design that doesn't work for
every single game out there but when it
does it is a huge win and something that
I really appreciate that power I did
with this one is they did release it in
both a wired and wireless model so I
like using the wireless one it's just
one of the main benefits of having the
controller to me but if you just like
the idea of a newer style GameCube
controller and you don't want to spend
as much money on the wireless there's
that option out there too another cool
thing is that power is released these in
a variety of different colors which are
all based on the actual old-school
GameCube controllers you can get them in
the traditional indigo purple which I
know a lot of people are bigger fans of
you can get in black I personally went
for the silver or platinum is actually
what Nintendo calls them but I had
flattened GameCube growing up that's the
color I've always loved and associated I
know it's not the main traditional
everyone goes back to but it just has
the strong nostalgic factor for me by
the way if you want a really cool and
easy way to customize your switch you
can grab skins like these from today's
sponsor dbrand they're totally safe to
use they come in a variety different
colors you can afford on the switch
yourself or the dock
check out the link down below now exit
roller is honestly a little bit of a
boring answer for some of you but
honestly it's the truth
the standard straight of switch pro
controller this is a great controller
it's not the cheapest one out there it
doesn't necessarily have any kind of
additional crazy special features but it
has an excellent shape and design to it
that I think is really comfortable and
just makes it a really safe go-to for me
for any kind of gamer I'm not entirely
sure what button layouts gonna be
perfect just yet
part of this comes from the fact that in
the long standing forever war of
PlayStation versus Xbox one of the big
debates is of course controllers that
you like and I've kind of always enjoyed
and found the Xbox style controller to
be more comfortable and that's something
that the switch pro controller means a
lot more in the direction of in terms of
how the grip is shaped and the fact that
it uses the offset sticks instead of the
parallel design something I love about
Nintendo's approach to the pro
controller as well is that they have
been releasing other designs but it's
not just the standard like oh we made a
red one or a blue one which I would
still like to see as well but I love
they've been doing a lot of different
special edition designs inspired by
different games for instance this is
obviously the Smash Brothers design with
the silver smash logo on it with the
white handles which I think looks really
really nice I'm also a huge fan of the
Xenoblade Chronicles 2 design suppose
dudes alright it's not quite my thing as
much but it's still a good-looking
well-designed controller I just think
when it comes to aesthetics they're
really starting to find a better way of
tackling special edition controller
designs and I'm really excited to see
more of these down the line plus if
you're not a fan of any of the designs
that are actually currently out it's
surprisingly really easy to do a shell
swap on these I mean I've done shell
swaps on a couple different Nintendo
products Joey cons are very difficult
switches themselves up to hard for at
least the backplate pro controllers are
the easiest thing it just takes a couple
screws to take out nothing's complex are
not rewiring anything really simple job
you can find all kinds of different
third-party designs out there including
stuff like glow-in-the-dark handles or
even a Pokemon style one this a safe
slightly uninspired choice sure but for
good reason now I might lose some of you
on this next one it's gonna be a little
bit of a break from tradition and maybe
a little awkward for some but honestly
it's one of my favorite recent releases
for the switch the a bit doughy m30
which is a Sega Genesis style controller
thank God good night beat CPU duel
tonight I know this is a weird crossover
of old-school enemies but when it comes
to retro games on the switch I love
having a good old-school deep head to
use on it and a pedo is one of the best
companies when it comes to making deep
heads on controllers and a lot of pee
we'll go to the s and xxx Pro which is a
great awesome option if you want a more
SNES shape style controller it does well
and that's what I used before this one
came out but this has completely taken
over as my new favorite the main reason
being that while it isn't exactly a
traditional Nintendo shape or button
layout it is a very comfortable and
roller design probably one of the most
comfortable retro style controllers that
I've used and it has one of if not the
best d-pad I've ever used flat out it's
great for traditional directional
movement but also awesome for rolling
inputs they also added shoulder buttons
to this so it adds more control options
that'll make it actually fit for a lot
more games on the switch though might
make use of more than just the six right
here on the front and while I do
personally prefer to use the stick in
fighting games if I wanted to use a pad
option outside of the game computer
roller or smash again that's its own
dedicated option but any other fighters
if I want to use a fight pad this is the
way I go but you can also buy a special
dedicated 2.4 gigahertz model that
connects specifically to an adapter that
plugs into Sega Genesis so if you want
to have the fastest cleanest connection
possible and use it on old school system
that's another option out there for you
next let's take a break from standard
controllers and talk about joy cons or
in this case joy car this is the hoary
d-pad controller and at first glance
there are some things about it that some
people get scared of right away the fact
that it doesn't have any kind of
wireless connection it doesn't have
Rumble none of that matters because it
addresses one of the biggest issues that
a lot people have with the switchin
handheld mode no built-in d-pad this is
a problem that a lot of people have had
with the switch design there's been a
lot of different solutions to offer for
how to fix this including different
covers that you just put on top of
regular joi cons there's shell exchanges
we've done before and those give you the
feeling of a d-pad in the sense that
there is a d-shaped button you can press
but the problem not deceived the crush
it that's an outtake
while this gives you the feeling of a
d-pad where you have a cross-shaped
thing you can press it's not really a
d-pad it's just for clicky buttons that
now have a different shape to them and
it doesn't have the same kind of feeling
that an actual retro d-pad would have
the hoary d-pad on the other hand
actually feels like a real deep at
something that's inspired by retro
controllers and so when I'm playing
retro games and hand out on the switch
this is something that I really like to
have on hand instead of the traditional
joi cons basically anytime I want to
play a game handheld and use a d-pad
this gets attached and abilities I
haven't seen these before they do come
in a couple different designs outside of
this Zelda one they're all inspired by
different major Nintendo franchises like
there's a Pikachu pokémon one there's a
Mario and that's red I personally like
the Zelda one the most though I think
the black and gold is always a really
good color combination and something it
does a little differently from the other
two is that they both kind of have a
patterning effect on the front which
doesn't look bad I just think the very
more intentional specific layout on this
looks a lot better really the only major
complaint I have about these is the fact
that they are a wired or I guess
directly connected option only there is
no wireless versions just yet hopefully
that's something we see down the line
because I would love a wireless droidcon
that gives me that d-pad option</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
