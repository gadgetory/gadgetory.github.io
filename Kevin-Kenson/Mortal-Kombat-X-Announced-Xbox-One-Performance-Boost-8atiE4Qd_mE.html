part of this new channel I want to start
bringing you guys more content other
than just game reviews and first day
impressions and as part of that I'm
gonna start bringing you guys weekly
Sunday news videos where I just cover
the highlights of all the major gaming
news that has come out this past week
and maybe throw in my two cents about it
so first things first there is this
little event coming up in a couple of
days some of you may have heard of III
and as part of that a lot of companies
seem like they just can't wait under
releasing a lot of III trailers really
early this past week some of them are
for games that we already know about and
are just seeing new footage of but some
of them are for brand new games and now
these brand new games one of the biggest
ones by far was the announcement of a
new Mortal Kombat game Mortal Kombat X
whose trailer depicts everyone's
favorite color-coded ninjas fighting
one-on-one with of course the series
traditional gruesome finish now this
looks to be a full reboot of the Mortal
Kombat franchise not just time-travel
shenanigans like an MK 9 NetherRealm
Studios has stated that this reboot will
feature both classic characters that we
all know and love as well as a bunch of
new ones as well including some
returning mechanics from MK 9 such as X
ray attacks now MK 9 was already a great
breath of fresh air into the series and
really brought it back up into Fame and
hopefully with new characters and enough
of the right mechanics being brought
back this one could continue that
upswing now in addition to MK X there
were a lot of trailers for games we
already knew about this past week
including Borderlands the pre-sequel
Lord of the Rings shadows of Mordor
Kingdom Hearts 2.5 remix and The Witcher
3 now speaking of The Witcher 3 its
developer CD Projekt RED had one other
announcement to bring us during the
press conference their storefront
website GOG is now going to get its own
platform akin to steam called GOG calm
galaxy galaxy is meant to be a way for
users to purchase organize and keep
their favorite games updated isn't in
direct competition with applications
like Steam origin and you play but with
the important distinction that it has a
much higher emphasis on consumer freedom
just like with GOG any games you
purchased through galaxy will be 100%
drm free and any additional functions or
features that galaxy has to offer
will be completely optional for instance
if you want to be able to chat with
other users you can make an account so
that you have an account name to talk to
people with or you could choose not to
do so and just focus on playing your
favorite single-player games now in
addition to this they've also talked up
that it'll have the ability to support
cross play meaning that if you buy
game on galaxy and your best friend buys
it on Steam you both can still play
together and chat together without the
need of a third party program the
introduction of a drm-free platform like
this might finally give steam the
competition that it needs and it's my
personal hope that if galaxy does get a
lot more popularity that also helped
rekindle a lot more interest in older
classic games that are harder to find
elsewhere that you can find on GOG now
this last bit of news I want to cover is
in regards to the Xbox one it's become
pretty popular opinion that at least as
far as this past year goes ps4 has
basically been winning at a console war
especially considering recent news that
Sony has sold more units in this past
fiscal year than Nintendo or Microsoft
but these past couple of weeks Microsoft
has been coming out with a lot of news
that has really helped to improve their
position including things like no longer
requiring Xbox Live Gold for using a
third-party services like Netflix or
Hulu or finally releasing an Xbox one
coming out and tomorrow that is not
going to require a Kinect and doesn't
include one to begin with well as a
direct result of that last piece of news
Microsoft announced earlier this week
that its dev kit will now allow
developers to make use of GPU resources
that used to be dedicated just for
Kinect integration now of course this is
up to individual developers but what
this means is that hopefully future
titles on the Xbox one especially those
that don't make any use of the Kinect
will now have better graphics than they
would have otherwise now of course
there's no hard data on the suggests yet
but Microsoft estimates the games could
see as much as a 10% boost in
performance meaning that could look a
lot better and hopefully shorten the gap
we've been seeing in a lot of
multi-platform games between ps4 and
Xbox one such as in Metal Gear Solid 5
Ground zeroes or in watchdogs
so that was just a little look at some
of the biggest news to come out this
past week III is just in another couple
of days so there's a lot more
information coming out soon and in fact
I plan to bring you guys actual full
reviews of the different press releases
happening in the first couple of days
and let you know my thoughts on them if
