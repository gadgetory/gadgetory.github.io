arising rumors that Microsoft might be
working on a fourth model Xbox one to
come out sometime next year something
that would be kind of a super-slim model
where it's cheaper and smaller than
currently available Xbox ones and the
way that Microsoft would achieve this is
with a very interesting and very
important single decision dropping the
disk drive ultimate in radical
technology turbo graphic CD it uses the
immense memory of CD soft super intense
gameplay now there are a lot of reasons
why they might want to drop disk drive
and honestly I think they're good ones
we'll get into that a little bit but
first let's talk about the immediate
impact of doing something like that by
removing the disk drive from the Xbox
you end up making a lot of free space
inside of the system and thus you can
make it a lot more cheap because you're
able to use larger parts or other things
you can rearrange it a little bit on the
inside and overall make a much more
affordable system and if these rumors
are true the idea is to make a system
that is on par with the Xbox 1s in terms
of power but at a price point below $200
as for what something like this would
look like I think Microsoft is currently
on the trend of really wanting to focus
on making all their systems very
aesthetically similar you can already
see that with the 1s and One X where yes
there are some differences where they
place vents and you know some very
specific shapes but the general design
idea where you have this main
rectangular block piece with the stand I
think they're gonna keep that now by
removing the disk drive and depending on
what they do with other parts they could
heavily change the shape of the system
it could just be something that's
thinner or it could potentially even
move to being closer like a square shape
as opposed to the rectangular we're
currently seeing like I said earlier
this is an interesting and I think good
idea for a few different reasons and
keep in mind this is coming from someone
who traditionally loves physical media I
have held on as long as I can still buy
physical copies of my games because yeah
I'm a little vain I like having a
collection that I can look at but at the
same time there's getting to be fewer
and fewer good reasons to really justify
them still being a thing aside from
common arguments like Oh digital is just
so much more convenient and then
obviously the fact that we talked about
earlier where it's safe through min the
system there's just a lot of reasons why
discs don't make a ton of sense anymore
to use on a major console first off it's
just outdated technology first remove
the disk
from the case push open on your CDI
player well you may use the controller
to open the disk door you know most
games now when you buy them even
physically you're installing most of the
game on your hard drive because the time
it takes to read a disk is just too slow
to be functional and we're even getting
the point where our games are getting so
large some games still need to disks
even though we have such larger
capacities now for instance Red Dead
Redemption 2 just launched with an
install disk
and a play disk that's crazy not to
mention the fact that producing
something like this in large quantities
creates a lot of waste when versus
compared to just buying something
digitally where you just download to
your system and you're done that's
really simple now there are some counter
arguments to why you might not want this
but honestly a lot of them aren't really
is true as they used to be for instance
yes going all digital does mean you're
gonna use up more harddrive space going
physical but that doesn't mean much
anymore because like I said most games
have you install the vast majority of
their data now some don't some games
don't rely on as much like say fighting
games but anything that's open-world you
basically install the whole thing and
you're gonna use that space either way
now there's also the fear that well if
you go all digital some games might at
one point just cease to exist and
there's no way to get them which is a
rightful fear I mean we're already
seeing that happen with some games like
the PT demo that you can't download
anymore even if you got it once before
but the issue there is that games are
not relying so much on day one patches
or DLC or balance fixes that even if you
still owned a physical copy of a game it
might not really be usable in the far
future if you can't download all those
fixes and such it's not going to run the
way that's really meant to there's
always going to be that part of me that
wants the nostalgia and loves the idea
of owning physical games and all the old
cartridges and stuff I have and you know
I'm still gonna get some of those but it
just doesn't really make sense anymore
and I think it's kind of going the same
way that a lot of other digital media is
where you know you can still have those
limited physical releases there can be
those physical options for people that
really want to collect that but it can't
be the default option for everyone
anymore as of right now Microsoft has
not commented at all all these rumors so
we have no indication of whether or not
this is at all real and usually I'm very
very skeptical of rumors but I kind of
lean towards this one being real and if
it's not it's something that could very
easily see Microsoft for really doing
and this
ladies into something that I think has
really bitten Microsoft's kind of hidden
strategy over the last couple years
which is to try out a couple of
different slightly crazy ideas and
seeing how the market reacts to it and
whether or not it would work for a
potential new system whatever you want
to call it the Xbox too but the point is
you're seeing all these different ideas
like Xbox game paths where you're not
only being able to play all these games
for monthly fee but you're getting
access to brand-new games right away on
launch day like for its horizon for
you're seeing again with the idea where
they tested the market for people buying
Xboxes and paying for it monthly versus
having actually just buy a system
straight up at the full price and if
this rumor is true we're seeing another
test with the idea of a system that
doesn't have a disk drive it all plays
into this concept of a new Xbox that
focuses more on digital and streamable
games instead of the traditional way
consoles are perceived</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
