to say that the switch has been a
success it's this awesome combination of
portable and home gaming it's got some
great first party games on it but for
all those benefits
it does have some downsides and some
negative quirks some of which honestly
just don't make sense in 2017 like the
fact that right now there is no built in
or official way to do wireless
headphones on this system there's no
Bluetooth there's no proprietary
wireless connection nothing and this is
something that was present in the Vita
almost six years ago and it's not in the
switch now I've been thinking about this
problem a lot recently because I love
using my switch as a dedicated handheld
but I'm honestly not a huge fan of its
built-in speakers while I can use wired
headphones I don't like having to be
connected to my system in case I do
something like set it down and then drag
it off of a counter which is probably
happen more times than I care to admit
the Prague is I want a wireless solution
and so something I decided to test out
we're Bluetooth transmitters and the
results for the most part pretty good
let's dive in exactly how this worked
out so here's the deal when you see good
reviews on Bluetooth transmitter like
this on Amazon or Best Buy or whatever
site it's not always gonna be indicative
of how good will be used in a gaming
system a lot of people are buying these
kind of things to use them for say a
Bluetooth speaker and just a sound setup
they have and in a situation like that
all they're worried about is sound
quality well they're not thinking about
is latency which when you're playing a
game is a really really big deal and
that's exactly the problem I ran into
when testing some of these out see when
we got these at first glance we grabbed
these two different models now at first
glance I thought this one was going to
be the better one because it's a built
in all one experience you just plug it
into the top done and done this one on
the other hand doubles as with a
transmitter and receiver it has all
kinds of additional adapters and
different options of ways to set it up a
little more of an all-in-one package but
it looks a bit like a mess when you plug
it into your system however after
testing both of these actually ended up
having way less latency while using this
Bluetooth transmitter where there was
still a tiny little bit but it was very
forgivable whereas this one we're
getting the situations where I hit a
button and then I hear a sound go off
right
after now is this latency bad enough to
the point of which is going to ruin your
game experience honestly not a whole lot
you know depending on the game you're
playing yes you for doing something
competitive we're hearing a sound at
just the right moments you can react and
you know life-or-death situations yes
this can be a problem but if you're just
doing laid back casual gaming it is a
very small amount of latency that is
honestly very forgivable and often times
you won't even really notice it unless
you're trying your best to really find
and know whether or not sounds are
happening right as you're pressing
buttons and things happen on screen
really if you're just looking for a
solution for more casual gaming that
you're doing on the go or laying back on
the couch this is a great solution as
long as you don't mind having a little
tab thing hanging off the top of your
system now an important thing to note
too is that while I was working on this
as being a solution for portable gaming
it'll actually work with a home
entertainment set up as well kinda like
what we did with that retro Super
Nintendo setup see when the switch is
docked if you plug anything into the
auxiliary port it's going to override
the audio going to the HDMI so if you
wanted to adopt switch you could plug
this in and connect it to a pair of
Bluetooth speakers or maybe even in a
headset if you don't want to keep people
up in the house while you're playing a
game like splatoon unless of course are
going to be screaming while you're
playing now of course a wireless
Bluetooth setup would be incomplete
without headphones now yes you could go
searching for a gaming headset that
supports Bluetooth but honestly that
really isn't the best choice for what we
want to do here we want something that's
going to support good casual gaming that
you can do on the go it's gonna give you
great sound for a variety of games a lot
of gaming can sit on the other hand are
designed more for just like dedicated
multiplayer experiences directional
hearing separating explosions of
gunshots not what we need instead you
can go for something that's much more
traditional whether it's some in-ear
headphones or just a better looking set
of over years they're gonna do much
better all-around sound quality that you
can use on the go or in a home
entertainment setup like we said earlier
so did we find the perfect solution for
our wireless headset problem the switch
sadly not just yet you know the
Bluetooth is going to give you a way to
be able to do this comfortably in a
working casual gaming but like I said
there is a little bit of latency which
will mess up some games so you're gonna
have to stick with wired if that is
important to you if not this is a great
little solution for when you just want
to do some nice laid-back cell
cut to Zelda game play with like smooth
jazz playing a background</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
