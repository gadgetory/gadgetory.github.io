a lot of you are still having is is it
worth grabbing over a regular ps4 slim
especially if you don't own a 4k TV and
the answer to that is maybe normally
this question would be a little bit more
open and shut but the thing keeping the
ps4 Pro so competitive is it's
ridiculously affordable price point of
$400 only a hundred bucks more than a
brand-new slim the ps4 Pro is obviously
bigger than the slim in every direction
which means that it will be taking up
much more of your shelf space especially
with how deep it runs on top of that
while the aesthetics are similar here
and of course personal taste will vary I
gotta say that I think the slim just
looks way way better than the pro the
triple stacking was just not a great
call however there are some functional
upgrades that the pro does offer while
both systems have a pair of USB ports on
the front the pro offers an additional
USB port on the back along with having
an optical port one minor thing I do
like about the slim / the pro though is
the placement of its power and eject
buttons they're easy to reach but make
it really difficult to accidentally
press whereas the pros are front facing
on a little flap and while still better
than a touch button are still the kind
of thing that could get hit by accident
pretty easily
now of course physical form is only so
important what most of you are really
wondering is how much more powerful the
pro is in practice while spec wise the
ps4 Pro is clearly more powerful in the
name of compatibility Sony has made it
so that unless a game receives a
specific pro support patch the ps4 pro
intentionally will limit itself to run
those games at the same level as a
regular ps4 would so for games that
don't offer support Pro patches for
instance blood-borne and witcher 3 the
pro is offering you nothing over the
slim but there are a lot of games
especially recent Sony exclusives and
triple-a titles that are offering pro
support and what exactly this means
ranges wildly from game to game
for instance uncharted 4 runs at a
native resolution of 1440 P and then
gets up scaled to 4k while the last of
us running in 30 FPS mode is actual
native 4k
there's also upcoming games like horizon
zero dawn and Mass Effect Andromeda that
will use what's known as checkerboarding
which while not as good as native 4k
does come much much closer than
traditional
scaling so yes certain games will look
better on a pro if you own a 4k TV but
what about if your TV is only 1080p well
once again this varies by game but the
coverage for the most part so far is
pretty minor some games offer graphical
improvements like better anti-aliasing
or higher and more stable frame rates a
common benefit for Sony exclusives
including VR games is using super
sampling in which the pro will run a
game at a higher native resolution and
then downscale it to 1080p displays
which is an improvement but the gain is
more minut it's also worth noting that
while most games look prettier some
unpatched games even some pro supported
games are actually getting worse
performance on the pro compared to the
slim for instance world of Final Fantasy
has noticeably lower visual quality with
blurry backgrounds and some pro
supported games have less consistent
frame rates one other question I've seen
pop up is whether or not the pros sata3
interface for hard drives allows for
faster loading times and the answer is
yes but not really enough to matter
after trying a number of different
titles the ps4 Pro either loaded up at
the same speed as the ps4 slim or beat
it by a matter of a few seconds I
haven't tested this with a switched in
SSD but other reports seem to confirm
the same thing better but by such a
small margin it really doesn't matter
now aside from gaming the only other big
performance feature the pro has to offer
is of course 4k media which in its case
only applies to streaming services you
can stream 4k videos on Netflix or
YouTube which the slim can't but if you
were looking for UHD blu-ray support
both systems are going to fail you on
that front so if you don't own a 4k TV
there really aren't that many benefits
to grabbing a pro over the slim if
you're a first-time buyer
I'd still say the Pro is worth paying
$100 extra for for the bigger hard drive
and visual improvements for a small
handful of games but if you already own
a slim or a launch ps4 there really is
no reason to upgrade your system unless
you own a 4k TV or you just enjoy
burning money</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
