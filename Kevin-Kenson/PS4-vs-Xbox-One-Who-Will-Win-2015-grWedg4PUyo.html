and we have a pretty clear idea of what
to expect this upcoming holiday season
from both Xbox one and ps4 so I want to
take a moment to talk about what kind of
games we can look forward to what kind
of major changes are going to be made by
that time and which system I think is
going to end up selling more by the end
of this year to begin with let's have a
little status update on how both systems
have been performing so far the ps4 is
still sitting at a huge advantage with
twenty three point eight million units
sold worldwide while the Xbox one is
sitting at thirteen point 1 million like
I said before my other comparison video
part of this is due to the fact the ps4
is available in more regions and has
been available in a lot of places for
longer but even then just looking at
strict sales wise the PS works just been
out selling a ton compared to the Xbox
one for instance let's look at how
they've been selling year-to-date since
the start of January 1st 2015
ps4 has sold 4.8 million units while
Xbox one is sitting at 2.1 that means
that for every one Xbox one that's been
sold more than two PS fours have now is
this a trend that I think it's gonna
continue on and we're gonna see the ps4
win another year against the Xbox one no
actually actually this year the Xbox one
is gonna sell more units during the
holiday season more than enough to end
up making up for the year-to-date sales
and passing up but not quite enough to
fill in that all-time sales gap because
10 million units is a lot but it's
definitely gonna do some damage and make
it a little more narrow and there's a
few reasons why starting with exclusives
now if you ever seen any my other
comparisons before for ps4 versus Xbox
one one thing I always go back to is
that exclusive games should be one of
the biggest things that determine which
system you get because you want to get
the games that really jump out at you
and when it comes to this year Xbox one
has a whole lot to offer to a lot more
people than ps4 does just talking about
games that are completely exclusive to
one system or the other Xbox one has
basically three huge titles they're
gonna help push sales this year we've
got Halo 5 which is by far the biggest
one and is gonna do most of the heavy
lifting but to round it out we've also
got Forza 6 and rise of the Tomb Raider
which is a timed exclusive and will be
made available on other systems later
but for now during the holiday when it
counts it's only gonna be on Xbox we've
also got the rare replay collection as
well as the Gears of War Ultimate
Edition which by themselves probably
won't drive too many system sales but
will definitely be a nice
extra push now as for ps4 there's a few
people arguing that there's nothing
coming out this holiday season for them
that's exclusive which isn't entirely
true it's just that what's coming out is
either only exclusive to Sony in the
sense that it's not gonna be on Xbox one
or it's a very niche game for instance
we have tales of zestiria which is
coming out with PC and ps3 as well
Disgaea 5 Dragon Quest Heroes and
persona 5 which is gonna be on ps3 as
well all of which are great titles if
you're a fan of JRPGs but as far as
having a wide mass appeal that's gonna
sell consoles left and right not the
strongest choices to go with at least by
themselves they're also gonna be having
the Uncharted Nathan Drake collection
which will allow you to play the
original three games in HD but once
again that's not really the kind of game
that's going to drive sales for the
system by itself it's cool to have if
you already own a ps4 and you want to
have prettier versions of those games
but you're not gonna buy a ps4 just to
play Uncharted in HD so just looking at
exclusives alone the Xbox one just has a
lot more going for it as far as wide
audience appeal whereas the ps4 is
focusing a lot more on just smaller
niche audiences now on top of that
there's a whole lot more that Xbox one
has at its advantage this particular
year first off they now have a price
drop so that the system is only $350
rather than 400 now given this is the
price that was selling for last year but
that was a limited edition price whereas
this is a permanent price drop and
they're also offering a terabyte model
for the original 400 price tag they're
also updating their UI which is a huge
bonus because one of my most consistent
complaints about the Xbox one was the
current UI design so seeing that whole
thing overhauled is a big benefit to
people that were kind of on the edge
before now that being said the ps4 does
still have quite a bit going on for
itself this holiday season like I said
there's a lot of GRP news coming out so
if you're a fan of that genre there's
quite a bit to look forward to on top of
that if the trend continues most
multi-platform games do tend to look
better and perform better on ps4 vs.
Xbox one so people that aren't really
fans of the Xbox one exclusive Xand they
just want to have games look their best
that are available on both well there's
an extra nudge for ps4 in that direction
and while ps4 doesn't have any huge
titles coming out this year this past e3
they did focus a lot on titles we can
look forward to in 2016 so there might
be those people that grab a system on or
early
planning on picking up games that are
coming out in the hopefully not too far
future such as no man's sky and horizon
zero dawn so these are things that will
help but really it just comes down to
the fact that right now based on what we
know this holiday season the Xbox one is
gonna be available for fifty bucks
cheaper with more big-name triple-a
titles available to choose from for
people that are currently sitting
without a next-gen console ps4 does have
stuff to offer but it's just a lot more
niche right now which is a problem when
it comes to raw sales so those are just
my thoughts on how the Xbox one and ps4
are going to sell this holiday season
there is of course time for some of this
to change there's always the chance of
surprise price drops bundles that are
really worth it or maybe even seeing one
of those major games I talked about
getting pushed back to next year but at
this point it seems like they're pretty
locked in so as long as they are pretty
safe to say that I think the Xbox one is
gonna win at least holiday sales if not
year to date and I'm gonna do at least a
good bit of damage to close up that
current gap as always if you guys
