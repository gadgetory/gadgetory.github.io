leagues rumors all that good stuff we
finally have an official reveal trailer
for the Nintendo NX and holy shit
so one of the immediate thoughts I had
while watching this trailer is that
everything we heard in the leaks was
basically exactly true I mean it's a
portable system with a screen on it it's
got detachable controllers that you can
put together to have a separate one it
has a docking setup when you want to
play at home and it even uses carts for
its games now something that we didn't
know going into this trailer is what the
system is actually called which is the
Nintendo switch which I really like that
name it's short it's simple its
memorable and it really aptly describes
the concept behind this system and it's
definitely way better than whatever idea
they had before for Wii U and I gotta
say seeing what was in this trailer I
really liked the idea behind the system
this is something I can see myself using
a lot especially if it's all it's easy
to use as the trailer tries to make it
out to be you know something as simple
as you just put it in your docking setup
and you can play right there on your TV
and if you want to stop and continue
playing just pick it up out of the dock
and keep going assuming that's all
really simple this is a great idea that
being said there are some things I don't
like about what I saw in this trailer
first off the system itself is kind of
simple not terrible looking but not
really great that's not a big deal
the bigger problem I have is the
controller I really don't like the way
the new stock controller looks like it's
like a pair of wiimotes you have in each
hand that aren't even shaped properly to
be comfortable or you can combine them
together to have this weird little brick
thing that's just as awful if not worse
the upside though is that I think
Nintendo kind of saw this coming and
they were smart because in the same
trailer we also saw some kind of pro
controller that you can also use with
the system which I like a lot better but
it's probably not going to be shipping
with a system probably something you
have to buy separately for 50 or 60
bucks now another thing that Nintendo
did in this trailer that was really
smart was how it approached games now
obviously it opens up with gameplay of
zelda breath of the wild the one thing
we knew for sure but then it went on to
show us more games including what looks
like a brand new Mario game
and some ports of some of the more
popular Wii U games like splatoon and
Mario Kart and what's really interesting
is it also showed some third-party ports
like Skyrim now what's a little weird
about this is that Nintendo has tried in
the past to push poured third-party
games as launch titles as being a big
deal because they're trying to get
everyone excited that hey look all these
other companies are supporting us again
and as we saw the Wii U didn't exactly
end well but what makes a stronger case
for this time with the NX is that the NX
offers something new
portability sure you played Skyrim
before years ago several times you're
probably planning on playing it another
week when Skyrim remastered comes out
but now you have an easy way to play it
in the backseat of a car or while
sitting in a waiting room and that's
really the big point this trailer was
trying to get across how portable the
Nintendo switch is and more importantly
how adaptable it is to so many different
situations honestly I thought this was
an excellent reveal for the system I
think it did a great job of getting
people hyped up for this new idea of how
they're going to handle this next system
but it leaves us with a lot of questions
you know it ends saying the system is
coming out March 2017 so we still don't
have an exact date we don't know how
much it's gonna cost and seeing an
action brings up a few more questions
like what kind of battery life can we
expect for the system when it's in
portable mode with only four months to
go there's a lot that Nintendo still
needs to tell us about this system so
hopefully we'll be seeing some more
official news and trailers soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
