you guys today about a month ago Sony
released well not so nice pacifically
but as a crossover we got these sony
nike shoes and i don't lock my
playstation I know nothing about shoes
so I needed to bring in some expert help
doctor I'm well and I know a little bit
about shoes I been in a little bit about
video games so hopefully I can help out
here fill in the blanks filled in the
blanks here so these are the PG to open
first which open them before we actually
like I don't know it sure let's do that
let's go I already peeked a little bit
so you can even do the unveiling them
yeah so these this is the Nike PG 2 and
PlayStation and these shoes are actually
a really big deal when they release cuz
it came out
oh well over a month ago and we're kind
of looking into it and having gone
immediately and back up a resale at much
much higher than what they read up
what's that so the shoes retail for 110
dollars yeah that's the Paul George
issue so the shoes are for Paul George
fYI Oh Paul George is the basketball
players in the NBA it's such an probably
say that to Paul George just happened to
be very big PlayStation fan PlayStation
was the first console that he ever
received as a kid and so obviously
that's kind of what's to stick with that
you know the kid when that first thing
you get is kind of what you write yeah
like I'll do all a bunch of different
systems when I grew up on Super Nintendo
so at the end of the day right that's
the one that had probably means the most
to you right now Nike knowing that they
they decided to create the PG to
PlayStation now these are super limited
that's why they got so much on the
resale market but they were really it
was a really exciting thing you know a
lot of times you don't see that sort of
crossover in the sneaker world it does
happen they do collaborations with like
companies and like sneaker stores yeah
but not like brands and because video
games the sneakers are really closely
aligned at least in my mind they yeah so
it makes a lot of sense and people were
really excited about it
yeah let's go I mean there's lots of
little details right away that I'm just
seeing here that are kind of cool little
call-outs like I mean there's obvious
things mean you have like the
PlayStation logo right there there's you
look here they're down there yeah like
on a patent leather here on the on the
midsole so I should say the mid panel
they have the xbo
the triangle right square and like a
more subtle not the same thing actually
is the loops right here those are
actually the four colors yeah of the the
buttons
if were you perform it's guys out there
that love to play ball this is what Nike
calls their dynamic strap which helps
for lockdown so when you're driving to
the hole after that amazing crossover
we've got a little additional help here
with this dynamic lock but will it help
an NBA 2k
things that are kind of usable on it I
thought this is a really neat tool an
official yeah it's on this one there's
actually a code on the back of this one
that's for a ps4 theme yeah it's one
time you felt like it I really like just
the idea of taking a promotion like that
but still kind of tying it into the
visual yeah neither is like a game and
like I believe the the theme kind of
looks a little bit like the shoe I think
it a duns the like the coloring only the
color scheme but though I don't know you
could almost put like the splatter paint
yeah the splatter fan 3 to get it oh
sorry time to get guys as you're saying
it's not really super common to have
like game crossing promotions but there
have been some before right brother yeah
which I can actually see we got some re
ones back there yes yeah so Vance does a
really great job like vans isn't the
most popular sneaker brand in the world
like it's not like the lifestyle choice
of like a lot of the quote-unquote
antiquer heads but they do an amazing
job when it comes to their collaboration
yeah it comes to video games like
actually one little thing I always
thought was cool about these was the aha
Oh was an exclamation point so even more
important I know we were saying that
like there's not many system ones but
there was another one recently which is
right over there too yes they do that
for the 1x launch right I think I
remember you didn't unboxing with that
and I'm finished up right I did a boxing
for this so this is the Under Armour
curry this is the Xbox one X version of
the shoe now this isn't an official I
don't know it's kind of an official clap
oh it exists but there's no like you
couldn't buy them so is this something
you think you're gonna start seeing more
of maybe more crossover stuff like this
or does it took me pretty rare for
gaming at least I don't know if you just
saw my eyes light up but I would I would
love that
so what's what's your dream
collaboration what do you want to see
happen oh my god if there is like more
stuff like this coming that's a really
great question I think to appeal to the
height beast out there I think I would
love to see something like with like
supreme in Air Jordan 1
or maybe like an ultra boost or a Yeezy
or something like that and maybe like
whatever a big game that's coming out so
maybe like CEO Pheebs that's coming or
grand theft auto or something huge like
that we're so really well done execution
that kind of touches on all those and
like tied into a launch to so the hype
is actually it's like maximum when it
happens well thanks again for coming up
to help you talk about this because I
couldn't tell you anything about that I
could have been just in their shoes with
Playstation stuff yeah yeah yeah oh
that's super helpful man thank you so
much I'm about thank you for having me I
appreciate it like we're gonna have to
do more of it this is fun I like to do
gaming I'm like sneakers we got to make
this happen
well yeah make it popular I'll make more
okay that's the dream well if you guys
