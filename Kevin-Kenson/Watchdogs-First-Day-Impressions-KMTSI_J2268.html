video was originally planned to go up on
launch day for watch dogs that didn't
happen I've had kind of a weird couple
of days and just a lot of external
circumstances have messed with things
but I'm pretty stubborn and I said in
the unboxing that we're gonna bring you
guys a first day impressions video and
well damn it I'm doing it so a couple
days late but here it is my day 1
impressions of watch dogs which is
available on ps3 ps4 xbox 360 xbox one
pc and we you all the gameplay are going
to be seeing as well as my personal
experience is based on the pc version
now those of you who saw my unboxing the
limited edition that i posted on TL d
yesterday or my graphics comparison that
I did on ticket tomorrow
earlier today will know that I basically
compared to watch dogs being a lot like
Grand Theft Auto and that really is a
fair comparison in terms of how the base
gameplay works out it takes place in an
open world city that you can explore
steal cars in and drive around finding
numerous side missions and collectible
things what draws it apart though is
it's heavy emphasis on the whole hacker
concept you spend a lot of free roam
time just looking at random passerby x'
hacking their phones trying to find new
side missions or crimes to stop maybe
make a little extra money or get
unlockable things like songs there's
also the big difference of course and
that GTA has remained character take on
the role of being a criminal or a thug
while watchdogs places a heavy emphasis
on being a vigilante most side-quests
involves stopping crimes like muggings
or assault and there is a reputation
system involved with how the city sees
you based on how much crime you stop
commit yourself or whether or not you
use lethal means to solve problems
gunplay even incorporates this as you
are allowed to non-lethal II handle
enemies by shooting them in just the
right spot for instance targeting
kneecaps rather than the head or the
heart which the game considers a
relatively good act sure they're
crippled of life but at least they're
alive now one thing I really do like
about watchdogs so far is that there are
a whole bunch of different progression
systems going on all at once completing
missions and taking down enemies will
earn you experienced which then gives
you skill points that can be spent on
improving your shooting hacking driving
and crafting skills and there's an
entirely separate progression system
based on just completing side objectives
unlocking new weapons or giving you
passive bonuses as far as the core
gameplay feels the gunplay is pretty
much what you'd expect in a third-person
free roam shooter stealth mechanics are
solid giving you numerous ways to
distract or remotely beat guards using
cameras and electronics
the one big obvious low point of this
game is its driving car physics are just
silly vehicles are somewhat awkward to
control whatever you yourself are
driving will normally be pretty much
invincible compared to other cars freely
ramming through them street signs and
even barely slowing down when getting in
a head-on collision then there's the
multiplayer which admittedly I don't
have a ton of experience with just yet
mainly due the fact that you play has
been going up and down up and down which
basically makes multiplayer unplayable I
was able to get a couple matches in on
the first day and basically my
impression so far is that it's something
very similar to Dark Souls where the
game is still a single-player game for
the most part but there's multiplayer
components that are integrated into it
where you can basically invade other
players worlds to hack them while they
try to identify you now the last thing I
want to touch on really quick our
virtual trips these are little mini
games that are built into watchdogs that
have their own set of rules and for me
personally have really been some of the
most fun parts so far especially one a
particular spider tank spider tank is a
game where you just run around the city
and a giant spider mecha blowing stuff
up for the highest score possible which
honestly I just found to be way more fun
than the base game so far because let's
be honest the main attraction in a lot
of free roam games is just being able to
cause a bunch of havoc and having an
automatically built-in way of doing this
that doesn't affect your wanted rating
and doing it with a giant mech on top of
that is just a great way to win me over
now this is all based on just about 5 or
6 hours of gameplay that I've
experienced so far and there's a lot
more ground that I need to cover I need
to do more of the main missions complete
more side quests and do a lot more
multiplayer matches before I can really
weigh in and give you as my final
thought on the game but I can't tell you
that so far I really am enjoying it but
I wouldn't say that I'm loving it just
yet as I said earlier driving is an
absolute pain and the gun mechanics
could also use a little bit of work but
on the upside I really like the way the
game is handled stealth in a free roam
game and there are so many different
things to do for character progression
that it looks like it'll keep you really
busy especially if you want to go full
completionist on it all-in-all so far
it's fun but just not exactly amazing
just yet we'll just see how it maintains
in the later stages or if it picks up
noticeably with time what was yours my
day 1 impressions of watchdogs if you

first seeing my unboxing of the limited
