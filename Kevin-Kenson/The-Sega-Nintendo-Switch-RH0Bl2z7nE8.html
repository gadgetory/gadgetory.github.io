revealed one of the real eye grabbing
things about it was this idea of a
system that isn't just a handheld isn't
just a home console but something that
was both allowing you to easily switch
between and adapt to your lifestyle
which was a great original idea that
Sega had over twenty years ago
this is the Sega Nomad ii handheld
system released by sega that unlike the
game gear their first handheld which was
its own system of his own library of
games was actually more like a final
revision of the sega genesis giving you
the ability to play Sega Genesis games
on the go now the second Nomad is a
weird bit of gaming history with a lot
of little oddities connected to it it
first came out back in 1995 and was
based on another second product called
the mega jet now what that was is it was
a portable design just so I get Mega
Drive which is the Japanese version of
the Sega Genesis site that would hook
into portable TV screens the idea was
that it would be used in planes that's
the name mega jet and give you a ways to
play games while they're on a flight
well they took the same technology used
for that instead incorporated a screen
to release this little guy right here
exclusively in the US another thing
that's odd about the system is the fact
that if you know your history of gaming
and when systems come out 1995 is very
late in the cycle for this generation of
systems the Genesis had already been for
quite some time and their newer system
the Sega Saturn was already released in
the US and Japan so here comes along
this handheld version of an older system
that's not gonna really support any
brand new interesting games now the way
Sega kind of leans into this is to say
well hey you have this gigantic library
of over 500 Genesis games already
available you can play on the handheld
which it's kind of cool but it's kind of
already being replaced by all the new
stuff that's coming out instead and this
is just one of the many factors that
played into why the Nomad didn't exactly
see the same kind of success we see
today with the switch the idea was super
cool but well ahead of its time and just
had a lot of factors playing against it
first like I said it didn't have any of
its own original new games its
technology was lagging it behind because
it was a handheld adaptation of an older
system and as it had no that should
honestly wasn't super great it's big its
bulky it's not super comfortable and the
battery life on it was not good at all
in fact if you want to play for long
periods of time you basically had to
plug it into a wall outlet and it just
became a stationary system not really
portable you could get battery packs for
it that were chargeable and you could
just get the battery holders which held
a bunch of double-a batteries but then
you're basically
getting about 2 hours of gameplay and
killing 6 doublea's and all these
problems together were really another
compared to the biggest issue which was
the fact that right after it was
released
Sega pretty much immediately stopped
caring about the Nomad they really stood
with this awkward time where they were
already trying to juggle so many
different systems at once they just
released the Sega Saturn they were still
trying to do some support for the Sega
Genesis and all the different add-ons
like the Sega CD and 32x and there was
just so much going on that with this
guy's underperforming sales and the fact
the Sega Saturn was doing really well in
Japan
Sega basically abandoned it right away
to instead focus on just the Saturn
alright so we got our batteries loaded
up let's check this thing yeah we're
gonna start with a classic altered beast
oh man I forgot how with these older
systems when you mess with the
brightness bar it actually like is a
huge impact is you know the point where
you just can't see anything if they
haven't you just right to even see
what's going on scream there we go
so something we actually discovered - we
were tracking one of these guys down
with this video is that lately they've
actually been getting a lot more popular
again primarily because people are
finding ways to mod these and upgrade
them so you know this version that we
have right here is just unmod and
original but people are doing things
like improving the screens adding
support for stuff that it really isn't
supposed to normally have like when
these guys came out there was actually
one of the other problems is that a lot
of the major peripherals designed for
the Genesis don't work on this guy at
least out of box so you can't use like
the 32x obviously Sega CD the power base
which lets you use a Sega Master System
games on it none of that works on this
it's just traditional Genesis games I
just turned it into an ster I won't
prove one other ridiculous point of
something that you can do with the Nomad
because well it doesn't support all
those other peripherals there are a
couple it still supports which lets you
do silly things like this because of
what this guy can support you can do
something like taking a game genie copy
of Sonic and Knuckles
slot that there
to attach and then of course Sonic 3
which been turned into Sonic &amp;amp; Knuckles
and then you could just play casually
you know a game like this because
there's nothing at all weird-looking
about this setup uh yeah I mean clearly
it works as just a straight-up handheld
so now let's check it out actually
hooking it up to a TV all right so we're
all set up I've already played enough
ultra beats though so I think it's time
to switch for one of the greatest
classics that is exclusive to the Sega
Genesis Ecco the Dolphin 27 Nevers of
danger mystery and beauty or through the
eyes of a dolphin some people are young
which by the way something I didn't
realize about this when we were
personally getting to it and getting it
I knew it connected to the TV I did not
realize that it doesn't stop the signal
on the Nomad itself you still have this
screen going the whole time would you
have to use this as your player one
controller so don't get distracted by
that this actually looks really nice by
the way too there's kind of a weird
cropping happening on the CRT but I'm
getting like a really good looking
signal the game like looks really good
which I haven't done like in death
conversions myself would actually have
read arguments before that the Nomad
doing the a/v out is actually a cleaner
better signal than doing like just a
traditional Genesis like this is
actually the best way to play some of
these games I think about this guy
that's a little weird is that you have
to use the Nomad itself as your player
one controller even though it has the
controller out that's just for two
players stuff so as far as comfortable
controllers go this isn't really one
it's very bulky it doesn't really have a
comfortable grip design mean there's a
little bit on this one right here but
doesn't do a whole lot it's a definitely
a brick by the way you're wondering
about our blackout design switch right
here that's actually thanks to today's
sponsor D brand they've released a whole
bunch different skins for the Nintendo
switch and one of the big colors that
you just can't do with official joy cons
just yet is black and you can get a
couple different black designs from D
brand that look awesome whether it's
carbon fiber or cane
you want check about make sure to look
at the link down below description so
what exactly did the switch do right in
comparison to the Nomad well first off
there's the game library now yeah it is
kind of cool to advertise hey you
already own all these Sega Genesis games
they'll work on your new handheld system
but there's nothing really exciting
about that there's nothing new there's
nothing that's it's gonna open up for
you that you didn't have before with the
Genesis whereas the switch is its own
brand new system with brand new games
well porting some of the biggest hits
from the Wii U and really one of the
huge things is a concept of wireless
technology because imagine using the
Nomad where you haven't hooked up with
the TV where you're running AV into the
television system it isn't a doc setup
that you could just put on whenever you
want you have a separate cable running
into power unless you're relying on the
batteries but you're gonna die pretty
quick and if you want to do two player
wave one person playing on the Nomad
with these two cables running out of it
with a third cable running out of the
bottom so someone else can use a
controller it's not exactly super and
easy fun compared to the switch where
you just drop the main tablet into a
dock and then detach the controllers and
bam you have just little portable
wireless controllers the idea of being
able to play a system portably or on a
TV screen and switching between them is
really cool weather was back in 1995 or
today it's just that all the tech stuff
that surrounds that concept of makes it
possible is just so much better now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
