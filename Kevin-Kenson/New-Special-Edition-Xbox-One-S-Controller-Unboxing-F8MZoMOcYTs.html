I got a really cool surprise in the mail
today
so I originally actually have any
different video plans to shoot today but
then these showed up for Microsoft now
they were actually cool enough to send
us these three Xbox one controllers but
what's really awesome about it is the
fact that none of these are actually
released yet so I thought given the
opportunity let me open them up and
showcase them for you guys so if you've
seen them and you're curious actually
get a little more in-depth look because
there's a lot more to show than what a
screenshot can normally do justice so to
begin with we're going to look at this
green grey one right here it's actually
called grey green the point is that this
is the simplest of the new controllers
coming out so going to start with this
one right away and I actually haven't
opened anything yet so these are all
kind of be my first time actually seeing
them in person let's give it a look whoo
that's actually really clean looking so
I've talked about one that's similar
like this before
that they did was a military green with
orange highlights which I actually have
right here and if you saw the video
where I talked about this one I wasn't
really a big fan I mean I like the
orange highlight to it but I've just
never really been a big fan of military
green design so this one is actually a
huge step up now if I'm not mistaken
this is actually the same gray that you
can get on the Xbox design lab that's
called ash gray but what really makes
this one different is obviously the
different stick design which really does
a lot more than you think I mean even if
you're looking at the controller
straight on the base is a little larger
than the stick heads you can still see
that green shining through a little bit
and gives a nice little contrast to the
design I mean definitely one of the
simpler controllers I mean definitely on
the simplest out of these three but it's
really good looking for that next up
we're going to take a look at the newest
in line for the tech series controllers
is actually the second one that's going
to be released and that's the patrol
tech now to be honest when this thing
was first revealed
I wasn't that big of a fan mainly
because something about the way that the
shot of it was lit it almost looked like
it was the same colors as the Recon tech
which is this one right here except it
just had different symbols in the middle
which thankfully that's not actually the
case once you have them side-by-side
we'll open it right now to look you'll
notice that's actually a bit more
different than that so let's take a look
oh yeah that's actually a lot more
different once you see it in person so
if you're looking at what our use
individually you might think this is the
same grade but when you have them
side-by-side you'll notice that this is
a
darker kind of deeper one with more
blueish tones resistance just an ever
tiny little bit green which you would
never notice until you add something
else to contrast it also the other big
change is that the etching on the front
here is silver instead of gold so
overall this controller has a much more
kind of cooler tone and vibe to it
really looking at it now and having it
on hand I actually like this one more
than the Recon tech I mean I think I've
talked before I'm not a huge fan of gold
accents it just always seems a little
too gaudy to me so the silver with the
dark blue I think is a really good look
I still don't get absolutely any vibe
whatsoever the military thing I don't
understand the theme of this controller
line sorry to interrupt myself but I
actually I figured out what most of
these symbols mean there's a couple that
I'm still not entirely sure of but I
know all the ones on the patrol
controller at least I'm pretty sure I do
now these are all pulled from what's
called NATO military map symbols now the
one on top represents Allied air
infantry the box around it means allied
X in the middle infantry and the little
kind of em at the bottom that looks like
a bird in the distance air now this one
at the bottom is a more generic symbol
that means enemy air units it doesn't
let you know that like what kind of
specific ones they are if it was an
allied one it would be a smoother kind
of parabolic line pointed up instead of
being these hard edges now the X in the
middle X's could mean things in other
contexts that I'm not aware of but as
far as I know a single X by itself
represents a brigade as for the Recon
tech controller the simple is attack
follow some of the same rules as this
one the fact that there's a diamond on
the outside instead of a box means that
it's an enemy unit and the symbol inside
represents reconnaissance and it might
specifically be artillery reconnaissance
because it has a little dot in the
middle as well as for the other two
bottom symbols
I saw idea now like the Recon tech this
is a little higher quality controller in
general it's not just things like the
fact that it has the silver etching on
the front but also on the back it does
have a different grip most of the
controller's just have this slightly
rougher plastic so it gives you more
grip but not much else
this actually has kind of a rubber
insert with little diamond shapes so
it's going to give you a more
comfortable grip that has just the
littlest bit of pliability to it and
next we have the volcano shadow now this
is actually the one that when they first
revealed these three new controllers
this one really stood out to me as one
that I really wanted to grab so
Supercenter when these came in now I've
talked before about what my favorite
ones is the ocean shadow I
really like the kind of area doesn't
finish that these ones have I like the
fade effect it just is a really good
looking controller but I'm also a rly
big fan of the color red maybe a little
orange kind of a fire theme to it which
that's the name volcano I got really
said I want somethin revealed so let's
open it up and check it out oh yeah
that's that's pretty good
show you guys so like I said just like
with the ocean shadow you're getting
that kind of iridescent just slightly
shiny finish to it it's going to fade to
black but what I think really stands out
to me about the controller compared to
the ocean shadow they've another one
called Dom at the purple is that the
ocean shadow on the Dawn shadow have
kind of darker colors so there's not
quite as much contrast whereas this one
you have this very warm orange red that
gives a lot more contrast to the black
on top and for the but that just all
kind of stands out a little more and
it's just really really pretty I mean
I'd have to say that right now this is
easily my favorite Xbox one controller
