all those last second gifts you need!
We've already talked Playstations,
now, let's talk Xbox gifts,
accessories, controllers,
tied in merchandise, all
the things you need to get
for your Xbox friends and family.
(chill holiday music)
Something that I think Xbox
has done really really well
are their special editions,
especially when it comes to controllers.
There are so many different
controllers out there,
coming in different
colors, patterns, themes,
and even ones tied to specific games,
like what they've done for
Sea of Thieves or PUBG.
They have so many different,
cool controller designs out there.
If you're never quite
sure what to grab someone,
a new, cooler looking controller
is always a great way to go.
If neither of these cut it for you,
you can also look for a number
of other different designs
out there, like what
they've done for Minecraft.
I really like their Shadow
series of controllers,
which feature this nice
little fade design.
And I think one of the coolest
ones they've done recently
is their Sport White,
which is kinda like their
military theme, but redone,
and just looks so clean.
No matter what the person
you're trying to get a gift for
is into, there's bound to be a controller
that matches their style.
Now, if there isn't a controller
that you think is just quite right,
well, there's still one other
option out there for ya,
and that's Design Lab.
Xbox actually gives you the ability
to design your own, custom controllers
to match exactly what someone's into.
You can even create your own themes.
For instance, this one right here,
is inspired by Cuphead, which is still,
probably my favorite Xbox exclusive.
It's just, so much fun.
The point is, if there's not
something already out there
for you, make your own.
There's a lot of different choices!
You can do different colors
for the buttons, the sticks,
you can do shadow designs,
like I mentioned earlier.
There's just so many different
colors to choose from.
You can customize it just
the way someone likes it.
You can even get a
special engraving on it!
Now, if you watched our
PlayStation gift guide,
you might have seen this next gift,
but it works across both systems,
and I think is one of the
coolest innovative things
to come out this year,
and that's the new Nari
Ultimate Headset from Razer.
Now this is, to begin with,
just a good, high
quality, wireless headset
that's gonna give you positional sound,
really clear audio, it's nice and durable.
But the big thing about this headset
is that it actually has haptic
engines in the ear cups.
So depending on the sounds
that are coming through it,
it's actually gonna lightly rumble,
which adds a whole new level
of immersion to gaming.
Now while this is a wireless
headset for PC and for PS4,
sadly, on the Xbox, you
cannot use the USB dongle,
you do have to hardwire it in,
but it's not that big of a deal,
you just plug it into your controller.
You're gonna get that
awesome sound quality
and the haptics are still going to work,
'cause it's all just tied to
the sound coming through them.
There's a lot of awesome
headsets out there
offering a variety of
different audio qualities,
but for something a little different
that's really gonna change things up,
this is honestly, a super
cool gift to look out for.
When it comes to
collectibles for video games,
a really big one is figures.
And one of the biggest companies by far
is Funko with their Pops.
Now, I gotta be honest with you guys,
I'm not actually a huge fan of Pops,
they kinda creep me out.
The eyes, just something about
them, starting into my soul,
and I just, I'm not okay, but!
They make a lot of other figure lines,
and one of my favorites, is
what they've done for Cuphead.
They have a series of
Funko figures for Cuphead
that are based on just
the designs from the game.
It's not any kind of warped
or deformed different ones.
They look like they are in
the game and look awesome.
As you can see,
there are a couple
different designs to grab.
You can get Cuphead, Mugman, The Devil,
and I'm hoping that once
the expansion DLC comes out,
eventually, some day, that
we'll also get Ms. Chalice
as an option, because I need a full set.
For something a little
more outside the box,
Xbox, ah, ah?
Anyways, for something a little different,
something that I really like, are mugs.
There's a lot of different
mug designs out there
with different special designs,
and for an Xbox focused one,
I really like this one,
from FanFit Gaming.
They actually have a line
of different mug designs
based on each of the major companies,
but I really like the way the
Xbox One all comes together.
It's design is primarily
covered with stuff
from Gears of War and Halo
along with just a mixture of
all kinds of different things
from Xbox, like the systems
themselves, controllers,
buttons, accessories, it's just everything
that makes Xbox fun and great.
If you're a big Xbox fan
or you know someone who is,
this is an awesome little item to pickup
to put whatever you're drinking
while you're playing game.
Without a doubt, one of the biggest games
to come out this year is
Red Dead Redemption 2.
And personally, I like
playing it on the Xbox,
just 'cause I think it
runs best on the One X,
and it's just an awesome, beautiful game.
And a cool tie-in with
that is a strat guide!
Now, I know what some of
you are probably thinking,
strategy guides, in 2018,
there's the internet.
And yeah, that's true, if
you just wanna look stuff up
on how to beat the game, sure, do that.
But, the cool thing
with something like this
is that it just honestly makes
a really cool collectible.
A lot more effort has
gone into these things
as far as just upping the
quality of the hardcover design,
the art that goes onto them,
even just the interior design of it.
The way everything's laid
out, the cover art choice,
and even just the
Rockstar logon on the back
makes this an awesome collectible
for any fan of the game.
I think this is just a cool thing,
even if you just wanna
have it on your shelf.
It's something to show off and reference
on the occasion that you might need to be
a little more completionist.
Just look at Arthur,
look at that, come on.
He wants you to buy it.
He's actually threatening you to buy it.
Speaking of really big
successful games this year,
another one that of course a lot of people
are constantly talking about is Fortnite!
And there is so much cool
Fortnite stuff out there to find.
And one interesting place to turn is Etsy!
You can always find
really cool, unique items
that people are coming up with.
And we have a couple examples here,
and really, this applies to any game,
outside of just Fortnite,
but that's specifically the
cool stuff we have right now.
For example, we have this light up sign,
which is just awesome, I think
it's a great little piece
to just show off in any
kind of gaming setup.
And, a little Boogie Bomb that lights up!
If you just wanna find cool, unique things
that you're not gonna
find at a regular store
and is gonna be something very different
and really catch someone
off guard and by surprise?
Etsy is an excellent option
to find this and more.
Now I have one other item
from Etsy I wanna focus on,
it's its own kinda side thing,
'cause there's lots of cool
stuff you can grab, obviously,
that's just kind of aesthetic
and shows stuff off,
but there's something that's
functional and really weird
and fits into another awesome
game from Xbox this year,
Forza Horizon, and that's
this little wheel attachment!
Now, I know this looks kinda silly,
and if you haven't seen the video
I actually did dedicated on this before,
you might be like, what, exactly is this?
What does it do?
This is, just a little attachment.
It latches over the top of
your Xbox One controller.
It attaches to the thumbstick,
and enables you to turn it
into a little tiny steering wheel
and it works so much better
than you would ever think!
For being just a little
3D printed accessory,
it's pretty amazing how
much this thing impacts
the experience of playing Forza Horizon.
If you know someone that's
a big racing game fan,
and you don't necessarily have the money
to throw down for something
like a gigantic racing wheel rig
or some kind of just,
whole apparatus with
a seat and everything,
this is a great way to
just add a little bit more
of that experience at a
much more affordable cost
and surprisingly super cool.
By the way guys,
the end of the year's
coming up really quick,
and we've had a really good one,
so to help celebrate with you guys,
we're giving away a new Nintendo Switch.
I'm doing this with Jonathan
Morrison at TLD Today.
Check out the link down
below in the description
on rules on how to enter and
get your chance to win it.
If you wanna go in the direction
of a fancier controller,
there's a few options out there for Xbox,
but honestly, I've always been a big fan
of the official Xbox Elite Controller.
This is based on the same design they use
for the regular Xbox One controllers,
but everything's been just turned up
and tuned up just a little bit.
The buttons, the sticks, the grip design,
as well as having additional buttons
which are these little programmable ones
on the back right here.
You can also change out
different kinds of sticks,
and a D-Pad that has a faceted design
which I personally really love.
I rarely use the normal one on these.
This is just such a great little addition.
And, while it's been around a little while
on a black design, earlier this year,
they released it in a white
that looks super clean.
While both are good, honestly,
I think this is the way to go visually,
just because especially
with the great grips.
It just all comes together
as this really visually
pleasing controller.
Not to mention that just
the tiny little bits
of green you get on it as well.
Now, if you know someone who already owns
an Elite Controller, whether
that's the original black one
or the newer white one,
something you can grab to accent that
is an exchange kit, which
adds new buttons and paddles
in different colors, like
this one in here, in gold.
It does different gold
designs for the D-Pads
and for the back paddles.
It's in the same kind of metal
that is on the official ones as well,
and just adds a little
different pop of color.
I think it looks really good on the while.
The black especially adds
a really cool contrast.
Now, like I said earlier,
something Xbox does really well
is controllers, whether
it's there Elite ones
or the regular designs, and
the various different colors
and special edition themes they have.
And if you have any of these,
you wanna be able to show
'em off a little bit.
It doesn't quite feel right
to just have a controller
just laying on the ground
or in a drawer or just
sitting on tabletops.
So, what you need is a controller stand!
This is a cheap little way
of making an awesome way
of showing off what controllers you own.
You can get them in white or black.
So you can pick the right one that accents
what color controllers you have.
It helps that these are
officially branded, by Microsoft,
so you do get the little
Xbox One logo here.
And for some of the really
special edition designs,
you can find a couple color
matching for those as well,
for instance, the Gears of
War red Xbox One controller.
Individually, they're fairly cheap,
so if you know someone
who has a large array
of different controller designs,
you really want them to show them off,
you can get a pack of 'em, so that way,
they can really build a proper display.
One of the biggest changes
the Xbox received this year
from Microsoft is the fact
that you can now use a
keyboard on your Xbox
for select games like
Fortnite and Warframe.
So, in celebration of that, of course,
you gotta take a look at
some gaming keyboard options.
And one of the coolest ones
is the Razer BlackWidow Elite.
Now Razer is actually the
official partner with Microsoft
for the entire support of
keyboards, and in fact,
they even currently have
a Xbox One dedicated one
in the works, but until that's released,
this is a great way to go.
The BlackWidow is the
mainline mechanical keyboard
from Razer, the Elite one
is the top line option
they have currently
available, which, honestly,
you don't need all these
features for Xbox One just yet,
but in fact, they actually
just released a cheaper option
called the BlackWidow Lite,
which doesn't have the Chroma lighting
and more quiet keys, which is
a great fit for the Xbox One,
to make sure that you don't
keep up the rest of your family.
Now down list, if you're
searched accessories
for the Xbox One before,
you're bound to see accessories
that attach to the system itself.
And some of these are
actually really cool,
and some not so much.
And right here, we have a
great example of both of these.
First, on this side, we have
a battery charger attachment
for the Xbox One, it goes into
the USB port in the front.
It adds two little slots
where you can charge replacement batteries
that will go inside the
Xbox One controllers.
This is a great, easy way to
keep track of any batteries
that are currently not
inside of controllers
and just a place that you can pop them in
whenever they need a little extra charge.
And it still frees up a USB port,
so you have access to one in the front
if you need to plug in a controller
or any other kind of accessory.
On the other hand, we have a cooling fan
that adds some additional USB ports,
which is kinda cool, but honestly, don't.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
