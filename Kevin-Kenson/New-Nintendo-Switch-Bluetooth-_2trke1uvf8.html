Bluetooth options
this which has a lot of great things
going for it but one of the things that
has been the most annoying since its
launch and it really hope gets revised
in some kind of future version of the
system is that it doesn't have any kind
of support for any form of wireless
headset not a proprietary connection or
you've to buy a specific headset or just
bluetooth to use with a variety of them
it's really really weird especially when
you consider the fact the system can be
used both portably and livingroom both
situations benefit a lot from the option
of a wireless headset the ability just
wear one and switch between modes seems
really cool so it's really upsetting you
can't do that
now just because it's something the
system can't do innately doesn't mean
there's not ways to make that work with
the system we've tried before using a
variety of different Bluetooth adapters
to see how the experience goes and a lot
of the ones that are just currently on
the market aren't really designed for
gaming in mind they oftentimes don't
have very good latency so as a result
while you can make wireless headset
setups kind of work oftentimes you're
gonna notice a little bit of delay in
gameplay which depending on your playing
can be a really huge deal until recently
at least because of the switches lack of
Bluetooth support there's been a few
companies looking at ways to fill that
gap and offer more wireless headset
options for the switch in fact a really
recent popular example is the Genki
adapter which had huge success on
Kickstarter offering a lower latency
form of Bluetooth audio to use with the
switch and as a result of that doing
really well a whole lot of other
companies out there are trying to beat
it to market right now like this guy
right here the gully kit root Plus this
is a USBC adapter the attaches to the
bottom your switch and it's supposed to
work right out of the box all you have
to do is plug it in and it should give
you the ability to connect any Bluetooth
headset you have and have a better
listening experience and on top of that
it also offers support for a specific
Bluetooth profile called apt xll which
only a handful of headsets will support
but if you're using one of those it
should give you the lowest latency
experience possible with those headsets
so we're gonna go ahead and try it out
with a normal gaming headset then try it
out with one of those other special
headsets that is designed to support
that and see how it all works out so
first we're gonna try it out using a
traditional gaming headset and in this
case I'm gonna be using the arctas pro
but before that we actually have to just
get out of the box and test it in the
first place so here we get the dru plus
we're gonna open it up
and while we're getting this set up
there's a couple other little things I
do want to talk about it really quick we
have the main adapter right here in the
box but it also comes with a USB ad USBC
adapter so you can use it with the dock
otherwise you just use the USB C to plug
it into the bottom and it does have a
pass-through connection as well so it
doesn't need power on its own it'll just
drop from the system itself but if you
want to be able to charge your system at
the same time as using this you can plug
it into the bottom since it's taking up
that port should work right out of the
box we'll see how my luck is there are
no instructions ok so it's this little
tab right here yep there it is what you
can hear coming out of it ok
got it hooked up it's all running so
let's go ahead and actually play using
it and see if there's any noticeable lag
so I'm having a thing with the messenger
which is a recent awesome retro style
platformer I really want to use this one
because you should what the games look
at this timing is really important with
sound because you actually need to know
when certain moves are coming out inside
it sounds really good
let's start messing with and actually
see if there's a noticeable lag yes
definitely
yeah it's really berry fight if I hadn't
been playing this game non-stop recently
I might not notice it as much but I'm so
used to how it should sound that using
this adapter everything's just a little
slower a little delayed it's not awful
but it's still enough that I think it
could definitely impact gameplay
performance next year I tried this
adapter with the wave sound 2.1 I can't
tell you anything about this headset
beyond the fact that it is the first one
we found in our search for one that
supports apt xol so we're gonna hook
this guy up and see if there's a
noticeable difference in Layton sees yep
cool nope it's still prepared to that
one over there oh wait no fear we got we
good we're good we're good alright let's
see if this is any better I can't hear
you
I've got a pair up out see if there is
any noticeable less latency
Oh Oh that just immediately feels better
actually yeah this actually so it's
definitely noticeable because right when
I started using us with the artist Pro
earlier while it was very close and I
think will work for most games there was
just always this slight delay I could
sense it just didn't feel quite right
here though I mean this is pretty hard
to distinguish between when I was just
playing the game without a headset this
works really great if you have the
specific kind of headset that'll support
the kind of profile it needs if you have
an apt x ll headset this is actually
pretty awesome I'm really curious to
compare it with the Genki when that
actually comes out but for the time
being this this works so well it's not a
perfect solution because you'd have to
buy a specific kind of hit set to work
with it and I'm a little bummed I can't
just use my one gaming headset across
all my systems it is really cool to see
that we are getting better and better
solutions to be able to use wireless
audio that's actually functional on the
switch and it just reminds us that you
know if Nintendo is working on any kind
of switch 2.0 revised switch new switch
whatever they want to call it if there
is a new one in the works there's a lot
of stuff they can do to improve on this
already good system to make it even
better I think including Bluetooth is
near the top of that list also better
battery life then a kickstand that
doesn't break right away</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
