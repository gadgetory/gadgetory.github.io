- What the (beep)?
- Yes that's right,
your eyes do not deceive you.
This is an official microphone
for the Nintendo Switch.
You can tell it's official,
it's got their little brand right here.
Now you might be wondering
why it looks a little bizarre.
That's actually cause this
is an attachable cover
that HORI makes for it
so that when you sing
you can cover your mouth like this,
so you can sing as loud as you want
or you just don't like
people seeing your mouth
while you're singing.
The point is, this exists.
Now you might be
wondering I don't remember
there being any karaoke
games on the Switch.
How did I miss this?
When did it come out?
Well it's cause this actually
isn't available in the US.
We had to import this.
You can get them in Japan
or in Europe as well.
And as far as we can tell the only game
that actually uses it in
Europe is Let's Sing 2018.
A karaoke game that is
not available in the US,
where you can sing some fun
duets with your friends.
♪ Oh oh oh oh oh ♪
♪ Caught in a bad romance ♪
Now to be honest we
picked this up originally
just cause we thought the cover looked
absolutely ridiculous and
it would make a great Instagram post.
♪ If I could just see you ♪
After picking it up and kinda
messing with it a little bit,
I really started thing more and more
about voice commands
have been used in gaming.
Now yes, microphones are used a lot
primarily so people can do things
like chat during multi-player games,
(banging and keyboard hitting floor)
but there's a lot of games out there
that actually had more
interesting experiments
of how to integrate
microphones into game play.
It's actually very fitting
the microphone we grabbed
is for Nintendo because
they're one of the companies
with the longest history of
really messing with the idea
of voice commands in games.
Going as far back as the not
original NES, the Famicom.
The original Famicom had a
microphone built directly
into the player two controller
which some games would make use of.
One of the most popular examples being
the original Legend of Zelda where there
were monsters that you could scare away
by screaming into this microphone.
(yelling in foreign language)
And the reason why this particular example
is pretty popular is
because the US version
of Legend of Zelda still
makes reference to this
in lines but there's no way for you
to actually do it because
the original Nintendo
did not have that microphone feature.
And this is not something that Nintendo
only experimented with during
their early years with gaming.
This is an idea they've
come back to multiple times.
In fact, they did a lot
of experimenting with it
during the mid 2000's
with the GameCube and DS.
For the GameCube we had a lot of games
that messed with the idea of using it
as the main form of interaction.
whether that's Hey You, Pikachu
or that was the main goal or offering it
as an alternate control
style in other games
like Mario Party 6 and 7.
- [Narrator] Pikachu
responds to your voice.
Call him gently out of the forest.
- On the DS the idea wasn't so much
as making it the only form of control
but instead offering weird little ways
to mess with the game by adding
just an extra option.
Whether that's blowing into the microphone
to interact with the
environment around you
or using voice commands to
call out specific items.
Something that was used a lot
in the earlier Phoenix Wright games.
Now Nintendo is not the only company
that has messed with these ideas.
One that I think has actually had
a really interesting
history and has tried to
do some more interesting,
weird things with it is Konami.
Going all the way back to the NES
they actually created a peripheral
which would use voice
commands and your head
to control the game exclusively
which is this beautiful
piece of tech right here.
The LaserScope.
The idea was you could play
something like say Duck Hunt
instead of having to hold
a controller in your hand
like a loser, you could
have this on your head
and just scream fire
while shooting at ducks
by aiming with this visor right here.
It did not go well.
- I retire this in glory.
- And this isn't the last time
they messed with the idea either.
Years later on the PS2
and I think in 2003,
they made a game called Lifeline.
What was interesting about this
is that voice commands were meant to be
the only way you controlled the game.
You did not use a regular
controller at all.
Instead the entire concept
is that in the game,
you're an operator giving
commands to a character
that you have to guide
through a space station.
Once again tech wasn't fully
developed quite enough yet,
and so there was a lot
of problems with this
and didn't control as cleanly
a people would've liked
but it's a really interesting idea
that I kinda think is starting to get
time to start experimenting with again.
Now to be clear, I'm not
saying that every single game
needs to have some kind
of voice interaction.
Let's not forget what
happened with the Connect.
But I think it's really
worth investigating the idea
of having games that are
built on the idea specifically
of using voice as a form of interaction.
And Nintendo right now with
how experimental their being
with the Switch and their
history of just trying new ideas,
I think it's kinda time to try again.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
