to start off by going over my reactions
to the big three press conferences
Microsoft Sony and Nintendo in the order
they aired starting with Microsoft now
this year's conference I thought was a
little bit weaker than last year's but
still really strong the biggest thing I
had was that I felt like the emphasis on
games was a little weaker but they
really came back when it came to
accessories and features to begin with
when it came to first party games they
had a very strong start by finally
showing some real gameplay for Halo 5 as
well as finishing the show by officially
confirming Gears of War 4 which I think
a lot of people saw coming and it's nice
to know that one's on the way and
hopefully it's better than judgment but
personally I thought the trailer didn't
do a very good job of building up hype
all it really did was say yes this is a
nuclear's of war game here's a potential
new main character and it does look
prettier compared to older games since
it is of course a newer gen system aside
from those two big ones we did hear
about a couple of their first party
games there is going to be a ultimate
edition of the original Gears of War
there's a trailer for a new game called
recore which is a sort of
post-apocalyptic looking game where you
have a robot companion you can change
what bodies that occupies there was also
look at the new Forza as well as some
talk from the rare division which talked
about releasing a collection of 30 of
rares most classic games such as banjo
kazooie Conker's Bad Fur Day Battletoads
all in one disc for 30 bucks which is
pretty cool as well as talk of a new
pirate game they're working on which
it's not entirely clear if it's an MMO
or just some kind of heavy co-op focused
game but it looks like it could be
interesting and it's gonna be available
on Xbox one as well as Windows 10 now
aside from those games there was some
time spent on third-party titles most of
which were multi-platform but some were
timed exclusives for Microsoft consoles
such as rise of the Tomb Raider plants
vs. zombies garden warfare 2 the
division but most importantly was
fallout 4 because while we already saw
gameplay for fallout 4 the night before
the big announcement for Microsoft was
the fact that the Xbox one version of
the game could play PC mods which is a
big deal normally when it comes to
certain PC games the biggest argument
for why you'd want it on PC over a
console is that you can mod it and yes
there's also the argument that the game
can be prettier on PC but as far as just
looking at an individual title if the
Xbox one can run fallout 4 just fine the
ability to get mods that add different
features could be a huge thing
especially compared to ps4 now as I said
the games were good but the real
strength
this year's Xbox conference were the
features and accessories first off we
got a look at the new Microsoft elite
controller which is running for one
hundred and fifty bucks but also looks
really intense as well as highly
customizable I definitely wanna get my
hands on one to see if it's worth that
price point second up we got a
demonstration of the hololens which we
didn't get any kind of clear release
date or price point it was just showing
off how it can be used with Minecraft
but the most important thing of this
demonstration was that out of everything
we've seen it III so far this year this
was the biggest sign of things to come
in future gaming you know it was really
intense to see this live demonstration
of how you can actually look at this
three-dimensional world your building
moving and manipulating it it was
definitely one of the most sort of wow
factor moments for that conference the
biggest announcement by far though in my
opinion least is the fact the Xbox one
will be getting a software update to
become backwards compatible now they
have released a list of what games are
currently planned to be backwards
compatible and it is extremely small but
seeing as how this update isn't planned
for release until this holiday season it
can be pretty safely assumed that the
list is going to grow quite a bit until
then and what's huge about this is that
assuming that list does get to a big
enough size to include most Xbox 360
classics that means that the ps4 is the
only current gen system that is not
backwards compatible you're gonna be
able to play your favorite Xbox 360
games on Xbox one the way you can
already play Wii games while the ps4 is
completely locked in modern-day games
which is a big move for Xbox one now
later on in the same day with Sony's
press conference which a lot of people
were curious about how they're going to
strike back at Microsoft after that
whole backwards compatibility thing and
while they didn't directly address that
particular issue
they struck back pretty hard right away
by basically literally making three
different dreams come true first off
they brought The Last Guardian out of
vaporware and development hell it is now
planned for a late 2016 release and we
saw new gameplay for it after that they
announced the Kickstarter for Shenmue 3
which on the one hand having a
Kickstarter at a press event of that
size feels really weird to me and also
to be perfectly honest I actually missed
out on Shenmue that's a series that I
don't have a connection with but I do
understand it's a big deal that the
third one is happening and it's proven
by the fact that it met its $2,000,000
goal in just 10 hours
and it crashed the Kickstarter website
right when it was announced third up and
definitely the most important for at
least me personally was the fact that
they announced the Final Fantasy 7
remake now of course this is a
third-party title from square and even
trailer itself did point out the fact
that it will only be temporarily
exclusive for ps4 but it was still a
huge deal and it was really a great
curveball too because when they
initially announced it it sounded like
they were going to talk about Kingdom
Hearts 3 and then it was Final Fantasy 7
out of nowhere now those three
announcements alone are huge I mean when
you just list them out side by side it
almost sounds like some kind of crazed
fanboys dream of what they'd want
announced but it actually happened but
on top of that the Sony conference also
did a good job of covering a lot more
games people cared about as far as first
party titles go they did close the
conference with gameplay of uncharted 4
we got more looks at no man's sky which
looks absolutely incredible as well as a
few new games and development including
horizon which is a new game from
guerrilla Studios that looks absolutely
amazing now like Microsoft Sony did
spend some time on third-party game as
we got new looks at the new Batman game
a new hitman game Star Wars Battlefront
an assassin's creed syndicate but the
most interesting one was the
announcement of call of duty black ops 3
because while we already knew the game
was in development a new piece of
interesting information is the fact that
from now on unlike what has been past
tradition all map packs are now going to
have early access on ps4 instead of xbox
one which is basically just a huge shift
and betrayal especially for fans that
have been staying on Microsoft consoles
and no longer have that perk
so overall the Sony press conference was
incredibly strong with a very heavy
emphasis on games games and games
however there are some downsides if you
were paying close attention I mean first
off as far as their first party games go
pretty much none of them is scheduled
for the rest of this year they're all
far future projects which is still
important and a big deal when they look
that intense but there's nothing to push
people to buy it this holiday season
just yet the other thing is the fact
that Sony basically completely dropped
the Vita this year I mean you heard the
mention of the Vita whenever there was a
game that was available on ps4 and Vita
but that was it no special attention
paid to it whatsoever
now last and actually possibly least
this time was Nintendo which had a good
conference it wasn't a bad one but there
wasn't any really huge wow factor that
came at it this year I mean the best
mole
by far was when they opened the whole
thing up talking about Star Fox zero
which looks like it could be a ton of
fun they also introduced a new Legend of
Zelda game called Triforce heroes which
looks like four swords but instead you
only have three characters and there's
also this whole sort of like class thing
going on where you wear different suits
and it gives you different abilities now
aside from those two the rest of the
show was at least for me pretty much
downhill I mean we did get a Metroid
game which a lot of people were hoping
for
and it even has the prime moniker
attached to it but it didn't look like
when you'd expect a Metroid game to look
like it was a lot more cartoony and it
looked like it had a lot more in common
with Metroid hunters than it did with
Metroid Prime which is definitely not
one of the better games in the series to
reference aside from that as far as
other games go we did get more looks at
yarn Yoshi which continues to look like
a fun game but we already knew about it
we did have a few very amiibo
heavy-based games announced including an
animal crossing game and there was a new
announcement for Paper Mario meets Mario
and Luigi which actually looks legit'
fun that was one of the other games that
I got really excited for after that
though the rest of the show was
basically focused on amiibo's including
even talking about having a Skylanders
crossover where there's gonna be a few
special amiibo figures that are also
skylander figures and then they talked
about Mario maker law which once again
is cool but we already knew about it so
overall Nintendo's press conference
wasn't very strong this year there were
a lot of games and a lot of them do look
good but there just wasn't any huge wow
factor going on and part of this I think
is due to the fact that Nintendo just
doesn't really care about press
conferences anymore you know a lot of
these companies are just doing one big
press conference this time of year well
Nintendo has been doing multiple across
the whole year with Nintendo Direct so I
think they just kind of treated this one
like they would any other Nintendo
Direct and it just happened to be one of
the weaker ones which is a shame so
overall as far as just the big three
press conferences ago I'd have to rank
Sony at number one because they had the
heaviest emphasis on just games and they
had some of the most astounding ones to
show off Microsoft comes in at second
with having a few good games to show off
some that we were expecting and some
that we are excited to see as well as
having some really great accessories and
features shown off and announced
Nintendo sadly comes in last for me not
because it was a particularly terrible
conference but it just wasn't very good
and was easily outshined by what the
other two had to offer now there is a
lot more information coming out of rida
cover I am planning on doing another
press conference roundup video focusing
on the developer ones as well as
the PC press conference which has
probably aired by the time this video
goes live so look forward to that video
going up sometime tomorrow as always if
you enjoyed this video hit that thumbs
up unto let me know as well as subscribe
and follow me on Twitter I'll be seeing

until then I'm Kevin Kenson and I'll see
