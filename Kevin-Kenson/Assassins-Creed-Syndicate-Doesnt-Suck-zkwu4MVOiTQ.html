which is actually a huge relief to me
because after how terrible unity was we
really needed to see some changes for
the better in this series and thankfully
we got them and in fact this really kind
of confirms a theory that I've been
having with each game as they become
released where every odd-numbered game
they tend to make a lot of mistakes and
have a lot of areas that need to be
cleaned up and then they fix it in the
following even-numbered one but then
they just go back and forth back and
forth as we saw with Assassin's Creed 3
and five unity but we saw good stuff in
Assassin's Creed 2 Black Flag which is
number four and now number six which is
syndicate so the question is then what
exactly was done in this one that made
it better than what we saw in unity and
a lot of it comes down to the fact that
while a lot of the core game is very
very familiar it's the same thing we've
seen across every single game in the
past except maybe black flag which
deviated a little bit what changes they
did make were huge strides in making the
overall flow of the game a lot better
the core that were all familiar with is
definitely here free roaming through a
city climbing towers to unlock side
missions slowly conquering all of the
town while also completing main story
missions to get through the plot it's
all stuff we've definitely done before
but there's a lot of adjustments that
just make it so much better first off
there's the fact that they've completely
overhauled the advancement system that
we saw in unity one of the things that
made unity a big problem was that it
relied heavily on spending in-game money
where you'd have to buy different pieces
of equipment which would then level a
character up problem was the amount of
money that higher level stuff costed was
ridiculous and pretty much required you
to start investing in the game's helix
credits which were microtransactions yay
syndicate on the other hand focuses much
more on a natural form of progression
we've seen in other games whenever you
complete different side missions
complete story missions you're rewarded
with XP and for every thousand XP you
get a skill point spend so many skill
points you level up which then lets you
buy equipment you can use which is all
much more affordable as a result the
game's pacing is much much more player
friendly where you can just take your
time doing all the missions available
for your current given level and through
completing them you're definitely going
to get enough money and experience to
get all the upgrades you need to move on
to the next set of missions another
addition that seems kind of small at
first but actually has a huge in
on how the game is played is the
grappling hook which makes traveling
around the city a lot easier one of the
things that became really annoying and
monotonous about other older Assassin's
Creed games is all the time you have to
take to climb buildings or to survey the
land or get to important parts of the
mission now with the grappling hook you
can quickly ascend any major towers or
even find easier ways to cross from
building to building at first it just
seems like a handy new tool but it
really does impact the overall flow of
the game because you spend so much less
time having to do the same
exploration tasks over and over again
but can instead focus on the missions
you're playing through now one of the
biggest changes of course is one of the
things they heavily advertised about
this game and that's that you have to
separate main characters the twins jacob
and evie frye now what's interesting
about them is that while you share all
experience and money and what you unlock
so on so forth they actually have two
separate independent skill trees they
look the same for the most part with a
couple unique talents here and there but
you develop them for each character
individually so if you want and as the
game suggests you can Oh Jacob focus
more on just upfront conflict and combat
while having Evie focus on a pure
stealthy approach now what's cool about
this is well you could just invest in
the same skills for both characters
making them feel very similar early on
that's boring instead if I specializing
them you can make it so each one is
suited for different missions there are
story missions where you must use one or
the other but for all the different side
quests you can do for exploring the town
it really does make a big impact who you
choose to handle what situation now
another big difference to unity is that
there's a whole lot less you need to
invest in with unity there was all kinds
of different small parts of your outfit
that you could choose from and by which
led to you having to buy a lot of stuff
with syndicate it's a lot more pared
down it's really just your weapon your
outfit a few other small pieces and the
ability to upgrade your gangs as well as
your secondary items as a result it's a
lot easier to unlock everything in this
game and basically makes
microtransactions completely unnecessary
they are still present in this game but
you really only need to use them if you
don't feel like playing through the
whole thing if you take your time being
completionist you can get through the
whole thing and a lock of everything you
need before you even close to finishing
all the content so from a mechanic
standpoint there have been a lot of
upgrades in this game that just make the
entire thing flow together a lot better
that being said though the whole thing
exactly amazing in particular the story
it feels like at this point Ubisoft is
just going through the motions with what
happens in the story for this game
there's not really any interesting
twists or turns it's just a matter of
your the assassins here's this big bat
Templar guy you need to take down go
ahead and do that and along the way
you'll get a little bit more plot for
the overarching story in present-day
that's still somehow slowly moving along
the whole thing is extremely familiar
extremely cliche and honestly just a bit
on the boring side thankfully one thing
that does bounce it out is that Jake and
Ameobi are actually fairly interesting
characters and more importantly have
some really good banter with one another
which at least makes a lot of the
cutscenes entertaining in small bursts
now of course another problem is that
this wouldn't be an assassin's Creed
game without having its fair share of
bugs and glitches at launch but
thankfully they don't seem to be as
common as they were in other games while
playing through I encountered a time
where a character completely disappeared
during the cutscene even though I was
talking to no one holding a dog there
was another time where all fast travel
points disappeared so I had to reload
the game am I encountered one infinite
loading screen but these were all
isolated incidents and all the time that
I spent blitzing through so it doesn't
seem like they're happening often but
enough to still be frustrating from time
to time and hopefully we'll just get
fixed after some patching ultimately in
my opinion of this game is that it's
good not great but also far from
terrible like unity was they took the
time to fix a lot of the problems we saw
in that game but didn't really do
anything radical enough to make it
interesting like Black Flag it's enough
to where if you are a fan of previous
Assassin's Creed games and unity turned
you off this is going to bring you back
but if you've never liked any of the
games except maybe Black Flag this
probably isn't gonna do anything to
change that opinion with that being said
if you are interested in grabbing a copy
