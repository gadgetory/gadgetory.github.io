the power and excitement of Nintendo
right in the palm of your hand you got
something a little bit different for you
guys today there's something we saw a
couple weeks back on the internet that
was just too interesting to pass up I'm
is the right mixture of kind of weird
maybe bad but maybe really good so we
had order one to get our hands on and
try it out just got it recently and is
this guy right you the case console a
little piece for your phone that brings
the promise of offering a Game Boy
experience on the back earphone or at
least that's the idea with this design
of the back which is clearly based on
the original Game Boy so let's check it
out yes so this is a lot simpler than
what I was expecting at first because I
was thinking maybe it was like actually
you know doing all the pixels like a
Game Boy would but instead this is based
on a little older tech where instead we
just had these giant bricks that are
each being turned off or on to make
images that are kind of descriptive I
mean it gives you the basic idea of what
the games about it's very very simple
though all right let's see what else we
got here so he has shooting game racing
Frogger kind of Frick breaker Tetris
Tetris
everything after AI is tetris something
that is really impressive about this all
although is that you know a long time
ago this kind of tech still took up a
pretty big body and now it's just the
thin back of my phone icon which we have
in the actual old fat game boys you can
put him side by side to see how much
these have just shrunk in comparison I
don't have one so gonna get one
so original Gameboy on such short notice
I called up my local retro video game
store pixel vault and thankfully they
had just one left so went down and
checked it out
let's count what we need I think so how
do you see these like come and go these
days like our luggage is still hunting
down the original fat ones
a lot of people still like these and
some of them still probably doing just
for these custom type of jobs but then
there are also the Game Boy pockets
right me personally I think quite
similar to yeah actually size-wise need
a lot closer yeah yeah because
personally I've always stuck would just
be advanced because it gives me that
whole library going back example let's
get the backlight without money yeah
it's really cool to see if you like you
took the initiative to do that with the
older systems to that but for some
reason the grip on these older gave
voice to even the fact that they're just
fat it just has it feels more
comfortable they feel more comfortable
and we won't give you that carpet like
but I have a seven this is probably
really comfy but yes an adult this is
actually a lot better yeah peace yeah
and they you know they do last quite a
bit
only problem these is that LCD
pixelation starts going out but there's
that coming in over time it's easy they
easily fixable now we may have spent
just a little bit too much time minister
we spent way too much time looking at
all the different retro goodies trying
to get different ideas for how we can
justify buying some of these collectors
items and in the end we did buy the
Gameboy but we picked up a little bit
extra including a game and watch also
maybe a Vectrex quick before moving on
shadow to Armando for letting us shoot
in his store if you guys are interested
in retro games make sure to check out
its Instagram so now that we've the
original game boy on hand it really
isn't saying how much larger this thing
is I mean realize that this is how big
the case is on the phone all that really
matters for the working parts is this
thin back part right here so compare
that to the Game Boy which is thicker
than the phone not to mention taller I
mean a little lighter maybe but yeah
this thing is gigantic compared to it
and all that tech is now going in here
now something that was interesting the
Kimbell ball we're at the store though
is that when you really break down how
this phone case is working it actually
is a lot more in common with the game
boyse predecessor the original
Nintendo handheld which is the Game and
Watch series which came out back in 1980
hold nine years earlier The Game and
Watch was super smart for its time
because back then people were trying to
kind of do what the Gameboy does we have
cartridges and you're making use of this
screen where you're doing every pixel
but the processing power really wasn't
there back then I mean you only got
screens that had so many pixels to where
you needed to use a lot of imagination
to actually figure out what was really
happening in the game so instead what
they did with these was they made
standalone one-off games that were their
own little portables and instead of
worrying about doing every pixel on the
screen it just had different symbols
that would light up at each time which
took way less processing power and
really kind of gave players a real sense
of what was going on like these two
dudes boxing right here and that's
basically what this phone case is doing
with all those larger blocks that it's
just choosing to light up or not as cool
as this was for its time people still
wanted to eventually accomplish the real
full-blown idea of a portable console
something where you're actually able to
interchange the games I have to buy a
whole new system every time you want
something different and that did finally
happen in 1989 with the arrival of this
Gameboy right here in born only from
Nintendo now you're playing with power
although what's really interesting about
it too is that Nintendo was really
hoping that its success would be based
on putting a Mario game on it but really
defined it is that one part of a puzzle
game we all know and love and can't get
the song out of our heads Tetris
it's insane to think how much those
small handful of games really propelled
this thing to success because while the
game boy is awesome there were a whole
bunch of competitors at the time that
we're making way more high-powered
interesting looking systems that just
had no battery life and no library prove
it yet in the end this little hand held
right here survived not because of
having the best tech but just because
they had great ideas going into it
something that established a legacy that
got us multiple Gameboy revisions
introduced the DS the 3d s and now the
switch so anyways back to the case
console because that's what this video
is about I think or maybe it's just an
excuse for us to buy retro stuff anyways
point is the case ghazal is neat you
know I think it's a cool little idea
it's something that you can definitely
have as like a fun conversation topic to
show friends but once you actually plan
it for a bit it's whatever I mean the
best game on it is one of the 15
different versions of Tetris which if
we're being honest you could just
download that on your phone and it would
probably be better but it is a really
cool-looking case I'm gonna keep using
it I'm just gonna rip the battery out so
that I'm not constantly hearing the song
every time I actually hit the on button
in my pocket</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
