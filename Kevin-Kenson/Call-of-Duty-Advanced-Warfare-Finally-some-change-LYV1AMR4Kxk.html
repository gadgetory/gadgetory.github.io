that Call of Duty has been one of the
biggest selling titles year in and year
out and despite that fact it's felt like
complaints have just grown every year
since modern warfare 2 mostly because
the games have begun to just look more
and more like the exact same title
getting released back to back at a full
price of 140 bucks after Matt packs sure
the maps change guns get some rebalances
and some abilities might get added or
removed and you even get a shiny new six
hour campaign about shooting bad guys
but at its heart several past games have
been basically the same thing whose only
big difference has been what third games
have you get based on what company made
it if you guys saw my first impressions
video advanced warfare you'll know that
I was actually pretty optimistic about
this one because yes there are actually
a lot of changes front-loaded most
importantly the game finally got a
really good visual upgrade and there's
some new mobility options and special
moves added to the core gameplay that
mixes things up and I want to emphasize
that these changes while minut are also
really awesome and is by far the most
work i think i've seen put into a new
call of duty game in years but at the
same time the experience is still going
to boil down to just that call of duty
so breaking the whole experience down to
its parts the game basically consists of
three main forms of gameplay there's the
single-player campaign online
cooperative and of course the all-time
main attraction competitive multiplayer
the single player is basically what
anyone who's played a call of duty game
would expect short railroadee and
basically a glorified six hour tutorial
to build up your self esteem before
going online the story is one of the
better ones for the series partially
thanks to Kevin Spacey but also because
the plot is a little little deeper than
just here is the super bad terrorists go
to feed them though don't worry that is
still the direction it ultimately goes
there's a little variety and content
pests shooting dudes on foot you can
upgrade your character as the plot goes
on there's a few faux stealth missions
and of course a couple vehicle segments
that overall do liven things up a bit
but considering the campaign's overall
length it's just hard for it to be
memorable it's fairly enjoyable Walt
last but if you're the kind of person
that buys game just for the
single-player experience then it alone
is definitely not worth justifying a
full purchase the co-op mode this time
around is EXO survival which is in line
with the modern warfare series having a
team of players work together to hold
off for words of regular enemies all
while occasionally getting different
side objectives the one thing that does
draw this mode slightly apart though is
its own use of the
so suit which is an upgradeable part of
your character alongside buying new guns
and restocking ammo you can wear
different frame types that affect your
mobility and armor as well as equip a
special functionality like the
deployable shield now while this mode is
currently limited to just fighting
regular soldiers there is one particular
level that does feature a special bonus
round involving zombies and has been
announced that there will be future DLC
adding a full zombies only co-op mode
shows you that our fans of the tray are
call of duty's for that mode in
particular that's in dlc you want to
keep your eyes open for now last but not
least we have of course the main reason
why most of you are even considering
buying this game in the first place the
competitive multiplayer mode there's a
lot of familiar here with a hint of
newness mostly in the way the mote
emphasizes the game's new mobility
options you can customize your avatars
appearance by choosing a face falling
too many of the campaign's characters
outfit yourself with a couple different
clothing and exosuit design choices and
then of course create custom classes
from an expanding list of options as you
level up through shooting people and
doing low and matches class creation is
based on the black ops model of pic 13
basically instead of the game just
giving you a few slots to pick options
for your given more slots than normally
necessary and can emphasize what areas
you prefer want to use to exosuit
abilities at the expense of a grenade
cool want to have one tricked-out
primary weapon with elite sidearm and
fewer passive perks that works too while
it isn't that fundamentally different
from what you've been able to do in past
games it does allow for a greater degree
of specialization which is a distinction
I can appreciate now as I said earlier
the biggest change in this game comes
from core mobility controls players can
now perform a double jump thanks to a
jetpack as well as perform quick side
and back dashes and an air dash to try
and get out of danger with a few more
special options available as exosuit
abilities like a short-term hover on its
own the mechanic is a nice change but
thankfully it was also taken into
account in the game's map design none of
them consist of two open or flat-out
areas instead relying heavily on
multi-tiered levels that reward players
for utilizing their new vertical freedom
this can make things like flanking
enemies or get a jump on those a lot
easier though depending on the level it
does also run the risk of making you a
bit too obvious of the target while this
doesn't revolutionize the gameplay by
any means it's still
the change to make advanced warfare
tactics at least a little different from
previous games now I also want to take a
moment to praise the games variety of
match types while certain traditional
modes of course offer the most player
traffic there's a lot more specialty
options to help vary your multiplayer
experience beyond just free-for-all or
domination offering some of the most
modes right from the start out of any
call duty game without any DLC
expansions just yet the thing about
advanced warfare is this it's still
pretty much call of duty yes there are
some changes that as I said we're mostly
for good but the core experience still
basically boils down to what many
players are familiar with if you're a
super hardcore player then there might
be some specific rebalances or changes
that you love or hate but for most the
experience is going to feel very very
much the same personally the series has
never really been my cup of tea and I'm
not a fan of the map packs go lower
sales model but while I normally
chastise a call of duty doing a lot more
for just being a regurgitated product
actually kind of like this one at least
relative to what the rest of the series
has been like in recent years it may
just be call of duty at its heart still
but it's the most refined one to come
out and quite some time there's just a
pinch of some nice core changes so if
you've never been a fan of Call of Duty
this one isn't going to change your mind
about that but if you've been a fan of
it in the past or you've always had a
passing interest off and on this is the
best one to come out in years and just
might actually be worth picking up well
