1x playing games running tests and now I
feel confident and bring you guys my
full review so let's break down my
thoughts on the Xbox 1x
let's take a look at the technical
specifications of the Xbox monix
compared to the more standard version
the 1s and how much of an upgrade it
actually is power wise first off the CPU
now both of them make use of eight core
processors but the 1s is the clock - at
one point seven five gigahertz whereas
the One X is at 2.3 gigahertz
it's the important takeaway here the One
X is 30% faster now things get a bit
more interesting with the GPU the really
kind of popular way people are measuring
this right now are how many teraflops
each one is capable of you don't know
what that is
the basic idea is a teraflop is how many
different floating-point calculations
these systems are capable of so in the
one s's case it's 1.4 teraflops whereas
the Xbox one X is that a whopping six
teraflops so just over four times the
power of the 1s and lastly as far as
performance goes there's how much RAM
each system has the Xbox montes has
eight gigabytes whereas the One X has 12
an important thing to note here though
is that when it comes to the Xbox three
gigabytes of RAM are always dedicated to
the system itself and not actually
running games so when we're talking
about the amount of RAM available for
gaming it's actually not increased from
8 to 12 it's an increase from 5 to 9
almost twice as much and then last but
not least let's take a look at the hard
drive sizes whereas the Xbox one as
originally launched at 500 gigabytes
most ones you grabbed today though are a
terabyte and occasionally there have
been limited runs of 2 terabyte systems
the Xbox one X on the other hand
currently is only planned for a one
terabyte hard drive but it is very
important to note that is not the same
style of hard drive is actually a faster
one to ensure that 4k loading times is
not going to be horrifically long and in
fact a side benefit of this is that if
you're still playing games in 1080p
you're gonna see faster load times
compared to the 1s it's also worth
noting that as far as ports go the One X
is exactly the same as the 1s they have
the same power port they both have an
HDMI IN an HDMI out two USB ports on the
back when USB port in the front IR out
optical out and an Ethernet port now
what all this power means the Xbox one X
are two things 4k gaming and what's
called Xbox one enhanced games otherwise
print that ribbiting between the One X
and the one s is the same they both do
4k video playback they both do HDR in
both video and games
and they have the same multimedia
services the important thing is how it
impacts the visuals of your gameplay
experience now the four key aspect is a
pretty obvious upgrade for those of you
that own 4k TVs you're getting a higher
resolution and therefore a much more
higher quality image obviously not every
game offers true native 4k it's
something that's based on a game by game
basis but even if you're playing a game
that isn't patched specifically for 4k
resolutions you're still gonna see it
upscale to have a slightly better image
now some other titles aren't going to
have native 4k either but instead just
have better variations for instance
quantum break makes use of more advanced
upscaling techniques so while it is
rendering out at 1440 you're going to
get a better image than normal
otherwise there are other games that are
just gonna get full-blown native 4k
which looks fantastic like 4 to 7 Gears
of War for a lot of big first party
titles from Microsoft now a consequence
of this is that the games are getting
much larger and a really cool thing that
Microsoft has done is that games are
gonna have variable download sizes based
on which system you own so for instance
if you're still playing on an Xbox one s
you obviously don't need 4k textures for
Forte's us so they use only gonna be 67
gigs but if you get it on the 1x it's
gonna weigh in at 95 so as a result
you're gonna fill up the one terabyte
hard drive of the Xbox one X very very
quickly especially if you're playing a
lot of big-name triple-a stuff so as a
result getting an external hard drive on
a system like this is much more of a
necessity now for those of you that
don't own 4k TVs you might be wondering
well is there any reason for me to
consider getting a 1x in the first place
and the answer I've come to is well
actually yes for three different reasons
first off super sampling now if a game
supports 4k resolution even if your TV
doesn't actually do that the Xbox one X
will do what's called super sampling
where it'll render out the 4k image and
then downscale it to your 1080p
resolution this results in a crisper
cleaner and better image than something
that's rendered out in 1080p in the
first place is it as good as native 4k
no but it is better reason number two
like I said earlier thanks to the faster
hard drive you will experience faster
boot and load times for all of your
games for instance in Gears of War 4
when we're loading up a specific level
in the Xbox one as it takes 44 seconds
whereas loading up that same level on
the 1x only took 38
and lastly and by far the biggest reason
why is Xbox one enhanced now if you ever
look at game cases for Xbox one games
you might start to see these new tags
showing up 4k which means it supports 4k
gaming HDR supports HD bar and then Xbox
one enhanced which is a bit of a more
miscellaneous mixed term this means that
the game offers some kind of
improvements in enhancements on the Xbox
one X that can't just simply be
catalyzed as being 4k or HDR for
instance on Gears War 4 if you're
playing the game on a 1080p screen maybe
the option to play with better visuals
or better performance with better
visuals while you're still getting a
1080p resolution it's gonna be using
that super sampling I mentioned earlier
and gonna have enhanced graphical
effects on top of that while keeping the
30 frames per second that you normally
see in the campaign and whored modes on
the other hand if you do performance
mode you're gonna see slight visual
upgrades but it's still gonna be 1080p
but most importantly it'll actually be
playing at a full 60 frames per second
which in my opinion is a much better
choice now we do our videos in 24 frames
so obviously you can't really see that
right now so we're going to link to
another video that's unlisted so you can
check that out and see the difference
between 4k 30 and 1080p 60 frames now an
important thing to note is that just
like with 4k support not all the games
are going to have some kind of Xbox one
enhanced mode it's up to developers on a
game by game basis so not every single
game is gonna get frame rate increases
not every single game is going to make
use of super sampling or enhanced visual
effects so if you don't own a 4k TV and
you want to make use of Xbox 1x
enhancements you've got to make sure to
pay attention to what games you care
about and whether or not they're gonna
see any kind of upgrades thankfully Xbox
is pushing really hard to make sure that
a lot of their first-party titles get
some kind of enhancement unless it's
really unnecessary for a game like say
cuphead and it looks like that a lot of
big-name triple-a games are also getting
support as well
for instance Middle Earth shadow of war
and rise of the Tomb Raider also support
increased frame rates like Gears of War
4 even more surprisingly is the fact
that not only our Xbox one games getting
these enhancements but also some 360
titles as well we're seeing some of the
backwards compatible stuff get
improvements - we're getting greater
color depth and actual upscaled 4k
resolutions so you can play Halo 3 or
Fallout 3 or even the original
Assassin's Creed with better
Jools than ever what's even more
impressive about all this is that you're
not only getting this increased
performance but the system is still
running just as quiet as past systems it
is maybe slightly louder than the 1s but
you're really only going to notice this
if you're in a perfectly quiet room
otherwise you're never really going to
notice the sound the system makes now if
oh this is sounding good to you guys so
far I have some good news for you I'm
actually giving away a project Scorpio
edition Xbox one X that I'm doing
alongside with Jon from TLD today so if
you want details on how to enter that
giveaway check out the link down below
in the description now there is one
other thing I want to talk about with
the system though and that's how it
looks compared to the 1s cuz I gotta be
honest with you guys I don't like a look
at the one that's better now to be
honest part of this comes from the fact
that I don't like the look of an
all-black system I know a lot of people
have been clamoring they want a black
Xbox that isn't just the original one
but a house you think it's a downgrade
it's not that I think white just looks
better I just like the two-tone approach
I like the contrast which this doesn't
give you at all one thing I do like
about the 1x though is that I really
like how they move the disc drive to
being this kind of hidden space between
the main body and the base I think it
looks really good it gets this kind of
just nice solid monolithic look to it
which I do think is an upgrade so I'm
really excited to see if any more colors
for this is gonna come out in the future
but as for right now definitely like a
look at the planets more so the ultimate
question is this should you buy an xbox
1x maybe look if you're on a 4k TV the
benefits are obvious and even if you
don't like I said there's a lot of games
that do benefit from the increased power
it's just whether or not the games
getting those upgrades for you is worth
spending an extra 2 to 250 bucks if you
already own Xbox one is spending 500
ollars all over again to get a new
system is a bit of a harder sell but if
you don't have an Xbox one yet I
honestly do think it's worth saving up
to get the system especially as more and
more games adopt upgrades like 60 frames
cuz every game that gets the 60 frame
patch makes the system all the more
worth it in my opinion</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
