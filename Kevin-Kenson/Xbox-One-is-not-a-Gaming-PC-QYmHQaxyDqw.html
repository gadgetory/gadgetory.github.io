off their new keyboard mouse combo
designed for the Xbox one and back when
keyboard and mouse support was first
announced for the Xbox and now again
with the Razer turret being shown off
there's this title that I've been seeing
going around all a lot of different
channels this is just this concept of
the Xbox one is now basically a PC and I
get it I get the idea it's a very
clickable title that makes a lot of
sense because yeah we're throwing off
how keyboard and mouse something that's
always been associated with PC
specifically is making its way to the
Xbox and I think it's a good strong
title but at the same time just seeing
that sentence my brain has this
immediate reaction of just going now
obviously there can be a bit of a
semantics debate here because yeah in a
certain sense home consoles are just
gaming PC's that run a very specific OS
that plays specific games and apps but I
think there's a very important
fundamental difference between console
and PC gaming and it goes beyond the
simple concept of oh one uses a
controller and one primarily uses
keyboard and mouse I mean if that was
the only literal difference between the
two
gaming pcs would have replaced consoles
years ago because they can use both
controller and keyboard the real key
difference between these is the intent
behind the products how they're marketed
and what kind of audience they're
designed for because there is a big
difference between how someone wants to
approach console gaming and how someone
want to build or buy a pre-built gaming
PC console gaming is and has always been
about just simplicity and something that
is very straightforward and works you
are buying a product for a set price you
know what games are designed to work on
the thing and assumedly all those games
will run fine sometimes you might have
to wait for a patch and sometimes that's
still not enough but that's exceptions
and the hold another debate but the
point is you're just able to buy a
product and it does what you want it to
do and it gives you a simple way to
interact with it and have the kind of
experience you want with PC gaming
you're dealing with something that is
much more versatile as it's designed to
do a whole lot of different things and
yeah if you build an expensive nice
gaming PC you're going to achieve a
gaming experience that is yeah prettier
and much more intense than what you can
get currently on consoles but it
requires more investment more knowledge
and yeah some people might think well
it's really not that much harder or more
difficult but that's not the point it's
still an
just step consul buy it it works PC I
gotta start doing a lot more thinking
now and it be clear this is not any kind
of debate of Oh console gaming is better
because simple or PC gaming is better
cuz frame rates and draw distance
whatever no we're not having that debate
right now that is not what I'm talking
about the important thing here is that
these are two distinctly different
audiences and this is something that
Microsoft is very acutely aware of and
they've even said as much in the past
they've talked about how when they
change their design goals with the Xbox
and how they want to approach releasing
games on it it's no longer a matter of
oh you want to buy an Xbox one and not a
PC it's oh you like Xbox or console more
than you like pcs cool we're gonna make
our games available on both these
platforms because these are two
different kinds of gamers today we
announce our biggest lineup of games for
Xbox one in Windows 10 along with the
Xbox play anywhere program that enables
you to buy a game once and play it on
Xbox one and Windows 10 and I think that
philosophy the Xbox started
demonstrating a couple of years back is
really influencing the direction that
that company is really going with how
they approach gaming in general at Xbox
we want to deliver a world where you
have more freedom and choice to play the
games you want with the people you want
on the devices you want I've ranted
before about the concept of where
Microsoft is taking Xbox that eventually
the focus on hardware is going to fall
off and instead they focus on the idea
of Xbox as a service delivering gameplay
through either stream boxes or actual
home consoles or even the option of
playing on PC and I I think something I
haven't properly emphasized though is
that the philosophy behind that is that
people should be able to play games
however they want wherever they want
that's it I think that's direction Xbox
really wants to focus on where you can
play with what kind of controller you
want to use whether that's a regular
controller or a racing wheel a
fightstick keyboard and mouse whatever
it's going to work across all different
products do you want to play on the go
play something on your phone streaming
to it do you want to have just a stream
box that gives you an easy way to play a
game by that do you want an actual home
console that's running it there cool pay
more by that you want to play on PC
where you can adjust settings cool play
on there by that I think we're hitting a
point in gaming history where things are
gonna have a very big change I think
that change is gonna happen sooner than
people realize I think we're all very
used to this concept of oh yeah there's
home consoles and they come out every
six years and if you want to buy the
newest cool games you have to buy that
or oh you plan PC well just keep
upgrading parts over time make sure you
can get the right resolution or frame
rate you want I think all that is going
to stop mattering really soon there's a
lot of companies already experimenting
with these concepts to being able to
just stream games through whatever kind
of product you want there's gonna be
this focus eventually where you're just
playing games it doesn't matter what
it's on or what form there's just going
to be a way to play and experience the
content and honestly I'm pretty excited
for it because I'm getting really tired
of console wars</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
