weeks now and if you haven't played it
yet you should because it's freaking
amazing it's been 23 years since the
original doom came out and gaming has
changed a ton since then just look at
the difference in file size the final
version of the original doom was 45
megabytes while the new doom is 45 gigs
that's a thousand times in size and with
those ears the FPS genre has gone
through a lot of different phases and
what makes doom so great to me at least
is that its single-player campaign makes
use of some of these new things while
still keeping the approach to old-school
game design and here's 5 of the biggest
ways it does number one hazing Doom
doesn't need to take any time to explain
shit to you so many games these days get
caught up and plot character development
motivations all of which can be a good
thing but don't need to be in every
single game and doom proves that it does
take a little bit of a middle ground
there's some setup there's a few
conversations here and there to give the
game a bare-bones plot necessary for
those looking for it but the game wastes
as little of time as necessary on this
instead favoring to just throw you into
the action ripping and tearing enemies
apart which is in fact why you probably
wanted to grab this game in the first
place if you want more the game throws
some data logs at you and things you can
read up on if you want to get a little
more mythological with the game story
but as far as 99% of the game is
concerned you just need to keep moving
and kill everything in your way which
links into point number 2 aggressive
gameplay one of the biggest trends in
FPS games that has risen since the
original doom is regenerating health
which was popularized by the Halo
franchise and love it or hate it one of
the big impacts of this approach is that
it rewards players for patience and
hiding from enemies oh what you took 3
bolts to the chest just hide behind a
rock and wait for your screen to stop
being red and that is not something that
would fly in older FPS games which
forced you to push ahead if you wanted
to live and this is exactly what the new
doom does it brings back a regular
Health System but with one important
change you can not only gain life by
picking up health packs but also by
finishing enemies often the most brutal
method possible meaning if you want to
stay alive you just need to keep killing
with every breath you have if a big
enemy hurts you no amount of running
hiding will save you so the only way to
survive is to go through everything that
stands in your way this makes for one of
the most of visceral experiences I have
ever had with an FPS especially in
recent years and is one of this game's
biggest merits in my opinion what makes
this game even better is point number
three it's love of Secrets older FPS
games doom included were littered with
all kinds of hidden finds to reward
players giving you caches of health
armor ammo and guns and maybe even a fun
little Easter Egg or inside joke and the
new doom fully embraces this and is able
to take things a step further since in
the old games you couldn't even jump or
look up doom has tons of Secrets you're
told about but need to hunt down and
adds in a little bit of modern game
design by making a lot of these things
collectibles and upgrades that make doom
guy all the better at killing things in
his way not to mention having an extra
special secret in every level that
recreates the original doom music
included FPS games at large today don't
really do this anymore and definitely
don't take them to the same degree which
is kind of sad because a it gives you a
very good reason to play through the
game again if you didn't find everything
and be it's just a ton of fun to stumble
in on this kind of stuff and be rewarded
for your curiosity now getting back to
the gory stuff point number four is what
I like to call the one-man army a lot of
shooters these days are obsessed with
the idea of the squad or teammates are
giving you NPC friends which isn't a bad
thing in and of itself but sometimes
it's awesome to just feel like you're
the biggest badass that ever lived and
this is exactly what doom does for the
player you don't need cover fire you
don't need a flanking buddy and you
certainly don't need a
computer-controlled Ally to run over and
kill you if you ever get dumb and die
fighting enemies you are more than
capable all by yourself the entire games
start to finish no opening handheld ally
no assistance you can summon in a bad
situation
just you and literal tons of ammo and
weapons that you can carry all at once
and devastate everything in your path
with and this leads to the final point
to hell with logic it's kind of weird
but we've grown to accept as being
realistic or not in video games these
days it's perfectly alright to get shot
five times then hide behind a wall to
feel better but we need to make sure
characters can only carry two guns at a
time only so many different support
items and
guns need reloading with ammo that's
only dropped by enemies using the same
thing if the game in question is trying
to be the most realistic experience
possible than fine but if not where's
the fun and all that doom guy never
needs to reload his guns except in the
case of the almighty super shotgun and
otherwise you just get all the ammo you
need by chainsawing a demon in half as
he splits open is some kind of munitions
pinata juggle between two guns why not
just carry all nine at once including
four guns that have to take two hands
and a ton of strength to hold and a
chainsaw to just top it all off
realistic falling damage nah guns that
use some kind of internal logic or have
a respect of physics never it's just so
refreshing when the rule of the game is
simply what's fun and not what's
realistic or what makes sense for the
story the point of all this isn't just
to say that doom is a fun game which you
should try which you definitely should
if gory FPS games are your style the
point is is that there's some merit to
making games today that hearken back to
old-school approaches and most
importantly worry less about having
complex stories are simulating the
real-world things those things have
their benefits and there should of
course still be games that focus on them
but at the same time it just doesn't
hurt to make a game whose only real
concern is have fun rip and tear</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
