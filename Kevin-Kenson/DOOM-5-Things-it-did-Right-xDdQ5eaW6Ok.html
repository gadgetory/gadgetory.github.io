weeks now and if you haven't played it
yet you should because it's freaking
amazing it's been 23 years since the
original doom came out and gaming has
changed a ton since then just look at
the difference in file size the final
version of the original doom was forty
five megabytes well the new doom is 45
gigs that's a thousand times in size and
with those ears the FPS genre has gone
through a lot of different phases and
what makes doom so great to me at least
is that it's single player campaign
makes use of some of these new things
while still keeping the approach to
old-school game design and here's five
of the biggest ways it does number one
hazing doom doesn't need to take any
time to explain shit to you so many
games these days get caught up and plot
character development motivations all of
which can be a good thing but don't need
to be in every single game and doom
proves that it does take a little bit of
a middle ground there's some setup
there's a few conversations here and
there to give the game of bare-bones
plot necessary for those looking for it
but the game wastes as little of time is
necessary on this instead favoring to
just throw you into the action ripping
and tearing enemies apart which is in
fact why you probably wanted to grab
this game in the first place if you want
more the game throw some data logs at
you and things you can read up on if you
want to get a little more mythological
with the game story but as far as
ninety-nine percent of the game is
concerned you just need to keep moving
and kill everything in your way which
links into point number two aggressive
gameplay one of the biggest trends and
FPS games that has risen since the
original doom is regenerating health
which was popularized by the Halo
franchise and love it or hate it one of
the big impacts of this approach is that
it rewards players for patients and
hiding from enemies Oh what you took
three bolts to the chest just hide
behind a rock and wait for your screen
to stop being read and that is not
something that would fly in older FPS
games which forced you to push ahead if
you wanted to live and this is exactly
what the new doom does it brings back a
regular health system but with one
important change you can not only gain
life by picking up health packs but also
by finishing enemies off in the most
brutal method possible meaning if you
want to stay alive you just need to keep
killing with every breath you have if a
big enemy hurts you know amount of
running
hiding will save you so the only way to
survive is to go through everything that
stands in your way this makes for one of
the most of visceral experiences I have
ever had with an FPS especially in
recent years and is one of this game's
biggest merits in my opinion what makes
this game even better is point number
three it's love of Secrets older FPS
games doom included were littered with
all kinds of hidden finds to reward
players giving you caches of health
armor ammo and guns and maybe even a fun
little easter egg or inside joke and the
new doom fully embraces this and is able
to take things a step further since in
the old games you couldn't even jump or
look up doom has tons of Secrets you're
told about but need to hunt down and ads
in a little bit of modern game design by
making a lot of these things
collectibles and upgrades that make
doomguy all the better at killing things
in his way not to mention having an
extra special secret in every level that
recreates the original doom music
included FPS games at large today don't
really do this anymore and definitely
don't take them to the same degree which
is kind of sad because a it gives you a
very good reason to play through the
game again if you didn't find everything
and be it's just a ton of fun to stumble
in on this kind of stuff and be rewarded
for your curiosity now getting back to
the gory stuff point number four is what
I like to call the one-man army a lot of
shooters these days are obsessed with
the idea of the squad or teammates or
giving you NPC friends which isn't a bad
thing in and of itself but sometimes
it's awesome to just feel like you're
the biggest badass that ever lived and
this is exactly what doom does for the
player you don't need cover fire you
don't need a flanking buddy and you
certainly don't need a
computer-controlled ally to run over and
heal you if you ever get dumb and die
fighting enemies you are more than
capable all by yourself the entire games
start to finish no opening hand held a
lie no assistance you can summon in a
bad situation just you and literal tons
of ammo and weapons that you can carry
all at once and devastate everything in
your path with and this leads to the
final point to hell with logic it's kind
of weird what we've grown to accept as
being realistic or not in video games
these days it's perfectly alright to get
shot five times then hide behind a wall
to feel better but we need to make sure
characters can only carry two guns at a
time only so many different support
items and
tons need reloading with Mo that's only
dropped by enemies using the same thing
if the game in question is trying to be
the most realistic experience possible
than fine but if not where's the fun and
all that doomguy never needs to reload
his guns except in the case of the
almighty super shotgun and otherwise you
just get all the ammo you need by
chainsawing a demon in half as he splits
open is some kind of munitions pinata
juggle between two guns why not just
carry all mine at once including four
guns that have to take two hands and a
ton of strength to hold and a chainsaw
to just top it all off realistic falling
damage nah guns that use some kind of
internal logic or have a respective
physics never it's just so refreshing
when the rule of the game is simply
what's fun and not what's realistic or
what makes sense for the story the point
of all this isn't just to say that doom
is a fun game which you should try which
you definitely should if gory FPS games
are your style the point is is that
there's some merit to making games today
that harken back to old school
approaches and most importantly worry
less about having complex stories are
simulating real world things those
things have their benefits and there's
of course still be games that focus on
them but at the same time it just
doesn't hurt to make a game whose only
real concern is have fun rip and tear</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
