earlier every year and this year is no
exception in fact we already have some
deals that are already starting today so
we're gonna go for some the best deals
to grab your level PlayStation Xbox and
Nintendo switch and all the games you
get ever hope first let's start with the
big one gaming consoles now there's a
lot of really cool console bundles this
holiday season and they're all regulated
by this companies actually making them
Sony Microsoft Nintendo so you're gonna
see a lot of the same deals across all
major stores now sony has I think
probably the strongest bundle at least
one I think is a really good deal and
that's for 200 bucks you can get a
PlayStation 4 slim with a one terabyte
hard drive and most importantly it is
bundled with spider-man one of the best
games this year easily makes us worth
picking up the bundle that's for
Microsoft we have a couple different
bundles going around you can get an Xbox
1s bundled with minecraft for only 200
bucks which is a solid deal but what's
really interesting is what they're doing
for the Xbox one X if you go to
Microsoft directly you can get an Xbox
one X for $100 off at 400 that is the
cheapest has been made available so far
to date but if you're willing to spend a
little extra money there's a much more
interesting deal going on over at Best
Buy where you can get the Gold Rush
battlefield 5 bundle which comes with an
Xbox one X that has this kind of gold to
black trim design that looks really cool
you're gonna get a copy of battlefield 5
and you're gonna get two controllers not
just one all for 430 s you're spending a
little extra money but you're getting a
game a special design and extra
controller altogether and then of course
we have Nintendo who's offering bundles
on both the switch and DS line of
systems for the switch they're doing a
bundle we can get Mario Kart 8 deluxe
included for all three hundred bucks
same price you're paying for the switch
normally but you're getting a free game
included and so really good about that
honestly it is still one of the better
sales they've done on that system so far
and as for the DES they're offering once
again another original 2d s bundle this
time including Mario maker which is a
fantastic game if you've been sleeping
on the DS and you haven't grabbed one
just yet this is a really good cheap
deal just if you want to start opening
up that library now of course there are
some deals tied into major accessories
as well what a big ones are seeing is
controllers Nintendo does really have
any going on right now but for both
PlayStation next box you can find their
controllers on sale for 40 bucks
technically the best out of these deals
is game stop selling DualShock force for
only $13.99 that is a whole penny
cheaper than Walmart and a dollar
cheaper than Best Buy and Target but
it's basically 40 bucks at all the
stores and for those of you
interested in VR we are seeing let's
again PSP our bundles going on sale
they're a hundred bucks off all across
the different stores the best lowest
price possible is if you go to Best Buy
you can get an Astra bot bundle for only
$200 if you end up grabbing an Xbox one
X or a ps4 Pro or you already have one
you know the TV to go with it well
there's a lot of 4k TV deals going on
this Black Friday as well we're gonna
break down some of the better ones by
individual store starting with Best Buy
now if you drew on a 4k TV at the
absolute lowest price possible they are
doing a great deal on a 43 inch Toshiba
4k TV for only 129 dollars now if you're
willing to spend more and get something
a little bigger there are a couple other
options available some of the best ones
include a 65 inch samsung for 600 bucks
and a 70 inch LG for 700 there's one
more deal from Best Buy I want to
mention because it is a really good deal
but it's still also very expensive and
that is the Samsung QN 65 q9f that is
one of the highest-rated TVs to come out
this year it is an amazing one for
gaming it's the one I personally use it
supports free sync which gets you a lot
more under your Xbox one X normally it's
thirty nine hundred bucks but right now
for Black Friday it's only three
thousand for more great TV options you
can also turn to Target they've got a
few smaller sizes but also it really
good pricing their absolute lowest one
is a 55 inch Element TV for 200 bucks if
you're willing to pay a little more for
other name brands you can get a Phillips
50 inch for 250 or a Samsung 55 inch for
400 all 4k TVs did not say that earlier
so just insert that line
lightning round we got games lots of
games to talk about starting with Xbox

30 bucks Co thieves 25 bucks stayed 2 K
