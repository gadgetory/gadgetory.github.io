with all of its new features and
upgrades over the original you're
thinking to yourself what else can I do
to make this thing even more kick-ass
well I've got a list of 5 accessories
that you need to outfit your system with
first off the one must-have for every
Xbox one a controller charging solution
because repeatedly buying double-a
batteries is just annoying now the
popular option here and the one
Microsoft would prefer you to do is grab
the official play in charge kit for 25
bucks which is a perfectly valid option
but if you want to save some money you
could always just find a good old cheap
set of rechargeable batteries with a
charger I grabbed this one here for 12
bucks and as long as you keep
alternating each set of double-a
batteries you're guaranteed to always
have a charged up wireless controller
never needing to plug it into your
system when it's low unlike a play in
charge kit now the second biggest thing
you're going to need for your system
especially if you want to play
multiplayer is a good headset and as
soon as you look up headsets you're
going to see there's a lot of them too
many of them now how much you're willing
to spend plays a big role here but for a
solid performer that isn't going to cost
you over 100 bucks the best option right
now is the turtlebeach EXO one it's
lightweight and comfortable to wear
which is super important if you want to
spend more than two hours soaked up in a
game and the sound quality is excellent
for its price point providing clean
audio the option for bass boosting and
solid separations who can clearly make
out what others are saying even when
you're surrounded by explosions again
there are better headsets out there but
only if you're willing to spend double
triple or even quadruple what the EXO
one is going to cost you
third up is an external hard drive we've
all had that problem where you buy a new
system think it'll hold all your games
in DLC only to fill it up two months
later and have to start playing the game
of what can you delete for now
thankfully one of the big upsides to the
Xbox one is you can load up games from
an external hard drive meaning that when
you do need to expand your 500 or 1
terabyte system it isn't hard to throw
down for a one two or even four terabyte
external hard drive to vastly improve
your storage now personally I'm a fan of
the Western Digital My Passport the
price is right it looks good and comes
in a variety of sizes and colors to fit
both your needs
and personal tastes trust me if you
haven't had the issue of nospace yet you
will and when that time comes an
expanded stored solution is a very very
good idea now next is an item that's a
little more situational but I have
personally gotten so so much use out of
and that's a carrying case for your
system now there really aren't any cases
specifically made yet for the 1s but a
great Universal option is the CTA
digital gaming backpack this was
supposed to work with the original Xbox
one but it was kind of a tight and
awkward fit but the 1s works perfectly
with it you've got plenty of
compartments and pockets specifically
made for fitting your system your
controllers cables gain cases and even
slots to put your disks in there's even
ways to make the Kinect fit making it a
perfect way to safely carry and move
your whole system without the fear of
scratching or banging it up in the
process now last but not least we're
going to get a little fancier a little
more extravagant with an accessory
that's definitely an awesome upgrade if
you're willing to throw down for it the
Xbox one elite controller this thing has
everything you need to deck out your
controller to your personal liking
different stick heads and Heights your
choice of a regular or faceted d-pad
adjustable triggers extra button options
in the form of back paddles and all of
it can be reprogrammed and adjusted with
the Xbox one controller app allowing you
to fine-tune and tailor the controller
for every game sure it costs a whole
half of an Xbox one s but damn it's
pretty now for number 6 we do have one
bonus item and that is the Kinect for
the most perfect controlling game I'm
sorry I'm sorry I just can't I really
can't</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
