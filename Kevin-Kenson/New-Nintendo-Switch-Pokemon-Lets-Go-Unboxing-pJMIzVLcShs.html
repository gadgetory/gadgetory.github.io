and Pikachu are finally here and with
them we're getting another special
edition switch bundle this is the final
one of the year and I would argue
actually possibly the best it's also the
largest because there is a lot of stuff
going on here we have not only a special
edition switch but also special edition
joy Kahn's a doc comes with a copy of
the game and also this little pokeball
control over you gets you a little bit
later but before we talk about any of
this stuff in depth and what I think of
them I want to talk about the box
as for the system this is the most
thorough special issue Nintendo has done
so far all the ones you've had in the
past they'll do things like maybe
something on the dock maybe something on
the switch maybe something on the jury
cons this one we're getting all three
and first I want to look at the joy
Khan's now they had a really interesting
idea with these where they just did a
color design based on Pikachu and Eevee
and something I think is a really neat
ideas that they actually also
incorporated into the wrist straps to
give it this really good two-tone look
the only problem is I don't use my wrist
straps much so I think the concept gets
a little austere people that don't like
using these but I think the color
choices are really on point I really
like it the Pikachu yellow I'm not
always a big fan of yellow but I think
it really works in enjoyed cons and I
hope they released these separately for
people that want a yellow joy Kon now
after these we also have of course the
system itself now this is a different
approach than what they've done on other
special edition systems so far usually
they just have this kind of print put on
the back that's very simplistic this
time it's actually a patterning using
that different two-tone black they'll
use sometimes for the logo and it has a
little outlines of Pikachu Eevee
pokeballs and all kinds of just little
Pokemon stuff on the back it's very
subtle but I think it works really well
and honestly as far as special design
switches they've done so far this is the
best one and then of course there's the
dock itself now this is something I've
talked about before a few times where I
feel like Nintendo is taking kind of the
safe route with docks and this is no
different I think it looks good I really
like the way that the peak is you and
Evie are on the same size as the joy
kant's when you have the whole thing set
up together there's a nice thematic tie
and I think it looks great but at the
same time I feel like Nintendo could
just get a little more creative the dock
itself doesn't have to be the
traditional dock shape this looks good I
think Nintendo could do better
now of course these aren't the only
things to get in the bundle you also get
a copy of the game and a controller I'm
gonna talk about the pokeball thing in a
bit but first just really quick the game
I really disappoint in Nintendo isn't
doing physical copies with their special
editions this isn't that varies from
company to company Sony does physical
copies Microsoft does digital I was
really hoping intended would stick with
physical I just think that as far as any
company goes especially because they're
using cartridges it would make a lot of
sense but they're going digital which
still a cool bundle but I just think
they'd be one extra cool thing
especially for old-school fan
the series so with that being said the
controller so this is the thing that
pushes this bundle over the limit making
it the most expensive switch bundle
they've done so far this is a little
attachment just for Pokemon let's go and
it's a controller it's not a fully
functional controller it doesn't have
enough buttons to work for other games
but for Pokemon specifically you can use
the little button right here as a
joystick you can click it in and there's
a button on top so you can actually play
the full game with this and also even
throw it to catch Pokemon it also
doubles as a Pokemon go plus if you're
not familiar with that accessory it's
something they're released for Pokemon
goes like a watch you could wear and
there's opens up some extra
functionalities in that game by
connecting your phone via bluetooth so
this is a really cool little accessory
to have if you're a huge Pokemon fan I
don't know how much realistic functional
gain you're getting otherwise but as
there's a little collectible it's really
awesome
overall I think there's a couple little
areas this bundle could just have little
extra bonuses like I said I think the
dog is the only part that was playing it
a little too safe but this is a really
awesome bundle I think it definitely out
does everything Nintendo's done so far
although their special editions just had
very simple prints and very very low-key
tiny stuff this is the first one that
really embraced trying to make every
single aspect of it something tied into
the game and I really appreciate that
now if you'll excuse me I'm gonna go
disappear for the weekend to relive my
childhood</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
