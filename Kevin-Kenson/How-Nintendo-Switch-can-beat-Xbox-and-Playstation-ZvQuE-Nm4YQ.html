now it's time to see what Nintendo could
be doing 43 and when it besides the idea
of could because there is a lot of stuff
that into no can talk about at e3 but at
the same time something's kind of been a
thing with it into the last couple years
is that they don't really care about III
up on stage here at e3 and stepped on to
something that looked a lot like a
plastic bathroom scale I like French at
least not to the same extent that a lot
of other companies do because they've
really adopted this more approach of
having their own little press
conferences consistently throughout the
year with a Nintendo directs instead of
just relying on one or two big press
conferences during major conventions now
that doesn't mean we aren't gonna see
cool stuff at e3 it just means that with
all the different things they could talk
about there's a lot they probably won't
because they're just gonna save it for
another presentation so first let's talk
about some of the big games that they've
talked about in the past that aren't
quite out yet so they could be making an
appearance at the show the first obvious
one which we know is going to be there
is Super Smash Brothers I mean obviously
that is the biggest game Nintendo is
going to be talking about at e3 how much
actual heart input we're gonna get on
the game we don't know yet whether it's
just a starting cast of characters the
whole cast revealed right away you know
trailers gameplay changes there's a lot
they could talk about but also a ton
they could also keep secret about what
is definitely gonna be one of the
biggest games of 2018 now aside from
that when there are a whole lot of games
that we know are in development for the
switch but we have varying levels of
information about each one that might
make an appearance at the show including
the likes of Bayonetta 3 Metroid Prime
four Fire Emblem for 2018 a new Yoshi
game octa path traveler which is coming
out in July so that might take a
backseat to the new Shin Megami Tensei
game for it and of course No More Heroes
3 the one game they have talked about
before that we are pretty sure is gonna
make an appearance though is Mario
Tennis faces that's a game they've been
doing a lot of little different little
news bits for a while now they did the
beta weekend recently and the reason
we're pretty sure this is gonna show up
and take a good part of the presentation
is because of a suppose it leaked which
showed a number of games would be
showing up as part of the presentation
Mario Tennis X is the one game that we
actually knew would probably talked
about and there was a whole lot of other
new stuff that's pretty interesting if
it's real along with Mario Tennis Age
the other games that we already kind of
know about are Monster Hunter
double-cross for switch and StarLink the
more interesting stuff was a lot of
third-party games and making their way
to the switch the biggest two by far
being Dragon Ball fighters and fortnight
two games that a lot of people been
demanding make their way to the switch
and if this leak is true turns out they
are there were a couple of their games
listing some of them were smaller titles
I think one of the other ones that kind
of stands out a little bit is overcooked
2 is happening which probably won't be a
switch exclusive but considering how fun
it is to play on switch it's definitely
be one of the better platforms for it so
that's a lot of the big stuff and things
that we know are going to be happening
at the presentation let's talk a little
more about the rumors and kind of
unknowns
first off Pokemon now we just recently
had a lot of new information come out
for Pokemon we have a new game called
Pokemon quest on the switch it's gonna
make its way to phones as well and more
interestingly Pokemon let's go Eevee and
Pikachu additions coming out for the
switch later this year so we did get a
trailer for those in a reveal of a
pokeball style joy con that can be used
with the game
we got basic info and they're already up
for pre-order but based on how little we
actually got it's pretty likely it will
least see a little more expanded
information during Nintendo's e3
presentation or as part of their
livestream we're able to demonstrate a
little more of the game now ask for
potential new reveals at this press
conference one of the biggest rumors
going on right now is a new starfox game
but not a new mainline starfox game not
a traditional-style one but instead a
racing game called starfox Grand Prix
according to the numerous rumors they've
been coming out about this game is going
to be a racing game which mixes elements
from f-zero which makes a lot of sense
because the far future style aesthetic
and didi kong racing which I imagine
involves maybe a variety of vehicle
types and use of power-ups kind of like
in Mario Kart if true this would be the
first original racing game Nintendo's
making for the switch since Mario Kart
was a port of the one on the Wii U and
it might be the first time we see kind
of a new f-zero game I mean it's not
going to be f-zero it's going to be
starfox but the idea is probably just to
use that universe and take all the
gameplay that people love about the
f-zero universe and just put them
together so that's all the news and
rumors that were coming to flying around
for the switch lately and of course
Nintendo has other platforms and whether
they're going to make an appearance at
e3
I'm not so sure I mean first off there
is the 3ds which a lot of people would
think would be dead
I know but it's not I mean Nintendo
keeps having more games come out for it
so while it's not going to be a focus at
the press conference it is possible we
might get a game announcement or two for
it it does seem like they're focusing on
at least having some RPGs and the light
come out for the system still and after
all they did just recently announced a
new collector's edition version of the
2d s XL which is that Hylian Shield
design so they're still definitely
focusing on the system and maybe just
give it a little bit of time at the show
and not be focused entirely on the
switch another platform that could make
an appearance that a lot of people are
talking about is a potential and 64
classic edition which I honestly really
doubt I don't doubt that that is a thing
that exists in Nintendo's going to
release it probably later this year
I just really doubt that it's going to
make an appearance at e3 people were
saying the same thing last year about
the Super Nintendo classic oh they're
gonna do at 83 they didn't and I think
that's true this time too I mean it
seems like for these classic editions
Nintendo is instead relying on just
having their own news cycle for them
they'll announce it sometime later in
the summer release it in the holidays
and that's just going to keep going on</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
