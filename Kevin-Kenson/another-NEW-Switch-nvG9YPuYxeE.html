wrong about something
and thankfully this is
one of the situations
where I'm pretty happy that
I was wrong about something.
So last week there were a
lot of rumors going around
that along with the Nintendo Switch Lite,
Nintendo was also working
on a hardware refresh
of the regular Switch,
and at the time I along with
a number of other people,
this isn't like a load
opinion, was of the thought
that was going to be a
very quiet hardware refresh
where really no noticeable
change was going to happen.
They were gonna change
some of the internal parts
in terms of improving
their production quality,
but at the end of the day
it was going to perform
more or less the same as a regular Switch.
And that's mostly still true,
but Nintendo has announced
one major feature
about this Switch refresh
that is pretty important
and that is a significant
boost in battery life.
Ever since the Switch first came out
it's done a great job of
accomplishing it's original goal
of being this thing that
you can play in portable
or at home and switch
between them, it's awesome.
But when it comes with a portable side,
one big problem it's always
has is the battery life
just isn't quite where a lot of people
were hoping it would be.
Now Nintendo's official estimate
for the original Switch's
battery life is two and a half
to six and a half hours.
The reason for that range
is how quickly it drains
is based on what kind
of game you're playing
and how much you have the
backlight on so and so forth.
So something like Breath of the Wild
is only gonna last about three hours.
This new refreshed
Switch on the other hand
has an estimated battery life
of four and a half to nine hours.
So the minimum is almost as long
as the original Switch
could last at the longest,
and the new maximum is
almost twice as much.
Again, as far as Nintendo was saying,
this new refresh Switch doesn't offer
any kind of performance enhancements
as far as how games run.
It's possible that with
the redone processor
we might see very tiny gains,
where maybe load times
will be ever so slightly
less than a second faster,
but it's not gonna be anything
that most people are gonna
notice, but all that aside,
that is a significant
increase to battery life,
and one that is definitely
worth talking about.
Something worth noting is that this is
still a quiet hardware refresh.
There's not any kind of
big announcement going on
for this for store shelves.
You aren't gonna go to
store, see a brand new box
that says hey, this is the
new and improved Switch
with better battery life.
None of that's gonna happen.
Instead this will be a quiet refresh
that Nintendo is saying
is going to take place
sometime in the middle of August
and you'll start to see
these new Switches pop up
and the way you're gonna be
able to tell the difference
is by checking the serial
number of the system.
If it starts with XAW that
is an original style Switch
with the less battery life.
If it starts with XKW that will
be this new refreshed Switch
that again, is gonna play all
the same games the same way
but you're gonna be able to
play for significantly longer.
Alongside the news of this refresh Switch,
Nintendo also announced new Joy-Con colors
coming out later this year,
which are actually the first new ones
we've seen in quite some time.
We haven't had any new designs
since the regular red ones
for Super Mario Odyssey
back when Odyssey first came out.
In total they'll be
adding three new colors,
which are being added across
two different combo packs.
The first combo pack
features the neon yellow
that we've already seen that came out
back when Arms was first
released and with that
we're now getting a brand
new regular blue Joy-Con.
So it's not the kind of
brighter cotton candy blue
the neon one is, instead it's
this kind of deeper dark blue.
It actually looks very similar to
the original Hori D-pad Joy-Con,
which was a deep dark blue.
Personally I really hope
they released these ones
in individual sets because
I really like the look
of that regular dark blue one.
I always like the neon red and blue combo,
because it reminds me of
like player one, player two,
but if I could do that with this dark blue
and the Mario red, real nice look for me.
Speaking of Joy-Cons if you
want an easy and cool way
to customize yours, use skins like these
from today's sponsor dBrand.
They come in a wide variety of colors
or different special pattern options
like this matte black or carbon fiber,
they're totally safe to use on Joy-Cons,
the Switch itself. or the dock.
Check out the link down
below for more info.
The other bundle we'll be getting
is two completely brand-new colors,
which actually complete the
full set of neon versions
of the traditional color wheel setup.
We're getting neon purple and neon orange,
which I've seen a few people talk about
how this is kind of
reminiscent of the GameCube.
The GameCube original color
was of course that indigo,
which is very similar to the neon purple
we're seeing on those Joy-Cons
and there was also later
on an orange GameCube
and orange GameCube controller,
so that kind of evokes that feeling.
Whether or not that means
that Nintendo's planning
for this theme to play into
some GameCube related news
in the future, that'd be really cool,
but I'm probably just getting
my hopes up for nothing.
While I am a huge fan
of them finally adding
some more Joy-Con colors and I do like
some of the specific colors they're adding
I'm not a huge fan of them
still going about doing this
as doing two pack combos
with mixed color options.
I really wish they just
released dual packs
of the same color or just put
them all out individually,
but fingers crossed that's gonna be
what they do down the line.
Until then I'm just hoping
that at least that blue one
gets a singular release.
Now all this is also really
cool because it shows
that Nintendo along
with announcing the Lite
has renewed their commitment
to the regular Switch,
but that's also starting to leave me
with a few more questions regarding
what exactly Nintendo thinks of the Lite
and whether or not people
should actually grab one.
When Switch Lite was announced last week
I was very much hype about it
and a large reason for
that is because for me,
the Switch really is a
portable handheld console.
The option of having the ability
to connect to a TV is great
but it's honestly not
something I use very often.
So having a smaller more portable Switch
that's also going to be a little sturdier
because it's all one piece
and has slightly better
battery life sounded great.
But now that we also are
going to have a regular Switch
with full functionality
that has better battery life
than either versions it kind of muddles up
the whole message a little bit for me.
Now to be clear, anyone
who was super interested in
grabbing a Switch Lite because
of that smaller portability
and because of the reduced price point,
that still makes a lot of sense for you.
If you want to get it for
kids, makes a lot of sense.
If you don't like having a larger system,
you just want the
smallest option out there,
there's still a good
reason to change over.
But if your entire argument is just
which is the better system,
what is the better buy,
and what's gonna get
you by in portable mode,
well battery life is arguably
the most important thing
when it comes to portability
and so having a newer
version of the Switch
that gives you all that functionality
plus better battery life,
it makes it a much
harder decision to make.
If you already have a Switch
and you were thinking of
switching over the Switch Lite
that can still make sense.
I mean again, the only reason
why you were doing that
in the first place is because you want
that more specialized experience.
Now does that mean that you might instead
want to switch over to these new Switches?
That doesn't really
make as much sense to me
because again, you're getting
the same experience overall
just better battery life.
I mean, money wise to me at least,
it makes more sense to just
take that extra additional money
and put it into a battery bank.
On the other hand if you
don't have a Switch at all
and you were debating
between the two consoles,
things just got a lot more complicated.
It really comes down I think
to what you really care about.
If you want something that's
extra small and extra portable
and you want think this
may be a little sturdier,
the Lite still has some
strong arguments for it,
but honestly at the end of the day
I think the biggest one is
just that lower price point.
If instead you're willing
to spend the extra money,
it's kind of hard for me to rationalize
not getting the regular
Switch as long as it is
that refreshed model
with that battery life.
Because now it's not just an issue of oh,
I can't connect to the TV.
It's I can't connect to the TV,
I don't have visible
long use and portability,
there's just a lot more trade-offs
than we first thought
we were going to have.
I just find the timing of
this really interesting
because while again, I don't
think this fully invalidates
the Switch Lite, I think there's
still a lot of good reasons
for the Switch Lite to exist.
I think there is an
audience out there for it.
This certainly muddles
up the message a lot more
by also saying hey yeah, the Switch Lite
this cool new thing we're releasing
that you should buy
during the holiday season.
Oh, but by the way regular
Switches are still really cool
and maybe you should buy that instead.
It's a little all over
the place right now.
I'm happy it exists.
I'm just curious what
Nintendo's thoughts are,</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
