but I hear that 2018 will be even better
do you agree with this that is a very
tall order to fill 2017 has been an
insanely good year for games I mean not
even looking at just individual titles I
mean we got the 1x we got the switch we
got a new Mario damn new Zelda that
we're both amazing we got some of the
best JRPGs and just in general is here
has been insane so to say that 2018 is
going to be better is why I'm not saying
it's impossible and there's totally some
like great stuff on the horizon that
we've heard about but is gonna be this
year that's that that's gonna take some
work which kind of following that same
vein what game are you most looking
forward to in 2018 so right now there's
probably two games that I am most hyped
for at the moment and that's Red Dead
Redemption 2 and Soul Calibur 6
admittedly part of the reason for so
converse is because it just got
announced like what not even we go so
I'm still like writing the hype train
from that but read interruptions one of
the games I'm most hype for mainly
because while you know we had you know
GTA 5 which was great there's a lot of
other good action games no but old stuff
that goes on there are so few games that
touch on the western genre so to have
another entry in what is the best
Western game ever made is just something
I really need soon as for Soul Calibur 6
well I just love a soul cover franchise
and I thought it was actually dead after
a while cuz Tekken's basically been the
main focus but it's coming back and
they're actually looked like they're
kind of going back to the roots of the
older game while still mixing in some
new mechanics which I really like the
idea of so one of those two definitely
do you feel that other gaming companies
are gonna start making handheld consoles
to compete with Nintendo probably not at
least as far as like the major companies
right now goes I don't think anyone's
going to dive into making a switch clone
just yet if someone were going to maybe
Sony that is something they kind of
experimented with before with the
PlayStation Portable and the PS Vita
it's stuff they've done but it hasn't
really worked out super well in the past
I mean it has its dedicated fan base but
it is not exactly something that you
know flew off store shelves I think it's
possible
I really doubt Microsoft to do anything
about that I think they're really
focused on just making the living room
experience as great as possible I don't
think handheld is something they're
currently interested in but who knows
they could throw a curve ball because as
we've seen the switch is clearly
something that people
and want to keep using so yeah I could
definitely see someone getting the
competition probably Sony but who knows
and that's kind of the reverse on that
one both Sony and Microsoft have done
hardware updates for their platforms
recently the One X and the ps4 Pro do
you think Nintendo will do the same for
the switch in 2018 what your desires if
they do
I really doubt we're gonna get an
updated switch in 2018 seeing as how the
system came out earlier this year I just
think that's a little too soon for a
Nintendo to do a full new model version
it's not impossible
it could be something they did for the
holiday season but I think more likely
we're gonna see that in 2019 if we do
get something in 2018 it'd probably just
be some kind of special edition system
that might offer some minor upgrades
maybe a little more internal storage
something like that that's all I think
we'll get now if we do get a model
update in 2019 2020 whenever things I
would like to see mostly just changes to
the physical form to make it well better
you know maybe just making it a little
thinner improving the cooling a little
bit change the kickstand because I
really really hate that kickstand having
something that's actually functional
would be awesome and maybe get a little
more experimental with droidcon designs
I mean yes you could just take the old
row cons from previous system and slap
it on a newer model but if they're gonna
do a new model I think also changes the
controller design could be an
interesting way to kind of differentiate
and give people way to sort of halfway
upgrade what has been your biggest
disappointment in gaming this year this
is honestly probably like a common
answer but Mass Effect Andromeda not
because I even hated the game like
actually I kind of liked it or at least
didn't hate it as much as other people
did but it just was such a waste of
potential there were so many kind of
like just good ideas that kind of form
the basis of the game but then a lot of
it was squandered on being this rushed
project where there's bugs everywhere
there's pointless side quests plot lines
that go nowhere things that are just
never addressed it just there was so
much potential and it went absolutely
nowhere to become just a matte game if
you had to choose just one console past
or present you can use all of its games
which one would it be and why it's a
tough one but I would probably have to
say about the top my head PlayStation 1
a lot of games I really love are on that
system and while the SNES has a lot of
my other favorite games thankfully most
of those were ported onto the ps1 like
Chrono Trigger 5 and 6 before even some
games that we didn't get in the u.s.
that we got later through that so
yeah probably PlayStation 1 I'm
definitely losing some stuff from ps2
and from like well just PC gaming in
general but if just one probably
PlayStation 1</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
