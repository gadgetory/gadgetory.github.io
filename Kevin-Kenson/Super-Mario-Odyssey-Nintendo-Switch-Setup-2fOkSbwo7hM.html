it's time to race ourselves it's freedom
like you never knew
I'll be there in a flash you could say
my head is
jump with me have coins me welcome to
our super mario odyssey setup first
something think it's just a nice little
point is we've got a little light up
mario right here entering our piping
system they're actually holding this up
using this piece of clear acrylic sheet
which does a really good job of making
it look like it's floating if you're not
like right up looking at it to notice
that it's actually they're hanging in
space then it's going into our pipe
network which we actually made ourselves
we picked up some four inch PVC pipe
spray painted it with a green and set
all this up to create a nice little
border for our television as well as
hiding the stand that it's sitting on
now this is of course is all of our
old-school traditional mario stuff that
we want to show off but to get in a
little bit of the odyssey feeling one of
the things that I think really ties this
whole setup together is the set of
posters we have up above we've got one
of the major promotional images that was
a high-res and made our own personal
posters that are printed on three
separate sheets one of things I really
love about how it worked out in this
setup is that we're using those huge
strips you used before on the bar that's
coming out and it fills in the spaces
between them with that traditional
series red and a little bit of green
that just looks so nice
we wouldn't be complete without having
Cappy on top of our TV and then of
course none of this would actually make
any sense at all if we didn't have a
switch setup going on right here now I
love that we're actually set up having
the switch Doc's sitting on this end of
the pipe which originally we had this
idea in mind where we thought it'd be
really cool to run the cable management
through the pipes themselves but then we
realized that was kind of dumb because
we're the dock is relative the TV we
could just hook it up right here so
we're still using the pipe to hide it by
putting it behind but it's not running
through it great idea though if you want
to do something similar to this now for
the switch dock itself something we want
to do that would give a little more the
Mario style but also serve a functional
purpose is we grabbed one of these
covers right here off of Etsy now
there's a whole bunch of these you can
find different designs if Mario it's not
your thing they're Zelda and all kinds
of other stuff along there but the main
benefit of this is one give us a lot
more style to your dock but to more
importantly this actually acts as a
screen protector for your switch because
as some of you know if you're not very
careful putting your switch in out of
the dock you might end up scratching the
screen especially we don't have a
protector on it so this is a really nice
little thing to have if you just want to
make sure
and you're playing stuffing docked and
don't mess up your switch now as for the
joy cons that we're using to accent the
system yes there is an official Mario
red but with the coverslip we're using I
thought it just looked like a bit too
much so instead we opted to go with
these special custom Tendo ones that
we've gotten before which show off a
little more old-school Nintendo flavor
and look really good with the mario
slipcover you know something I really
love about Super Mario Odyssey that
really inspired this set up is the
fusion of new and old-school Mario you
know it's this new Mario game it has new
mechanics I mean all the stuff with cap
is this insane new fun mechanic that
opens up so many things but at the same
time it's tapping in a lot of the
old-school stuff - there's a lot of
elements from Mario 64 and even from
Bari over before that I mean there's
parts of levels or you actually enter a
2d world and play an old-school Mario
game in this beautiful 3d world so
that's something I really wanted to get
across in the setup we're getting this
mixture of Odyssey and classic at the
same
now before we the video I want to take a
second to think lacy for coming out
today's shoot in this video with us
thank you so much for having me yeah I
really think the music aspect is really
just put tied this video together so you
actually have a cover of the song on
your own channel if you can find you at
lacey johnson music on youtube yeah so

guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
