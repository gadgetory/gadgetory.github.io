the holiday season is in full swing
there's still some time to get some gift
shopping in and the biggest system going
around right now is the switch so
whether you know someone getting it for
this upcoming holiday season or they
already have one you want to get some
cool accessories we've got a list of
some of the best and coolest gaming
accessories for the switch a type of
accessory that's become very uniquely
big for this which specifically are
carrying cases gives you a way to
protect the switch right on the go but
also a place to carry any extra game
cards cables you need you can add a
little bit of a personal touch to your
switch itself now there are a lot of
these on the market but lately I've been
really liking the ones that come from
PDP they have a whole line including
this very basic one that I think just
looks really nice and trimmed but if you
want something that's a little more
all-out they have released a lot of
different Pokemon designs recently
because of Pokemon let's go including
ones for Pikachu Eevee just a regular
pokeball or my personal favorite that's
probably just a little too over the top
this Charizard case
they're colorful strong and the inside
designed in such a way that's gonna make
sure that the screen of your switch is
protected while you're moving around and
has plenty of storage space for any
little extra items you want to bring
around including things like thumb grips
and has little slots to carry any
physical cartridges you might own one of
my all-time favorite collectibles slash
kind of addiction from Nintendo are
amiibo and thankfully with the release
of Super Smash Brothers we are seeing a
lot more of these flood the market right
now including new ones like Ridley and
reprints of old classics like chic and
because there's so many more of them
while it's shopping online you might see
some of them be a little over priced as
resellers the prices are way more under
control for instance this animal right
here used to go for 80 bucks if you
wanted to find one nowadays it's
basically 20 if you're not finding it in
the store if you know someone who just
picked up Super Smash Brothers or was
just a really big fan of a certain into
no franchise like Zelda Metroid Mario
Fire Emblem there are a bunch of awesome
amiibo themed after them go for the hunt
they're awesome
speaking of awesome games you can play
on the go I'd like to take a moment to
thank today's sponsor brawl stars a new
game from super cell brawl stars lets
you play quick matches by yourself or
with friends that can take less than
five minutes you can do 3b3 games with
people in real time or even enter battle
royale modes solo or in duos there's a
variety of different brawlers you can
unlock and play as each with their own
unique play style regular tax and super
moves and you can even get different
costumes for each one so you can pick
the look that you think is coolest you
can also socialize with other players
including being able to join and create
your own clubs in fact I've made my own
Club it is the very simply and aptly
titled Kevin that's it
just Kevin so make sure to download
brawl stars try it out and join up
thanks again to Burrell stars for
sponsoring this part of the video now
let's get back to the switch when the
switch first came out one of my absolute
favorite accessories that was released
early on for it was a switch backpack
from PDP and it is still one of my
favorite ones however they've recently
upgraded and released a new option the
elite backpack so this is gonna be a
little bit bigger than their older
design it has all the slots you need to
carry your switch as well as additional
accessories but this one's also been
designed to act a little bit more like a
traditional backpack so it's able to
work both tasks really well including
having a sleeve for a laptop and
additional pockets for anything else
when I carry and it just has a better
your build is little classier looking is
worth noting that because this has come
out the original and has had a price
drop and is still an excellent pickup so
if you want to save a little money and
grab that or go all out to get the elite
one will have both link down below
either way awesome item the big switch
game this holiday season is Super Smash
Brothers and because of that game alone
we are seeing a flood of accessories
that are themed after the game and also
focused on one very specific concept
using a gamecube controller on your
switch now Nintendo does have their own
official option which is all fine and
dandy and all people probably picked up
it's a four port one lets you plug in a
bunch of gaming controllers wired but an
amazingly cool alternate option is the g
bros adapter now the benefit to this is
that while it only connects to a single
GameCube controller it's going to make
that a wireless controller so you have
to worry about having a cable running
across a room you don't have to worry
about using the switch in a docked mode
you can use it on the go in tabletop as
well and it's going to give you that
convenience of a wireless solution while
still letting you use your favorite
old-school controller to play smash if
you're looking to get something for
someone who just picked up smash or you
want to bundle something with smash as a
gift this is an awesome
outside-of-the-box option that I feel
like not enough people really know about
so keep your eyes open for this one on
the other hand if you just want to get
someone a Gamecube style controller
without having to worry about hunting
down an actual old-school game computer
or hoping they have one still on the
hand or trying to get one of the new
ones from Nintendo that sells out
constantly there are some awesome
third-party controllers that have hit
the market as well and my personal
favorite is power a especially because
they're the only one that offer a
wireless option and some ports note that
this is a switch controller shaped like
a gaming controller not just a flat out
GameCube controller but that means is
that when you're using the wireless
versions controller it's connecting
directly to your switch no adaptors
knowing like that and it's still a
wireless connection and it'll be usable
across any switch game making it perfect
not only for smash brothers but also
just for people who like this controller
design to use across any game they like
these also come in a variety of
different colors including black purple
and gray and even a game stop they have
some limited colors and silver and gold
so take your pick
they're all awesome one item for the
switch that could use a little spicing
up is the dog I mean yeah it connects to
your TV and lets you play games great
but it's pretty plain looking so if you
want to give
little more life to it check out these
docs from PDP so this is a dock that
connects to your dock you place it
inside but it adds a light on the front
screen that shows different graphics now
they have a couple different bundles
that are out this is a more recent one
they've release that's focused on
Pokemon it has this Pikachu one you can
see right here as well as a polka ball
design there is an older bundle
available as well that comes with a
Legend of Zelda and Mario Odyssey
options so if you like those games more
you want to get for someone's it's big
Zelda fan those look beautiful as well
the switch is a lot of fun to play on
the go but one downside to it is it's
not exactly the most comfortable design
so if you play for a long period of time
your hands are gonna start cramping and
then you're not really having fun
anymore so a really cool thing to look
for the switch is a grip now there's a
little different these you can choose
from but my personal favorite is the
Skull and Co grip designs this is
something it attaches around the body of
the switches gonna keep it all together
as one unit and actually comes with
different sized grips you can touch to
the back that also are available in
different colors when you pick it up you
can choose which ones you want so you
can have them match the droid comes yeah
for instance I'm rockin the Mario red
ones right now but you can also get the
traditional neon blue and orange or even
splatoon colors this makes it a lot
easier to play your switch for hours on
end without having any kind of
discomfort whatsoever
honestly completely change the handheld
game for me love it if you want a gift
that's a little more unique it has a
little bit of a DIY flair to it
something I really love are these
exchangeable shells for switch joy cons
you can also get them for the backplate
of the switch this is something that you
can either do on your own modifying it
for someone else to give to them or give
to them as gift and have it be their own
little DIY project but they come in an
amazing array of different options that
don't exist currently for official
controllers you can get these awesome
transparent shells and if they miss
having a d-pad on the controller you can
also get these shells that have a d-pad
option as well that works great I'll
admit it's a little bit of a risky gift
to do and you do run the risk of maybe
destroying a joke on the process of
making it happen
especially if it's your first time doing
it but it is possible to get it on your
first try without wrecking anything and
you can end up with some beautiful way
more unique joy Kahn's and you're gonna
see on the market
well the switch has a lot of great stuff
going for it one big flat has is that it
doesn't support wireless headsets so
there's a lot of adapters that vent
under the market try and fix this
problem and the best one by far is the
ganky so this is actually the first big
adapter that was announced and caused a
lot of other ones to enter the market
but this is the best one first off I
just love how it visually matches the
switch with the color designs on the
sides and will actually enable you to
connect to two different wireless
headsets at the same time one of the
coolest things about it though is that
it supports both aptX and AAC encoding
which means that if you're using a
headset that has those like Apple
earpods
you're gonna have a seamless experience
with no noticeable audio lag which is so
important for so many games if you're
going to spend a little extra it even
has a full kit option that comes with a
few little extra goodies including a
stand so you can use it in tabletop mode
a lot easier since this goes on the
bottom of the switch and has an adapter
so you can use it for the switch in dock
mode as well by the way guys the end of
the year is coming up really quick and
we've had a really good one so to help
celebrate with you guys we're giving
away a new Nintendo switch I'm doing
this with Jonathan Morrison at eld today
check out the link down below in
description our rules on how to enter
and get your chance to win it there are
a lot of battery banks out there that
will work on the switch however Anker
has a line of banks designed
specifically for the switch in mind with
a optimal charging speed to make sure
they're able to charge it up nice and
quick you're getting it multiple
playthroughs out of it it comes in two
sizes this is the larger of the two
either way though they're nice and
portable so you can easily fit them in a
bag or even a pocket and have them on
hand whenever you need to get that extra
little boost
for alternative option if you like the
idea of having an extra power available
but you don't want to carry around a
separate accessory or something in a bag
like that another great choice is this
battery case from on Tang so this is
gonna attach directly around your switch
and keep it constantly charged while
it's running instead of having be
something it to break out and plug in
here and there and a top off has give a
little extra features that are really
handy first it does add a little
protection to the switch because it
contains the entire body it has its own
kickstand built in which are way better
than the ones built into the switch not
only are they stronger but there's
pair of them so it's gonna be a little
more balanced on a variety of surfaces
and there's also a little carrying case
up top told any games you want to bring
alongside aside from what's already in
the switch it's not gonna offer the same
max capacity or charging efficiency as
the inker batteries but if you just want
to give someone an option that is always
gonna be attached to the switch it is
nice and convenient and add all these
other little perks this is a great
all-in-one option now if you know
someone's getting a switch for the
holidays or they haven't had one for
very long yet they haven't really bought
many accessories a major one that's a
big pickup for a lot of people is a pro
controller now there's nothing wrong
with the joy Collins they are
comfortable it's fine to use in a
handheld mode and if you're ever doing
kind of more laid-back relaxed gaming
they get the job done but once you start
playing stuff that's more competitive or
games that are just a lot more difficult
it might make you wanna tear your hair
out a little bit like Dark Souls a pro
controller is a great way to go people
who are more used to traditional
controller designs gonna feel much more
at home at this as opposed to using the
tools I enjoy cons which just doesn't
sit well for some people now you can
find the standard design of this pretty
easily and usually a little bit on sale
however if you're willing to pay a
little extra usually a little over MSRP
right now because of demand there are a
number of different special edition
designs they've done in the past that
look super cool this is the newest one
they've done for Super Smash Brothers
ultimate it's got the symbol on here and
kind of a silver design that's
reflective but I really like with the
white grips this is my personal favorite
but if you look a little further back
there's a couple other designs that are
really good-looking too like first
platoon and xenoblade chronicles - as
you may notice there are a lot of
controllers on this gift list but there
is one other type of accessory that is
very important to gaming and that's a
headset for the switch specifically I'm
a big fan of the Astro a-10s now they do
have this design across all the
different systems it's a really great
headset for its price point it's a wired
design but it's one of the cheaper ones
it's going to give you great audio
quality along with being a nice durable
headset and being comfortable at the
same time but most importantly for this
one is the switch version is this
amazing black and gold Zelda design if
you know someone is a Zelda fan you want
to get them a headset to go with it this
is an absolutely amazing pick up worth
getting for something that's a little
bit more of a stocking stuffer option
we've got these thumb grips from control
freak now control freak makes a lot
different thumb grips for all the major
systems when it comes to the switch they
folk
on thumb grips for the pro controller
because that is a little bit more of the
serious competitive one and this is
gonna make it a much more comfortable
experience a really important thing when
you're playing games is making sure that
you don't lose track of those sticks
especially in an FPS game and because of
these raised heights and different grip
design it's gonna make sure your thumbs
stay right on them and give you a little
bit more precise control on top of that
they also come in a huge variety of
designs covering different things based
on specific games or game genres or just
cool-looking color combos if you know
what someone's into or what kind of
colors they like you're gonna find a
style that matches them perfectly next
we have the Polka ball plus controller
for switch now admittedly this is
something that's a little bit more of a
novelty than a truly functional
controller because it only works for one
game pokemon let's go well to games if
you count the phone one that it also
works for but the point is this is an
awesome cool little collectible it's not
necessarily something that's going to be
the end all controller used for
everything you play but if you're a big
Pokemon fan or you know someone who's a
big fan this is a great little
collectible you're able to play Pokemon
let's go entirely using just its simple
little stick right here you can click
and it's got a button at the top and
even adds extra functionality of the
game including unlocking a legendary
Pokemon and you can store Pokemon in it
to take them on walks and help them grow
and like I said it does also have
functionality with Pokemon go on mobile
as well and it acts as the old Pokemon
go Plus accessories so it's kind of an
all-in-one
big book one fans keep your eyes open
