making the rounds what does it mean for
the older generations of Xbox like the
1s would they continue to support the
hardware yeah I think they would case
you to support it and how much and how
long kind of depends on what goes on
with the new system for instance will
the new system be backwards compatible
because if it is then ya keep making X
possible and games for at least another
year or two because you know all the
people that still own Xbox ones are
gonna benefit from that but you're also
giving this library of new games that
are still appealing than people buying a
new system they're not necessarily going
to be pushing it power wise but as long
as there's still great games why not and
based on how much the current generation
is focused on adding backwards
compatibility I don't see why they
wouldn't do that for the next system I
think it's more interesting to talk
about though is the fact that along with
rumors of a new Xbox coming out sometime
like 2020 there's also they focus on the
idea of Xbox focusing on cloud gaming on
string table games and if that's the
case I mean not only could we have a new
system as powerful or maybe even some
kind of cheap system that just
streamable games you could open it up to
the Xbox one as well giving this new
functionality where owners of an Xbox
one s or one X can play these newer
games through streaming it may not be
the absolute best experience versus
actually following a new console but it
would still give another use for these
current generation systems and just give
a whole new strength to the entire line
what are your thoughts on the upcoming
Super Mario movie by elimination studios
I don't know look to be honest I'm not a
huge fan of the mains movies this has
never been a big thing for me and so
something like Mario being in their
hands I'm just not sure and there's also
the fact that Mario is a really weird
thing to adapt into movies I mean
they've tried before and that was awful
last name Mario when you think of the
concept of you know oh we want to make a
movie based on Mario what do you
actually mean by that like what does
that look like what is the plot line cuz
Mario isn't exactly a narrative heavy
game I mean adapting any game to a movie
is always a weird process but something
that basically boils down to a guy runs
sideways for a while while jumping on
mushrooms it's a really awkward thing to
try and turn into an actual flow like it
could make for a really awesome short
film I could see that happening but like
a feature-length an hour and a half two
hour long movie I don't if I hopes for
it I don't think it's impossible I hope
it turns out to be something great but I
I'm not holding my breath
pineapple on pizza no no if Nintendo
ever added another character to smash
ultimate or made some DLC what character
would you want to see yes I did answer
the question last month but let's be
honest this is a question that I have so
many answers to we could probably do it
every month until the game comes out so
other characters we haven't talked about
yet one that was really heavily rumored
that I think would be super cool is
Simon Belmont from the original
Castlevania that was on the old-school
NES that was one of the games that
helped popularize the NES in the US and
we already have snake showing up in
Smash Ultimates that means that deals
are being struck with Konami so if
they're willing to hand even more
characters over I think that would make
an awesome addition and so many of the
abilities and play styles would easily
translate over to a 2d fighter so that a
thousand times another one that I know
is probably not going to happen at all
because there's already a costume form
for the Mii characters but I can still
hope Geno from Super Mario RPG it's
never gonna happen and I'm just going to
live with the fact that we just haven't
messed meat costume but it'd be so cool
what game system do you regret buying oh
yeah what's up Internet Kevin here with
TLD bringing you our review of the OES
what games do you think will be
announced this year or early next year
for the switch I'm hoping Animal
Crossing you and really this is actually
the number one question I got for this
Q&amp;amp;A was when is Animal Crossing coming
when is innamal crossing coming when are
they announcing it I don't know
but I think it is something that is
going to happen I mean as far as the
switch goes we've been getting a lot of
confirmed nail since for pretty much all
the biggest franchises that Nintendo is
still supporting the only ones that are
still kind of unheard from our Star Fox
and Animal Crossing so I think I don't
cross things something to hear about
there has been lots of rumors that
Nintendo did not announce their full
array of titles for 2018 there's still
gonna be stuff announced for 2019 of
course I think Animal Crossing is very
likely to be one of those and once again
there were those rumors about that
starfox racing game I don't think that's
out of the question yet we just don't
still have a hard announcement so those
probably be the two biggest things I
think we're still waiting to hear on
past that it could be anything at this
point I'm actually really hoping that
now that we have all these games for
their big franchises we maybe get a
couple or brand new IPs announced
because platoon was a great addition so
his arms now we just need even more what
are the big selling points about the
switch was its portability do you think
PlayStation and/or Xbox are going to
take portability seriously in the coming
years it's weird because to say that the
big benefit of the switch is the
portability is kind of a really simple
reduction because you know the 3ds is a
great portable system and it didn't blow
up the same way the switch did the
reason why the switch is awesome is
because it's that mixture of a home
console entertainment system but also
portable on the go it's more than it's
this mid point that adapts to both
styles rather than just the fact that it
is a portable system and whether or not
that means Sony and Xbox is going to try
and jump on the bandwagon with that I
honestly don't know because Sony has
tried messing with handhelds in the past
as what worked out best for them the PS
Vita while a great little handheld just
did not sell well at all I think a large
part of that problem comes from the fact
that a lot of their big first party
tiles just don't always translate the
best to a portable style system as for
Xbox I don't think they're ever going to
adapt doing some kind of handheld system
at least a dedicated one if anything I
think if they do go into sort of mobile
game market it's gonna be more focused
on that kind of idea we talked about
earlier where they're gonna focus on
streamable games and they're gonna make
it so that you know phones or some other
kind of handheld device can support
playing games that are streamed not
necessarily an actual dedicated handheld
system with zone games what is your
favorite indie game on the switch okay
so I've answered this question a couple
times in the past and normally what I do
I just rant and rave about shovelknight
for about like 20 minutes then we have
to cut it down to like a minute of
footage for you guys to actually see but
I'm gonna be different this time well
it's still a great game to other ones
that I want to shout out that are kind
of similar blood-stained curse of the
Moon which is a side game to the
upcoming not Castlevania game
bloodstained which is meant to be just
an old school style Castlevania from
like the NES era it is super fun it
captures the style of that kind of game
perfectly but at the same time
rebalances it and does some new
interesting things that just comes
across really well it's a really short
game and super cheap honestly there's no
reason you shouldn't just download this
right now another one hollow night
awesome game kind of like it a lot of
people make this argument of saying a
game is the darksouls of something but
that's actually kind of true for hollow
Knight because it is a 2d Metroidvania
style game but with a lot of dark soul
style tone not necessarily the
difficulty or gameplay but the setting
and the way the story is kind of
portrayed has that kind of style to it
and it is done so well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
