showing guys how you can switch out the
shell on your Nintendo switch with a
custom white body one around the same
time that we were shooting that video a
whole different shell designs started
blowing up the internet at the moment I
saw it I just knew we had to do a video
on and that's a clear shell for your
Nintendo
now if you haven't seen it yet you
should check out the white switch shell
replacement in before because it's a
little more long-form it shows a bit
more of my trials and tribulations as I
made mistakes but with the clear one
things went a lot more smoothly although
still the hiccup here and there just
like last time I started to switching
out the actual main switch body itself
which is super easy all you're doing is
taking off the back and keeping a few
parts for things like the kickstand and
the game flap but really simple you're
not messing with anything else just the
back part of the switch the joy comes
though once again are where all the real
fun happens now while I will say that
this did not go over a hundred percent
perfectly I did need to actually tear
these down one or two times because I
made a few little mistakes here and
there buttons had to be shifted that
kind of thing over all this to go a lot
more smoothly than did with a white one
I mean and got the whole thing done in a
fraction of the time as last time and no
missing screws this time thanks to not
actually doing it over carpet like a
moron
now one thing I was really grateful for
with this build was the fact that the
middle piece on both joy cons was
actually shaped properly this time on
the white ones I still had to use the
grey joint companies in the middle
because the triggers weren't acting
right but it wasn't that big of a deal
because the only thing we lost was
having a little bit of grey between the
two shoulder buttons whereas with the
clear one if we ended up having to use
that grey one instead it just would have
ruined the whole thing
and just like with the white switch this
one did come with button replacements
you can't have more Super Famicom style
buttons that are colorful and while I
did use those in this build I got to say
I actually think I'd like the plain
black look a little better on this I
just think that there's sort of this
monotone design to having this clear
shell and the colorful buttons can stick
out just a little too much and so here
we have the completed clear switch I
gotta say this thing looks fantastic
honestly I'm not a huge fan of how the
actual main switch body itself works I
mean I really appreciate the fact that
unlike the white one it doesn't have
some third party logos slapped on the
back switch just mucks up the whole
design but at the same time I think the
insides of the switch itself are not
quite as interesting as the Joye cons
because the Joye cons look freakin
amazing I think that's really just the
biggest standout part of this design and
it really makes me wish that Nintendo
got back into doing designs like this
for their official systems because
obviously this is not an official
Nintendo design just yet but they have a
history
doing this kind of stuff before you know
in the earlier years especially during
the late 90s when the main systems were
the n64 in the gameboy color
Nintendo messed around a lot with
different clear or at least translucent
designs for instance they did the atomic
purple n64 controller 995 gets you an
n64 in a second atomic purple color
controller free and the gameboy color
now as far as the mainline systems are
concerned like the n64 the n64 was
really the only system that Nintendo has
done this really hardcore oh is that I
mean they did a lot a different design
they've a whole line of different n64 is
called The Fantasticks which are just
varying different translucent colors
thanks :
now as for handheld Nintendo was
actually messed around with this idea a
lot more the gameboy color in fact
wasn't even the first time they did this
the original Gameboy pocket came in a
clear color as well and they messed with
the same translucent design on the
Gameboy Advance and then it kind of died
down for a while with the DS but it even
made a return more recently with the 2d
s getting a clear red clear blue and
clear black design that was exclusive to
Japan so it's really not that crazy to
think that eventually Nintendo could get
back into doing these kind of designs
for the switch in particular I mean the
2d yes translucent designs weren't that
long ago and while I think that we
probably are going to see something
where the back of the switch is gonna be
clear like this I do think the
possibility of getting translucent
controllers is a very real possibility
and it just looks so awesome I mean the
designs look cool before with like the
Gameboy in the n64 but the circuitry
inside was so much more simpler back
then I mean you see the layers of parts
going on inside of here it just creates
such an awesome looking device now when
it comes to this one versus the white
shell or any other custom shells you can
buy out there I definitely think this
one is by far the coolest I mean if
we're gonna do any kind of exchange like
this this is a great idea to go with the
only reason I would maybe advise
checking out the white one as well
though is because a you don't worry
about messing up any the insides and
then all of a sudden having a
weird-looking controller but also
because white is really easy to paint
over and reduce so if you really want to
get handy and kind of do your own sort
of unique design where you do your own
paint job your own logo or anything like
that
white ones can be an excellent choice
for that otherwise clears pretty easy
