about the switch is its adaptability
whether you want to use it on a TV or
handheld but if I'm being honest
personally I pretty much use it in
handheld mode a long time so a big
problem I run into that needs to be
fixed is the grip because while it's a
great little system with some awesome
games it doesn't have the most
comfortable design when you're using in
handheld mode so we're gonna go over a
bunch of different rip options that are
out there and which one is right for you
first we're going to talk about a case
that I have shown on this channel before
and that's the skull and code grip case
now this is by no means an expensive
accessory for the switch but when it
comes to gripped cases it is a little
bit more on the pricey side but honestly
I think you get what you pay for now
this is a case design that it comes to
the entire switches body so it keeps a
nice and compact together it adds a
little bit of protection but it's not
really the goal of the case it's much
more giving you the most comfortable
grip possible and one of the ways it
achieves that is that these little grips
right here are actually detachable
and there's two different sizes you can
use so depending on the size of your
hand or just what kind of grip you
personally find more comfortable you
actually have a little options as to
which one you want to use you can
actually buy them separately as well in
case for instance you get like just
right here with the blue and red and
decide later I'd rather get something
that matches like the splatoon
controllers you also have the option to
buy a special case that will pair with
this which does cost a little more money
but when the upsides of that is that
while this adds a little bulk to the
switch so won't fit in more traditional
cases that's going to give you a way to
fit the switch the grip and anything
else need to carry like games or some
smaller accessories really my only major
complaint with this case is that because
of its full body design it covers up a
lot of the buttons on the top of the
switch and some of them work fine like
the alum triggers but other ones like
the power and volume buttons they don't
really feel like you're actually hitting
a button they do work it just doesn't
feel quite right next up is the Meo
protective case now this is another one
that's in the very similar style as the
skull and cub one of the biggest
differences is it's half the cost so
it's a lot cheaper and it's still a
solid comfortable good case the main
areas where you really start to lose out
a little bit compared to the skull unko
is that it doesn't have changeable grips
well they are changeable but it's just
two other colors they don't have
different sizings or shapes like the
skull co does so if this main basic grip
doesn't work for you you don't have a
lot of options but one of the things
that is real
cool about this one is that the little
grip storage areas here pop off a lot
easier and you actually used to store
game carts as well so this gives you a
way to carry around two additional
switch games inside of your switch all
at one time which is really convenient
like the skunk Oh though this one does
still run into some of the same problems
where it's an all-encompassing case
design it does allow you to use the
shoulder buttons perfectly fine but it
does once again cover up the power and
volume switches which just don't feel
comfortable now along the same lines
another case that is on the cheaper side
and also still is a full body case is
this one from GTECH now an important
distinction with this one is that this
isn't really designed to be a cover grip
first and foremost instead it's actually
meant to be a protective case which the
main way it accomplishes this is the
plastic here is a little softer so it's
actually able to absorb the impact
instead just carry it through and it is
a little thicker compared to the other
ones it does give you a cover grip still
in the form of these kind of little
lumps here but it's not changeable it's
not any kind of different designs it's
just a slightly better grip than normal
now something I do really appreciate
about this case though is that while the
grips aren't quite as good as the other
ones you talked about so far this is the
only full-body case on this list that
actually gives you the ability to still
use the kickstand on your switch at
least if your kickstand isn't broken and
it doesn't cover up any of the top parts
button wise for the switch so you still
have access to the volume buttons the
power buttons shoulder buttons none of
them are covered by different things you
just use them straight up so it feels a
lot more natural changing gears a little
bit now let's look at some cases that
are not really well cases they're more
focused on just adding the grip design
and not really covering the entire
switch so something like this one from
satisfy is focused too much more on just
adding that more comfortable grip
without adding any extra weight or bulk
to the system this is not about
protection it's just about comfort and
one of the things that's really
interesting about the satisfy grip in
particular is that it's a little bit of
a different design for most switch grips
oftentimes the handles are symmetrical
in this case the right grip is actually
angled out a little more and the reason
being is it actually makes the grip more
comfortable specifically in situations
where you're gonna be using both sticks
very often by angling your head out a
little more you're gonna rest your thumb
much more naturally on the right
thumbstick so it's gonna be a lot more
comfortable for long-term gameplay I
will say though that in situations where
you're not really using the right
thumbstick for instance say a 2d
platformer and just want to
buttons on the left stick I prefer the
other group design more so depend on
what kind of games you really into this
can either be a big upgrade or just fine
either way it's still a comfortable grip
and like the Skull and Cohen I mentioned
earlier you can buy an optional case
alongside this one which will fit the
grip the switch and any additional stuff
you want to carry along with you as well
and then this brings us to the go play
grip for the switch now just like with
the satisfy one this is one that's
focused on being much more just a
lightweight add-on in fact this one is
especially your bare-bones it doesn't
really add that much weight to the
switch at all other than of course
giving you these little grips one of the
really kind of interesting things about
it too that the company pushes is the
fact that you can actually use this as
its own kind of stand it'll sit on a
desk fine without using the kickstand at
all but it still leaves the kickstand
open if you'd rather use that angle as
well another thing that also sets this
one apart from all the other grips we
talked about is that for the most part
all the grips have kind of just a flush
back design but with this one you can
see kind of a little divot right here
for your fingers to rest into it gives a
little bit of a different grip feel and
honestly I actually wanted to be really
comfortable I think alongside the skull
code this is one of the more comfortable
I have used now these sort of upside
downside to this one depending on your
needs is that this is actually part of a
forced bundle where it's not like an
optional add-on to get a case for it you
actually have to get the case thumb
stick grips and this grip all in one
package it's a good price for what
you're getting but if all you want is
just the grip you're spending a little
more money than normal
now all these cases are great for a
variety of reasons they each have their
strengths depending on what exactly
you're looking for how much you're
willing to pay but if you're wondering
what my personal favorite is I'm gonna
have to give it to the skull and
co.design I really like the grips on it
I like the case you get alongside it I
think it's a really well-made case
that's not a little going to be
comfortable but also protect your switch
a little bit it's just my personal
favorite you are spending a little more
but I think it's absolutely worth it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
