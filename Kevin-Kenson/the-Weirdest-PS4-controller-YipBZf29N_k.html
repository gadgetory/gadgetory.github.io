controller in today's video is.
It's been a little while since we've done
a weird controller video
and I think, you know,
for the lost time let's
make sure this one's
especially weird, so, I finally got the
opportunity to pick up one of my favorite
weird things I've seen,
the slime controller.
This is the HORI slime controller for PS4.
It was released as part of a promotion
for Dragon Quest 11 coming out in Japan
back in 2017, this actually isn't even the
first time something like
this has been released,
it's actually based on
a previous design that
was released on the PS2
in both a blue color
like this as well as a
silver metal slime color
that somehow looks even more
uncomfortable than this one.
So obviously this is a pretty
awkward looking controller,
but let's actually break
down what it has to offer
and what's missing compared
to a PS4 DualShock.
So to begin with it is a
fully functional controller,
it has all the buttons
that you need to play games
including a working touch pad, however,
it is missing a lot of
sort of the extra functions
that can fill out, you know,
the usefulness of a controller.
It doesn't have any rumble
motors, which doesn't
give you any kind of sense of feedback,
and honestly I really
wish it was in this thing
because it'd be hilarious
to see this thing just
shake around a table, I
wish we had a shot of that.
(roaring)
- It also does not have a
headphone jack, so you cannot
use any head sets with
it directly so you'd
have to rely on something
that connects to the PS4
directly like their PlayStation head sets,
that can work out, and it
doesn't have a light bar,
which is good and bad,
it's gonna make sure the
battery life lasts a little
better, but I sometimes
really like the visual cues
that come with light bars,
so instead you just get a
little tiny light right here
to let you know whether
or not syncing connected
and if the turbo function is on.
One of the really
interesting things about this
is despite its bizarre look the layout for
the buttons and sticks
is actually very close
to a standard DualShock
4, the distancing at least
between the sticks
themselves and to the D pad
and the buttons, obviously
the buttons curve out
a little bit, which is
an interesting feeling,
and the triggers are just way off.
These do not feel at all
like using a standard
DualShock 4 because
they're a lot higher up
and further back on
the body of this thing.
Also while it's not a
function of a PS4 controller,
there is a part of me
that's a little saddened
that this isn't any
kind of softer material,
I mean you just see this
little slime guy and
you think oh, maybe
it'll have a little give,
a little plush to it, no
it's pretty hard plastic.
Now one question you might
be asking yourself is
if it's a statue this way,
and a controller this way,
how do you actually set this down?
There's two options, you
could set it flat down
like this which isn't
great for the buttons,
or you can set it down
this way when you're
in controller mode,
thankfully though it does
come with an actual
display stand that protects
all the buttons, so that's
actually the best way
to do it because it gives
you a nice little way
to display it and make sure
this is all nice and safe
to use the next time you
want to play a game with it.
Now all that being said
I haven't actually spent
a ton of time really using
it as a controller yet,
so let's go hook this up and see.
(chimes)
- So one of the things
I'm noticing right away
is the dead zone on these
sticks is pretty ridiculous,
like you can go a pretty
good distance before the game
is actually reading that
you're pushing a direction,
it's not too bad for
movement at least in game,
but controlling the camera's
where you really notice it,
you can't make very small
adjustments carefully,
you basically have to hit all the way
to see it actually do something.
Something else I'm noticing too is that
while the stick layout is very familiar,
having the buttons and D pad
be off by just a little bit
on each side where it
curves in actually makes it
a lot more awkward to
reach for those buttons.
The front facing buttons aren't too bad,
but if you ever need to
switch between the left stick
and the D pad it just
doesn't feel natural at all,
and it's really easy to
accidentally hit the wrong
direction, which not a ton
of games have you switching
between stick and D pad a
lot but this is one of them.
And on that same note,
something else I'm noticing here
is that kind of in the same
way that the D pad is awkward
to switch between a lot,
the front facing buttons,
hitting X and square
and even circle is fine,
but if I want to hit
triangle I need to reach
higher than my hand
wants to naturally rest
with where the triggers are,
so I need to keep shifting
it up and down a little bit
every time I want to use
that button, which is a little annoying.
If you have like really
big hands it would actually
maybe be comfortable, but
I have to keep moving,
it's a little weird,
yeah this is one of those
situations where the controller works,
it's just there's a lot of better options
out there including the
one your PS4 comes with.
Spending some time with
this I've gotta say
aside from the dead zone on the sticks,
everything else in this
controller is pretty good quality.
The front facing buttons,
the D pad, the shoulders,
they all feel good, and
I think the thing that
surprises me the most
is that the actual grip
of the controller isn't that bad.
If you're just holding the controller it's
kind of comfortable in this
weird way where your hands
are just very relaxed
holding a ball almost.
Where is gets to be a
problem though is when you do
need to start hitting
buttons and doing like
intense button combinations,
just moving your
hands constantly doesn't feel great.
If you use this in a game
that didn't need a lot of
rapid button presses
like a turn based rpg,
like Dragon Quest 11, this
actually works really well.
I would not use it for anything else.
(chime)
- We talk about a lot of
controllers on this channel,
and I feel like you can
kind of group them all into
four very general broad categories,
there's the pro-controllers
that cost a lot more money
but offer all kinds of bells
and whistles and fancier stuff,
there's the cheaper
alternatives that you know,
get the job done and are just
meant to be a way to save
a little money versus buying
another official option,
there's the controllers
that try to achieve
some weird form of control
for better or worse,
and then there's the
controllers that just have
a concept they really want
to get across no matter what
and don't care at all
whether or not the things
gonna be usable, this is
in that last category.
And there's actually a whole
history of very bizarre
controllers kind of like this
that have been on PlayStation.
Like I said there was a
previous version of this one on
the PS2 in two different
colors that actually looked
even more uncomfortable
because the sticks were even
closer together which is
just a bit of a nightmare,
but going even further back
than that on the PlayStation 1,
there was a Wu Tang Clan
controller which was shaped
like the Wu Tang logo,
that was the entire shtick.
Also on the PS2 was a
katana controller that just
looked like a full length
katana that you could hit
buttons on and didn't
really have any kind of
traditional grip, and then
of course there's my all time
favorite that we have talked
about on this channel before,
the Resident Evil 4 chainsaw controller,
which is just a mess
but I love it so much.
There's a certain dedication
to this form of design
that I honestly really kind
of love, because again,
I don't think I would ever
recommend to someone hey,
yeah, you should grab this
as your next pro controller
option, but at the same
time this entire concept is
something that's really
meant to be a piece that you
show off on your desk
and then use in front of
people as a practical joke,
it's just so beautiful to me.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
