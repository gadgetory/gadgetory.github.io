wired controller continues and today
instead of doing an in-depth on one new
one we're gonna go over a whole bunch of
options at once starting with a quick
recap on the two we've already covered
from Horry and power a now for the Horry
one big downsides going on is the fact
that it's definitely not one of the
prettiest pro controller options plus
it's hardwired in there's no way to
remove this cable right here but on the
upside that has surprisingly good
buttons and sticks considering its cheap
price and while it doesn't have a
traditional d-pad it does give the
ability to switch between a d-pad
interface or just using buttons which
honestly I actually really like on the
other hand you have the power a
controller definitely a better looking
design and more comfortable grip I'm not
as big of a fan though of the sticks the
buttons feel a little worse and the
d-pad is a downgrade but still usable
overall still a solid choice and
detachable cable is really nice but with
those out of the way let's start talking
about some new choices first we're gonna
take a look at probably the most
traditional controller option and that's
the new core controller from nyko now at
first glance honestly this thing kind of
seems like a mixture of the major
downsides of both the Hori and the power
a you're getting this hardwired and
controller I really don't like the
triggers because it's kind of soft
design instead of being just an actual
trigger pool or a straight-up button
it's got a d-pad similar to power A's
which is usable but not great buttons
are okay but it does have a turbo button
like the Hori which is a nice upside the
interesting thing about this though is
the fact that while Michael lists this
as being $30 which is the same as the
other two you can actually grab this at
a lot of places for only 20 and like I
said it is worse than the other two but
honestly we're talking about third-party
cheap controller options the margins are
actually pretty tiny asyou getting this
for 10 bucks less is honestly actually a
pretty tempting offer next up we're
gonna get a little weirder and we're
going to talk about the poke and
controller for the switch now this is
actually just a new version of the same
controller that made for the Wii U if
you still own the way.you ones that I'll
work on your switch as well and before
we talk about the benefits of this thing
it does have some pretty obvious
downsides of the fact that you are
missing a lot of inputs here there are
no analog sticks whatsoever the Zia
see our buttons have been moved from the
shoulders to being on buttons right here
very clearly this controller is designed
specifically for pokken and mine so in
pokken it's great other games not so
much because clearly you're missing a
lot of inputs you need where it gets
interesting though is where you consider
using games that don't actually need all
these buttons things like Mario Cart
shovel knight games that are designed to
work on the joint con directly this is
actually a really solid option as well
especially if you like using d-pad this
is actually one of the better d-pad
designs of all the different wired
controllers and the grip despite looking
a little weird at first glance it's
actually really comfortable and grows on
you really fast if you're looking for
one wired controller it's gonna work
across all your games this isn't the
answer but if you like playing a lot of
simpler stuff something you can do
multiplayer in this is actually a really
good choice now for something really in
conventional a little more different the
rest on this list because it's not a
third party controller option grab but
instead it's using your game controller
on the switch and as at the end of
October when the switch launched it's
4.0 a patch a lot of people realize that
you can use this Wii U GameCube adapter
on the switch to use your controllers
which is actually really cool it does
have some downsides worth noting first
off the fact that like the pokken
controller you are missing some buttons
so depending on the game it might not be
all that usable in particular you're
missing a minus button because the start
button right here only works like a plus
button and you only have a zr button you
do not have a ZL so depending on the
game this could work either great or
terrible another way can be a little
awkward to the fact that all the buttons
are just a one to one comparison so if
it's an A button move it goes to this a
button if it's Y it goes to this the
problem is that since the button layout
is so different compared to the pro
controller some games weren't really
designed for this layout in mind and
it's gonna be really awkward but if
you're like me and you really loved user
than game controller you can take the
time to learn to use the thing and
honestly it works out really great
the big problem however is that these
aren't super easy to come by anymore so
until Nintendo potentially starts making
new ones to go for the switch
specifically it's gonna be a real hassle
Humpy's down so at the end of the day
what is the best traditional controller
option for this switch well first off it
needs to be said the actual pro
controller is going to be your best
choice it's Wireless you've got the NFC
reader motor controls all that good
stuff but if you're looking to save
money and you want to grab
one of these instead there's arguments
that can be made for each one you know
if you want to save as much money as
possible the Nyko forgoing only twenty
bucks is actually a good option however
I do think it's worth spending a little
more to go for the Hori or the powera
for different reasons the Hori is a
little more unconventional the shape is
different the d-pad is a little weird
for those of you that you know try it
out for the first time but honestly if
you give it a shot I really like this
controller they found the other hand you
want something that's a lot closer to
Nintendo's pro controller the power a is
gonna be a solid choice I still have a
couple hang-ups about it but it's a lot
closer and design it's got a really
comfortable grip both are gonna be solid
options for your switch</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
