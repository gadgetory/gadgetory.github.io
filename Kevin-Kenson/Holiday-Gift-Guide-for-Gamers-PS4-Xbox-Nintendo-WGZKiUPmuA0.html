friend that's really into video games
and you're not quite sure what to get
them well one of the first obvious
choices is of course a game it is the
holiday season and as such there have
been a lot of big-name releases
battlefield 1 titanfall 2 Gears of War 4
watchdogs 2 Final Fantasy 15 Last
Guardian the list goes on the problem is
you might not always know which exact
one they want or they have the impatient
habit of grabbing games right at launch
depriving you of the chance of getting
it so that's where all the other gifts
on this list come in starting with a
personal favorite of mine collectible
figures if there's one kind of
merchandise that is just booming with
gaming related stuff its figures and
there's a lot of different kinds and
quality levels you can go for for
instance if the person you know is into
Nintendo stuff chances are they already
have some amiibos they're built well the
price points aren't bad and they're
constantly going on sale so these can be
a good stocking stuffer or little gift
if you want to go for something not
Nintendo owned one of the biggest
collectible figures in the u.s. right
now are pops now to be honest I'm
actually not a huge fan of regular pops
something about their eyes just bores
into your soul reminding you of that
mistake you made 10 years ago were they
really knock it out of the park though
is there special edition larger figures
my most recent obsession being their
titanfall 2 pops featuring little mini
pilots that can fit inside the jump in
quality here is obvious especially in
its paint job in detailing making it a
pretty awesome gift for any titanfall
fan now if you want to go even more next
level without getting into big ol
statues then one of the best options out
there are Nendoroids
these are made by a Japanese company
called good smile and while most of them
are anime and manga focused there are a
number of video game based designs that
are seeing more and more distribution in
the West one of the coolest things about
these things is their modular design
most come with several interchangeable
limbs faces and accessories so you can
pose the character just how you want and
change it up every now and then
now--if figures just aren't the right
fit another option that I think goes
overlooked a lot is coffee table books
which there are actually quite a few
based on gaming an easy choice here is
of course art books lots of collected
arts from different game franchises have
sometimes as a collector's edition thing
other times you can buy them on their
own a great example would be the Last of
Us a pretty timely grab considering two
just got announced and if an artbook
doesn't feel right there's plenty of
Awesome books out there relevant to
gaming for instance the Hyrule historia
a book that chronicles behind the scenes
info on the Legend of Zelda franchise
including whole explanations of how
every game is linked or a more recent
example now you're playing with power a
companion book to the NES classic that
has little strategy guides for games on
the system as well as a documentary into
the NES is life and uses a lot of art
assets from old magazines advertisements
and instruction manuals now of course
another longtime popular option is
gaming themed clothing t-shirts hats so
on so forth but if you want to do
something a little more festive a little
more ridiculous you can of course get
holiday sweaters now you can get
something like this which is honestly
kind of lazy design it's just a regular
old sweater with a design printed on the
front what you really want is something
like this now this is a real woven
sweater with the entire design all over
the place not a fan of playstation boom
Sonic that was a messed-up pun anyways
though still not a fan of that Street
Fighter these things been getting more
and more popular every year so there's a
lot of designs out there I'm gonna link
some my favorite ones down below for you
guys to check out so all the stuff is
cool but if you want to grab something
that's a little bit bigger of a gesture
there is of course special edition
systems but the problem here is that
there's still not a ton of color options
and some limited editions are exactly
that limited as an already gone so if
you want to do something really fancy
there's actual companies dedicated to
selling and customizing systems and
other colors like this bright red Xbox
1s you see right here from color where
you can send your own system and
controller in or just pay extra for them
to send you a new system you could
choose colors for different segments get
different finishes and even design a
matching controller if you know someone
with a favorite color that just isn't
going to be an official system any time
soon this is a pretty badass way to make
their dream a reality and on that note
I'm actually teaming up with a good
friend of mine your average
consumer to giveaway this red Xbox one
