why I think the switch is a great
console one of the main things is its
adaptability the entire idea of how you
can use it handheld on your TV on a
tabletop this is just it is able to fit
a number of different play styles and
something that's been coming up lately
which even gives more credence to this
idea is that there's more and more games
showing up that are vertical now
obviously there's no games right now
that are purely your vertical and can
only be played that way but a number of
titles that were originally say arcade
releases like Donkey Kong pac-man Galaga
all these games were originally played
with an aspect ratio that favored more
verticality and so those games that come
to the switch give you the option to
play in that style and the only downside
of this right now is that there's not
really a comfortable way to really set
this up outside of using a stand that
holds the switch by itself in that mode
if you want to use it handheld it's not
really choice yet or is it there's been
a recent really popular Kickstarter
which gives people an option to use the
switch in a vertical style handheld
where it's a grip that holds the switch
tablet in a vertical style and has
little sliders to put the Joye cons on
and the only little awkward about this
is because most of the games that offer
vertical require you to flip the system
this way you end up having to cover the
volume and power buttons which is a
little long but you still get the
headphone jack at least which is
important so this is something that's
now at least become a Kickstarter that
people are really hyped for but we kind
of wanted to see if there the way we
could do this for ourselves right now so
we got our setup going on here in the
kind of simplest way we could figure out
which is using command strips probably
not recommended for long period use and
one thing that's a mainly a little
confusing is that the switch menu isn't
available in verticals so if you're not
already in a game this is a little a
little weird but now let's go ahead and
jump in and check it out
so the Namco Museum is probably one of
the best examples of a lot of games that
offer vertical supports there's a lot of
classes on here you can do so store with
little Galaga oh man this is it's kind
of weird to play in this style because
I'm so used to using my switch you know
horizontally obviously but at the same
time I mean I've spent time as a kid
playing Galaga and there's definitely
something to having the actual vertical
outline for like your bow the screen
you're using just as much space it's
just
different experience seeing it laid out
this way pausing as I think of more
things to talk about oh no I died I
should stop thinking oh god it's
actually really cool that they even
thought to include this as an option
because really how many people would
have liked without thinking about it
just been like oh yeah I meant sure my
switch sideways for a game that makes
sense but once you start using it I mean
this is definitely for this specific
game at least this works out better yeah
so it's not obviously using the entire
screen for the game still but you Devon
would be able to fit this same amount of
real estate using it horizontally yeah
so this is it's really interesting
trying out more games in a handheld
style using this vertical set up because
it's just giving you a viewpoint that
you don't normally get and a guy gives
games a different focus this is almost
something kind of like a 2ds because you
have like a two screen setup for this
game in particular or like with pac-man
and Galaga it's just vertically focused
which is kind of a really cool change of
pace now before we tried this idea there
was one other thought we had which was
to use one of the joy Kahn's still
connected to what is currently the
bottom of the switch tablet the problem
is is that you wouldn't be able to sync
a single joique on sideways like that
while it's still connected we needed to
be simultaneously connected and not
connected we want to read it wirelessly
which there's just as far as we can tell
right now not really a way to rig up but
it's also got me thinking what if we
could do this just a little crazier
before moving on to that craziness
though I want to take a moment to shout
out deeper in for sponsoring today's
video and supplying us with these
awesome skins for the switch they got a
whole bunch of colors you normally can't
get enjoy cons right now this is one of
my personal favorite combos the red and
white because it gives me this Pokemon
Pokemon vibe really awesome if you want
you to come out
there's link down below so using the
switch vertically in a head hub mode is
cool and all but why do I need to limit
it just to handheld why
use it in docked as well upside down yes
upside empty right now
options upside down okay there we go
there it is look it might just be
because I'm used to years of playing on
traditional displays but there is really
something about having this alternative
viewpoint like I don't know it just it
allows you to design games to the
different idea focusing on this kind of
sense of verticality instead of the
traditional widescreen look I kind of
love this set up with like a little and
one of our key to feel now with this
right just have these set up down here I
really like the other morphs which game
is embracing the idea of doing this
vertical design and I really hope we
actually sort of see some tackling of it
where maybe there's some games that are
just designed from the outset to only
support vertical mode because I mean
there's a lot of stuff three does then
there's already a number of mobile games
that important to the switch most of
those are horizontal orientations but
there's a whole lot of great ones out
there that are designed with a vertical
in mind and vertical video display is
becoming more and more common not just
because of games on phones but even more
videos I mean IG TV just launched and
that entirely favors watching things in
vertical like I said earlier one of the
big strengths of the switch is its
adaptability and I think there's more
that it can do than we realize so far I
mean yeah you can do TV and a handheld
that's cool but I mean we have games
doing vertical like this right now and
there's even more I mean we're seeing
intend to experiment with it we're in
Mario Party in handheld mode you can
line up two different switch tablets
near each other and that creates one
larger screen that is amazing and that
just shows more cool ideas of how the
switch can already give you so many
options and there's just even more than
Nintendo can explore</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
