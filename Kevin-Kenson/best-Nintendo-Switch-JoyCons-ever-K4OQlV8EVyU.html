of the things I was most
excited to get a hands-on impression with
was HORI's new Split Pad
Pro, mainly because it's
doing something that no
one's really done yet,
which is offering an officially
licensed, well-designed
alternative to Nintendo's Joy Cons.
This isn't to say there
aren't any other Joy Cons
that are out there on the
market, you can find some
and we've used them before, but
it's a little scary sometimes.
Because they're not things
that Nintendo's really
signed off on and they might
work when you first buy them,
and they might be really cheap,
but there's no guarantee
of how long they'll work
or that they won't damage your system.
So, getting a new option for
what to attach to your Switch
in handheld mode is really
cool to me and I love the fact
they went for something
that was very different.
And while it is a great first
step, it also got me thinking
about, well, what do I want in a Joy Con?
What kind of, if Nintendo
down the line did
some kind of Pro Joy Con or there was some
more expensive, awesome Joy Con option
offered by third parties.
What do I actually want
out of an awesome new Joy Con option?
Now I do have my own thoughts
of what I would like to see,
but before we get to that,
I actually reached out to
a few other YouTubers that I know
to see what they were looking for.
- This is my perfect controller.
Well, almost perfect, it's
the HORI D-Pad controller.
It feels exactly like an
official Nintendo Switch Joy Con.
It's just missing the motion
controls and the Rumble,
which, honestly, is fine.
I don't care much for that.
95% of the time, I'm
playing in docked mode
with a different controller anyway.
Plus, cutting out the motion controls
also cuts down on the cost.
You can get this thing for only $20.
It also only works when
it's attached to the switch,
because it doesn't have wireless.
But to make it truly
perfect, I want that D-Pad
to swap places with the thumbstick,
that's where my thumb naturally sits.
I play a lot of 2-D side-scrollers,
so having a D-Pad Joy Con
that I can swap in when
I'm gaming on the go, would be awesome.
This would also be a
great thing to have for
Mario Maker when that comes out.
If we're talkin' pie in the sky dreams
for the perfect Joy Con, then yeah sure,
throw the motion controls back in,
make it as expensive as you want.
Also, throw a fan in there
for my sweaty hands, why not?
Mario Maker exclusive?
I'm gonna be sweatin'
like a pig come June 28.
- I'd like to add that on top of the fan
for keeping your hands not sweaty,
I'd also want to Joy
Cons to be a little more
shock absorptive, because Mario Maker 2?
That's gonna make a Joy Con fly.
- Hmm, what is my dream Joy Con?
It would be so cool for
appearance if it looked
galaxy themed and the
buttons lit up like stars.
But, besides that, I think
it would be even cooler
if you can take the virtual
world into the real world
by having the Joy Cons
become either really cold
or really hot, or you could feel things,
or, I don't know, maybe
have it feel realistic.
So, whatever's happening
in the virtual world
it's actually happening in real life.
I don't know if that's
way too far out there,
but, yeah, how cool would that be?
- The temperature idea is
actually really interesting,
because one of the only
real ways we have feedback
from games is Rumble and
that's always been a big deal
when that was first added and
we've worked on refining it.
But there's not any other way
of adding reactivity to games.
So, that's interesting.
As for me, I actually
really like the direction
HORI started taking it
in, in that it's kind of
a more traditional
controller grip design shape.
It certainly makes the Switch larger,
but I really like that comfort factor,
and I think for being
a sort of fairly priced
alternate option, that's cool.
But if I'm thinking
something that's, like,
a premium...
- Premium!
- ...amazing Pro controller,
there are some cool things
I think we could add to Joy Cons.
First off, I would love
for it to be something
that does wirelessly
connect to the Switch,
along with being connected directly to it.
Now with larger controllers like that,
it's harder to use them
individually in each hand
and have that still
feel really comfortable,
it's just different physics,
but it would be really cool if
if it was a wireless Joy Con
connection that also just came
with a little connector piece
so you can put them together
to have a traditional controller.
Sure, you could have
these special Joy Cons,
along with the Switch Pro controller,
but I like the idea of
having an all-in-one option.
And as far as special features go,
having a button on the
back of the controller
is great, I think that's basically
just a standard thing now
that most Pro or alternative
controllers designs
should have, it's just really handy.
But something that I'm
always a really huge fan of
is the idea of modularity.
Which is something I think the Switch
already does really well
with the idea that you can
slot different things into
the slides, but I also want
controllers that embrace
that concept as well.
And there's some concepts
of this that you've seen
really come on a lot of controllers,
like having swappable
sticks, whether you want
a longer stick length
or domed versus concave
kinda designs for the stick head.
That's all cool, definitely want that,
but I also want that approach
with things like the D-Pad,
and on a slightly wilder
side, the buttons.
And when we're talking about
the idea of modularity,
I also really enjoy the
idea of being able to
switch up the entire
layout of the controller.
If you've looked at the Split Pad Pro,
you'll notice they swapped the
stick and button placements
for the right Joy Con, which
it's supposed to give you a
different design, that's
a little more familiar
maybe to PS4 controllers,
and some people prefer that
to the offset design that
you see on regular Joy Cons.
Something that Nintendo's
history has showcased
is that you don't always have
to rely on the traditional
four button front phasing set up,
I mean, it makes sense
for most controllers.
If you're only going to
have one button setup,
that's a really good one
size fits all approach,
but there are a lot of other
Nintendo controller designs
that are amazing for specific games;
a great example of this is
the GameCube orientation,
which people still prefer to use
for games like Smash Brothers,
or even doing things like
the N64 setup, where you have
more than four buttons on the front side,
so you have more options to work with.
This is something that really not a lot of
Pro controllers have messed
with yet and I think it's
a really cool, interesting opportunity,
because some games just benefit
from alternative setups.
Now, what's the likelihood
that we're gonna see more
crazy options like these actually show up?
I don't know, HORI is the
first actual, official option
we're now seeing and I'm
hoping it jump starts something
where more companies start to jump on,
and while I'm not super
optimistic about Nintendo
doing it themselves, it would
be amazing to get some more
first party options from
that them just further
explore making something
bigger and better out of
what the Joy Cons are currently doing.
So, there's some crazy ideas
for some dream Joy Cons.
