surprise something came a little bit
early for Microsoft the white Xbox one
elite controller so we're gonna unbox
this guy take a look at it see what's
different between it and the original
and kind of go for once again everything
you're gonna get with it
so it comes in this cool little pouch
right here which is just like the
original black one did it looks like the
coloring on this though is a little
brighter and even has a little white tag
so if you have multiple D controllers
easy way to know which one to put in
which case oh that's cool it actually
looks a lot nicer so there's a lot
different actually going on let's guy I
mean obviously the big obvious aesthetic
difference is it's white and they did a
full white design which I really like
you can see on the buttons right here
they've done a couple of white
controllers in the past like the sport
white and the winter forces and those
have white buttons like this but the
actual symbols are kind of a dark grey
this just keeps the whole thing white
which i think is a much better look and
it looks like there's actually been a
lot of little changes they've made to
the coloration to kind of differentiate
it just a little bit more and I think
work better with that white color for
instance if you look at the original
elite there's kind of just a simple
chrome symbol right here for the Xbox
logo is here it has more of a kind of
metallic sheen similar to the tallip
it's on here but just a lot more
reflective I also really like all the
lettering and marks on here for the
buttons like for the menu and select
Xbox up top instead of being just kind
of a metallic gray it has that same kind
of Sheen that the Xbox logo does which
is really nice
now one color they did keep from the
original release that I really like here
actually is the little green highlights
you get on the switches the sync button
and just a couple little notches on the
d-pad seeing it here I actually kind of
wish that they may be fully embraced it
just a little bit more I really like
this green with this white so maybe if
they did something like applying the
green to the anti-friction rings or
doing what they've done with some of the
like the grey and green controller they
have having it on the stick body I think
that would look really nice this is
still awesome I'm just really curious to
see what that would have looked like
with that little adjustment and then one
other area that hasn't really changed as
far as I can tell it's actually hold
these up side by side yet so the rubber
grips here are the same kind of dark
grey that we have in the elite
controller but obviously the visual
effect is a lot different because
this is kind of a highlight versus the
rest of the black body this is giving a
really hard contrast to the white that
you can't really see from the front too
much maybe a little bit on the bottom
but it does give it a really nice look
move back now just like with the
originally puller there are a whole lot
of different added functions and extra
little goodies that come with this
controller so let's check those out
we've got these full remappable paddles
on the back which you can remove if you
don't want to use them and these little
switches right here will switch our
triggers from being a full traditional
stop to being just a quick half stop we
also of course have at least by default
on the controller the changed d-pad the
faceted design which gives it a much
better kind of Rolly feeling to it
we have anti friction rings around the
sticks so that when you move them around
a lot it doesn't really feel like
there's actually anything that's rubbing
up against sometimes the normal
controllers you'll feel that a little
bit of resistance that can get annoying
doesn't come here at all and then of
course on the front of the controller
you have this little switch right here
that goes between one and two this is to
change between two different profiles
that you can have saved that you set up
through the Xbox controller companion
app now all of that is pretty cool but
there's a lot of extra stuff that comes
in the bag that you can add onto the
controller as well for instance one of
the things that really makes this thing
awesome is how easy it is to switch out
these sticks and d-pad so on the d-pad
we have that faceted design but if you
prefer you can just go to your carrying
case and bust out a traditional d-pad
that you can put right there and then
it's four sticks it comes pre-loaded
with these standard stick designs which
have a little clunky of head and our
shorter grip but you also have options
for a convex head that also is a little
taller really good to use for your right
stick and another concave head that has
that longer grip as well if you prefer
it then of course we also have the
carrying case for sure t-shirt off and
then a ten-foot long braided cable it
just does USB cable well in cable and
probably have to add a little bit
because it's not you know perfectly taut
there okay it's like it need to have
time for cable alright it's not we're
gonna say it tonight and then of course
you also get the carrying case security
looked at and a braided cable you can
use when you want to just play directly
wired to your xbox overall this is a
really really pretty controller I mean
you're getting all the same benefits and
strengths of the original Xbox one elite
and if you didn't jump on getting one of
those just yet this is an awesome one to
grab instead I think the white plays
really well with the other colors it
just has a really nice clean look and if
you're planning on grabbing the new
white Xbox one X or you're still working
with the white original Xbox 1s this is
gonna pair with it perfectly</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
