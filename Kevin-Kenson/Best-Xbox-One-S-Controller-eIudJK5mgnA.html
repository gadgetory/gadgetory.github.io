controllers and thought why don't I
actually open these up in front you guys
take a look at each one break down what
I like and dislike about them we're
going to start off with this green and
orange one right here now this list is
not organized by worse to best I'm not
doing any kind of ranking thing but this
one is the worst yeah I am just not a
fan so this is really similar to the one
that came with the battlefield 1 Xbox
one which is like a dark green I think
this is a little bit different I don't
think it's the exact same green it looks
a little more d saturated but the big
difference is that they added these
orange sticks to it while still having
the green head I do like the orange
accent I mean I think it brings it up
and elevates it a bit but still still
not a big fan of this one oh now this
one actually looks really nice this is
not the same as the one that comes with
the blue Xbox one if you're curious that
one's a little more of a teal it's a
little shinier maybe a little more green
tinge this is definitely just a
straight-up blue but they accented it
with a darker blue on the back same
thing where you actually have a
different color on the sticks and what's
on the stick head I was like the way the
buttons look where you have that same
kind of lighter blue for the letters but
then it's got this darker kind of grey
accent to it
this is actually a lot different than I
expected looking at the box I mean even
I don't know how well comes across on
camera but this is a lot more reflective
than this image here this almost looks
like sort of just a plain matte green
that goes to a dark area this is really
reflective it actually reminds me a lot
of I can't remember what they're called
right now but it's some kind of bug or
beetle or something that has those kind
of green reflective is thinking of
prisons cobalt anise also known as the
Blue Beetle it has an iridescent cobalt
blue exoskeleton and can be found in the
western United States and British
Columbia currently this is my favorite
of the group but we got two more to go
so let's see how those compare
this is the first in the line of new
controllers that Microsoft is releasing
but they still haven't actually shown
any other designs yet the main
difference between them is that they're
supposed to be military-themed and also
a little higher design quality than from
the others it doesn't actually have any
functional improvements over other
controllers but there's just a little
extra detail done I mean for instance on
this one you actually have this gold
etchings on the front also the grip is
different all these other controllers
have just the same standard grip that
all the Xbox one has controllers have
where it's just kind of a little rougher
plastic that feels the same but it's
better for your grip this actually has
like a little layer of rubber that's
diamond shape I'm not really officially
racing these but this is second
now this is one of three designs they've
release that all have a different
military theme kind of I mean it's not
exactly what would you call this it's
not really camo it's like is it I mean
with the hard edges instead of like
isn't it normally kind of like a blotchy
I don't know military things oh I think
I'd like this camo design a little
better with the two other designs I
think the covert one would work pretty
well I definitely think the armed one
would look better than that just plain
green one back there because once again
this is not an official ranking but that
one blast so then we have five actually
pretty surprisingly different designs
for Xbox one controllers that Microsoft
has released now let's actually talk to
some other people and see which one they
like that crystal so I know you're
working on a video that is a living room
setup and you're using the white Xbox 1s
in this so looking at these five
controllers which then kind of leaps out
as you would fit the setup or just
really like well I know it's one I like
as my favorite I don't know if it goes
my setup really but I love that blue one
right in the middle the ocean shadows
obviously like that's definitely my
favorite yes but I feel like this mess
is my setup more blue gold mmm
anyone makes your favorites here for my
setup probably this because the gold is
so fancy looking too
now I'm here with Whitney our resident
music specialist and let's see out of
what we have here what do you think
would fit really well it's like part of
an album artwork or you know also just
which one's your favorite really like
you know okay way mo okay well so
automatically a really drawn to that one
I like it's waiting I like like the
color gradient I think that's really
cool second favorite would probably be
the blue one just it was nice and bright
and I'd also speaking of album covers it
reminds me of the Ed Sheeran divide
album cover we're doing speaking of
divide you did do a really good cover of
that one which people can find on your
channel yes that's right in the club
isn't the best place the fun another
stood the Bacchus tango ralphing we've
gotten the same favorite pics like every
time in a row so I need you to break
that chain so two questions what's your
favorite or which of these is most emoji
my favorite we have to be this one here
this is a little gripped controller
it's what the Recon controller what was
everybody's favorite no man look they're
not professional gamer that's why
there's everyone's favorite tomorrow in
the office let me know what you guys
like down below in the comments and I'll
see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
