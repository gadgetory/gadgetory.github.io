way of playing your favorite games from
the 90s on a 1080p display but it got me
thinking what would it take for us to
make a modern day setup that would give
you the best experience possible on an
actual old-school SNES and to do that we
have to take a step back to the 90s
so obviously there is a lot going on
here so let's kind of break it down a
little bit
obviously I light up a little bit when I
said that this is you know all from 91
not exactly this monitor is which is
awesome this is a PBM from Ikegami we're
gonna talk a little more in depth about
why we went with this monitor choice as
opposed to you know a modern TV or even
other more traditional CRTs but let's
take a look at everything else in the
set up first
we are definitely mixing in some more
modern stuff right here because we want
something that's gonna give the best
experience with the SNES not necessarily
something that's entirely true to the
90s the first thing right away wireless
receiver for the SNES this is something
I've talked about a few times from 8-bit
dough normally I've done the ones for
the classics but they do make one for
the SNES straight up so you can use this
with a wireless SNES Bluetooth
controller or if you even wanted to you
could use it with say a ps4 controller
if you want to go all-out another thing
we've got going on wirelessly are these
speakers well I love using this CRT it
doesn't actually have audio out and even
if it did most of them didn't exactly
have the best speakers for their time so
what we're using is an actual Bluetooth
transmitter that we have the SNES
plugged into while the video signals
clearly going here and that Bluetooth is
transmitting to these speakers right
here giving some great sounding audio
for some classic games I think my
favorite thing we've done with this
though is how we're holding up the TV
which is this little rack system right
here now the functional use for giving
it is that we're putting all abreast and
yes games down here on display but more
than anything I think this really
captures that kind of classic 90s
feeling that I had in school where like
the best days when the teacher brought
in a TV like this I will now show a
short sex education film I don't know I
love the visual it also really works out
that the greys are like the exact same
aside from that we've just got a lot of
other kind of aesthetic stuff going on
to kind of match the full thing I like
the use of colors for some light blues
and pinks and then we've got the
classics on display both the SNES and
the European design which has the
Famicom shell and a top some Yoshi's up
top and of course these posters which
they just make me so excited
now let's take a moment to talk about
the television we chose to use for this
setup because when you're looking to
make a modern day setup that
incorporates old-school gaming systems
you basically have two different choices
to get the best picture possible hey you
can buy a really high quality fancy
expensive upscaler to plug into your
system and then put into a modern-day TV
and the upside to this is that you can
use that with a modern-day entertainment
setup no problem but it does run into
some issues for instance the fact that
you weren't going to be experiencing
latency that you would not get with an
old-school television which some of
these old-school games really rely on
the fact that you could just hit a
button and something seemed to happen
on-screen that exact moment that's why
we went with an old-school CRT and in
particular with this one from a Kagami
now if you've never heard of that
company that's because they never
actually made televisions for like
actual consumer use this is what's known
as a PBM a professional viewing monitor
this is the kind of stuff that studios
are actually even game development teams
would use while making games because it
gives you one of the highest quality
pictures possible and so this makes a
perfect fit to actually give you an
amazing CRT experience that you wouldn't
get with certain other models and it's
really the highest quality way to
experience old-school games now like I
said earlier this one doesn't actually a
video out which is why we're using these
speakers but it comes with a whole lot
of additional options as well where we
can do things like miss with the hue the
chroma all kinds of stuff so playing on
this thing is actually a really cool
experience because we're melding some of
the most appropriate old-school
technology to use with an SNES but at
the same time mixing in enough
new-school stuff to really give it this
kind of updated feeling you know we're
using the right kind of old-school CRT
so we're getting the best image possible
we're showing the games the way they
were meant to be shown back in the day
but we're mixing in wireless Bluetooth
speakers which are giving us way better
audio quality and not a mess of wires
everywhere we're using a wireless
controller setup so we're actually able
to not worry about how far away we are
from the TV which by the way a 19 inch
screen actually really helps with this
because while this may be small compared
to certain modern TVs this is actually a
good size CRTs you can play this from a
distance where you're still getting to
see the whole picture you're getting to
see some good detail but it's not blown
up so much that you're starting to see
the imperfections of old-school gaming
it just makes this really nice blended
experience for the whole
thing</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
