company that's been absolutely killing
it lately with their special edition
controllers and systems is Microsoft
Microsoft making it easy yeah they've
been releasing a lot of very different
and very cool Xbox one controllers so
many so that we've actually been
amassing a bit of a collection now we
actually show pasted recently in a set
of video which if you haven't seen make
sure to go check out and you guys loved
it this guy right here and if you
curious how we set this guy up a lot of
people learning what hooks we used we
actually the link down below the
description this video if you want to
check those out but I thought I'd take
the opportunity to go over some of my
favorite controllers out of this whole
collection and if there's any
controllers you guys love make sure to
let us know down in the comments first
off is the Minecraft Pig edition
controller
admittedly this isn't one of the ones
that I love for just pure aesthetics
it's more the novelty of it and what it
kind of represents from Microsoft
because this is one of the first
controllers they released where they
really started toying with having more
kind of fanservice he designs they had
special edition controllers before but
they were always over the top with just
designs everywhere and stuff plastered
all over and some of those were
cool-looking but there's a lot about
this design that's just fun especially
if you enjoy the franchise I mean first
off it is just a peg face on a
controller which is kind of cute but it
has a curlicue tail on the back of it
and even on the inside of the battery
case is a little carrot there's just a
lot of little things that go on with
this controller that's just very fun and
concept and I just think it shows a real
love for what you're designing instead
of just like oh we have to make a thing
that seemed after this throw stuff on it
next up is control that I do love the
look of and that's the volcano shadow
controller the shadow series is probably
one of my favorite lines that Microsoft
has done for their controllers because
their controllers that look great but
it's a very simple design as well it's
not using a lot of symbols or income
designs instead it's just having a color
that fades to black but also has this
kind of iridescent sheen to it that
looks really nice a close runner-up to
this guy is the ocean shadow which has
this very deep blue but I love the way
the kind of orangish red comes across in
the volcano and creates a contrast with
the black especially on the buttons I
mean the fade right here is great but
then when you have that little bit of
extra orange coming out at the top I
just love the look of this guy and this
is actually kind of my I guess you could
say daily driver for Xbox this is the
main one I use whenever I'm playing my
xbox one at the office or even at home
then we have the sea of thieves edition
controller
now I know we said earlier with the
Minecraft one that I don't like when
special additions to have way too much
stuff going on and thrown on them which
you would think it might be the case
with this one but honestly I think a lot
of thought went into design this guy and
there's a whole lot of stuff that all
plays into the theme really well which I
appreciate
first off this one is one of the
controllers that has edgings on it and
in this case it's kind of meant to be
like wood rot or barnacles and a hole of
a ship which is super awesome just like
when I kept on we do have a design on
the back of the battery case which is
the narwhals crossing their horns one
detail that I think a lot of people miss
on this controller which is really neat
is that around the analog stick is
actually a compass design and then of
course you have the logo in the middle
which is by itself just an awesome icon
for the series and while all this
together with the color choices makes
for a great looking controller I think
by far one of the best details of the
fact that all of this kind of greenish
spray teal over it is actually
glow-in-the-dark which is super super
cool next I'm gonna cheat a little bit
because this is exactly a standard or
traditional Xbox one controller but it
does work for the system so it counts
and that's the newly released versions
of the do controller these guys were
licensed by Microsoft have made by a
company called high Perkin and I'm
personally always a fool for anything
that's kind of a mixture of retro gaming
tech brought into modern day and new
stuff and that's exactly what this is
this is a remake of the old school duke
controllers which were the original
controllers for the original Xbox and
they were kind of infamous for being
gigantic and not super comfortable it
worked out for some people but most
hated it so they actually even replaced
it with a smaller design but I love the
idea of bringing that back and using it
on the Xbox one so this guy will hook
into the system you can also use it with
PC and it has been adapted a little bit
to work better for modern systems the
black and white button just do the same
thing as the left and right bumpers but
they also added left to right bumpers
which are still pretty uncomfortable to
reach for but it's just awesome one of
the coolest little things about it
though is that normally right here would
just be the Xbox logo but this design
it's actually a little animation which
is the old Xbox start up which looks
super awesome it's just a great little
attention to detail and once again it
just fuses that retro love with a new
controller it's just off
to actually use and then we have one of
the newest controllers revealed by
Microsoft which actually isn't even out
yet they sent this to me ahead of time
and that's the sport white controller
this one is very similar to design to
another series they have called the tech
series controllers withdrawal
military-themed but it's a bit different
it doesn't have some of the same little
extra bits those have those have edgings
on the grips and external symbols in the
middle
honestly I'm totally fine not having
those and just keeping some of the
aesthetic benefits which is this design
right here in little silver trim and
just overall the color scheme of this
guy looks so clean and nice I love the
silver and kind of great aesthetics for
the sticks and d-pad the white with the
gray and silver right here and then this
teal on the back just plays well with
all of it together making just a super
crisp looking design you know normally
I'm not a huge fan of super-bright
controller designs like this I mean as
you can tell pretty much everything else
I listed was very dark but just the
color combination everything with this
plus the silver just works so well
together</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
