question for this month is character
you'd like to see come to the new smash
so there's a lot that I would like to
see and probably too much to list
what's the matter Mario it's too much
for you but I think a general trend I
really wants you the next match it's
have a lot more third party crossovers
because I think we've got most of the
really big Nintendo characters out of
the way I mean yes there are some more
we could do there's some other esoteric
choices but I want to see more third
party crossovers because I think that it
leads to a lot of the big like moments
so the last game actually did a good job
of this because we had people from Namco
Capcom Square Sega all kinds of stuff
but I think we can do even more in fact
I would actually really love to see a
lot of indie game ones make their way
over like shovel knight would probably
one of my number one ones I'd love to
see I think Shantae would be a great fit
we could also get some other big-name
ones like Rayman from Ubisoft there's
just a lot of stuff I think could make a
really good crossover fighter that isn't
just the Nintendo characters is it a
good time to buy a ps4 Pro if you
already have a ps4 because a few days
ago there were rumors about the PS 5 dev
kits being released do you think there's
a chance of PS 5 being announced next
year
well first off as far as getting a ps4
Pro if you already have a ps4 goes I
don't think it matters when the PS 5
comes out because the main benefit is
gonna be that you can play those same
ps4 games but at 4k resolution I mean
you could hope that maybe a new PS 5
would be backwards compatible at PS 4
but Sony hasn't really been into that
thought process lately I mean the ps4
was not backwards compatible at all so
yeah if you have a 4k TV and the money
to burn everything burns it can be worth
it you get a better gameplay experience
but if you're happy with what you have
right now on the ps4 you could hold off
on it now as for whether or not we're
getting a PS 5 soon I actually think
it's very likely we'll get an
announcement next year and I wouldn't
even be surprised if we got some kind of
official hint at this year's e3 I mean
really the average lifespan of most
gaming consoles so far has been between
5 and 7 years and the ps4 came out back
in 2013 now yeah sure we got the ps4 Pro
and there is kind of a mid release but
that's still not a full generation leap
so I really think it's pretty likely
that we'll get a ps5 for 2019 or maybe
2020 at the latest I think it's gonna
happen do you think there's any chance
see if you use eventually comes to the
switch no
I love single-player action-adventure
games and yet everything is tending to
multiplayer online games what do you
think is the future of single-player
gaming honestly I kind of disagree
because I love single-player stuff - I
definitely favor single-player /
multiplayer I do a little bit over here
and there but definitely vespers here my
time is playing single-player games and
there have been a ton that have been
successful you know I think there's
always this kind of narrative going on
lately where people focus on all the big
triple-a games that focus on multiplayer
like Oh Call of Duty and battle for
knight and pub G but let's look at some
of the most popular games that came out
last year Legend of Zelda Mario
Rison zero Don near automata all
single-player games or have some kind of
maybe co-op option or you know I can
cuphead the point is all these games are
still single-player even this year with
stuff coming up I mean Far Cry 5 just
came out that single player with a co-op
option we've got God of War coming out
that's a single-player game there's a
whole lot of big-name titles that are
excellent and are still single-player
going on we just kind of let a lot of
the news cycle get dominated by all
those multiplayer games so I think it's
gonna go along just fine what are your
thoughts on Wii U ports for the switch
do you like them or not
also while on the topic do you think the
next smash is a port well when it comes
to Wii U ports honestly personally I
love them I wouldn't mind if my entire
wheel library eventually got ported to
the switch because at least when those
ports are happening there's some kind of
functional benefit going on you know in
comparison there's been a lot of ps3
games that got released on ps4 which
Shining your graphics yeah that's great
and all but for the Wii U to switch it's
where you know hey I thought this game
is really cool on my TV but now I
haven't handheld and that's really
awesome
now as for smash it's anyone's guess
this moment's all hearsay it's all
rumors personally I'm leaning towards it
being a new game I feel like the trailer
they did for it just felt too much like
a brand new announcement and not some
kind of like oh by the way reporting
this one - but I don't think that's out
of the question at all favorite Xbox one
game to date number one has got to be
cuphead I absolutely loved it not just
because of the gameplay of the channel
event but just everything about it the
music the visuals it just all tied
together in such a neat package I love
games that feel like a complete full
experience and that one just nailed it
perfectly after that I'd have to
probably say killer in
just cuz I like fighting games and the
fact that's kind of become the weird
crossover fighter for Microsoft is
really interesting to me but yeah
cuphead when we ever see cross play
between Xbox and Playstation maybe
honestly PlayStation doesn't really have
a reason to do it yet because they're
still doing really well I mean yeah the
switches too but they're not in direct
competition like Xbox is I think once
the playing does a little more level it
might happen but until then they have no
interest smash or Soul Calibur six why
you got to make me choose man they're
two different fighters entirely I mean
yeah you beat people up in them but
they're not at all the same it's I think
both the great yes I will pick both this
is my channel I do what I want</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
