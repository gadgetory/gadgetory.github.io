this year in Japan we see the release of
multiple home consoles and handhelds
that officially complete the fourth
generation of gaming systems including
the lesser known turbo Express the Neo
Geo from SNK The Game Gear and most
importantly the Super Famicom from
Nintendo which a year later would be
redesigned slightly for the Western
market as the Super Nintendo
now when the Super Famicom came out in
Japan it only had two launch titles but
they were both amazing and both of them
are on this year's list for best games
the first of which is of course Super
Mario World in many ways Super Mario
World simplified and condensed the
things that we saw in Mario Brothers 3
you could no longer stock up on multiple
power-ups the number of power-ups went
down only three and the overworld map
only featured traditional levels no
little minigames with toad at the same
time though World featured an overworld
map that actually connected multiple
zones rather than just being a patchwork
of different thematic lands it also
featured an entire hidden bonus world
for players that were especially crafty
yet navigating levels and it added one
of the series most iconic characters
aside from Mario himself Yoshi coming in
four different colors this cute little
guy gave Mario whole new ways to explore
levels including the ability to jump off
of him to achieve greater heights than
normal though sometimes this came at the
expense of sacrificing yo K himself top
all of this off with some of the best
visuals and most memorable music of its
time and it's easy to see why Super
Mario World was the highest selling game
on the SNES now like I said there were
two games that came out for the Super
Famicom at launch and the other one
revolutionized and kick-started the
racing game genre F 0 F 0 was the first
popular racing game to move away from
traditional cars and instead take things
to the future with some of the fastest
paced racing ever seen in gaming while
the game might appear super simple if
you've never played it before boiling
down just going fast and getting to the
finish line there's actually a lot more
depth
that each racer you could choose from
had different stats including
acceleration max speeds and toughness
with running an obstacle slowly draining
health possibly killing you with only
being able to do little repairs at the
start of every lap plus simply getting
first at the end of the race wasn't
enough every single lap you need to rank
higher than you did the lap before
making every moment of the race count
and not just the last 10 seconds f-zero
went on to have a number of sequels and
even an animated series and the game's
frantic futuristic racing inspired a
whole new genre of racing games so with
a Nintendo out of the way let's talk
Sega around the same time the Super
Famicom was being released and yet again
we had another successful Mario game
Sega was trying to find their own
character that could push to have the
same kind of mascot power as Mario and
in 1990 they secured the rights and
licenses to one of the most well known
characters in the US and worldwide
Mickey Mouse debuting on the Sega
Genesis Castle illusion starring Mickey
Mouse was a fantastic platformer and one
of the better examples of a licensed
game that didn't go horribly wrong the
game had Mickey exploring and fighting
through a number of levels using a
combination of popular platforming
mechanics of the time allowing Mickey to
defeat enemies by jumping on them or
using projectiles he had a limited stock
of like apples and marbles the game owed
its success to its fantastic level
design great soundtrack but most
importantly its visuals which were not
only incredible for their time but even
did a few things no other games had for
instance giving Mickey idle animations
turning him into a much more active and
lifelike character than other
platforming heroes of the time that
would just stand around like statues
shortly after it's released the game
also got an 8-bit version ported to the
Master System and Game Gear and a few
sequels were released years later
more recently the game also got a two
point five platformer remake that was
released in 2013 now fourth up on this
list is the sequel to one of the best
games of 1987 but sadly is another game
that we didn't get in the US until about
a decade and a half later and that's
Metal Gear 2 Solid Snake while the u.s.
got another watered-down game that was
metal gear and name only with snakes
revenge the msx2 in Japan got
sequel to the original game that laid
the foundation for the rest of the
series Metal Gear 2 had a large number
of upgrades over the original that would
continue to be seen across the entire
franchise after it made the leap into 3d
including the ability to crouch and
crawl underneath objects to hide or
silence your footsteps or radar system
that would show you where enemies are
relative to your location and enemies
that actually had peripheral vision and
didn't simply see in a straight line
making their ability to detect you way
more dangerous than before you could
also argue that this game's plot is what
inspired the rest of the series
with the iconic Metal Gear Solid on
PlayStation retracing the same steps but
with different names and implications
for the rest of the franchise Metal Gear
2 stayed as an exclusive in Japan until
it was part of Metal Gear Solid 3
subsistence and by extension the HD
collection released in 2011 now for last
on this year's list I saved my personal
favorite one of the greatest
point-and-click adventures ever made The
Secret of Monkey Island back during a
time when LucasArts still existed and
did more than just license out Star Wars
games left and right they also made a
number of successful point-and-click
adventure games Monkey Island being the
first to come out in the 90s
starring a witless yet surprisingly at
times genius aspiring pirate by the name
of guy brush 3-foot in his journey to
become famous and defeat the undead
pirate lechuck until was released most
point in flicks were focused purely on
the puzzles which served as a good
challenge for fans that kind of thing
but Secret of Monkey Island took things
a step further by injecting the formula
with storytelling and humor that made
the entire experience extraordinarily
entertaining
despite its tone the games puzzles took
some serious thought that put most point
click games of today to shame while at
the same time having some of the most
hilarious dialogue and ridiculous
situations giving players the motivation
to push onward in the game not just to
defeat its challenges but just to see
what's stupid or strangely intelligent
thing guy brush would do next
multiple sequels have been released over
the years including a set of games
released by telltale before they went
knee-deep into doing licensed
storytelling games while the original
got a special edition voiced remake
released in 2009 which is an absolute
must grab if you have yet to play it so
those are the best games of 1990 there
were a whole lot more classics that came
out that same year so make sure to let
me know down in the comments what your
favorites are as always guys thank you
so much for watching the video and I
will see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
