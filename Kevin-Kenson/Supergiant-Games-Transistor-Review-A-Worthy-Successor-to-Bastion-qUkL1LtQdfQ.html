my own channel now now don't worry I'm
not leaving techie tomorrow or TLD it's
just that due to things like scheduling
I haven't always been able to post all
the game reviews I'd like to and so now
I have my own channel to do that with
I'll still be posting things like
accessory reviews on TECA tomorrow or
iOS game reviews on TLD or if there's a
really high profile title I'll probably
post something over there and here as
well but this channel this just can be
focused on games themselves and to kick
things off today I'm reviewing the
second game from one of my favorite
indie devs
supergiant games transistor which is
available on ps4 and PC I personally
play the ps4 version for this review
now supergiant games is the dev team
responsible for 2011's big indie hit
Bastion which delivered an excellent
balance of visuals music and simple but
extremely enjoyable gameplay that could
potentially be quite challenging as well
so the big question is does transistor
live up to this legacy well let's take a
look at it and break it down first let's
take a look at the game's aesthetics
both the visuals and its audio now it's
very easily apparent that this is
definitely from the same dev team
there's a lot of things that are heavily
reminiscent to what we saw in Bastion
but there's enough changes and twists to
really make it feel like its own the
world is an interesting cyberpunk
inspired setting using a lot of darker
colors offset with plain white with more
vibrant colors used rarely to make some
things really pop out like the
protagonists red hair or enemy's eyes
well the music is very similar to that
of Bastion there's a noticeably higher
amount of electronic influence making it
fit a lot more with transistor setting
and make it feel like something new
rather than just a continuation of the
same in short aesthetically this game is
just beautiful there's enough
familiarity with the style from Bastion
to feel welcoming but with enough
variation to give it its own sense of
uniqueness
now another familiar the slightly
different approach in this game is its
storytelling which uses the same voice
actor as the narrator from Bastion but
now in transistor hasn't taken on the
role of the game's namesake a talking
piece of hardware that's shaped like a
sword the protagonist Red has lost her
voice at the start of the game and so
almost all of the dialogue consists of
one-way conversations where the
transistor babbles about events or what
you plan to do next well different it
does serve a very similar purpose and
storytelling and transistor does have
the important addition of having some
speaking roles delivered by other
characters the plot itself throws you
into the events really quickly with
little to no explanation and players
need to pay a decent amount of
do a lot of little nods and lines to
understand the full scope of the story
it's a tad too vague at times for my
personal taste but the center focus and
the major events of the plot still make
for a very enjoyable tale overall now
while the visuals and music and
storytelling are all very familiar the
nuts and bolts the actual gameplay are
entirely different creature while combat
can be handled in normal real-time as a
top-down action game players are able to
make use of a turn mode that pauses
gameplay allowing you to queue multiple
actions for a planned out tactical combo
with the downside of temporarily leaving
you incapable of fighting for a few
moments there's actually a surprising
amount of little rules to make use of in
the combat to gain the advantage using
some moves in order to get a special
combo damage bonus or just positioning
yourself behind enemies for backstab
damage what makes this really
interesting though is the game's
character setup system using programs
red can equip a number of programs each
of which can be used in one of three
different ways
serving is one of your four active
skills to use in combat as an upgrade
that augments how another equipped
active program works or as a passive
skill that offers some kind of constant
bonus one little thing that I really
love about this game is the fact that
each program is linked to a character
who either exists in the game's main
plot or its backstory and making use of
a program in all three of its capacities
can unlock biographical info to help
reveal more story tidbits it's not just
a cool way to help players and cover
more information but it's a great way to
push them to really experiment with all
the different uses of each program so
you can really get a feel for how you
want to use each one to complement your
play style now just like in Bastion this
game only has one traditional difficulty
setting which is fairly forgiving at
first but as you get farther you can
unlock these things called processes
processes are things that make the game
harder in some very specific way and
reward the player with a small boost in
experience kind of like the idols in
Bastion just playing the game with these
turned off will work fine for those
either looking to get into the scope of
the story and enjoy its aesthetics but
if you want to challenge then this
system is perfect for completely
changing up the experience from being a
lightly paced story focused game to a
really difficult tactically focused
action game now there is one big
downside to transistor that does share
with Bastion and that's its length one
single playthrough only takes about four
and a half to five hours six hours top
if you do all the different side
challenges and take your time reading
all the in-game bios now this is
remedied a bit this time around by the
fact that transistor does have a new
game plus mode which does
scale up all the difficulties so if you
want you can do a single playthrough you
just learn all the story and then really
challenge the game on its harder
difficulties in new game+ now an answer
to the question I posed earlier about
whether or not transistor lives up to
Bastion I can confidently say that for
me personally that it most certainly
does music and art are just as strong if
not stronger and the gameplay is
significantly deeper and more engrossing
once you learn all of its ins and outs
as I said earlier the story is a bit too
vague at times but never so much that it
sours the rest of the experience and
taking the time to read the game's
unlockable BIOS helps to solve this
problem as well
overall I'd have to say that transistor
is another must play with the only thing
holding back is whether or not you're
willing to spend $20 on it right now if
you're looking to just do a single
playthrough and that's it
then you might want to wait for a sale
but if you're the kind of person who's
gonna tackle it on new game+ multiple
times to get the most challenge you can
or if story is just that important to
you then it's easily worth it's $20
price tag
well that was my review of transistor if
