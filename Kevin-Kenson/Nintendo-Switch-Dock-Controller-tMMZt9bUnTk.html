things about the Switch
is it's modular nature.
There's a lot of different
things you can do
to change how exactly it works
based on the kind of controllers
or different other accessories
you're plugging into it,
and one really common option
that people have been trying
to make for it is ways to
turn it into an arcade system.
(upbeat music)
Now we've worked with a
couple of different options
like this in the past,
there is of course the option of
just buying a regular fight
stick to plug into your switch
while it's docked, and
that gets the job done
and is the most functional route,
but there's a certain
degree of fun that's missing
when you do that, and so
one of the other options
we've done that was interesting
was making a little cardboard
cutout arcade cabinet,
which was super cool looking,
you set up the two Joy-Cons
as little wireless controllers.
It works, but wasn't actually
that truly functional.
It makes a great little piece to show off,
but you're not really gonna
play any games that way.
Well today, hopefully we
found a strong midpoint
with the iPEGA Gladiator Game Joystick
for the Nintendo Switch.
And iPEGA, again, is a
company that we've looked
at couple products from in the past,
they are not one of the ones
that is officially licensed
for Nintendo, so this is
not like a normal thing
you're gonna find in most stores,
but you can order it
online and they do work,
it's just not something that Nintendo
necessarily fully condones,
which, by the way, one thing I
want to throw out real quick,
I love the fact that the box for this
heavily advertises
playing Street Fighter V,
which isn't on the Switch.
It's a fighting game,
and that would be cool,
but yeah, that's not a thing.
Anyways, so the way this works
is it acts as a little docking
station for your Switch,
it plugs in to the bottom of
your Switch in handheld mode,
and it's basically just like
plugging in a controller,
there's not any kind of cable or anything,
instead it just uses this USB-C cable
as the way to plug this controller in,
and it reads as just having
a plugged-in controller.
Now, on here you are missing
a couple of different buttons,
you do not have a capture button,
but oh well, if you just
have the Switch set up there,
you can still hit it
on the Joy-Con itself,
you also do not have a right stick
which, for the vast
majority of fighting games,
doesn't really matter, it
has a role in some titles,
like with Smash Brothers,
it's an easier shortcut
for doing smash attacks, but
not a thing you have to have,
and you don't have a D-pad,
which depending on the game
might be a loss for some
auxiliary functions like taunts,
but generally, as long
as the game supports
doing left stick controls for, you know,
actual fighting game
maneuvers, you're fine.
Aside from that, it does
also have the addition
of a turbo button which
is pretty much customary
in every single third-party
controller out there.
This does use the six-button
arcade style setup
where you have L and R setup
alongside the four front-facing buttons.
ZL and ZR are up top,
so depending on the game
you're playing, you might
have to mess with the controls
a little bit because, for instance,
in something like Smash Brothers,
you have two grab buttons
and shield is up here
and not super comfortable to reach for.
So, with all that said, let's go ahead,
set this up, and play some games.
So, we're all setup and good to go,
and it was pretty easy to do,
I just started up Smash Brothers
and put it on the dock and
immediately I could use
the controller fine, so that's awesome.
One thing I am noticing right
away that is a good thing is
I was a little worried by
the weight of the stick,
it feels very light when
you're holding it on its own
so I was worried that while using it,
if I would just gotten
really into a fighting game
and tried moving the
left or right really hard
with the stick that I might just send
the whole thing flying, and
that's really not the case.
It's got these little
rubber feet at the bottom
which add just enough
traction to the surface
that it's gonna stay where it is.
I mean, if I really wanted
to just shove this thing
and send it flying, I could,
but it's giving enough traction that,
just for regular gameplay
at least, and you know,
hitting buttons and moving
around with the stick,
it's not gonna shift around.
Now I will say, something
that is a bit of a downside
is it's a little smaller
than I would like,
I mean it's definitely an improvement
over using those Joy-Cons that we had
in that tiny arcade setup,
but compared to using
like a full-sized stick,
or even a smaller six-button stick,
it's just a little too cramped.
I want a little more room,
I just feel like I'm
really bunched in here,
and it's not the most
comfortable position.
I can still use it fine,
I can play games fine,
but for something I want
use for long period of time,
something a little bigger
would be really nice.
And that's really my only huge complaint,
and obviously, if you want to talk about
button and stick quality and comparing it
to a real fight stick, yeah,
there are definitely way
better options out there,
but considering how cheap this was,
and the main goal is just to create
this little kind of arcade setup,
it gets the job done pretty well,
but it definitely gets me
wondering what would the nicer,
more expensive version of this
controller would look like.
Honestly, I think this
is really neat idea,
and it fulfills a niche
that I think some people
would find really useful, but I also think
that there's a premium version
of this that could exist
that would be something truly cool.
First off, let's address
the fact that this is a dock
but not a Switch dock, it's
a place that you can dock
the Switch on to get the
controls, but that's it,
and it seems like this would
be the perfect situation
to make something that has
a pass through involved
so that way it could double
as a proper Switch dock,
either so you could
plug it into wall power
so you're charging the
Switch while using it
with this style of controller,
or even also including an HDMI out
so you could use it to hook it up to a TV
as well if you'd like.
And then there is again,
the issue of the size
like I was saying earlier.
This is perfectly usable, but
I think if it was something
closer to maybe the Hori Mini Pad size,
it would work out a lot better.
Something that's not gonna
be a huge fight stick
where it kinda gets rid of
the portability factor of it,
but something that's
just a little bit bigger
so it's gonna give more comfort
and feel a bit more natural to use
as opposed to how cramped
up this one can be.
Not to mention that, at
this small of a size,
it's something that you can kind of
put on a desktop comfortably,
but if you wanted to use
it like, on your lap,
forget about it, it's
not really gonna work,
whereas something closer to this size,
is designed to fit more in a lap properly
and that way you could play
in a more portable fashion,
instead of always needing
a tabletop on hand.
Of course there's also that concept
of adding arcade quality
sticks and buttons,
adding some of the buttons back in
that are currently missing.
I understand some of them being
gone, like the right sitck,
but if there was some kind of substitute
for the D-pad buttons and also
having the capture button,
having all that with that arcade quality
would make this something super awesome.
I think for how much this runs for,
it gets the job done fine,
and I don't have any
regrets picking it up,
but I just can't help but
imagine after using it,
what a really premium nice
version of it could do,
'cause I'm imagining this
portable arcade setup
that I can use on my lap, or
on a desk, or other places,
and not only have it for fighting games
but the numerous arcade ports
that exist on the Switch,
and even for things
like beat-'em-up games,
which it would be beautiful for.
This is still cool, but it
just makes me want more.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
