past couple days mostly because we did
have a Nintendo Direct just a couple
days ago but the most interesting thing
they announced was after that that
Nintendo is discontinuing the Nintendo
classic edition now this is baffling to
people for a few different reasons first
off the fact that Nintendo really didn't
give any explanation whatsoever as to
why they were discontinuing the system
it was a very Curt announcement of just
hey we're not going to make these
anymore if you don't have one yet you
should try to find one at the store but
we know they've been under stocked so
you probably won't sorry about that just
kind of a matter-of-fact statement that
doesn't tell us why they're doing it in
the first place it's also worth noting
that they're also cancelling the Famicom
classic edition in Japan although that
one had a slightly more vague
explanation saying that it might be
resuming sometime in the future it's not
exactly clear second the system hasn't
even been out for a full year yet and
third and really the biggest reason it's
been a success I mean these things have
been selling off the shelves like crazy
with not nearly enough supply to meet
the amount of demand that's out there
it's even been a scalpers paradise we're
seeing them pop up on eBay and other
auction sites well above MSRP which with
the system getting now officially
canceled you're now seeing prices as
much as triple for these systems so why
did Nintendo do this well obviously
there's no official answer to this just
yet but I had three kind of four
theories as to why they would though all
of them don't make entirely perfect
sense
then again Nintendo is company known to
not always make the best business
decisions theory one as insane as it
sounds is that Nintendo did not want the
classic edition to step on the Nintendo
switches Thunder the switch has been
selling phenomenally well and it's no
secret that down the line it's going to
have a virtual console like other recent
Nintendo systems where you've a
storefront and you can buy a handful of
NES SNES gameboy games saw and so forth
so if there's already this other little
system out that has your favorite NES
games on it you might not want to buy a
switch for Virtual Console because
that's why you would buy a switch in the
first place it's kind of an insane logic
reasoning but it's something that
Nintendo has acted on before now the big
Holness argument is of course if
Nintendo knew they were going to do that
with the switch why
release the classic in the first place
and if you did know you're going to do
this why did the classic have it's under
stock happening early on and instead
just flood the market and disappear as
soon as the switch came out it's just
not an entirely logical business
decision but once again Nintendo theory
- Nintendo is that vindictive it is a
long known fact that Nintendo does not
like people messing with their brands
whether that's modifying systems English
translations the games that only came
out in Japan fan-made games like Pokemon
uranium or just straight-up piracy and
of course to no one's surprise shortly
after it was released the Nintendo
classic edition was hacked and modded to
play the entire NES catalog rather than
just the small library of 30 games it
shipped with and there was something
that Nintendo absolutely hates mostly
out of fear that it'll affect the sales
of other systems now of course the
normal logic would be that this was
something that would inevitably happen
some people are going to do it but you
still have plenty of actual regular
customers that are going to buy the
system either way and sales will
continue but Nintendo has always been
very very vengeful in situations like
this and after seeing some people have
used the system take it away from
everyone else
now the third theory is the most
optimistic one it's kind of a mixture of
the last two but with the added idea
that Nintendo cancelled the classic
edition because they want to release
something better in the future maybe
it's true that they didn't like people
hacking the classic Edition maybe they
didn't like the response they were
getting from some consumers from how the
system was handled so they discontinued
it in order to work our project that is
an evolution and improvement something
that does offer a digital storefront for
expanding your games and not being stuck
with just the initial 30 something that
offers more than just NES maybe attacks
on SNES and original Gameboy there's all
kinds of things and it's something that
could be released at the end of this
year or sometime early next year but
once again that's kind of the optimistic
wish oh right
theory for then Tendo hates money</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
