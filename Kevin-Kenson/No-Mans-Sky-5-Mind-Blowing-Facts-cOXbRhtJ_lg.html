introduced to no man's sky a game that
promised a near infinite universe for us
to explore and since that promised a lot
of hype has been built up around it with
people's imaginations running wild with
thoughts of what kind of crazy
adventures they could have creatures to
discover and what strange different
planets they could find so now that it's
finally here the question is does it
live up to the hype
well here's five reasons this game is
absolutely mindful number one just how
freakin huge it is no man's sky contains
18 quintillion 446 quadrillion 744 m
what this means is every system you
explore is being generated by an
equation based on that system's code
which allows the universe to be so huge
but generated on the fly and this also
means that every planet is unique sure
you'll find planets with similar or
common traits but no two worlds are
exactly alike and this leads to point
number two this game is a dream for
collectors
if you thought capturing 800 Pokemon was
hard work this games got countless
species of creatures for you to find
every livable world is filled with these
animals for you to track down and
analyze but you can then name
permanently for all other players to see
and it's not just the creatures you can
name rock-types flora planets even a
whole system can be named by you if
you're the first to discover it and what
makes this even better is that the game
rewards you for these efforts giving you
money for everything you catalog and
even throwing a bonus on top for finding
every creature of a given planet and
that's not where the collectibles end
each world is also filled with monoliths
flax and alien ruins that teach you the
language of what intelligent creatures
you can encounter now a downside to this
is that the game is focused on the
journey of a lone wanderer and that's
exactly the feeling you're gonna get the
universe is filled with wildlife for you
to find but as far as civilizations and
actual people to talk to go it's
extremely slim number three crafting and
customization exploration may be the
main goal of no man's sky but survival
and resource gathering plays a very
close second every world is filled with
resources for you to harvest some of
which you may use to fuel your equipment
but others will go into crafting
materials and upgrades for your
multi-tool exosuit and ship and what's
really cool about upgrades is how they
take up inventory slots so you
constantly have to balance and customize
your loadout to fit your play style and
this all goes into point for death has
consequences borrowing the basic idea
from dark souls every time you die you
drop all of your resources and if you
want to retrieve them you have to get
back to that same location since these
resources are the lifeblood of
everything you can do in game from
fueling your ship to protecting you from
bad weather you want to hold on to those
desperately and what's even scarier than
that is losing your ship if your ship
explodes you're set back to square one
using the starting ship from the game
with terrible flight combat and cargo
capabilities this gives so much more
impact to every dangerous situation you
find yourself in making survival a chief
concern and finally point number five
freedom no man's guy takes a very
hands-off approach to how it introduces
you to the game the very beginning is a
bit linear covering basic topics like go
get so many of this mineral and repair
your ship but once you've done that it's
all up to you if you want to thoroughly
explore the world you start on go for it
if you want to see the rest of the
system you're in right away go for it if
you want to leave immediately so you can
hunt down you walk somewhere else you
can do that too
the game does have an underlying very
basic storyline giving you the goal of
reaching the center of the universe but
nothing's forcing you to do it
and really that's what this game is
about it's not about following a story
mode and putting in your 20 or 30 hour
investment to get to the finish line
it's about going your own pace making
your own journey and finding stories to
tell your friends</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
