little bit of catch-up today bringing
you guys my full review of Wolfenstein
the new order which is available on xbox
360 Xbox one ps3 ps4 and PC all the
gameplay are going to be seen here as
well as my personal experience is based
on the PC version now I'm gonna be
honest with you guys I did not go into
this game with the highest of
expectations there are a lot of FPS
titles that get turned out these days
and even though Wolfenstein does oh it's
named to one of the oldest in the genre
it's more recent servings haven't
exactly been memorable but this thing
completely caught me off guard and
proved me wrong this is an excellent
throwback to old school FPS mechanics
delivered in modern day graphics and
style now first off this is a
single-player only FPS game meaning
there is just the single-player campaign
and that's it there is no multiplayer
there's no special side missions nothing
just the single campaign which is
actually pretty rare for a lot of FPS
these days especially for a military
focused one new order puts you in the
shoes of the newest incarnation of the
longtime Wolfenstein lead protagonist BJ
blaskowitz in an alternate history
setting where the Nazis somehow gained
super advanced technology and dominate
World War two the game starts off at the
end of the war scene blaskowitz attempt
a mission that only ends up getting
travel stuck in his head leaving him
brain-dead and the story skips 14 years
later were through the sheer power of
nazi rage he snaps out of it is still in
somehow perfect physical shape and goes
on what is initially a one-man rampage
to form a resistance now the story isn't
exactly the game strong point but it's
not that terrible either
it takes itself entirely too seriously
at times and some bits of the plot just
get really strange but all in all it's
still solid and bearable which succeeds
in its main purpose of just giving you a
reason to blow stuff up and shoot a lot
of Nazis one interesting aspect though
is the game split plotline at the start
of the game you have to make a choice
that basically boils down to which
teammate you let die and depending on
this choice the rest of the game will
change a bit collectibles and power-ups
are route exclusive and while the
overall story remains the same some
details and specific events change for
each timeline as well giving the
single-player campaign a solid enough
reason to be played twice now where
Wolfenstein the new order really shines
is in its gameplay this is by no means a
tactical cover focused shooter even on
its higher difficulties but instead it
very much lives up to its legacy as a
run
gun experience over the course of the
game you'll get armed to the teeth with
a lot of different guns including the
usual suspects like handguns assault
rifles shotguns and marksman rifles but
if you other things thrown into the mix
- like a giant laser gun almost all guns
can be dual wielded if you find a pair
allowing you to fill the air with a lot
of hot lead though I'm a little sad you
can't choose to wield two different guns
at once if you choose to go with one gun
instead you're able to aim down the
sights for more precise aim and have the
ability to use cover for peeking out of
dis a flee knock enemies off one at a
time one thing I really like is how this
game rewards you based on your
particular play style there's a perk
system that doesn't use some kind of
pseudo RPG XP mechanic but instead just
unlocks upgrades and talents whenever
you accomplish certain feats in combat
killing so many enemies with a specific
gun or dispatching them in a very
specific way like power sliding the four
different perk groups consist of
focusing on using explosives and
grenades tactical combat using cover
with one gun out all-out assault combat
focused on do wildung and energy guns
and stealth which focuses on a silenced
pistol and knives for quietly hunting
down enemies one at a time now one thing
I really liked about this game is how
each level is designed to really
emphasize one style over another giving
you the chance to want to use each one
and really kind of adjust your tactics
based on how many enemies are facing
what kind of enemies and what kind of
train you're dealing with the only one
of these styles that did get a little
weird at times though was the stealth
basically as long as you're crouching
enemies are more or less oblivious to
your existence even in cases where
multiple people are in one room you can
stealth kill one of them
while the other is easily in earshot or
even looking in your general direction
and they won't notice a thing even guard
dogs seem to lose their sense of smell
and hearing as long as you're crouching
thankfully though stealth is mainly a
way to help get through certain specific
points in the game or to initiate a
combat segment and there's plenty of
times where all-out combat is your only
option for tackling large groups of
enemies and robots now one last thing
I'll not touch on the game is its health
system which actually goes back to a lot
more of the old-school style of health
and armor
rather than the more commonly seen
regenerative health model we see in so
many FPS games today there is a very
small degree of regenerative health that
does exist in this game but it's very
limited
you only regenerate up to the next
number divisible by 20 and after that
you have to pick up health packs which
can even overcharge you past your
regular limit though health will
constantly
reduce till it hits your regular cap
players can also pick up body armor to
act as a second health bar in an
old-school fashion what you pick up
means absolutely nothing other than just
adding to the meter did you just pick up
seven helmets then here's plus 35 armor
just wear some of them has really
awkward shoulder elbow and knee pads it
works basically the easiest way for me
to really sum up my whole experience
with Wolfenstein the new order is that
it's just very simple straightforward
fun FPS gameplay it doesn't have the
deepest writing but the visuals are
solid and gameplay is a beautiful return
to classical mechanics it's also got a
surprisingly high amount of content
relative to most FPS single-player
campaigns these days one run-through can
take as long as 12 hours of game time in
total and as I said earlier the game
leaves itself pretty open to a second
playthrough thanks to the split timeline
I honestly must say that Wolfenstein the
new order is an FPS title that any fan
of the genre should pick up at some
point
I don't regret spending the full 60
bucks on it right now but it's not so
great that I would say you have to rush
out and drop like you're playing right
now to buy it right away if you want to
wait for a price drop that's totally an
option in this case but definitely worth
playing at some point well that was my
review of Wolfenstein the new order if
you're interested in grabbing a copy or
for yourself right away I do have a link
posted down the description with pricing
and availability and while you're down
there there's this nice little nifty
button shaped like a thumbs up symbol
you should go ahead and click that too

much appreciate it now if you guys

got more content planned on the way for
