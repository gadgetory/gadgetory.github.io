of different setups lately we've done
ones including televisions gaming
monitors and more recently even a CRT
but there's one other option we haven't
actually talked about yet and that's a
projector
now before we get into the nitty-gritty
of gaming our projector let's talk about
this setup that we've got going on right
here now this particular projector from
LG does support wireless screen sharings
you can do stuff like you know send a
movie from your phone to it but for
something like a game system we're gonna
have to hardwire it so we've got an HDMI
cable running all the way from the
projector using some conduit to hide it
against the wall keeping it in the
corners and edges so that way the
cabling stays out of sight out of mind
and it's gonna keep the setup looking
nice and clean that leads to our setup
right up here which we're using this
piece of furniture to support everything
that we got from living spaces now this
to me is the perfect fit for this
projector setup because we don't want to
have something that's overly huge but
more importantly one something this can
be nice and wide so it fills in that
whole space beneath the screen otherwise
you're gonna end up with these awkward
empty spaces on either side that's just
gonna look weird so this fit real nice
now that HDMI cable is running all the
way to our sound bar which has a
pass-through
which is then going into an HDMI
splitter because obviously we're not
gonna be running multiple HTML tables in
the productor it doesn't even have the
inputs for that so if we want to be able
to support multiple systems like we have
right here we're gonna use that switcher
to give us a way to have them all
plugged in never needing to mess with
the wires and switch on command
now for the shtetl you'll notice that we
went with all white systems I think it
gives it a nice pop out of that dark
wood we tried some more colorful ones
earlier but just kind of got lost in it
so we went with the stock Xbox 1s that's
white the more recent special edition
white ps4 pro and while it's not really
an official thing we did do that shell
exchange on our switch to give it white
joy cons which just fits the whole set
up perfectly all of this put together
creates what I think is an excellent
experience for a projector style setup
because obviously you're gonna want to
do most of your playing when it's nice
and dark so it's gonna cause this dark
wood aesthetic to kind of blend into the
shadows well the system's really have
just a little bit of pop because the
thanks to their white finish but
ultimately the focus is what's happening
on this projector screen right here now
taking a closer look at the projector
we're using for this this is a new laser
projector from LG and I know what some
guys might be thinking well gaming on
projector seems kind of odd right I mean
things are gonna be really washed out
during daytime you have to wait till
it's dark you have a little startup
times a lot of stuff honestly isn't
really an issue anymore thanks to
they're now being
or projectors there's a lot of
advantages that they have over the old
school bulb ones first off you're
getting a stronger clearer image so you
actually can use it during the day it's
still definitely best at night where it
actually gets borderline looking like
you're just using an LED TV but at the
same time still usable you also have no
startup times no shutdown times it's
gonna automatically figure out how to
actually get a square picture you're not
messing around with the orientation
because you're getting these weird
trapezoids you still have to deal with a
few little things like focus but overall
much easier set up experience one of the
biggest strengths though is the fact
that while laser projectors are more
expensive up front you're actually
saving more money in the long run
because bulb ones are gonna burn out
every roughly 2000 hours of use whereas
a laser one like this can last up to
20,000 ten times as long so yes you're
paying a little more upfront but you're
not replacing something every year
instead getting something is gonna last
you up to maybe even ten years where by
the time it breaks you should just buy a
new one at that point now as far as
actually gaming on a projector goes the
experience is a lot better than some
might think I mean yes once again you
have to wait till it's dark if you want
to get the optimal use of colors and
clarity possible but you're actually
getting something that gives you a huge
screen to work with and at the same time
it's offering on average less latency
than a TV of equivalent quality so
you're getting a better gaming
experience on a bigger screen so there's
just something so innately cool about
playing in a home theater setup I mean
there's definitely arguments to the
benefits of using like a nice LED TV or
you know a good gaming monitor but at
the end of the day there's just
something so engrossing about playing on
such a large screen it just gets you
sucked into the game and it's just truly
a unique experience</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
