done a new switch setup we've tried to
come up with different ideas and new
ways to go about it but it always felt
like we were just missing something
different to tie it all together and
thankfully our buddy Chris from floor
eyes the guy that made our Xbox one
shelf a year ago approached us with
something he'd just finished working on
for himself that he thought would be
cool for us to feature so what have you
brought to our attention today here this
is like a switch stand setup deal it's
just kind of uh I guess what where it
came about was I used to always display
my video games around the house but my
wife wasn't super thrilled about it cuz
she wanted to display her stuff I want
to display my stuff so this was kind of
a way that I could display it but it's
still useful because these are actual
systems yeah you know it's not a
PlayStation 2 where I just have it
sitting on a bookshelf or whatever these
are things that we're still using and
that was kind of the reason that I
wanted to do that angled shelf so that
yeah I do play them but like 90 percent
of the time they're just kind of a
decoration and they're on display so
this yeah lets you see them and shows
them off a little bit more nicely so if
you want check out health for eyes built
this I've been pulling down below if you
guys check it out also we're gonna be
giving a switch away and one of the ways
you can enter in that is to watch that
video so don't miss out so first let's
talk about the system's incorporated in
this setup now obviously we have a
Nintendo switch but unlike for eise's
design of wanting to put it on top of
this mount we actually put it on a
separate stand over there so we can
instead deck out the top line with some
amiibos to show off and below those we
of course have the NES and SNES classic
now something that's really cool about
using these in a desk setup is that you
can actually not have to deal with the
annoying super short chords on the
controllers if you want to be a purist
use the systems as designed it's a lot
easier now but honestly in my case I'm
still probably going to use a wireless
receiver and play them all Bluetooth now
obviously aside from the system's there
was a whole lot more going on this desk
setup and a lot of it is themed off of
major games from the switch we're going
to start with the biggest of them The
Legend of Zelda breath of the wild
starting with this charge stand right
here now this is one that is branded
with Zelda stuff that looks really cool
but more importantly it gives us a good
way to charge additional controllers the
regular doc is gonna let you charge two
controllers at once but honestly if
you're doing a lot of multiplayer stuff
you're going to need to charge more
droid cons than that and on top of that
if you're using a pro controller you
need an easy way to charge that as well
without plugging in all the time so this
gives us a way to charge those
additional controllers no
now another Zelda thing we got going on
this is honestly one of my favorite
accessories we picked up recently is
this dock faceplate for the switch now
it's actually a dock for your dock which
sounds kind of ridiculous what you do is
you take the switch dock put it on top
of it plug it in and it creates this
light emitter that goes into one of two
face plates you can choose from one that
is led to dissolve in that we have right
now which I think looks better but if
you're a Mario fan they have Mario
Odyssey design as well that's also
really cool you can switch between
multiple colors you can have it do a
fade effect or constantly blink through
multiple ones just a really nice way to
spice up the regular switch dog and of
course no switch setup would be complete
without some amiibos to show off and
lately I have been loving the latest DLC
for breath of the wild so I just felt
like I really needed to show off the
four champion amiibos which happened to
fit perfectly on that top shelf that was
originally meant for the switch dog now
while most of this stuff is zelda we do
have little representatives for a lot of
other major games that have come out on
the switch this year on the charge dock
over there you'll see that we have the
green and pink joy cons which came up
for splatoon and along with those we
also have a branded pro controller that
was designed as a special edition for
Xenoblade to which Cheska man is
honestly a really fun game a little
rough around the edges but definitely
one of my new favorite switch titles now
of course for a desk setup the most
important thing that ties everything
together is well the desk and that's why
we went with this awesome design from
artifacts that I thought fit this design
perfectly you've got a couple different
things that really helped out with
accessories and setups we've got cable
management built into it that makes it
really easy for all the systems we have
plugged in at once you have a little
headphone rack below and something
that's really cool is you can buy
different kind of expandable shelves to
add to it which is what we have that
dock sitting on right now I also think
this was the absolute perfect color to
go with the set up because I think the
white top does a great job of
contrasting all the black accessories
for the switch and the woodgrain on the
legs is almost a perfect match for the
same stuff that four-eyes used for his
little switch docks setup right here so
just all together ties things perfectly
together</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
