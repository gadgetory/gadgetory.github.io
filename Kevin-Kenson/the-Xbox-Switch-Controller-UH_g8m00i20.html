switch controllers and normally when we
do we take a look at a lot of the big
name brands that have been pumping stuff
out and lately there's been a lot of
Wireless options like from power a with
a regular switch controller and a
GameCube controller obviously Nintendo
has their own Pro option Hori just
released one but something that we
haven't looked at yet for Wireless
options is just the dirt cheapest option
there is and so maybe she took dams on
and found this controller for only $25
that is still a wireless switch
controller now it is made by I honestly
don't actually know because it had
multiple listings on Amazon with
different companies associated with it
basically this is a chief controller
made in China it's the cheapest option
out there for a wireless switch
controller and we're gonna see how it
holds up there's a lot of interesting
things going on with this controller and
one of the biggest ones that you can
just immediately see is how much it has
in common with an Xbox one controller
and I don't just mean the sense of where
the buttons and sticks and everything
are placed are just visually this is
very clearly based on the original Xbox
one controller so much so that I have a
heavy suspicion that this controller is
either made using overstock leftover
parts from another third-party company
or that this same company once made Xbox
one shells and just decided to repurpose
them for a switch controller and with
this in mind there's actually a lot of
good that comes from the fact that it is
very similar to an Xbox one controller I
think the layout is very comfortable the
grip design at least in concept is
pretty good the grip shape on the back
does have this little kind of extra
rigidness to it that makes it not quite
as comfortable as it could be I wish it
was a little more curved and smoothed
out on the back but it's not bad and the
same level of criticism really applies
to a lot of what's happening on the
front of the controller the sticks have
a nice smoothness to them they're not
too loose not too stiff there is a
little bit of friction from the Rings
but not that much really
and the ABXY buttons well certainly not
the best I've ever used are far from bad
they're pretty solid the only part of
the front that really feels like a
problem is the d-pad which has this very
loose feeling to it and it doesn't have
a very clear feeling of registering any
specific direction where you run into
some more problems though are the
shoulders I don't like the shoulder
buttons they feel a lot like the
original Xbox ones shoulders which have
these kind of tab
that work fine at first but they wear
out over time and it just doesn't have a
very satisfying click to it and the
triggers have a very weak spring it
doesn't feel like it gives that much
resistance and it just it's not a very
satisfying trigger Pole honestly you
could almost feel how cheap the springs
feel whenever you're using them it's
just not great but there are some other
aspects of this that balance it out a
little bit for instance actually really
like how they repurposed some of the
additional buttons that he switched
controller needs the home button has
been moved to where an Xbox his home
button would be which makes sense well
the screen capture button has been riga
located to the top where a sinking
button would be which works out pretty
nicely actually I like having it out of
the way because I can't tell you how
many times I've accidentally taken
screenshots while playing games there's
also a reset button right here this is
not what you use in order to sync to a
switch the first time it's actually how
you reset the connection when you want
to sync to something new by the way if
you want a cool and easy way to
customize your switch a great option is
skins like these from today's sponsor
dbrand they make a whole line of switch
skins that are totally safe to use on
the system then they come for the system
itself joy cons it even for the dock
they have a variety different colors and
patterns if you want to come out go to
the link down below
now another critique that I have really
often for third-party controllers is
their weight I often times find them to
be way too light for my comfort and
that's not as big of an issue with this
controller since it's wireless there's
of course everything in there for
wireless technology but it also does
have Rumble motors as well which adds
just a little bit of extra heft to it so
it's still too light for my comfort but
it's actually better than a lot of other
options out there however these same
Rumble motors that give it that a little
bit of extra weight are also a problem
for the controller see there's a lot of
features that oftentimes get cut from
third-party switch controllers motion
controls which this doesn't have and if
see reader for amiibos which this does
not have and often times no rumble
feature which this does have which I was
really excited about in concept at first
but they're just not very good in fact
I'm not even sure if they're properly
braced inside of the controller I'm not
sure if this is a problem with the
entire line or if we just got one that's
a little weird but the moment I picked
it up I knew there was gonna be a
problem because I heard this
you could actually feel how loose the
rumble motors are sitting in this
controller and when they go off it just
creates this really crazy shake that
doesn't give the same kind of sense that
Rumble motors normally give to an
controller usually the point is to give
a little more interactivity with the
player and a sense of feedback when
certain things happen in a game but with
these it's just the same level of crazy
shake every single time that's more of
an annoyance than a useful sense of
feedback so after looking at all that
stuff in-depth how does it actually
compared to other controller options out
there for the switch not great but at
the end of the day that's not really
what this controller is about look I
would never say that this is as good as
a switch pro controller or even any of
the major third party options out there
I would easily take a power a wireless
controller over this one if price was
not an issue but it's $25 keep in mind a
switch pro controller is seventy bucks
MSRP although honestly you can normally
find a fertile more like 60 maybe 55
other third-party controllers usually 45
to 50 this is a wireless controller that
comes in at basically half the price and
with that in mind this gets the job done
I mean look if you want a controller
that's going to be the best controller
out there that gives you all kinds of
different little edges and performance
this isn't it but if you just want a
controller that is Wireless that will
work on your switch and not gonna cost
you very much money this works you know
whether you just don't care about
performance or maybe you want to get it
for a kid and you don't want to be
worried about whether or not they break
it I mean this is a pretty solid pickup
all that being said though there is one
other word of warning about this
controller that I find a little funny
because it's actually right on the
Amazon listing for it and that's the
fact that this controller works for the
switch for now as in at any time a
switch update could cause this
controller to no longer work now of
course they also say that they will do
firmware updates to make sure that it
still works for the switch but there is
that extra little layer of worry now of
how long will they actively support this
versus you know any major company that's
actively working with Nintendo so keep
that in mind that this is a cheap
controller that gets the job done you
just have to accept that some day it
might not anymore
