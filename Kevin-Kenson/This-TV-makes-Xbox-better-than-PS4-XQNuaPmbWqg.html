gaming setup upstairs and we've got a
recent update that is pretty cool so if
you guys saw last time we had our main
TV setup which we have all the cult's is
hooked up to and we've been using the
same Samsung TV for a long time since
our Xbox one set up and it was time to
upgrade and Samsung actually reached out
to us seeing that we'd use that one
before and offered us basically the
newer better super-awesome version to
check out which yes this thing is
awesome let's take a look this is the
2018 Samsung q9f and specifically the 65
inch model and before we talk about all
the benefits has for our gaming setup
specifically I really must say that just
in general this is a pretty awesome TV
primarily because it does a really good
job of just kind of hitting a great
balance of several different things you
need to worry about all at once it's got
fantastic colors deep blacks it looks
really good for both daytime and
nighttime viewing which is all great but
what it does for gaming is what really
makes it eight awesome fit for this
setup first off it's check marking all
the kind of standard stuff we're excited
to see for most consoles right now 4k
resolution HDR support and when you
activate its gaming mode it does achieve
an input lag below 20 milliseconds which
is the really important cutoff to make
sure that everything feels responsive
and proper and not like you're hitting
buttons things are happening moments
later ruining competitive play but
what's really exciting about it for
gaming and currently unique to Samsung
for this year's models is that they also
support free sync precinct is a form of
variable refresh rate technology that's
used by AMD and originally it was mostly
used with PCs that used AMD cards but
more recently and interestingly for
console owners is that the Xbox one s
and when X started supporting it earlier
this year the super simplified
explanation of what exactly free sync is
and does is that basically your Xbox one
or PC's graphics card is gonna speak
directly to display and tell it when to
actually show images when they are
completely drawn this solves two
problems first it gets rid of screen
tearing now this is something happens
where the display can't keep up with
what images the console is trying to put
out so as a result the top half of the
screen and the bottom the half don't
exactly perfectly match up causing that
little tear illusion in the middle now
this is something that traditionally has
been solved using vertical sync but the
problem with that is that it caps your
framerate which this does not do so free
sync is giving away two simultaneously
get rid of
while also maintaining higher frame
rates and also it makes us frame rates
appear smoother oftentimes if games can
jump between a lot between lower 40s and
50s this evens it out and gives it a
much more smoother appearance and that's
what's really cool about having this TV
in this setup because
freesync is something that exists in a
lot of monitors but when it comes to TVs
and actual living room solutions right
now this line of TVs is ELA that's
actually offering it giving you the most
out of your xbox so obviously we're
gonna have this set up we actually pick
a show and up and play a little bit I'm
actually checking out Wolfenstein 2
because on Eurogamer suggestion this is
actually one of the better games to kind
of mess with free sync on the Xbox
because especially in 4k it kind of
doesn't hit that 60 frames very well it
lingers more on kind of the 40 to 50
range but it looks a lot smoother with
free sync on I'm not playing very well
because I'm talking to you guys at the
same time this is this is a bad choice
for we're talking to the camera now
going back to free sync for a little bit
once again this is a feature that's
currently only limited to either using a
PC that has an AMD card although within
video you can get G sync and then Xbox
one you're getting this as well this is
something that no other consoles are
really supporting it you're not getting
on the PlayStation you're not getting of
a switch this is right now just on the
Xbox as far as consoles are concerned
and yeah I know you can't see it but
this really is smoother I was playing
this before on the 1x and Wow
looks pretty I was definitely
disappointed initially in the framerate
and how it looked and while this still
isn't you know true 60 frames this looks
a lot better so with the addition of
this TV there's a couple things that are
gonna have to change a little bit with
this setup because one of the big
differences between it and then when we
had before is that the rest on it sits a
lot lower so before when we displayed
all of our systems we were able to kind
of fit the Xbox one right in the middle
here with the PlayStation and switch on
either side of it this one's a lot lower
so we can't actually fit anything there
so instead right now we have the Xbox
one and the ps4 hooked up we don't have
a place for the switch stock just yet at
least somewhere that's visually
satisfying to me I mean you could put it
wherever we want but I want to look good
on display so we have to figure that out
what part of this TV that does help with
that situation though is that it does
have a breakout box and what that is is
it just has one cable leading from the
TV which then we have set up down below
and the box there
couple over HDMI optical all that kind
of stuff so that helps make sure that
it's not much easier to manage all the
cables so there's a couple of other
additions and changes are going on with
this setup as well you'll see that in
front of the TV we also have a sound bar
now here which is also from Samsung and
is designed to kind of go alongside with
this TV it also has its own dedicated
gaming mode which is really awesome and
on the back wall we've got our Xbox
controllers and display
we have a few new additions that
Microsoft just announced the coolest of
the two is this guy right here the
Phantom black controller which we've
actually done a video before about how
we wanted more transparent controller
designs from Microsoft which they didn't
have any yet and now we do but on top of
being transparent it's actually this
kind of fade design which looks really
really awesome also on the back wall
currently setup is the other new
controller the gray and blue which
should really just be called gray in
teal a really nice clean look as well so
to kind of get the best out of it and
really see that difference to how smooth
it looks free sink really helps I it's
so bad right now I'm talking at the same
time one more time or I don't die while
I'm talking</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
