system well when it comes to multimedia
use and other apps it's kind of handicap
to the moment buy a Nintendo and so we
kind of got the thought of what stuff
could we make it do that Nintendo
doesn't really want you to do yet and of
all the things we tried I think one of
the most interesting was uber so the way
this actually works is a little
different we did last time back then one
of the exploits was to go to your social
network settings and go to like Facebook
and there was a weird way to turn that
into a browser instead something we've
actually discovered since then is
someone's basically may hit a server for
activating the switch browser so what
you do that is by going to your system
settings going into the internet
settings which when I go to right now go
to that changer settings and then you're
gonna go to your dns settings for what
server it's contacting instead of
automatic you do manual and you input
the one I'm gonna put it in right now
so once you've got that updated in your
settings you just tell it to save try to
connect and when you initially do it
it's gonna give you an error saying that
you need to be registered to use it but
what it's gonna doing is pull up a new
page that you go to that enables you to
use a Google browser on your switch and
finally once it's done loading we end up
on this landing page right here now
there's a couple options here like being
able to go to Google or even just go to
specific URLs and that's really
interesting because this really opens up
a lot of possibilities what you could
potentially do with your switch it is
extremely handicapped there are a lot of
things that will not work on it but this
certainly starts to open the door that
previously well just wasn't there at all
in your switch now in this case we're
going to Oberer we're gonna actually go
to the mobile version of the site and
boom we get the mobile interface for
uber like I said we don't location
services so people can't actually
pinpoint our location but instead with
the mobile version you can specify a
pickup address so that's what we're
gonna do me whatever well set up a won't
do and where we want to go and then
after you've done that all you need to
do is log into your account a strange
thing that happens there is after you've
successfully logged in you just get a
blank page and it seems like it's not
working but then you just back out of
everything even before where the login
page was and you're back to the main
interface logged in and good to go okay
so now we've explained how this whole
thing works let's go ahead and see if it
actually works
what's the address we wanted to use that
one and now we wait for it to log me in
I think I think that work has just said
yep a new device site in I wonder if
they're winning like wait what the hell
is that
I wonder what it shows up at like on
their database I confirmed it I don't
know if this is coming out of my pocket
or the business cuz I didn't check
so hopefully business and he'll be here
in three minutes it looks like it worked
that's wait and see also it is like the
actual updating map like I'm seeing the
car on its way so even though it does
have location services it knows where to
pick us up so I'm seeing the full thing
and it looks like he's gonna be here
really quick actually it says two
minutes now but they're already turning
on the street I think that's him said I
thought a Ford Fusion looks like right
the best build American cars have you
driven aboard and it worked
hi how are you doing they were good yeah
we're actually shooting i order you
using a switch yeah we found a way to do
it through this little eye kinda hidden
browser thing so just kind of trying
stuff out recording it now the whole
point of this exercise isn't just to be
like oh look at this weird dumb crazy
thing we found you can do on the switch
it's to highlight the fact the switch
has a lot more capabilities and
potential than Nintendo is really
allowing it to have right now I mean yes
first and foremost it is a gaming system
as it should be but that doesn't mean
that it can't have support for a whole
lot of other apps and utilities to open
it up a little bit I mean it is after
all basically a tablet just really
focused on gaming so imagine if you ever
had the ability to play the games you
like playing on the switch but at the
same time you're able to take a step
back and open up other things like media
streaming apps which we do have Hulu for
now and it would be cool to have more
than that but to top that off even other
useful things imagine be able to go on
Yelp for uber or even just order food on
it that'd be awesome</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
