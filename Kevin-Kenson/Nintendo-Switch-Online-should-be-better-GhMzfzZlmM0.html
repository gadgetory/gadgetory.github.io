shedding some light on their Nintendo
switch online service something we've
been waiting a long time for in fall and
considering the fact that it now is
coming out well less than a week from
now and the info we got was initially
pretty cool sounding but there's a lot
of fine print that's sounding a little
bit rough now before we start getting
into some of the problems with it and
things that Nintendo can improve upon
let's give some credit where it's due
right away with one of the biggest
strengths that has affordability paid
online services for gaming consoles are
kind of a weird subject for some people
this last decade because some people
view it as a necessary thing you have to
pay for that make sure servers are
running nice and smoothly other people
view it as an unnecessary ingredient way
though I think you can kind of groove at
least looking at the online service this
is one of the most fairly priced
introductory wise whereas for
PlayStation next box you're spending at
minimum $60 a year if you're doing the
cheapest package possible switch online
is only costing $20 for a full year
which is pretty easy to do and even when
you break it down to some of the more
expensive packages like paying
month-to-month it ultimately boils down
to only being 4 bucks a month and if you
really want to save some money you have
the option of doing a family plan for
only $35 covering 8 accounts whether
you're family or just a group of friends
joining up so that alone is some good
news I think it's a sign that Nintendo
knows they need to competitively price
themselves a bit against Sony and
Microsoft but where it starts to run
into some problems is this is the first
time Nintendo's really tried something
like this a paid online service that
gives certain benefits and it feels very
much like this is a situation where
they're trying out online services for
the first time back in the mid-2000s for
instance let's talk about one of the
biggest most look for two features of
Nintendo switch online cloud saves one
of the big problems the switch has is
the fact that there's not really any way
to backup your save data at all and
everything is locked to a single console
so that console breaks you literally
lose everything as far as your actual
progress in a game goes and wasn't into
the switch online we're finally getting
a way to do cloud saves kind of there's
a couple caveats here now first off the
cloud saving service has some very
unclear terms about how it's handled a
tree or subscription goes up a lot of
people are interpreting some vague
wording from Nintendo as the fact that
as soon as you no longer pay for online
services your save data is immediately
deleted there's some other wording in
other locations on Nintendo's website
where it kind of sounds like maybe
there's a grace period but it's not
clear now compare this to what Sony and
Microsoft intend Microsoft cloud saves
are just an automatic thing it's not
even part of a gold membership you just
have that for free indefinitely Sony on
the other hand it is something you need
to pay for but if you don't pay for the
service they at least pay per cloud
saves around for six months Nintendo
like I said we don't know for sure but
either way it's sounding not as remotely
strong as either of those now once again
Nintendo's wording on this has been very
vague so it's possible that's going to
be better than what a lot of people are
fearing but there's other aspects of the
online service that's in much plainer
speech that's a little more worrisome
for instance the fact that not all games
actually support cloud saves
specifically split tomb 2 and Pokemon
let's go now the reason in Tendo was
given for this is because basically
these are games were designed with not a
lot of foresight as far as how online
services and being able to do backup
saves would work so if they did support
cloud saves it would give people a very
easy way to do things like duplicate
Pokemon duplicate items trade stuff away
and then just get it back again and
while that is kind of a good reason I do
that it raises the question of why
wasn't this planned for a ahead of time
especially if Nintendo switch online was
a thing we were expecting because it's
really rough we're especially in a
competitive game where you can spend
tons of hours building up a lot of stuff
that's the one thing you can't properly
backup or save that's not good now along
with allowing you to play games online
and cloud saves one of the other big
aspects of Nintendo switch online is the
ability to play kind of their new retro
console they're calling it in a 1000
Entertainment System Nintendo switch
online which is quite a mouthful now
this works a bit differently from
Nintendo's past attempts at bringing
retro games to modern consoles instead
of being a system where you're just
buying individual games as long as
you're a paying member of Nintendo
switch online you'll be able to access a
currently small library of Nintendo
titles currently numbering at 20 but
they're gonna be releasing more as time
goes on kind of similar to what
PlayStation does a PlayStation now or
Xbox with game paths but it's all much
older games the cool side about this
though is that kind of similar to what
they did with the Nintendo classic
editions that does update these games to
run nice and smoothly in 1080p
resolution and
interesting new facet is that you will
be able to actually do online play with
the small handful of titles where would
actually be relevant and I gotta admit
by far one of the coolest aspects about
it to me is that tying in with this
release they are releasing some special
limited Nintendo Entertainment System
controllers that act like joy Kahn's
being able to slide on the side you
can't use them for any other games
because they don't really have enough
buttons but if you're a paying member
and you're playing in ask games you can
use an actual NES style controller which
i think is an awesome little touch this
to me is potentially the coolest part of
what Nintendo online could eventually be
because right now with only 20 games
it's not a lot but they have already
shown that you're planning on releasing
a lot of games in the near future and
hopefully down the line it couldn't come
to something more than just NES you know
one of the things about Nintendo at
least in the modern age it's always been
a little weird to me is how all over the
place their way of accessing retro games
has been they've done different methods
they've released standalone systems I
really really want just one easy way to
access a large library of Nintendo games
and if this list continues to grow the
rate they're currently doing I think the
intent of switch online could be that
service and I think this would go a long
way in really helping make a Nintendo
switch online seem a lot more worth it
even if they eventually up the price a
little bit as that library of games grew
because as of right now at least yes it
is the cheapest online subscription
model out of the three major systems but
what you're getting out of these
honestly a bit limited right now the 20
games is a cool idea but it's a small
number and some of the other
functionality of it like cloud saves
while present don't exactly work the way
that I think a lot of people would want
them to work whereas with PlayStation
and Microsoft you're getting free games
there's all these other additional
services cloud saves are just
straight-up free on Microsoft this is
just the service you're getting what you
pay for right now but it's not quite
what it should be now I don't want to
just have this entire video be oh no
everything's awful Nintendo's basic up
online and you shouldn't buy it no look
it's a rough start but I think that
especially at the current lower price
point it's something that's at least
worth getting into right now and there's
just areas that Nintendo could really
you know work on whether that's
increasing memory games available for
the NES console or adding other
platforms down the line improving in
fixing up cloud saves work and let's not
even start on the still continuing issue
have
use a separate phone for offline chat
it's just it's a start right now but
Nintendo can do better</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
