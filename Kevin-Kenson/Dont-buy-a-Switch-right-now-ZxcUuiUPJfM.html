It has this awesome core concept
that allows you to play
games wherever you want
whether it's on a TV or
on the go and handheld
and it's got this great library of games
that's just growing
more and more and more,
whether that's ports from other systems
or its own original new games.
I mean I'm gonna be honest.
Any time there's a major
third party release
that's on multiple systems
I go for the Switch version
because the ability to go
handheld just beats out the option
of oh, it's a little
shinier on this system.
But it has its problems,
some that we've known about
since when it first came out
and others that we've kind
of just learned more about
as time has passed.
And none of these problems individually
are enough to be like oh, the
Switch is actually terrible,
nevermind, you shouldn't
be getting one, blah.
No, like it's still a fun system
but that doesn't change the fact
that those problems are there.
And with mounting rumors
that it looks like
we might really be getting not one
but two new models of Switch this year,
I've just come to the
opinion that right now
you really shouldn't buy a Switch.
There are numerous things that add up
as being problems for
the current Switch model.
Some of it is odd design choices,
some of it is possible bad build quality,
and others are just missing features.
Now when it comes to design
choices, some of these
I understand just by the
virtue of how the Switch works
we're kinda locked into.
For instance, the power port.
It makes sense when you wanna
dock your Switch into the dock
it'd have a little port right here
but if you ever wanna
play in tabletop mode
and charge your switch at the same time,
there's not actually a
convenient way to do that
right out of the box.
You have to buy some kind of
special stand or attachment
or a different cable
so it'll actually rest
under here comfortably.
Then there is also of course
the all time favorite argument
of the kickstand.
Now obviously this is a redone Switch back
and part of the reason why it
is is 'cause my old kickstand
got so loose from my regular switch
that it just hung out at all times
and would even just randomly fall out.
So this one, while it
still doesn't actually work
as a functional kickstand,
at least fills the space
and doesn't fall off all the time.
Again, there is an entire wave
of different third party accessories
meant to address this problem
but it'd be great if it
just wasn't a problem.
So we were just setting up for the shot
and I was originally gonna bring up
how on the top front of my switch
just one of the little
plastic pieces broke off
and you can kinda see the
other ones had little cracks.
I decided to poke one very lightly
and the whole grill just came off.
So that's just completely exposed now.
That's cool, that's,
that is really well times for this video.
As for build quality, there
were a lot of different things
that were circulated when
the Switch first came out.
A lot of people were
complaining about the fact
that oh I think my Switch might be warping
while it's in the dock.
Oh, I'm getting screen scratches
because when I put it in
the dock it hits the screen.
A lot of these are somewhat debatable.
It might be someone just not
being very careful at all
and sometimes it's a question of well,
how much is it actually bending?
Was it just like that in the first place?
Something that we do know
that is happening for sure
'cause it's a lot easier
to measure this evidence
with other people showing
what's happened to their system
is that as time has gone on
a lot of the plastic on
the shell of the switch
is starting to crack.
Now for a lot of switches
where this problem can happen
is you'll actually have cracks
that go around the screws
on the corners of the back plate,
which is exactly what happened
to my Switch which is why
I ended up putting on this
Game Cube one instead.
Plus I just thought it was a great excuse
to have a cool-looking design.
But the thing is those
cracks don't just happen
on the back plate.
They also happen to the top
and bottom of the system.
In fact, something that just happened
is that the whole grill
on the top of where the
heating vent is for mine
just cracked off.
Originally there was
just one piece missing
and a few little parts cracked
but now the whole thing's just exposed.
Now none of this actually
affects your ability
to play the system, true.
It's just a lot of cosmetic damage,
but that kinda sucks to
spend money on something
that even if you take
really good care of it
is gonna start falling apart over time.
I mean yeah cool, I use
it as a great excuse
to get a different design
on the back of my Switch
but not everyone wants to do that
or even go to the trouble of changing it.
You might just be stuck with
a broken looking backplate.
Then there's the issue
of missing features.
Internally the Switch has some
pretty good stuff going on.
I mean I wish you had a little
more actual internal storage,
maybe better battery.
But I think one big function
that people miss out on
is kinda common across
a lot of systems now,
Bluetooth support.
And again, there are a ton
of third party companies
that saw this as a great opportunity
and jump on it and fix it.
There are a lot of bluetooth
adapters you can get
for your Switch to fix
this issue which is great
if you already own a
Switch, but it'd be cool
if you just didn't have
to worry about that
in the first place
and your Switch just
worked with bluetooth.
And again, all these problems
combined doesn't ruin
what the Switch does well for me.
If I was told
that this was the only
model ever of the Switch,
this was the only way to
play I would still buy it
and accept all the
problems it was gonna have
and maybe even eventually
dish out the money
to buy a new one to upgrade
it, which kinda sucks
but I still love the system that much.
But the thing is there's
been a lot of rumors
we might be getting new Switches,
and if that's true why put up with this?
If you haven't heard these
rumors before, for a while now,
almost a year already,
we've had a lot of rumors that Nintendo
is working on a new model
of the Switch already
that could come out this year.
Now before those rumors
were all focused on the idea
of there just being one new model
and people would debate, oh
maybe it's a cheaper one,
maybe it's a pro model,
a more expensive one,
a 4K one, something.
But now more recent rumors,
as only about a month back
point to the fact
that we might actually be
seeing two models this year.
If these rumors are true
it looks like we might actually be seeing
both of those ideas, a pro
model and a cheaper one.
In the case of the cheaper one,
the idea would be something
that's going to save people a lot of money
and not offer nearly as many
functions that the Switch has.
A lot of the main theories
people seem to have
is that you don't actually
have removable JoyCons,
it's just one smaller system
with the controls actually attached
and is more relatable to a
traditional handheld console
and not something that
actually gives you the option
to switch between on the
go or on TV gameplay.
While removing wireless
controllers like the JoyCons
would certainly hurt a little bit,
especially 'cause you also
couldn't play in tabletop mode
unless you bought additional
JoyCons on top of the ones
attached to the system,
it would certainly save
a lot of money on production of the system
and make it potentially way
cheaper for people to buy,
maybe even as low as 150.
On the other hand,
there's also the concept
of getting a pro model,
something that is very similar
to what we already see
with the current Switch
but offers possibly new
features, new functions,
or more importantly just
overall more performance,
whether that's being more powerful
so it can provide us
with better resolutions,
maybe even a full blown 4K system.
In my opinion, more likely
it's just gonna be something
that gives us actual stable
frame rates on all games
regardless of whether
they're handheld or docked
and maybe even giving us better
resolution on those games
and handheld that are downscaling.
They could also do things
like add those functions
that we talked about that are missing,
like bluetooth support
or just be made out of a
better, stronger plastic
that isn't going to break over time.
Now there are some issues
that new models like this
might not completely address.
For instance, something that blog people
have been talking about again recently
is the issue of drift
on their left JoyCon,
which might be caused by damage
inside the JoyCon stick itself.
And if we're using the
same JoyCons from before
with the new systems, well
that's not gonna be a problem
that goes away anytime soon.
Though it is possible
they could do some kind
of quiet hardware refresh
where all the new JoyCons
that are released from that point on
would actually not have that problem.
So if you get a new one
maybe just don't buy older model JoyCons.
The Switch is a great system.
It has an awesome idea that I
think was executed really well
and it has a great library
of games backing it up.
It just has some problems on
the build performance side
that could use addressing
and if we are getting
these new model systems
that's gonna be the breath of
fresh air that we really need.
So again, I think the Switch is awesome,
you should get one, just not right now.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
