because today at least for some
retailers is the release of the brand
new robot white xbox 1s the first new
color for the 1x not counting the
limited run Scorpios that happened when
the system first came out in the
packaging for this one is very basic and
that's actually going to change
eventually which we'll get to
white later but for now let's open this
one up it's got all the usual bits cable
only good stuff but the two main things
are of course our white xbox 1x
controller and the new white Xbox one X
now at first glance the controller looks
like it might be just the same thing as
we've gotten before with the original
Xbox 1s but that's actually not the case
it is ever so slightly redesigned to
match up with more recent designs for
the Xbox one X in which the logo part
actually is sort of a metallic e silver
when it's not lit up versus just a plain
black logo now as for the Xbox one X
itself the description here is pretty
simple it's in white but honestly it
comes together really nicely when you
compare it to sort of the two similar
consoles with the white Xbox 1s and the
black Xbox one X I really think that
this is the best-looking iteration and
probably the best-looking all around
Xbox one we've done so far at least as
far as plain color designs go if you've
watched us unbox special edition and
different color systems before something
that I've always brought up repeatedly
is a really big appreciation for the
systems that make use of at least two
colors that contrast really well and I
don't think necessarily that the black
Xbox one X looks bad I just think that
when you have two separate colors like
this going on it ends up looking a lot
cleaner and helps make certain aspects
of it really stand out a lot more
especially cuz you have the division
between sort of the main body and the
base that it's sitting on and I think
that in this particular case it also
really highlights I think a lot of the
benefits to design change between b-1s
and 1x when I first saw the 1x actually
thought that it looked just a little
worse than the 1s design but seeing it
now on the white I think it actually
comes together a lot more nicely
especially because something it always
kind of stood out on the 1s is that you
have the disc crate which kind of
creates a little break here but instead
you not have this perfect little white
monolith up top with the disc tray
hidden in the seam between what's really
interesting about this xbox 1x is that
this is X
a early release version of a bundle
that'll be coming out in November which
is for fallout 76 this is advertised as
a fallen State v6 bundle even the game
isn't out for a full month and Game Stop
specifically is being able to sell these
early and that's actually my mentor Lee
with the packaging change where this box
is simple but down the line when 76
comes out it's going to be a fully
branded box with the game included in
this case we just got a code on the
receipt which basically just gave us a
fall at 76 pre-order what's really funny
about this too is that this is still a
fall at 76 bundle and it's advertised
that way and in fact game stuff even
emphasizes that it's the beta version
but even that's not playable until the
24th the game is in November on the 14th
the beta is on the 24th of October and
the system's
already out with no way to play just yet
so basically it's a full month early
access to just the system itself now
being this is the first new Xbox 1x
since the original project Scorpio and
just regular black editions it's
something that migra's been getting
really good at lately is hiding all
kinds of little hidden messages and
easter eggs in their systems we've had a
number of them especially in the
controllers but with systems they've
been doing some really awesome things
hidden inside of them so I thought why
not with this new one let's take a deep
dive and see if there's anything new so
fun factor maybe I have not done a lot
of tear downs in my life and in fact
it's really only something that we've
started doing as part of this channel
like when I started doing shell
exchanges on joy Khan's
and that makes something like going
inside of the system a little more
intimidating because you can break a
joke on you're out 40 50 bucks you break
a brand new Xbox one X it's about ten
times that
and you know we went pretty deep into
the system and we actually went to we're
on the project Scorpio and black xbox 1x
they have this little hidden symbol of
Master Chief riding a scorpion and
that's exactly what's still here so it
looks like Easter Egg wise this is
following the same design as the other
one X's which isn't really surprised
that was kind of what we figured might
happen but you know hey still an awesome
little secret so there you have the
white xbox 1x this is actually the first
to be released or last to be released
depending on if you get the early game
stuff release or the official fallout 76
one bit either way Microsoft is
releasing a whole bunch of different
white products this holiday season
you're getting this one the white Xbox
League controller which will be out by
the time this video is live and also a
new white turtle beach headset for the
Xbox specifically so if you're a fan of
getting a complete whiteout gaming setup
now is the perfect time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
