celebrating it Sony is running a
week-long promotion called days of play
which has all kinds of discounts and
stuff but definitely the biggest
head-turning thing to come out of it is
this special edition gold ps4 with one
terabyte hard drive that's selling right
now for 249 50 bucks off what a regular
ps4 cost now I'm personally not a huge
fan of gold
I love gone let's open this one up and
see how it looks and of course there is
another box to deal with first okay here
we have it oh wow this is a bit
different than I expected the picture
made it look like a flatter gloss or a
platter matte finish but this is
actually a bit glossy er than I was
expecting
it's not full-blown I'm you can tell
just by touching it but it definitely
has a much brighter sheen than I was
expecting that it's certainly a system
that makes a statement do have one other
gold theme thing in this box and that's
the controller and once again this does
have that kind of higher Sheen matte
finish except for the backside the grip
is just a regular kind of not even fully
gol most just like a sand tan color I
actually kind of liked the look of this
a little better my just because the
controller so it's a smaller thing but
definitely just as loud as the system
now this is the third color PlayStation
4 slim we have gotten so far there is of
course the regular matte black the
glacier white there is also the final
fantasy 15 limited edition design but
that's still a black system it just has
a big ol moon plastered on the top of it
so this is the third color we've gotten
and do you be able to do the kind of my
least favorite mostly because it's just
so out there I mean this thing if you
want a system to really show off this is
going to be a good choice because it is
a very very flashy system I mean
honestly we actually had to take a
little time setting up the shot right
because if I had to angle just the right
way at the window you would currently be
blinded by the Sun reflecting off of it
I will say though I do actually like
this one more than the previous gold
system that we got I mean there weren't
very many of them but for the original
PlayStation 4 sony did release a limited
tacobell edition that was gold on top
black on bottom I didn't really care for
that two-tone approach so I do
appreciate this one went for a full gold
design with just a little black trim
running through the middle which i think
was a good call
now if you're wondering why all of a
sudden we got a shiny special gold
PlayStation 4 out of blue that's because
it's part of like I said earlier Sony's
days of play celebration basically this
is a whole event wrapped into e3 where
Sony is trying their best to build up a
lot of hype for all their announcements
and wanting people to jump in the system
so why not offer a limited edition color
at a lower price than usual on top of
that they're doing all kinds of other
sales at the same time reading discounts
on controllers going for 40 bucks the
PlayStation gold a headset going for 80
gold is in the model not the colors like
that you also some of the biggest
PlayStation games are going on sale as
well for instance horizon zero dawn and
neo going for 40 bucks apiece also
digitally they're doing a whole bunch
more sales on Sony exclusives and some
big triple-a titles like Battlefield 1
Mass Effect Andromeda and 10 bucks off
full year's for PlayStation Plus if you
guys want to grab all those sales right
now notice really cool that we're
getting new colors for the PlayStation 4
slim but I am a little sad that we're
not seeing any kind of treatment for
this on the ps4 Pro just yet I mean I
get it it's a more expensive system
already in the first place it's a
specialty item in and of itself but
seeing some limited edition colors in
that even if they were more limited run
than these would be really really cool</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
