lot of weird controller designs trying
to accomplish all sorts of stuff and
we've covered a few of those in the past
but something we haven't talked about
before is times where it actually worked
sometimes really well and one of those
controllers is this weird little guy
right here
the Neji Khan from Namco
released back in 1995 for the
PlayStation one the reason this exists
is because Namco made a game called
cyber sleds for the arcade that they
ported to the PlayStation 1 and they
wanted something that would recapture
the arcade style controls that it had
which featured a pair of levers and so
the way they would do that with a
controller is this twisting motion right
here which is why it's called the Neji
con because in Japan mid Giroux means to
twit by the way I love the way they
actually branded this guy where there's
a little twist symbol right here and
that's also the G I mean yeah a lot of
people probably call it the neocon on
accident but it's kind of a pun and I
love that
now obviously the big weird thing about
this controller is the twist action
which acts as going left or right on a
control stick but there's a couple other
odd things about it too for one thing
it's missing a lot of buttons
PlayStation 1 controllers obviously have
these set of four shoulder buttons this
guy just has two up here and on the
front side some of these buttons are
actually analog not just simply digital
ones so the ones right here that
normally would be Square and X are now
these actual analog buttons you can
press down and feel the full motion of
it's also missing a select button so
obviously this would not work well for a
number of games but something that
people discovered is that while this
does work for Cypress LEDs as intended
another genre it makes a lot of sense
for is racing games it turns out the
twisting mechanic meant for driving a
hover tank is actually really
appropriate for any kind of vehicle
based game so a lot of the racing games
in the PlayStation 1 and even some jet
based games all used to this controller
and supported it and it worked really
well a lot of people prefer to using
this over the official PlayStation 1
controller so we're gonna test it out I
just hooked up my ps1 and let's see how
this goes a quick disclaimer I'm just
terrible at any kind of serious racing
game anyways so this is not gonna be
pretty either way oh no it starts in
like actual drive review I'm bad at that
how do I switch to car nope that's rear
view there we go okay you see the card I
just made all the racing game fans
cringe so obviously Energy cons missing
some buttons but for a lot of older
racing games all you really need to care
about is accelerate brake and turn so
all I need
these two and this I think this is
actually kind of really intuitive like
it just gives the idea of yeah just
twist returning like turning a wheel
this is all bad now no I take everything
back okay now something that's cool
about this guy too that people kind of
learned and figured out over time was
that yeah you can't hold it and use it
like a traditional controller and that's
definitely the way a lot of people are
gonna use it out of the box but
depending on the game you're playing
since you really only care about two
buttons and the twisting mechanism you
could also do something like switch to a
grip like this where you're hitting the
buttons and the even more kind of just
natural turn feeling you're not twisting
both you're just twisting the one and
I'm doing actually a lot worse now that
I started doing that because I was
proper tucking at the same time there we
go yeah so this gives you a little more
natural feel of just turning a wheel or
something instead of twisting both sides
at the same time yeah this is actually
really cool I mean look I'm gonna be
honest we first ordered this thing just
cuz we thought it looked ridiculous and
now that I'm actually using it this is
really awesome so I am still very bad at
these games but I will say all the
problems I'm having are definitely
because of me and not this controller I
actually think it'd be a little better
because of it what really stands out to
me about the neji con is this idea of a
super specialized controller designed
for a specific kind of game in mind that
works really well because you know most
modern controllers especially with the
mainland ones that come with systems
these are designed to be
one-size-fits-all and something that's
gonna be comfortable and work for racing
games fighting games action-adventure
RPG whatever this is going to work and
make sense but something like this is so
much more unique and specialized whether
they actually had to come up with more
weird innovative ideas to make it work I
mean you have some things today that are
specialized like for racing games yeah
you can get a full-blown wheel or
fighting games have fight sticks and a
few fight pads but something like this
where they actually come up with a
unique awkward solution for something
that's going to work for a specific kind
of game with this mechanism you just
don't really get that anymore now of
course there are good reasons why you
don't see stuff like this all the time
because it can be expensive to invest in
a weird unique idea like this and have
it not pay off but there are plenty of
examples this past to where weird
peripherals have paid off big-time and
when we have entire franchises built
around the idea of using odd controller
let me just look back at
band and guitar hero you're using this
guitar or drum kit that just acts like a
controller and yeah you could play with
the controller to have it be a rhythm
game but that changes the entire way
that you interact with it and makes it a
more fun experience and this is
something that to me is super important
because games are awesome but if
everything boils down to using the same
control scheme in everything it starts
to get a little repetitive and so the
idea of these different word peripherals
that change the way we play really keeps
things interesting I don't think that
time is over and gone yet you know I
mean look at the switch the droid cons
are by no means traditional controllers
and while they can kind of work like one
on their own there's all kinds of ways
that you could incorporate those with
other accessories to change the way we
play games I am just super excited about
that possibility</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
