number three and this time
we're talking Microsoft.
The One X launched earlier this year.
We've got a lot of people
that are picking up their
first Xbox One consoles.
So lets talk about the best
gifts to grab for the Xbox One
owner we know.
First off, I know this is
gonna sound a little basic
but an Xbox One controller.
Now, yes, everyone gets one
of those with their systems
and not everyone needs
multiple controllers but really
I think one of the really
cool things Microsoft has done
with the Xbox One is make lots
of cool, stylish, different
controllers with unique designs.
For instance, let's say
you've got a kid in the family
or someone who really likes Minecraft.
- Minecraft is not a game.
Yes.
Shut up.
- Well you can get the
Minecraft creeper or pink
controllers.
Or, maybe they're really
into FPS games and want some
military themed stuff.
You know, Call of Duty, Battlefied.
Well you can get something
from the Tech Series or
the Forces Series.
Or, if you want something that's
just a little more neutral
and just looks really good,
there's my personal favorite,
Shadow Series controllers.
Which all have this kind
of iridescent finish and go
from one color to a black
that just looks so nice.
And if none of these fit
the person that you want to
get a controller for well
then you can even just go to
Xbox Design Lab and make
your own customized design
that will fit their personality
which will just be perfect.
Next up a little bit of a
different accessory for your
Xbox One X or One S is a
wall mount for the system.
Now this is an awesome way to do something
a little different with your set up.
Especially if you have a room
that doesn't' really allow you
to have like a more
traditional TV console.
You've got a lot of stuff everywhere.
This is gonna be a great
way to show off your system
in a nice clean way.
Not only that but you can
also get these handy hooks
for your controllers as
well so you can set those up
on a nice pattern alongside the system.
Now, let's talk fun stuff.
One of the best exclusives to
come out of Xbox this year,
really one of my favorite
games of this year in general,
is Cuphead.
So I had to get some kind of
Cuphead merch and thankfully
Funko has made these awesome
little Cuphead figures.
For both Cuphead, Mugman and also
a larger one for the Devil.
They do make ones that are
more in the style of their
traditional Pops, which
I'm not so much a fan of.
But these vinyl designs, which
actually just look like them
straight outta the game
are so fricken cool.
These are easily some of my
favorite little collectables
that I've picked up this year.
Another option, but has a
little more choices available
right now.
You can also grab Pixel pals.
They have just made one
that's Master Chief from Halo.
Most of the other ones
they've done are from other
properties.
Lots of Nintendo.
Lots of Capcom.
Even some Mortal Kombat stuff.
Definitely worth checking out as well.
Help me.
Okay, so another cool gift
idea that's Halo related is
this Master Chief helmet right here.
Now this is actually
designed to be used as like a
tactical cam kinda thing.
You can wear it when
you're playing laser tag or
well, technically paintball
but it says not to do that
because it is not actually
protective at all.
But the idea is that you
can wear this and actually
attach a GoPro to the
front so you do this whole
like FPS view kinda thing.
(heavy drumming music)
(laughing)
- [Man's Voice] Rich
is not worried at all.
- And there should be just
enough room on the inside
that you could also
wear a headset with it.
Honestly my main purpose for
this thing is I'm gonna put a
light inside of it and
put it in the background
to have an awesome looking helmet display.
Either way, it's a solid
choice and surprisingly
not that expensive.
Really cool little pick up.
Now this year I've been
having a really heavy
board game theme with
all these gift guides.
I mean I don't wanna stop
on the Microsoft one so
this particularly intimidating
looking set up is Halo Risk.
Now I used to love playing
original Risk but sometimes
matches would go way too long.
Some of them would go a
little back and forth.
It just wouldn't be quite
as fun as the game could be.
And the Halo version does a
really great job of injecting
some Halo universe flavor
into it while fixing
some of this problems.
The biggest thing is that in
regular risk you have to play
the whole game until someone
conquers the entire map.
Which can take forever.
Where as in Halo Risk,
everyone has these little
objective cards that tell you
you have to do certain things.
Like conquer so many territories or
kill so many enemies in a turn.
And once someone gets all three
of them they win the game.
Another really cool like
thing too is the game actually
represents three of the
games biggest factions
from the original trilogy.
The Humans, The Covenant and The Flood.
And each of them have their own
little deck of special cards
that give them special abilities.
So really awesome combination
of the board game and
the video game universe.
Tons of fun to play.
Just takes a little bit
of a time investment.
So there you have some great
gift ideas for the Xbox fan
you know especially if they love Halo.
