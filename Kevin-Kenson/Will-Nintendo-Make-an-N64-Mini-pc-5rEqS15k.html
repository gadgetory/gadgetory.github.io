game sim across all platforms now I can
say as a racing sim aficionado that
without a doubt the most hyper realistic
racing sim out there but also a ton of
fun just gives the feelings the roar of
your engine is Mario Kart Double Dash
that that was the series answer do you
think Nintendo of America will stop at
the SNES classic or do you think we'll
see an n64 classic and another question
that really goes hand-in-hand with this
is if Nintendo were to release an n64
mini what games would you like to see
now do I think we're going to get one
yes I'm not quite as positive about the
n64 one as I was for the SNES you know
as soon as we saw the NES classics just
SNES made sense to me n64 feels a little
weirder a little more of a wild card but
I'm currently leaning towards I think
they're going to do it now as far as
games I would love to see on it you know
there's a number that I think are pretty
safe bet like Mario 64 starfox 64
Ocarina of Time Majora's Mask the
original Super Smash Brothers for some
slightly weirder ones or like
third-party stuff that isn't straight-up
Nintendo I'd like to see Goldeneye I'd
like to see Mega Man 64 which is really
just Mega Man Legends with a different
title for Nintendo a weirder one even
though it wasn't as popular as Mario
Kart I actually really liked diddy kong
racing so seeing that on it would be
cool and then one other game that I
think would be great is actually the
answer to this next question what's your
favorite game based on a movie or TV
show so because I'd have to go with
Rogue Squadron
all three of them are great I guess if I
had to pick just one of them and
probably number two on the Gamecube but
I spent a lot of hours on the original
rogue squadron on n64 now this isn't
necessarily my favorite Star Wars game
it's just my favorite one that's
actually based on one of the movies
we're looking at sort of just you know
movie franchises in general Star Wars
Knights of the Old Republic too is an
incredible game despite the fact that
it's also unfinished and a buggy mess
but if you can actually get through all
the bugs and play it it is an incredibly
well-written game and definitely worth
trying out if you miss out on it yeah
you know I love the goldeneye as a kid I
don't know if I still have like strong
nostalgia for it
vocalist blaring gaming that's what I
think the big deal was I feel like it
hasn't kept its age up as well great
discrete okay what's your favorite game
making company so what's weird about
this question for me is comparing
between like what studios are actively
putting out or looking at the actual
full catalog of company because if I'm
looking at the full catalogue I have a
lot of love for some of the older
Japanese companies like Capcom Konami
Square Enix I mean my favorite
franchises are Final Fantasy Metal Gear
Solid Megaman but when I'm looking at
stuff they've done recently I've kind of
been let down a little more I like some
of the stuff being produced under Square
Enix but games they developed first hand
I'm a little more iffy on when I'm
looking at stuff that's coming up
recently I've got a lot of respect more
recently for Arkane studios thanks to
Dishonored 2 and prey one of my favorite
indie Studios the supergiant games I
loved Bastion and transistor really
looking forward to pyre and then I
actually really like vanilla where just
because their art style on poor stuff is
just so unique an awesome looking one
game whose sequel you really want to
play but there is even rumors of it
coming so I actually touched on this a
little bit when I did by e3 wish list
and there's this low-key successful DF
game that came out back in I think 2009
which was Might and Magic Clash of
Heroes it was a spin-off game from the
might magic series that Ubisoft now owns
and it was this weird fusion of tactics
game puzzle game RPG that just worked
really really well I mean I'm not a huge
puzzle guy I mean I've had fun doing
like Tetris and stuff before but this is
the first one with a competitive aspect
that I can actually see myself playing a
lot and there's been no word of another
one at all whatsoever I mean Ubisoft
hasn't even really hinted at it capybara
has been mixed on the side doing below
for the last four years which I'm not
even sure if that's coming up at this
point I think they're doing like Cartoon
Network game now I don't know there's
just no word of a new game coming which
really makes me sad because it was an
excellent game the original releases in
2009 it got a remake in 2011 which is on
PC and Xbox 360 and I think phones now
so if you haven't played it definitely
check it out and then you could be like
me hoping that a new one comes and never
will</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
