known fighting game franchises and
arguably the best and here's five things
about the series you may not have known
number one Street Fighter has actually
taken direct influence from hacks of
their games the third version of Street
Fighter 2 called Street Fighter 2 turbo
was directly inspired by a hacked
version called rainbow Edition rainbow
Edition featured all kinds of ridiculous
overpowered changes to all characters
including heat-seeking Hadouken z-- air
specials the ability to switch fighters
mid-match and moves that would travel
across the entire screen super fast but
most importantly though it sped up the
entire pace of the game Capcom USA had
one of their employees James Godard try
out hacked versions of the game and
while the majority of the changes
rainbow made were completely broken he
did find that returning to the regular
Street Fighter afterwards felt like an
incredibly slow experience this led to
turbos increased speed and may have also
inspired the addition of air specials in
later games such as Akuma's ergo
Hadouken number speaking of Akuma both
him and Street Fighter 4's goken were
actually made thanks to an April Fool's
Day joke the original Street Fighter 2
had a mistranslation for reuse victory
quote saying you must defeat Sheng long
to stand a chance which was meant to
reference one of his signature moves the
shoryuken or the dragon punch but
instead sounded like the name of some
other fighter the gaming magazine EGM
featured an April Fool's series of
Secrets one being that shen long was
reuse master and if you do things just
the right way while fighting bison the
fighter sheng long would appear kill
bison and force you to fight him instead
Akuma was introduced in the 5th version
of Street Fighter 2 as a hidden
character and using a similar but much
easier method can make his appearance as
the final boss of the arcade mode
killing bison in the same way the joke
claimed years later another egm April
Fool's article was made for Street
Fighter 3 talking about Sheng long being
Akuma's brother and known in japan as
goken being a hidden character and this
time they introduced a picture of the
fighter which looks pretty much just
like the goken we got years later in
Street Fighter hoar number 3 long time
Street Fighter character dhalsim is
normally known as being one of the most
reluctant fighters in the series
normally resorting to diplomacy if it's
an option but just like all characters
he has his
grudges and there's one in particular
that's especially nasty and that's with
Balrog like all fighters dhalsim's
backstory enjoys its fair share of
stereotypes one of the other ones being
that he owns several pet elephants which
are featured on his stages of background
in Street Fighter 2 during the plot of
Street Fighter Alpha 3 Balrog practises
one of his signature moves the Gigaton
punch by punching in carrying elephant
in a single strike and that elephant
just so happened to be friends with one
of dhalsim's leading to the yoga masters
pretty understandable animosity against
the prizefighter that and you know he's
a chief enforcer and one of the most
pile evil terrorist organizations
infamous worldwide but that's all
secondary number or speaking of Balrog
the fighter bears a very uncanny
resemblance to real-world fighter and
former heavyweight champion Mike Tyson
as well as a fighter from the original
Street Fighter series named Mike in fact
Balrog was originally named Mike bison
in the Japanese version of Street
Fighter 2 but fearing a possible lawsuit
from Tyson's Capcom decided to switch
around not two but three of their
characters names bison became Balrog the
fighter that we know is M bison was
originally named Vega and who we know as
Vega was originally named Balrog these
names are still kept in Japanese
versions of the later games while other
countries also use the shuffled up
versions leading to international
tournaments and forums referring to the
fighters simply as boxer claw and
dictator number I Balrog / Mike bison
isn't the only character based on a
real-world fighter Street Fighter threes
protagonist Alex is based on real-life
wrestler Hulk Hogan I'm not the Hulk
anymore while Hugo a character
originally introduced in final fight and
later became a fighter in Street Fighter
3 is very clearly based on wrestler
Andre the Giant these influences are not
only fairly telling in the characters
design but is also made super obvious by
a unique fighter introduction when the
two faced off against each other in
Street Fighter 3 which directly mimics
Hogan and Andres real-world face-off in
1987 at WrestleMania 3 it's also
interesting though that since Street
Fighter 3 takes place at the end of the
Street Fighter timeline and Alex is the
main character that series that he's the
current world reigning champion of the
street
a tournament in other words as far as
Street Federer is concerned Hulk Hogan
is the strongest fighter in the world
