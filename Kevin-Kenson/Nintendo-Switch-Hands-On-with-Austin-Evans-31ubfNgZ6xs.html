reviewable price and everything a couple
days ago they had a hands-on event I
couldn't go I was stuck back here but
you guys got to try it so tell me what
was like it was amazing
hi my life will never be the same I've
transcended the immortal universe and
I've tried to switch now final answer no
it's alright the switch was interesting
I think hardware wise it's nice I
thought like the joy Kong controllers
are really impressive that's something
that dizzy jumped out to me it how
comfortable they were interesting how
well they came on and off because that
was my biggest fear honestly looking at
them nah man because I mean look have
you ever used like a regular-sized 3d s
of smaller ones yes those are the
current okay to be fair I didn't find
those I'll actually like the regulatory
yes really the XL yeah but even with
that said I mean use like an NES right
like you know like the rough size
because it's eerily similar to that it's
not bad look I'm sure I'm not going to
play Mario Kart with like a bunch of
buttons for like eight hours but the
joys on by itself is fine
but specifically what really impressed
me was knowing how easy they are to take
off and put back on but having the joy
con separated right yeah so with the
idea of like remember like with the Wii
Remote and stuff you would have that in
a nunchuck and it was kind of a little
goofy and weird a little weird
especially give the cable putting
together exactly with the joy cons you
can have them both separate so having
them together either on the the console
having them with the grip controller or
having them separate there's no
difference you have the exact same
buttons throughout I did be able to gain
here game here or game with your arms
behind your back you can do whatever so
super comfortably comfortable
comfortable with me I think what English
I know I residual its gory and it's
great because it's it's like it's not
only comfortable but it's all cohesive
and the same no matter where it is yes
so yeah like it's cool um the actual
hardware stuff is nice the screen looks
nice I know everyone's complain like oh
it's like 720p it's fine it's a small
raylene it'll shine what it'll look
sharp no matter what like you like when
playing splatoon and Zelda and it looked
absolutely fine
there's no pub and it's funny going
between the small 6 inch screen 6.3 or
whatever it is yeah on the tablet
you drop it on to the dock which is
incredibly fat - that's literally the
second layer you drop it on take it off
super fast but then you look at like how
nice it looks on the screen all setting
it blows up to the giant
you know KPTV in front of your like
alright this looks ok but as soon as you
get on that tablet yeah everything looks
great yeah because I mean a smaller
screen they're just there's not as much
for the loser exactly yeah so honestly
using the switch was fun I thought
there's a lot of good stuff about it
yeah I think the hardware itself feels
good the joints on controllers are by
far my favorite part of the whole thing
which is not what I expected to say at
all while going into there well I
honestly I think that's the systems like
strongest argument really is like its
base design you know the idea of this
easily switch being portable and home
set up that's a very easy so a lot of
people I think yeah it's just everything
else needs to come out to them you know
actually games good pricing and
something else that jumped out to me is
how portable it really is so you see the
pictures everything and you kind of
assume at least I did that it's going to
be bigger than was yeah with the
controllers on it's a little bit big
what's it's controllers off it's not
much bigger than a smartphone yeah but
wait so the exercisable when you take
with you well it is solo thinner but I
mean it's the same like know that in
Hamlet the tablet is basically or sorry
roughly the same size as a 3dsxl mm
anyway run a little a little bit of
thinner and maybe a little bit more
bezel but it's not that big at all it
felt like a large smartphone right if
you take the controllers off I mean so I
put my seven plus up to it while we were
playing around with a it wasn't a much
bigger look I'm not going to say that
I'm going to walk with switch my pocket
all the time every idea especially with
the controllers I throw at those ad
jeans but thanks what you should do it I
feel like I could fit the switch in my
pocket with that and like maybe put the
controllers in another pocket the
portability was a lot better than I was
expecting
it's a lot smaller than even like a
7-inch tablet is right so that was one
of the things that also kind of yeah and
and to that point though the controllers
I know some people are worried because
they think that they're too small no and
honestly I don't really think that's
because I mean granted you know I like
to say guys normal sized hands I'm going
to have well and then so when I think
about the comfort of them in the small
size I'm not so worried about when
you're holding both of them and it's
like sideways thing with most it's the
side west side of the actual yeah
because you're bunching up so like have
on the the shoulders and the what does
that feel but that's what I worry what
someone told me at the event I don't
know if it was one of the guys that you
know we were with or if it was one of
things where I was getting b-roll on my
own but he was telling me that the
asymmetrical controllers are so people
with big hands can use one and
components and use the other and it
works better for you know or one of them
works better for let's chase but that
they are not the same does not know is
they're not as doing if they have the
same button there's not anything I have
seen but it's just a defacing the
different yeah yeah my thought is so for
some of the games for example arms was a
good example of one where you hold each
one individually when you're holding
them individually like in sort of
vertical mode like you would on any
other controller they're fine I feel
like I could do that all day it's only
when you flip them sideways does it get
a little weird but honestly for that it
seems like much more of a casual
experience like I'm gonna play a couple
games from Mario Kart yeah even even
with the worsen for wherever I'm not
gonna get a cramp after 10 minutes right
right yeah the whole point of that too
is that you do the sine is one way into
want to do a local game with them right
exactly so it'll to play it doesn't seem
like I'm going to put eight hours into a
game with one joke on foot sideways like
that just doesn't seem like I think you
have never had drinks with playing
Street Fighter before okay fair point so
I have two very different minds on it
there's the personal side of me that
honestly is excited you know I I saw a
lot of the games that were announced
it's more my speed a lot of stuff I mean
that conference is very focused on
Japanese titles guarantee so you know
also if I'm excited for Xenoblade to
fire by our warriors awesome also path
traveler I really really want to try SMT
five huge fans great so that'll looks
good to me and I'm excited personally
like personally hyped but then when I
look at all the other news surrounding
it I can see why for most people it's a
huge term and the biggest thing is
pricing across the board I think yeah
alright so I don't have it for you to
expand on that because I don't think the
pricing is that bad now mind you the UK
parking is crazy okay so it's crazy so
here's why the presence bent of what 300
is okay that's a great I think 300 is
okay I thank you 50 would have been
smarter for being like really aggressive
yeah you need to be a like strong
alternative in the u.s. 300 the same
price of getting an Xbox one or ps4 so
we're not you close enough so point is
the switch pricing is fair but not
incredibly I problem comes across it
everywhere else first off they're asking
for a monthly fee which is it's
acceptable these days it's just for I
was going but all they're bundling with
is here's a free NES or SNES game you
get to have for the month and then it
disappears so that's a great sales pitch
and then do you know the pricing on the
controllers and accessories yes okay so
okay joy right the the one oh joy Khan
controller now yes one joy Khan is
enough for one additional player right
what was included so you can take it
right off horses right but if you're
buying a separate additional joy
launcher one joy come by it sells $50 if
you want a get a to bundle wait wait
wait they sell them individually
individually yes no one joy Khan
controller it's 50 bucks yeah there's
two and there's they're two different
ones actually okay so now obviously if
you want people that have full control
with to compare two icons you can get a
bundle let's you know we're just right
$80 now of course that's just if you
want to use the two handles if you want
to be able to put it in a container
river and a grip that will be an
additional $15
so that means $95 $95 feel full but
that's not even the real thing because
isn't there two different grips yes
they're called grips right there yeah
there are two Democrats there is a
charge grip in a rage charger yeah so
the regular grips 15 and that's what you
get in the system I don't know the
pricing on the charge no there is a
charge one we haven't read all of them
come with the system yeah okay because
someone someone was complaining about
the fact that it doesn't the the regular
grip obviously doesn't charge in it so
if it runs out of battery your only way
to charge it is I put it back on the
comment on that note I was reading that
worried too but I also found something
out now I've only seen this reported in
an IGN video and it wasn't intended of
saying this but I haven't seen it
anywhere else that the reported battery
life of the joy Khan is 20 hours yeah so
unless you're just extremely negligent
and you're not the kind of you just want
you fall asleep and throw the droidcon
to the ground I don't like you has a
system backup yeah seeing it like you're
never going to end up needing to really
charge those in the day unless you're
just not and we're safe scenarios
they're about to die you put them on and
you play in tablet mode and they will be
charging even off of the internal
battery so yeah you definitely plugged
in there my really I'll give you that
update only charges won't plug it the
drivers don't charge oh really
yeah we started them if it's actively
plugged into it I guess that's where the
battery light is not great and yeah you
don't want to siphon it i yeah little
bit this capacity
like my but that just you know it puts
you in an awkward situation if you're in
the middle of gameplay like say you're
playing Zelda and you know you're just
going on forever right or you know you
go to bed but you forget to put it back
on or something like that you know
you're in the middle of the game and
suddenly runs at a battery it's like
you're in this awkward situation of
alright what am I going to do now you
have to literally stop playing put them
on the joy con and charge them for like
whatever an hour I guess I just doesn't
seem like a big deal ya know I got a big
deal me personally that's not the
problem I am my problem is the price so
we've talked general thoughts on the
system we've talked about you know
pricing and how comfortable controllers
are but then of course the main point
for any game system is games so would
you guys play some results on it that
stuff was fun
yes so they had actually a lot of the
game yeah all the launch games and most
of the games are coming out that you're
out so I got to play splatoon too
I didn't play a ton of splatoon one but
it seems very very similar they're like
new weapons and some new characters but
seems similar i like split them so did
you know shin control civil yet so
that's the thing so all the demos on the
side where it was just tablet were all
gyro long and that's that's just um you
know a me gyro not moving gyro right but
it still with a little bit hard to wrap
my head around but i and I was told that
obviously you can change it I just you
know they just love demoing in gyro yeah
right I just did movie cuz I just kept
my hands there and just like you suspect
yes the ideal situations that you'd use
the the pro controller and so that was
those the other half of the setups that
I don't think any of us play but I mean
the fact that you have those options and
it played really well in tablet mode and
it looks really nice it looked you know
sharpen up on that 720p display like I
was really happy with it and it felt
like spooky light which I love if you
played splatoon before you know already
and if not then it could be a title for
you to try online for the switch right
for sure yep yeah so then you only
played that and Skylanders we can we can
drive out oh please let's talk about
carry on we're gonna we're going to
create another final and Zelda so I can
result it yes so it was I believe is the
same e3 demo it's the very beginning you
have a different hardware did you play
as 83 I did not okay my dress
there's no comparison the experience
between them damn well everyone who I
talked to said it was a very similar
experience from the videos I've seen it
looked very similar to what I've tried
on Twitter I know some people said it's
like technically a little bit different
but it seems similar isn't there like
any huge differences it was fun right
so I got to do like the intro sequence
you get kind of walk around you get like
to lighten things on fire and everything
right it was cool um I did notice there
were some technical slow down for not
amazing I was curious for that because
that was happening with the Wii U
version of e3 as well so I was hoping
that with the switch version now give it
it's still pre-release and so that can
change hola
we were saying line for about 30 minutes
so I was watching someone else play and
then I played for about 20 minutes I saw
two major framerate dips in the entire
time mi Joos is to really saw I'm not
people worried it was like you know
during like really intense hopefully
yeah oceans you know and all that to
note though a lot of the ones that I
noticed were on the TV mode entertaining
oh so I'm not sure how it will perform
in 720 I would assume that it might be
better yeah obviously there's no way for
me to tell if I can't you know go back
at ya got second but you know I'm
beginning to see a supreme release so
they could fix that stuff they could
maybe dial things back a bit who knows
what they're going to do but otherwise
it looks really good yeah they both for
the most part and what I really enjoyed
was aren't so what I'm looking at like
who's gonna be gimmicky it's gonna be
lame who cares that plays it's like oh
this is kind of fun it that and
wantonness which both gave me a very
strong original Wii box right which is
cool because like oh look this seems
legitimately different and cool so the
way that arms works is so you have the
two controllers like in the hand you'll
have your like yeah they have to be
freeform over exactly so what you do is
you literally do everything on all your
motion is based on this is this is your
motion here is the way you get into I
didn't know that's how you bought me
guys like know so you like use your
motion control so you will actually walk
and stuff I mean you do your punches so
it's like straight punches curved
punches and there are a couple of
buttons on the actual joy constant cells
like blocking light house ride it was a
lot of fun way more fun that I thought
is interesting
so lot of us which I've wrapped in
hands-on short of Sutton's you can give
me
not till we sold yet excited for
potential thank you
they're doing a surgeon tear down sweet
