replacements on the Nintendo switch joy
Kahn's but today I've got a special some
little different and that's gonna be a
shell replacement that actually adds a
d-pad one of the big complaints a lot of
people have had about the switch is that
the traditional joy cons don't come with
a d-pad option so we're going to take
this clear one that we've already
modified and upgraded to this atomic
purple with the d-pad and see
Oh stab my hand
all right I might have just set a new
record for how fast I can take meetings
apartment but it back together so this
was actually pretty much identical to
switching out with just another shell
the only difference is where you would
normally have to lay each button down
you just put a d-pad right here and it
actually fit together exactly the same
looks like all the buttons are working
all right well I'm just gonna go ahead
and miss rather than feel it awhile and
see how well the d-pad works out so
after having spent some good time using
this thing I gotta say I really really
love this modified iPad I mean yes there
is that fear that if you're gonna modify
your droidcon you might accidentally
brick it destroy it make it totally
unusable and to be honest yes that is a
very valid fear if you're not careful
you could mess things up but as long as
you take your time and take a little bit
of care for it it really isn't that hard
to do and the benefits are awesome I
mean this thing feels completely and
totally natural to use almost like this
was just an official Nintendo joy
constants I was able to put it together
successfully I mean it's still using a
lot of the same internal parts it's just
that instead of having the four
directional buttons out here you've got
this d-pad instead so since all the
internals are the same you're getting
the same snappiness for all the buttons
and even doing rolling motions feels
perfectly natural now where this thing
does get awkward though and this is
really the reason why Nintendo didn't
pursue using a d-pad in the first place
is that when you want to use the
droidcon by itself
sideways you don't actually have any
regular buttons at least on the front
facing you've just got the stick here
start button and then another d-pad with
no regular ABXY array but honestly it's
still completely functional I mean it
feels a little weird at first and it's a
little off-putting but as long as you
still make the connection that you know
these are supposed to be the for regular
buttons still works out perfectly fine
that being said since I have multiple
droid cons to use I'll probably stick
with this one just being on the regular
portable mode and if I want to use some
sideways ones on their own for like a
party game I'll break out different ones
if you're in a situation where you only
have your one set of joy' cons this
might be a reason to maybe hold off just
for now they may have also noticed that
with this upgrade I not only switched
out to having the d-pad on this but I'm
also now using the atomic purple color
now this is something I've talked about
back when I first is the clear
modification on the Joye cons and this
is actually a color that Nintendo is
used a lot in the past and
for comparison here's a gameboy color in
the same style and one thing I'm really
impressed by is actually how closely to
being the exact same these really are
it's not a perfect match the one area
where this is a little different is that
the kind of transparency they use is a
little less hazy it's much more just
straight clear than the official image
no ones are but this definitely captures
the feel of this classic Nintendo style
that I really love you know for a long
time I've been sticking with just using
the red and blue draw icons because like
I said before I love that kind of just
classic game example of red versus blue
but with the addition of the d-pad and
this atomic formal color this might
become my daily driver now if this isn't
the interested in doing but the atomic
purple really isn't your jam the same
guys that make this woman have made a
whole bunch of other colors as well
they've got some more transparent ones
like this that are very reminiscent of
the n64 fantastics but they also have
some solid colors as well like a plain
white if that's more your style I'll
like a couple options down below and
I'll see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
