of the first press conferences we'll be
seeing is Microsoft's on the Sunday
before now last year they brought a
really strong press conference one of
the main reasons being their focus on
the hardware they'd releasing with the
Xbox one X and with last year's they did
end up getting the title of having the
strongest console that's currently on
the market it's a step forward in terms
of the way it uses graphics and the
speed however a problem they're still
running into is when it comes to
exclusive games so what kind of stuff
can we expect to see at this year's e3
that'll help them possibly win
well first let's talk hardware now
obviously with the Xbox one X being
released last year that is already out
of the waste there isn't that much to
focus on the hardware for this year but
I think there's a few things they can
still talk about first off there is of
course the Xbox one adaptive controller
which they already revealed and talked
about pretty in-depth but I think it's
gonna at least make a small appearance
at the show as well something that's
kind of related to that though that I
think could be a new announcement is the
release of a new Xbox one elite
controller now we got one it was already
released before the Xbox one s and it
was a really cool piece of hardware but
with the release of the One X that kind
of feels like it needs a refresh and
there's actually been some supposedly
very blurry leaked photos of a new one
coming out and part of the reason why
there's a little bit of credence to this
rumor is that it features a little bar
design on the front of the controller
which looks like the same thing on the
Xbox one adaptive controller which would
replace the mode switch on the current
elite design aside from that obviously
we're not going to get any new systems
from Xbox but I do think it's possible
that with how long the One X has been
out we might get the reveal of a
redesign not necessarily a fully
different shell or anything but some
more color options because right now we
still just have the plain matte black or
if you're able to get ahold of one the
limited edition Scorpios now hardware is
all well and good but the one big uphill
battle that Xbox has been having a lot
this generation is exclusive titles I
mean we got a couple of releases this
past year but still nothing compared the
sheer number of things that PlayStation
is beginning so if they really want to
win this year's e3 we got to get some
announcements now there are a couple
games we already know about that have
yet to be released that will probably
make an appearance one of the biggest
ones being crackdown 3 which was
supposed to be out by now but got a lot
of push backs hopefully because it's
gonna get the polish that it needs to
make sure it's a strong release now
crackdown 3 is really the only one that
we know for sure is still going on but
there's a couple other games that
microsomes talked about before that have
either been cancelled or entered
development hell that might hopefully
make a reappearance one of the big ones
would be scalebound from Platinum Games
Microsoft has said they want to try and
start working more with Japanese
third-party developers and it'll be a
great one to kick back up to in order to
boost morale another one that I just
keep hoping for is below this is a game
that was announced before the Xbox one
was even released and still isn't out
after who knows how many push backs it's
probably dead but
I really hope it's not he's dead now as
far as actual new stuff that could
happen this year there's actually quite
a few things that are pretty likely now
the one that's pretty much 100 cent per
share chance is Forza horizon for it's
no secret that Microsoft likes to switch
off between Forza Motorsport and 4 it's
the horizon we just got Motorsport last
year so pretty likely we're gonna get
this one as a new horizon game unless
for some reason Microsoft decides to mix
it up and either take a year off or
introduce a new subset of the series
what's even more intriguing though is
that it's an actual possibility that at
this year's e3 we could see
announcements for both of Microsoft's
biggest exclusive FPS as Gears of War
and Halo now Gears of War we're pretty
sure it is going to happen because of
the Walmart leak that happened earlier
this month in which they revealed a
whole bunch of games including rage and
new Borderlands and of course Gears of
War 5 now as for halo there's no actual
news saying that's gonna happen but the
dev cycle seems to line up so that we
would be getting a new one announced for
this year because it's been three years
since Halo 5 it is possible that maybe
Gila wars 2 through that schedule off a
little bit and they don't want to have
both Gears Ward Hill at the same time
but honestly they need all the morale
they can get so having both those
together would be awesome something else
worth considering is anthem the next big
game coming out from Bioware and EA and
anthem is not an xbox one exclusive but
it might be one of those situations
where the Xbox one version gets a little
extra love it did premiere at last
year's Xbox one III event so we might
see things like early access DLC on the
Xbox one versus other systems a unique
DLC it might run best on the Xbox one X
all kind of reasons that might make the
Xbox one version of anthem the
definitive version now beyond all that
there's of course gonna be some
announcements for things like indie
games more multi-platform stuff but as
far as exclusive Microsoft stuff goes
we're gonna have to reach a little more
now one thing that has been speculated
on a lot is that there's a new fable
game in development there were rumors of
that earlier this year and whether or
not that's something we'll see this year
I'm not sure because if they start a
development this year it's very unlikely
to be released in late 2018 unless they
were rushing it very heavily
or maybe they kept it really quiet and
it's been development for a while either
way hopefully will at least get a teaser
trailer for it even if it's for the far
future something I mentioned earlier too
is that Phil Spencer has made comments
about wanting to reach out and work more
with Japanese third-party developers now
plaid
one of those companies they worked with
before and hopefully they're just doing
scalebound again but it's not maybe
something new would be really cool
it's also possible they could try
reviving some of the small number of
JRPGs that were unique to the xbox360
like blue dragon and lost Odyssey so how
likely is all of this stuff to happen
all at once probably not very likely but
if they were hit even 70% of the stuff
that we listed risk now it could be a
really strong conference the big thing
they really need to do is just up the
number of exclusives whether that's
stuff that's coming out this holiday or
for early next year we just need to know
that stuff is happening because that's
the one area Xbox really needs to bulk
up they've got the system now we just
need the library</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
