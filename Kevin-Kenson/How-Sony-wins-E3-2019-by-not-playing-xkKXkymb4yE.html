weeks away from E3 2019.
A huge event in gaming.
A ton of people are hyped up for it.
We're gonna get all kinds of announcements
about a lot of big games.
And despite all the energy
going into it, I find myself
asking the question, do
we really need E3 anymore?
(upbeat music)
And this is a thought
that even gaming companies
have been having.
I mean after all him a
few years ago EA left E3,
although it was to form their own event
that happens at the same time.
But an even bigger example is
that this year's upcoming E3,
for the first time ever
since the first E3 in 1995,
Sony will not be attending.
Sony no bologna.
Walkman no phony.
And the argument that he
gives actually lines up a lot
with the things I've been thinking about.
Now I'm heavily paraphrasing here,
but the basic idea is this,
is that when E3 was formed
back in the 90s, it was a
very traditional trade show.
Meaning that it was really
only trying to do two things.
One, be a one-stop-shop for journalists
to all see all the big upcoming games
and things announced so they can report
on it all at the same time.
And two, a way for retailers to interface
with different gaming companies.
So that way whatever
Sony can argue to Walmart
why you need to carry a Playstation.
On the journalism side
of things, the Internet
has made sharing of
information super easy.
You don't really need
to have one big event
everyone goes to to get stuff.
There's news cycles
happening all the time.
And on the retail side
of things, well Sony
doesn't really need to
convince anyone right now
to buy their stuff.
Playstation's are selling
themselves pretty well.
So Sony decided to leave E3 this year,
and instead focused on
creating their own news cycle.
Which is why we've been
seeing those state of plays
they've been experimenting
with, where they just announced
a couple games and show
little demos back-to-back
instead of having one big
announcement just in June.
And this is a concept that
isn't unique to Sony at all.
I think Nintendo is another
really good example of this,
because while they are still attending E3
and still give it quite a bit of love,
they treat it very much like
just another Nintendo Direct,
but with just a little extra.
Nintendo is already tackling
the idea of making news
when they want to.
Saving announcements
for when they wanna line
it up just before release,
instead of relying
on just doing one big
conference every year.
Instead when E3 comes around
they just give a little extra
time and focus a little
more on some games,
and have a cool way of
creating an awesome booth
to get fans involved and
excited to play these games.
And that's really the
main argument for why E3
I think is still going on right
now and has energy behind.
The fans.
It's transformed into
something entirely different,
where it's not really a
trade show, it's a fan event.
Another aspect to that I
think gives it a little energy
right now is the long-standing competition
a lot of these companies
have with each other as well.
Because unless everyone starts
dropping out all at once,
as long as some people are
still making a big deal
out of E3, other companies need to respond
at least a little bit.
I mean even Sony, who's
dropping out this year,
is still doing their
days of play promotion.
Which is always a big way
of trying to get people
hyped up for this news cycle because hey,
look at all this cool
PlayStation stuff on sale,
look at this limited-edition system.
They might not be at E3,
but that's not stopping them
from paying attention the
fact that hey, everyone else
is making really big
announcements, we need
to make sure we say something
around the same time
so people don't start thinking that we're
on the losing side.
But even with that energy
momentum still going
on, it doesn't change the
fact that Sony has chosen
to step out this year.
Possibly permanently.
And if that's the case, is
that a cue that other companies
are going to follow and
choose to leave as well?
There's a part of me that's
saddened by this idea.
Because like a lot of other
gamers out there, I look forward
to E3 every single year.
It's that time where we're
getting way more trailers
than we'll ever see the
rest of the year around.
And you just watch each of the
press conferences wondering
how each one's gonna try
and outdo the other one.
The thing is, the more I've
been thinking about all this,
the more I'm starting to
believe that while I do love
all the hype that goes into
E3, I can't help but wonder
if it's actually causing
more problems than benefits.
Year after year we have
all these press conferences
where we get new announcements
of games and everyone
gets super hype about it, but
a lot of times in retrospect,
it's not as great as it was
when we were first watching it.
Either because trailers
for games ended up being
very misleading. they're
misdirecting, it's based
on stuff that doesn't actually
make it into the final
version of the game.
It's more of a mock-up
than an actual demo.
And other times we get game
announcements that are announced
solely for the sake of
getting people excited
that it's happening, and no
indication of when it's actually
happening, if at all.
A great example of this,
something that people kept
clamoring on for years
and years was the idea
of a Final Fantasy 7 remake.
Which Sony did eventually announce,
and then not really talk
about for four more years
until recently when we
were getting more info
and might actually learn
that it's coming out
sometime in the relative near future.
In the rush for all these companies to try
and make the biggest and
best presentation possible,
we end up with announcements
that don't really
live up to what actually
happens years later.
And in a lot of cases dev teams
are forced to try and make
something work just in time for the show,
that isn't necessarily gonna
be what the final product
is really like.
This also pressures
companies to try and save
all their announcements just
in time for this one thing,
or force things to be
ready just in time for it.
As opposed to a model like
what Nintendo's doing,
or even what Sony is beginning
to do with State of Play,
where they just do
announcements as time goes
by, and waits to make
sure that all the games
they're working on are actually
going at a smooth pace,
and the updates are reflecting real stuff
that's gonna be on its way.
Going back to that
interview with Sean Layden.
This is an idea he brings up as well,
talking about the fact
that Sony as a game company
right now wants to focus
on major first party titles
and release them when they're finished.
They're not trying to meet
any kind of specific deadline
to show certain gameplay, they're
not trying to force things
to fit in a specific cycle.
But instead just try
to build hype as things
are being completed.
Which honestly is kind
of the better situation.
It doesn't have the same
kind of hype building
that E3 gives us, but it
leads to better product.
There is a lot happening in
the game space right now.
Whether that's reports of more
more companies falling prey
to massive crunch that sometimes
leads to botched launches
at them, or situations where
countries are now beginning
to ban loot box progression,
which is a core part
of lots of major game releases.
And as part of all these major changes
as companies begin to reexamine
how they wanna approach
game development cycles,
I just have to wonder
if maybe part of that is it's time
for E3 to step out.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
