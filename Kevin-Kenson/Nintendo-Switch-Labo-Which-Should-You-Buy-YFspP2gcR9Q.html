actually really cool
you know when I first saw the idea
behind this in the trailers I thought it
was a neat idea I thought was a little
interesting kind of thing but now after
having actually built stuff and messed
with it it is intense the kind of stuff
that this can teach kids and just the
way all the different mechanisms work
and how you see putting these cardboard
things together works but here's the
thing there's two different kits so if
you're curious about grabbing one of
them you might be debating well I don't
want to go all in and grab both right
away which one do I pick up first do you
go for this guy right here the variety
pack which comes with stuff like a
fishing rod a little bike piano which
has been featured a lot or do you spend
extra ten bucks and get the big ol robot
kit well let's talk about what each one
is gonna offer you now at first glance
the variety kit definitely seems like
the way you'd want to go I mean after
all first off it even has a little oh
one in the corner here kind of saying
that oh this is the first one maybe you
should get as far as Nintendo's
concerned and the idea here is that
you're not getting as big of one cool
thing like you might with a robot but
you're getting a lot more variety that
might kind of showcase all the different
little things that labo is capable of
and at the same time does this mean that
you have to absolutely use this before
you can jump into the robot let's go
ahead and build it and see all right
let's build this robot
No
look these complex mechanisms I'm
building
it's all good under what this is though
there's holes on the side all right so
now that we've built a bunch of stuff
let's actually check out some of the
games that come in both a variety pack
and of course the big robot setup Jesus
all just a mess this feels really
ridiculous all right
it's young good feeling good oh that's
cool you can actually see like the the
pulleys on the back of the robot
matching fucking fly oh alright so next
ready to the piano which once again is
another one where you could just slop
the switch into a little slot right here
but what we've a big monitor let's
actually do it on TV
so I don't play piano so this is none of
this is gonna sound good like it all I
just make sounds so it's kind of weird
about this one is that it came with
other stuff so let's let's put one of
these guys in and see what happens old
man in the corner oh I see cats
well I'm never using any other option
now oh okay I don't know if the mic
speaking does it really well but it's
the joy calls are just vibrating and
you're creating like a frequency that
makes a piano sound they're not piano
sound but you know a tone that's really
cool that's a really cool thing about
this thing too is in it I mean obviously
teaches kids things when they're putting
it together and the whole process of
building something but it's also just
other little weird scientific
applications that does like showing you
harmonic frequency by just having the
drink on vibrate and make music let's
try this out let's go this is like an
almost extra version of doing Mario Kart
where you actually have a whole little
bike ahead of you know passing it's cool
to air like inside of here I didn't
record putting this one together but
there's a rubber band inside this handle
so I'm always getting a little bit of
force back from pulling the ax for
accelerating whatever the term is we'll
just cut that line yeah there's
something just really cool about having
assembled this yourself and then playing
a game with it yeah first place the HD
Rumble even like does this thing where
it's the engine like calming down at the
end so it just kind of starts to just
vibrate a little slower it's ridiculous
this is it's it's dumb how kind of cool
this is yeah I mean these are all still
definitely very mini gaming it almost
reminds me of playing like one of the
old like Wii Sports games but that's
cool so after having actually built a
bunch of the stuff and playing a lot of
the games I got to say that honestly
when it comes to which one to grab first
you can kind of go either way I mean
when you first think about it look at it
and even going to this video I really
thought the variety pack was going to be
the obvious first choice I mean it's a
little cheaper there's a couple
different things
yeah the robot idea is cool but you can
do the piano you can do the fusion hook
there's just more stuff going on the
variety kit but the robot is actually
really fun and it's not that much harder
to do at all even if you already played
with one of the other kits the robot one
still runs you through the same basic
tutorial and while it certainly takes
longer than any of the variety pack sets
it just takes longer it's not any more
difficult and all the kind of stuff that
you have to go through while building it
is the same kind of stuff you have to
deal with in the variety pack as well
now of course the obvious strength of
variety kit is well the variety yeah the
robot school but the Veronica just comes
with more stuff you get the fishing rod
you get the bike you get all this kind
of and stuff but all the games built
around them are very simple and
straightforward they're very focused on
this concept of here's just what this
thing can do whether that's racing on a
track or playing piano and the
experiences are a little more reliant on
you having to actually kind of build
upon them you know you're trying to play
music of piano you're building your own
courses with the bike but on the other
hand the robot while it is just the one
game it feels like a more fully formed
actual gaming experience I mean there's
a scoring system you can customize the
robot there's much more in-depth
controls and there's a whole lot more
going on with this contraption that
you're building to play it I mean yeah
the variety kit does have all these
different things going on but they are
altom utley much simpler experiences
whereas the robot feels like something
you can spend a lot more time doing
especially if you enjoyed the structure
of a video game at the end of the day if
you're debating the doing which needs to
start with honestly you could go either
way if you like the look of the robot
but you're worried that I don't know I'm
gonna miss out on something by not
starting with the variety kit maybe it's
not gonna teach me stuff right don't be
worried at all it's still very simple
very doable it just takes more time to
do with the one project so it really
just comes down to what you're more
interested in if you want to do the
variety kit you're gonna get more ideas
that kind of the basic stuff that Lavo
can do it gives you a more kind of
versatile approach but the robot is this
really intense thing where it's kind of
just taking everything and putting it
together because it's nuts the kind of
stuff these labo kits can teach kids I
mean it's not just the construction of
the cardboard but creating pulley
systems using reflective tape with the
Joye cons IR sensor to actually notice
things like that's how the robot works
it sees these pulleys that you make go
up and down and that figures out raising
the legs punching the arms it's just so
insanely cool</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
