(instrumental music)
(chimes)
(techno music)
With the Switch in
existence, what is the future
of Nintendo handheld consoles?
Will they make a follow up to the new 3DS
that's in the same vein
as those handhelds,
or will they keep making different
iterations of the Switch?
As far as I'm concerned,
the Switch is the
continuation of handhelds.
Yes, the new 3DS's were kept
around for a while longer,
and the Switch is kind of this odd melding
of their traditional mainline
systems and handhelds,
but I don't see there being
another handheld system
that's separate from the Switch,
co-existing at the same time.
The 3DS kind of went through
the rest of it's life cycle
much longer than I think
anyone really anticipated
or thought it would, and that's it.
So if we're going to get
another handheld in the future,
it's either something entirely new,
or it's a new Switch ideration.
I don't think there's any kind of new 3DS
or dedicated smaller portable.
It's Switch, or it's new.
I think what's actually a
more interesting question
that no one's really asking is
are we going to get another traditional
home console system of Nintendo?
Because a lot of people, I think, again,
equate the Switches as being both of those
and it's considered a mainline.
Which is mostly true,
but it's still basically
a portable handheld
that you can also hook up to a TV.
In my mind, its a portable first.
So with that logic,
really, it kind of makes sense
that if we did get a Switch 2
in the future or if they just focused
on making 1.5 versions of the Switch,
whether it's a mini, or a pro or whatever,
there's totally the chance that Nintendo
could work on a more powerful,
traditional home console
that relies on some other
kind of interesting,
different gimmick.
Whether that's more motion
controls like the WII did,
the tablet set up that WII U had,
or something entirely new that
we're not even considering.
You know, the big thing I think Nintendo
has been known for the last
couple system releases,
is not going the direction
a lot of people think they are going to
and they could totally
catch us by surprise again.
How do yo think Project
Xcloud from Microsoft
will compare to Google's Stadia?
It's a slightly weird situation
because we don't know
everything specifically
about Xcloud yet,
we understand how it's going to work,
but we don't know full
things about pricing,
or what games are going to be included,
that kind of thing.
But based on how I assume it would work,
I think Google Stadia
is going to be something that
works better,
but Microsoft is going to be something
that's a lot more attractive
to a lot of people.
Mainly because it's a
platform that already exists.
With Google Stadia, you have to buy games,
even if you already own them
on another platform previously.
If you want to do the 4K kind of stuff,
you have to have that premium membership,
you're buying a specialized controller,
there's a lot more going
on getting into it.
Whereas project Xcloud,
is very open receiving
to people that are already Xbox users.
You already have an Xbox One controller,
you already might have an Xbox Live Gold
and Xbox game pass account
which might tie in together.
I mean, if project Xcloud
allows you to take games
that you own on game pass and
play them wherever you are,
that is a much easier system to get into
and is going to be a lot more
appealing to a lot of people.
So, I think Stadia is going to
have the raw power behind it,
but it's a bit of a steep
investment for Google to get into
whereas Xbox is just
going to be really easy
to pick up people that just
want to try it and get hooked.
Now of course, it's totally a possibility
that Stadia could just
catch me entirely off guard,
again, we don't fully know everything
about how project Xcloud is gonna work
and a large part of the
apprehension about Stadia,
is that streaming games like this
is just still kind of new tech.
We've had a few examples of it in the past
and none of them have been super great,
I mean anyone that's used PlayStation now,
yeah, sometimes it's good,
a lot of times, its not.
And if you want to play more
modern up to date games,
that are even more demanding,
well that's even harder to do right
so a lot of hinges on
just how well the service
is gonna work and maybe
Stadia will surprise us.
Maybe it'll be a perfectly
stable awesome thing,
and it explodes in
popularity and that's cool,
or maybe it doesn't and we
wait for the next big thing.
Can we get a BTS tour?
So, yes and no, because I'm
not gonna do a tour right now,
but there's actually already a video
that shows off where we are right now
but in other directions and angles.
John, who I work with, did a
tour of our office at up here,
a studio where we do all of our shooting,
we'll go ahead and link that video
so you guys can check that out.
What is your favorite
video game soundtrack?
Oh, that's tough.
There's a lot that I really, really like,
for very different reasons.
Some of my top ones
are probably the
soundtrack for Transistor,
Nier Automata, really everything
that (mumbles) has done
Chrono Trigger is really up there for me,
look guys, I can go on forever about this.
I'm just gonna stop myself
now because that's--
Chrono Cross as well,
even though I don't like
the game quite as much,
the soundtracks--
Basically all of Final
Fantasy at least up 'til 10
half the Castlevania
games which to be honest,
most of the time the are just
remixes of the same songs,
but it works.
(techno music)
Oh, Child of Light, that's
another really good one,
Journey, on that same note.
Basically that entire genre
of like,
whimsical sounding indie games,
for very different reasons, Rayman Orgins.
For very different reasons.
Are you excited for the Sega Genesis Mini?
Yes, I am.
[Man]- Sega, Mega Drive
(in foreign language)
- Because I did not grow
up in a Sega household,
I was able to play a couple
games when I was a kid
at friends houses and stuff,
but I never really played
through a lot of stuff.
I did start working on a couple of them
when the Mega SG came out,
because that lets you play
actual old school Genesis games
on a modern TV which is cool,
but it also requires me
to actually hunt down
and collect Genesis
games I didn't own yet,
So, I've played some of them
but there's a lot more
that are on the Mini
that I'm really excited to finally play,
'cause they've been on my
backlog for a very long time.
What genre of game do you think,
needs more representation overall?
Oh, that's tough,
'cause there's a bias
part of me where I'm like,
oh yeah, we just need tons
more of this kind of game
and it actually probably has
plenty of indie spin off's
that are cool and I'm
just greedy and want more.
What's something that
we don't get a lot of?
I feel like we could probably
use another resurgence
of beat 'em up games.
There's a few indie titles
that have kind of done it
and we've seen a small return of them
with collections of classic games,
but there hasn't been
a really good new one
for a little bit.
We had like a mini renaissance
of it in the late 2000's
like Scott Pilgrim and Castle Crashers
and again there's still some
indie titles here and there
but I could definitely use a lot more.
I'd also like more
kind of puzzle hybrid games
if that makes sense.
I really loved Clash of Heroes on the 3DS.
Might Magic Clash Heroes,
not the phone game thing,
but I really love that kind of genre
where it's this fusion of puzzle solving
but it's also RPG tactics, I don't know,
it's a weird thing that
there's not enough of,
and I could use more.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
