on the E3 show floor,
and while there are a lot
of awesome games to try out,
one of the things that
has been really awesome
that I got to actually have hands-on with
is a new controller coming
from Hori, the Split Pad Pro.
Now they just announced
this on the second day
of the E3 show floor, and
what it is is a new set
of joy-cons designed for
the Switch that attach
directly to the sides
and offer a much larger,
more comfortable grip design.
To be clear, the controller I got to use
is a prototype version
of the final product,
it is a fully-functional one
so I was able to play games
with it, but the final version's
gonna be a little different
having a different plastic,
different finishes,
and overall probably
just up the comfort level
a bit more than what I got to experience.
That being said, honestly,
it was awesome to use.
I always like using my
switch in handheld mode,
but sometimes it's not the
most comfortable experience.
The joy-cons are really nice to use
when they're on their own floating,
but on the sides of the switch
it just gets very uncomfortable over time.
It doesn't really have
anything in the form
of a traditional grip,
and that is something
that this controller adds.
Now just like with their
d-pad joy-con attachment,
these are only working when
connected directly to the Switch
so they are to be used wirelessly
or floating in the air,
but the main goal with
this is so that you can
use your Switch in handheld mode
with a much more comfortable grip style.
It's gonna be really
important for more competitive
or intense games.
Along with the larger size of the joy-cons
and the curved shaping that
gives it an actual grip design,
there are a lot of other
little updates and changes
to these controllers, as well.
They do have larger
buttons, everything's spaced
a little bit differently to
add a little more comfort,
especially if you have larger hands.
It also features additional
buttons on the back
of each of these joy-con attachments
that will give you an additional
button you can program.
You'll notice on the demo unit I'm using
there are four sets of
buttons that are laying
on the bottom parts of these joy-cons.
There's actually two sets of
these same pair of buttons
because they apply to
each joy-con individually,
they're not connected in any kind of way,
they are, technically,
their own controllers.
One button acts as a turbo
feature while the other one
is the programming
button used to figure out
what button you want to
use for those back buttons
you're able to press for easy access.
Honestly, this is a product
that I am really excited to see,
because while there are
a lot of the third-party
controller options out
there for the Switch
there hasn't been any
officially licensed joy-con
alternatives just yet, aside
from Hori's own d-pad joy-con.
Again, while that adds a
d-pad, it doesn't actually
change the shape of the
joy-cons, themselves,
so this is the first time
we're seeing an actual licensed
product that giving you a
more comfortable grip design.
And yes, there are options
out there that you can find
and buy that might even offer things
like wireless connectivity,
but often times
they're not actually that
great of an idea to grab.
So having an actual licensed
product that's giving us
a larger joy-con with
the Switch is a big win.
As far as pricing these are
going from an MSRP of $50,
which I think is at about the right price.
If you get the individual d-pad joy-con
that goes for 25, sometimes 20 bucks,
so this gonna be basically
doubling the cost
to give you two of these
larger joy-con attachments,
plus the increased size and having
the extra button on the back.
They're slated to be
coming out at the same time
as Daemon Ex Machina, which
these particular split pads
are designed to be kinda
based on the same image of.
In fact they have really
nice subtle branding
of just replacing the x on the x-button
with the Daemon Ex Machina
symbol, which is cool.
I did talk to them about
any kind of potential
future designs they
could be doing as well,
and while Daemon Ex Machina
is the one official one
they'll be doing, there is the chance that
if this does well we're
gonna see more designs
come out in the future
featuring other games.
Again, the one I was using
was a prototype design,
so some of the chief differences
that appear to be happening
between what I used and what's
gonna be happening at launch:
different thumbstick tops
that are gonna be red
instead of just the black that
you see on this prototype,
and the biggest thing is the grip change.
The shape of the grip
is going to be the same,
which I did find to be really comfortable,
but the final design is
going to feature something
that instead of just
being a smooth plastic
like the prototype, is
going to be designed
similar to what we see
on Switch pro controllers
where its that kinda smooth plastic
but with little dotted
texturing so it adds
just a little extra grip comfort to it.
Looks like we're gonna have
that same kind of design
which is a big plus.
I've been waiting a while
to see some official joy-con
alternatives come out,
and I'm so happy that Hori
is kicking things off
and I'm excited to see
what else might be
coming out in the future.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
