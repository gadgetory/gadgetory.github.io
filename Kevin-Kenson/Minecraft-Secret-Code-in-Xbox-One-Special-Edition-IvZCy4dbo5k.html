approaching you know what that means
lots and lots of special edition systems
and one of the first ones came out is
this minecraft themed Xbox one that's
right we're gonna rip open right now and
take a look at oh man
so immediately everything is still
minecraft named little little info setup
pamphlet just all green and grassy same
deal here got stone little love on the
bottom wow they really went all out with
like the just the theme of this thing
actually really cool packaging let's
check out inside HDMI cable more
importantly the controller for this
system which is also my craft theme
specifically it's a creeper so hopefully
this one won't actually explode on you
but as usual this is a 1 s style
controller so does the little bit better
grip and the built-in Bluetooth and more
importantly unique to this one the
backside TNT for the battery cover and
then in here we've got some additional
paperwork for it still just keeping the
themed hallway stand for the Xbox one
and download code for Minecraft on Xbox
along with a game pass I believe in here
as well and then this brings us to of
course the main reason we're opening
this thing minecraft edition Xbox one so
this is actually really real
whoa that's frickin awesome look I'm
gonna be honest right now I am not like
the biggest minecraft fan I've tried it
just wasn't really for me but this
design it's actually really really cool
I love the way they kind of just adapted
the style of the game to this Xbox I
mean just an awesome and this is
actually the second special edition Xbox
one us that we've got there's been a few
other releases but the zola just be kind
of like a single color bundled with
another game whereas this is actually a
special unique design the first of which
was actually the Gears of War for one
right back there which was a bit of an
old HUD system that was just blood-red
with these claw marks on it and all
kinds of insane stuff this is a little
more subdued but honestly I think this
is
way better design because there's just
so many different layers of detail going
on with this I mean first off there's
the whole concept of what it is we have
the kind of grass and dirt on the top
here and beneath it is the bedrock which
forms the base of the system which also
just makes a really good color contrast
I think and then like we showed earlier
on the bottom we've got some Red Rock
powder and down here which a really cool
thing I don't know how clear it is on
camera but the fact that you actually
have a surface level one and then it
breaks through this translucent layer
onto the actual hardware inside so it
creates this kind of depth to it that's
really cool there's also this text we
noticed here that's like the Minecraft
script I have no idea what this says
we're trying to pay that right now but
we'll see there's just so many good
design decisions here in little details
that make this really awesome design
that I think anyone who's a fan of
minecraft would absolutely fall in love
with this detail is not unique to just
the system there's actually even more to
go with the controllers that I realized
earlier for instance the TLT on the back
actually is this thin a little black
line that leads to the front of the
controller which is absolutely
unnecessary but really cool they
actually paid that much attention to it
and this is not the only minecraft
controller we're getting for this now
waltz nut bundle with the system
separately sold I did this pig what what
huh I did it did what oh did you get the
translation I got the translation okay
what is the text of the bombsite I sent
Andrew to go figure out what the text on
the bottom was so that's after lots of
computer mining or internet mining never
dig straight down huh
that's a lot more specific they thought
I was gonna be like hello gamers or
something yeah it's really weird cuz
everyone else talks about how the
Minecraft language is just gibberish in
the game but like someone figured out
alphabet for it it's from Commander Keen
you know there's like super specific
it's the universal space code now as I
was saying for that little revelation
about the text we do have one other
controller that's minecraft mean that
came out just a few days ago you can
grab separately and this is one themed
off the pigs from minecraft now just
like with a creeper one there's actually
quite a bit of detail going on here
obviously have like the eyes of the pig
and stuff of the front but on the back
look really cute tail so this is just
all it all awesome stuff coming out for
Minecraft as far as these special
edition items go the system itself is
exclusive to target in the Microsoft
Store right now but the controllers you
can grab separately by themselves from
pretty much anywhere like I said earlier
I am not the world's biggest Minecraft
fans but the amount of detail that went
in the system this is honestly one of
the coolest special editions that
Microsoft has put out and if this is any
kind of sign of the quality we're going
to see four more of them coming out in
the future I am just super excited
because this this is freaking awesome</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
