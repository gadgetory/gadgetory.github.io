that's been going around
for about the past week
is the potential of
a limited edition Switch
based on Super Smash Bros.
And the whole reason why
this rumor is circulating
is because supposedly an
image of it was leaked
on a European retailer website.
Now you can't find this image anymore
as far as going to the
actual website itself
but there are several people who have
taken screenshots of it
and for the most part it's
a pretty small, blurry image
but it gives some ideas
of, if this is real,
what it looks like.
Now based on what we
can see on the packaging
it doesn't show us every little bit
about the Switch itself.
We can't see the back
of the main Switch unit
so it's possible that it's
just a regular Switch design
but it could have something special.
As for what we can see,
it does appear to have
specially designed joy-cons
and a dock.
Now for the joy-cons it's a
design similar to what we're
seeing for the pro controller
that has been confirmed.
Where it features the
main smash logo of the two
crossed lines
but in this case it
doesn't feature the circle
going around them,
it's just two lines
going over both joy-cons.
As for the dock itself,
it looks as though it's
keeping the same main
Nintendo logo in the middle
but then on either side
of it are two pillars
of multiple characters all
kinda crunched together.
Which is kinda similar
to what we're seeing
on the cover art for
Super Smash Bros. Ultimate
and it's very very similar
to the design that they had
for the Smash Brothers
3DS special edition.
Which on the one had
is kind of a cool idea,
on the other it's more reasons
why I'm not entirely sure
this is actually real.
The design of it, well?
Kind of interesting and cool.
It just doesn't feel like an
actual Nintendo design to me.
And I don't think this
discounts the possibility
that we are getting a
special edition Switch,
I just don't think this is
necessarily what its going
to actually look like.
Now if this is real or if
we are at least getting
a Super Smash Bros. special
edition this would be
the second one that Nintendo
has released alongside
the Monster Hunter double
cross edition that is
only available in Japan.
And both that design and what
we're seeing from this design
honestly, underwhelm me a little bit.
Now the only reason I'm being
a little bit harsh about this
is because I really want
Nintendo to make more
special edition Switch systems
but I also want them to
take notes from what they've
been doing with the 2DS
because they have been
absolutely killing it
when it comes to making
awesome special edition 2DS's.
Whether that's the Poké
Ball, Animal Crossing,
the Hylian Shield,
or most recently the
Minecraft design in Japan.
There's just a lot of really
cool intricate designs
and it's a little bit of a
letdown to see in comparison
on the Switch just regular
colors with decals.
And it just really gets
the brain going for
what Nintendo could do in the near future
as far as special edition
designs for games go.
By the way just because there's
not a lot of special edition
Switches just yet doesn't
mean you can't start
customizing your current switch
to match your favorite franchises.
For instance this one right
here which we were able to make
thanks to today's sponsor, Dbrand.
They've made a whole bunch
of different Switch skins
that you can get in a
whole variety of colors.
You can use 'em for the
Switch itself, the joy-cons
or the dock.
Right now I'm going with
this yellow and orange design
'cause it reminds me of Metroid.
If you're interested in
grabbing these for yourself
make sure you check out
the link down below.
There are so many cool
things Nintendo could do
for special edition Switch
designs beyond just doing
the basic color pallette and
putting some decals on top.
I mean, just look at what
they've done for their
pro controller designs in the past.
I mean yeah, we've gotten
joy-cons that come in colors
like the splatoon one
but if we got an actual
special edition system
where it had matching joy-con colors
and then actual attention to detail on
the Switch shell itself where
you're seeing things like
the little paint splats.
Words. There's words there.
There's so much going on here
and none of that's really happening with
their Switch design so far.
Now obviously there are
some limitations to what
Nintendo can do to their special editions.
For instance they can't
really mess much with
the physical shape of the Switch itself
'cause it still needs to fit in the dock.
But that's actually where
one of my biggest complaints
comes from.
Is why are we seeing all
these boring dock designs.
There is absolutely no reason
why any special edition
Switch should come with
a regularly shaped dock.
Because all that really
matters is you need something
for the Switch to sit it
and that can connect to your TV.
Beyond that there's no
reason it has to have
the same basic box shape
and it can't instead
have any kind of crazy
colors or weird designs.
Imagine a Metroid special edition system
which features all the cool colors
and everything associated
with the Metroid franchise,
kinda like what we saw with
the Samus Returns 3DS XL,
but then a dock design
that's actually Samus's ship.
Or another mainline Pokémon
game is on the way next year.
What if we had something
where there was a giant
Poké Ball for a Pokémon dock.
And it uses the red and white
colors for the joy-cons.
And even Zelda, even though
we're probably years away
from actual brand new Zelda game,
there's nothing stopping
Nintendo from doing some kind of
HD collection of classic Zelda games
and having a special edition
system come out for it.
Since the Switch has come
out I think Nintendo's been
doing a great job of
coming up with some fun,
inventive ideas of how
to use this new design.
But I think there's so
much more they can tap into
and special editions is
a great next place to go.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
