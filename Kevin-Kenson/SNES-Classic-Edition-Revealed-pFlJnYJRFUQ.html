happened Nintendo has announced the SNES
classic edition I got to say overall are
pretty happy with it I mean I do have
some misgivings here and there but the
benefits from what's been announced
definitely outweigh them so let's go
over the basics really quick it's going
to be coming out on September 29th maybe
at $80 rather than 60 20 bucks more than
the NES classic but the reason for that
is that this one will be shipping with
two controllers which just makes so much
sense you know I think they're really
big selling point of the NES classic
edition and now the SNES is that it's a
one-stop place to play a lot of your
favorite retro games so a weird thing
with the NES was that shipping with one
controller meant you were kind of stuck
sometimes you know a lot of those games
are best done in coop or vs. and being
sold separately oftentimes they would
sell out so you buy the system can't
find another controller now you're stuck
with only the one player game so
shipping with two makes a lot of sense
what is still kind of weird though is
the cable length now there's been rumors
circulating that Nintendo is not going
to be shipping it with a three foot long
cable acting yes which was pretty much
unusable and they are now upgrading to
five feet which is better now of course
the biggest thing though is what games
are going to be on the system and that's
where things are a little bit more mixed
primarily because it's only going to
have a library of 21 games nine games
less than the NES classic which feels
like a weird choice to me too because I
feel like the SNES has the densest
selection of strong Nintendo titles and
yet you're going to give it the smaller
library for this release on the other
hand though all the games on it are
really strong choices I mean looking at
this list there's not a single one that
makes me go oh why do they pick that why
is that there there's obviously some
games that I want added in but
everything here are strong choices now
when it comes up the game is missing the
biggest most glaring omission to me is
Chrono Trigger one of the best RPGs ever
made one of the best SNES games period
and it's not going to be on the system
which is especially awkward because
there's already a number of other Square
Enix titles on here like Super Mario RPG
Final Fantasy 3 which is actually follow
my Nexus 6 it's really confusing with
localization the point is core trigger
is one of the best games to come out on
the system and it is not there I would
also have loved to have seen Donkey Kong
Country 2 on here instead of Donkey Kong
Country 1 but
I get why they made a choice there's
also the fact that there is not a single
side-scrolling beat'em up in sight for
the classic which was a great Jean on
the SNES I mean we had three different
final fight games a Battletoads game
TMNT turtles in time one of the best
beat'em ups i've ever made and it's not
making its way to the classic now it's
really interesting about this library
isn't what few games are missing that I
wish were there but one game that
actually somehow made its way onto it
Star Fox - a game that actually never
released anywhere now the reason for
this is that Star Fox 2 was cancelled
when it was already finished and
developed but intended decided to hold
back because the Institute for was
coming soon the ps1 was already out and
basically any 3d games that came out in
the SNES would not look good in
comparison to what the ps1 could do with
its hardware so they decided to back off
we didn't get Star Fox 2 and instead got
Star Fox 64 which was an amazing game
there have been some leaked versions of
Star Fox 2 that have been playable in
ROM form but this is going to be the
first time we actually get the chance to
play the final complete version of the
game which is a really great form of fan
service that Nintendo's doing for people
now of course the big fear with the
system that everyone is having is the
fact that the NES was horrible when it
came to how much supply was around
everywhere and those things sold out
like that classic edition I mean those
things sold out like that and there was
never seeming to be enough for all the
demand so people are wondering is this
going to happen again with the SNES well
Nintendo has actually given an official
statement about this in response to
Kotaku in that they are going to be
making more SNES than they did the NES
but just like with the SNES it is going
to be a limited release they are going
to be producing and selling them
officially from September 29th til the
end of the year with no plans for what's
happening after that so there's still
definitely be a scramble for the system
but hopefully it's not quite as bad as
it was with the NES classic as of right
now there is no official news for a
super famicom classic edition coming out
in Japan but Amazon UK has already put
up pre-orders for their version of the
classic Edition which historically
actually uses the same shell as the
family which is really cool so I'm going
to put a link for that down below in
description as soon as the US version
goes up even though the plugs disappear
immediately I'll add that to description
as well I'll see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
