to dominate the home console market
despite now getting some competition
from the Sega Master System which does
offer more powerful hardware but nowhere
near as strong of a game library this
year we also saw sequels to some of 86's
best games that just didn't live up to
the originals and we saw a few more of
today's biggest franchises get their
start so here are the best games of 1987
first up is the original Double Dragon
natchez R if you grew up in the 80s you
probably spend a lot of time in arcades
busting heads open left and right with
baseball bats in this classic
side-scrolling beat'em up which is
exactly what makes this game so
important Double Dragon introduced us to
the side-scrolling beat-em-up genre as
we know it today bringing us a style of
game where you're not just simply
punching and kicking bad guys but you're
using their own weapons against them
you're listening to an awesome
soundtrack and you get so caught up and
gratuitous violence that you're not even
sure when you're supposed to move on
until the game tells you to well you
could do this all by yourself the game
was at its absolute best when tackling
it in two-player co-op especially when
you've survived four stages of random
mooks throwing themselves at you to die
only to find out that the final boss is
each other next up is the original Metal
Gear now I sense some of you are pulling
back and you might be saying to
yourselves middle gear on the NES sucked
which is true
Metal Gear on the NES was terrible
because it was a stripped-down weaker
version of the original game on the msx2
which only came out in Japan and Europe
see the original game made stealth
matter because if you got caught
you'd be swarmed by enemies pouring in
from off screen and the only way to end
it would be to kill everybody or go to a
whole new area meanwhile the NES version
didn't do this at all and only had the
game's lighter alert mode which wasn't
nearly as challenging it also screwed up
by butchering the game's level design
and replacing the final boss of badass
mech called Metal Gear the very thing
the game's named after and replaces it
with four dudes with guns guarding a
super computer this version was so bad
that the creator Hideo Kojima disowned
it himself sadly we weren't able to
experience the real version of this game
when it was originally
least but it was made available as a
side game in Metal Gear Solid 3
subsistence and part of the HD
collection now number three is this
upstanding gentleman right here how Bob
Canada the mother okay Mike Tyson's
punch-out put you in the shoes of Little
Mac the scrappy underdog working his way
up the ranks to be the best boxer in the
world now this is based on the arcade
series that did have a very different
visual style but the NES version gained
a lot of popularity thanks to an
endorsement by Mike Tyson what's really
cool about this game is that it's really
a puzzle game cleverly disguised as a
fighting game requiring players to
memorize moves and recognize patterns to
beat their opponents which the game
pushes to the limit with its bullshit of
a final boss fight we're blocking isn't
even really an option because you get
tired immediately and you're just gonna
get rekt three years after its original
release they dropped Mike Tyson's name
from the title and replaced him as the
final boss with mr. dream nowadays
you'll hear some people say that oh it's
because he had criminal allegations but
that was actually two years later the
real reason for the change was because
he lost the heavyweight title and
Nintendo's contract for three years went
up and didn't see the need to renew it
next up is Wonder Boy in monster land
this was a sequel to the original Wonder
Boy in arcades which was a pretty
traditional side-scrolling action
platformer Monsterland changed this up
though by taking influence from recent
RPG successes like Dragon Quest adding
very simple RPG mechanics to the formula
players would now start off as a
near-naked wonderboy who over the course
of his adventure could save up money to
buy and build up all kinds of useful
equipment like armor shield's boots and
useful consumables like bombs and
potions this game is a terrific example
of taking a very simple core gameplay
mechanic adding just a little depth and
creating a wonderfully replayable
adventure giving players plenty of
hidden runes
shops and side quests to complete that
could increase their chances against the
game's final boss mecha dragon and would
help to make all the simplicity more
difficult and an Adam Moore arcade vibe
is that the whole thing is timed
you're slowly losing health as time
passes so you can never just hang around
grinding for items instead you have to
get through the whole game as
efficiently as possible especially in
arcades if you don't want to end up
pouring tons of quarters in this game's
success in the arcade led to it being
ported
to the master system a year later
becoming one of the few truly standout
titles on the system now last but far
from released is the original Final
Fantasy putting you in control of a
party of four heroes who you can name
and pick classes for as you wish
funny enough though the game was
actually at its absolute easiest if you
just ran through it with a party of four
fighters giving zero fucks
now obviously Final Fantasy is one of
today's biggest franchises but what's
really interesting about that is how
this series started the reason why the
first game was called Final Fantasy is
because Squaresoft thought it was going
to be the last game they ever made
because they assumed they were going to
go bankrupt but the game sold so
incredibly well that it launched them
into a new level of success where over
time they not only became one of the
largest companies but they also bought
out most of their major competition such
as Enix who was responsible for Dragon
Quest what's really interesting to note
too is how the original Final Fantasy
was very much based on traditional
Western fantasy tropes containing things
like elves dwarves fighting the undead
all kind of stuff that you would see
from something like Lord of the Rings
but as time went on and more games were
released the series started to adopt
more of its own new tropes and ideas
that turned it into something that's
very unrecognizable from the original
game so those were the best games of
1987 if there's any you loved that
