not be that time of year without having
a good share of leaks and of course
there was the big Walmart one which
revealed stuff like Borderlands and
Gears of War 5 but more recently the
game stop did something where they
listed 15 Nintendo switch games that are
gonna go for reserved none of which are
named yet now if you want to have the
voice of reason there's a couple things
these could be I mean there's a couple
games we know about that aren't listed
yet like Fire Emblem for 2018 there's
gonna be some multi-platform games like
Walmart revealed we're gonna get NBA 2k
19 on it so there's a couple things that
are for sure there but this is youtube
so instead let's have some wild
irresponsible speculation now we're not
going to deal with anything that's
multi-platform or stuff like that I mean
yeah there's smoke gonna be some games
coming to all systems but if we're
talking tendo specifically there are two
main things that could be going on for
new switch games first off obviously
brand new games sequels to stuff that
having sequels in a while new stuff
entirely maybe new IPs I'm not gonna
exactly you know fortune tell what
Nintendo might have in store there but
another thing that we can look at is
more Wii U ports Wii U which they've
already ported most of the best of the
system over the switch but there's a few
stragglers still that would be really
nice to have so let's talk about those
now when talking about Wii U games that
have yet to make their way to the switch
there's really six titles that really
stand out to me that either have a big
enough name or franchise for Nintendo or
I just think are good games that should
make their way over if there's any that
I'm missing that you guys love make sure
let me know in the comments but first
let's talk about a pair of Mario games
first Super Mario maker I do not know
why this has not made its way to the
switch yet it is a great game they did
put it on the 3ds as well but that one
didn't have the full online support so
if we get the portability of the 3ds
version but the full online like the Wii
U one and just have those together on
the switch that would be the perfect
version of the games and I just don't
know why him to know hasn't jumped on
that yet another one going a little
further back in the library is Super
Mario 3d World it was a fun Solid kinda
just more linear Mario game but really
great in coop which translates really
well the switch so that one's definitely
a possibility as well now going for some
other smaller games Pikmin 3 is one of
them and we did get a newer Pikmin game
recently on the 3ds but that didn't do
super great
so I don't think they're gonna do a
brand new full-fledged Pikmin game
anytime soon so three would definitely
be a good way to just kind of keep the
franchise alive a personal hope for me
would be wonderful 101 which did have
some problems if they fixed him in a
port that would be awesome but Nintendo
has been getting platinum a lot of love
since they ported Bayonetta 1 and 2 and
we are getting a Bayonetta 3 so that one
I think is not out of the question
lastly because I have a huge glutton for
RPGs there were two that we're pretty
good on the Wii U that you can't grab
anywhere else yet so having those on the
switch would be awesome first up
Xenoblade Chronicles X I mean number two
is doing really well on the switch so
porting over X even though it's kind of
a different style of game I think is
something that could happen the other
one that I would love though is Tokyo
Mirage sessions if you ever played that
one that's the weird mashup that
Nintendo did with Atlas to make this
kind of shouldn't got me 10 say Fire
Emblem thing that ended up having idols
I don't know it was weird but the
gameplay was actually really good so if
we could get that on the switch and not
leave it just to die on the Wii U that
would be great next let's talk about
some new game sequels to suffer that a
Nintendo has not done in a while
starting once again with their biggest
franchise Mario there's a couple things
here that we could do first off Mario
Party yes they could just part Mario
Party 10 from the Wii U but I don't
think it's likely because the tablet
played a big part in that game so an
actual new Mario Party would make a lot
of sense for the switch especially
because you know with joy cons and
everything there's a lot they could do
there another one that is not as likely
but I really hope for is Mario Strikers
yes we're do mario tennis coming out
soon that already kind of covers our
mario sports games for a little while
but I love striker so much and I don't
know why Nintendo hasn't done a new one
since like what the Wii it's just it's
so fun and we need another one soon
definitely not gonna happen and it's an
insane dream of mine but I would love if
at some point they've worked together
with square again and do another proper
Super Mario RPG in fact our the race I'm
even thinking this is cuz the Nintendo
Twitter just recently tweeted out like
oh yeah so I'll bring the birthday of it
who is your favorite character it's like
Nintendo do another one just do it as
for some other franchises that have been
touched in a little while and we could
get a new sequel for something that
happens every time a Nintendo does as to
new Super Smash Brothers is there kind
of renewed interest and some of the
characters that are there that don't
have games come out very often so once
again of course everybody wants to have
a new f-zero I mean we got fast our mix
which kind of covers the style a little
bit but a proper actual full-blown
f-zero would be really cool to have
another one Kid Icarus it's not my fault
so shortest we got the 3ds one which was
surprisingly really fun and yes the
studio did closed down after that one
but Nintendo still has the IEP and I
think there's still some life to that
franchise they could breathe in there
there is of course also everyone that
wants a new Animal Crossing game which
I'm personally a little pessimistic
about I think it would be really cool I
think a proper new actual focused game
would be great but since they did the
mobile game I think that's a Nintendo's
focus right now for that franchise sadly
one other kind of crazy hope dream of
mine is that they could actually revisit
the Golden Sun franchise it was a great
series on the Game Boy Advance they made
one game on the DS which was fine but
didn't really capture the same spirit I
would love for them to give it one more
shot however that's probably not gonna
happen because the main company that
works on it is currently working on
Mario Tennis so yeah I can dream though</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
