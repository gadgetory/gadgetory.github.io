another couple days and we've got press
conferences starting as soon as tomorrow
so before that whole thing kicks off I
wanted to go over the five games that
I'm most excited to learn more about
these are games that we've only gotten
opening trailers for yet and teasers and
no actual gameplay starting with Deus Ex
mankind divided we got the initial
trailer for this a couple months ago we
haven't really learned a whole lot
outside of just the bare basics the fact
that the game takes place two years
after the events of human Revolution and
will star once again Adam Jensen one
thing really interesting about the
trailer is that it does show Adam using
a lot more special abilities that
weren't present in the past game
including a ridiculously fast teleport
dash move the ability to turn himself
into sort of like a hardened diamond
thing to resist damage and having
built-in weapons such as having a peps
plaster in his actual arm which if all
these actually make their way into the
real game could be really exciting given
the fact that Square Enix is having its
own dedicated press conference this year
on tuesday after the nintendo one this
looks like one of the games that we will
more than likely get a little more
glimpse at or at least i hope we do
second up is a game that shares its
genre with deus ex and that's cyberpunk
2077 which sadly I really don't think
we're going to actually see anything new
on that this year but I really want to
this is from the same guys that just
released the witcher 3 CD Projekt RED
and as a result they're still kind of
busy with that they're still working on
expansion packs for Witcher 3 so there's
still gonna be some time dedicated to
that but since we're sure he has fully
come out now it might actually be time
for them to start pushing a little more
information out for cyberpunk which
would really also be in their favor as
well now given the fact the writing so
much momentum from The Witcher 3 having
sold four million copies in just two
weeks this is honestly one of the less
likely games we're going to see you but
it's definitely one that I want more
information on third up is Mirror's Edge
catalyst now we did get a trailer as
well as a little bit of gameplay for
this last year and it was just recently
revealed that the game is in fact not a
sequel being called mirrors edge 2 but
is in fact either a reboot or just a
reimagining of the first game it's not
entirely clear if it's a separate story
prequel but it's not a direct sequel to
the first game like I said we did get a
little gameplay of this last year but it
was really just little minor snippets
and didn't give us the full scope of
what this new version might actually
handle like compared to the original now
appropriately at number 4 is of course
fallout for what
just announced a couple weeks ago but
desta is going to be the first press
conference this year on Sunday night so
hopefully that's going to be a large
part of it some of the main questions
glaring at us obviously are how the art
style has changed because the trailer
did look a lot more cartoonish not
heavily cartoony but definitely more so
than the drab looks of fallout 3 and new
Vegas and whether or not the game is in
fact having a fully voiced protagonist
and what kind of impact that's going to
have on players options and freedoms of
choice so it would definitely be really
interesting to see actual gameplay
especially if the game is teased to be
possibly coming out as soon as this year
now last but not least is a game that
has been heavily rumored to be at this
year's e3 although at this point it's
almost customary for that to happen and
that's the last guardian this game we've
been waiting on a really long time and
at this point I really just want a
confirmation one way or the other if the
rumors are true and the game does in
fact make an appearance we need to get a
release date or at least a launch window
and if the rumors aren't true they
really need to just put the last nail in
the coffin and confirm it as cancelled
because the biggest thing that I think
could really harm this game is how much
we've just been waiting and not really
knowing what's going on the worst thing
they could do is make a simple
announcement of oh yeah it's still
happening eventually we're not sure when
because people have been waiting so long
especially after the momentous game that
was shout of the classes that whatever
kind of hype they're building up in
their heads over time is just going to
make it to where this game can't live up
to it so they really need to decide
either announce it now and give us a for
sure launch window or just let it die
please cuz the waiting is just making it
worse so there's just the five games I'm
most interested in learning about at
this year's e3 there are of course a lot
of other big titles that I left out a
few that I'm sure you guys are super
excited about and are a little pissed
that I left off the list just let me
know down comes below what games you're
really looking forward to this year as
always if you enjoyed the video hit that
thumbs up button to let me know as well
subscribe and follow me on twitter I'll
be seeing guys soon with some III
coverage but until then I'm Kevin kensun
and I'll see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
