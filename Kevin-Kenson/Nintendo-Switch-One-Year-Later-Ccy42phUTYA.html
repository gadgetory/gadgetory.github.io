going to be officially one year old and
what a first year it has been this
system has been completely destroying
and let's see hack first let's just tuck
hard sales numbers now the last official
news we got from Nintendo was for up
until the end of December which
basically marks the first ten months for
the system during which it sold 14.86
million units worldwide four point eight
of which were in just the US making it
the fastest selling system in US history
and that momentum is not stopping just
yet with January having more switches
sold than Xbox one or ps4
it's by like a 3% margin but it's still
true now why is this how did this happen
well there's a whole bunch of reasons
first let's just talk about something
else they can still be backed by a lot
of data and that's game sales the switch
had a fantastic year as far as games
released on it most of which was
thankful to two of its biggest first
party titles Super Mario Odyssey and
Zelda breath the wild both of which sold
incredibly well are adopted by the
majority of switch owners and both games
are some of the most well reviewed games
in gaming history and it's not as though
those the only two good games the system
has I mean we had a lot of other great
first party titles last year like
splatoon too and arms and arguably even
more important we saw a lot of
third-party support that just wasn't
there for the Wii U or the later years
of the Wii for instance we had Bethesda
porting some of its biggest titles like
Skyrim and doom over to the system we
had other third-party companies making
exclusive games for the system like
Ubisoft making Mario rabbits Kingdom and
Co a tecmo doing Fire Emblem warriors
and that's just time that the big-name
companies there's also been a huge push
for the system for indie games whether
that's original stuff like Celeste or a
lot of great games getting ported to it
that have found their true home on the
system whether that's oxen-free
darkest dungeon enter the gungeon shovel
knight even a great way to play rocket
League handheld and it's where they're
going to that all these games put
together plus the ones that are on the
way already make a library for the
switch that is larger than the one that
we you had five years to build which you
know explains a lot why the system is
already out sold that we use lifetime
sales now I don't think this
assess the switch though can be
attributed just to the great game
library although that certainly doesn't
hurt I think one of the big things
though is just this concept of what the
switch is where it's both this handheld
and this docked system and that's an
idea that is very easily communicated on
people you know I think one of the big
reasons why that we you failed is
because to this day there are still
people who think that we you is just the
tablet part of the system that it's some
kind of add-on for regularly which it's
not it's a whole new system but that's
exactly the problem people couldn't
figure that out with the switch though
it's this visual thing that you can get
right away oh you take the controller
off the tablet and give it to someone
now it's multiplayer oh you put it in
the stock and now it's on your TV it
sells the concept right away and it
adapts to so many different life styles
and that adaptability plays a huge role
also at how the system is done so well
because it works for so many different
schedules I mean you can have one person
who loves using it in doffed mode when
they get back from work or home from
school or another person that always
uses in handheld or someone else that
uses a balance between to fit their
schedule the point is that whether on a
priest prefers it in one method or
another they're all using the system and
they're all enjoying it it's this great
combination of nostalgic great games
like Zelda and Mario that are both
bringing back these old memories but
also doing something different new and
exciting with this system itself which
is a total reinvention of how people
approach handheld gaming or even at home
gaming that makes it this unique idea
that just worked so well now while the
switch has sold really well I think it's
important to keep in mind that it did
that while being far from a perfect
console I mean this thing definitely
also had its problems over this past
year for instance back at launch there
were a lot of questions regarding just
the physical design of it you know
having the only charge port being on the
bottom which sure makes sense when you
dock it but doesn't make a whole lot of
sense if you want to charge it while
it's in tabletop mode or the fact that
the way the dock is designed can cause
the system to overheat slightly warping
the system or even risk scratching the
system from repeatedly putting in the
dock and taking it back out which yeah
some people have learned how to live
with some of these problems and deal
with them and work around them and be
careful but they are problems
nonetheless and those aren't the only
ones
there's also Nintendo's bizarre approach
to how they're handling online chat a
service that requires the use of an
external app on your phone and if you
want to use chatted with a game play
well you need to hook up this adapter to
both your phone switch and headset all
the same time which just seems
very unnecessary there's other issues
too but things that will hopefully be
fixable in time for instance Nintendo is
constantly focused on this idea of
having a premium online subscriber
service but it keeps being pushed back
and it's starting to become a little
less clear what all is gonna be entailed
in that package there's also the fact
that as of right now the switch has very
little focus on media basically the only
real media app we have at all is Hulu
and that's it nothing else for movies or
television nothing for music something
that while the system doesn't
necessarily absolutely need would
certainly help in this modern-day
competing with other systems thankfully
though despite these problems as we've
said the switch has been doing well and
it looks like it's gonna continue to do
well for years to come
Mario and Zelda are gonna be tough to
follow up and Nintendo's already got a
lot of stuff planned for the rest of
this year and beyond whether that's more
first-party stuff like Metroid Prime for
Bayonetta 3 a new Yoshi and a new Kirby
game or even more ports from the Wii U
that will probably outsell the Wii U
versions like Hyrule warriors or Donkey
Kong tropical freeze and what's really
interesting to me is that we not only
had these great first party titles that
we can look forward to for the year and
even some third party stuff that's in
development as well but Nintendo is
continuing to try and innovate on top of
what the system already is with LeBeau
coming in April which looks utterly
ridiculous and amazing but tons of fun
for kids and maybe also for certain
fully grown adults that can't let go of
fun childish things and what's craziest
about all this is that as exciting as
all those things are there's still so
much more Nintendo could do there's
keeping quiet on for instance Pokemon
Pokemon has been one of the most
successful series that has been keeping
the 3ds line going and there's talk of
us getting one on the switch which a
transition like that could mean
something totally different for the
franchise and that's not the only one
there's one even bigger that we just
absolutely need where is smash</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
