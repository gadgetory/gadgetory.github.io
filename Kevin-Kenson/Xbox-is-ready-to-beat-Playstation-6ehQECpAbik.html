the Xbox E3 presentation,
and there was a lot of stuff
announced and talked about
but something I really wanna focus on
is the general future of Xbox
based on a couple different
main things they talked about.
And the first is, of course, the new Xbox
which right now we're still going under
the title of Project Scarlett.
Now what we've heard about
Project Scarlett so far
lines up a lot with what
PlayStation has been talking about
with their new PS5, in
that we're not hearing
hard specs just yet, but
we are getting an idea
of what these systems are capable of.
Specifically, the concept of 8k gameplay
at 120 frames per second
and support for using an SSD
so that way loading times are much faster
than what is currently
possible on modern consoles.
Now something they did do
that Sony has not done yet,
however, is show how actual gameplay
might look like on a system like this,
and the example was with Halo Infinite,
the next Halo title which we now know
is scheduled to come out on
the same day as the Scarlett,
or at least the same window,
and be a launch title for it.
And to be honest, this just
looked absolutely amazing.
I mean, especially being
here, in the crowd,
and seeing this giant
screen and all the detail
that was still in this gigantic image
is just a really great sign
for what this system can be capable of.
Now one of the things a lot of people
were hoping to maybe hear at this E3
is the potential of Xbox and
Nintendo working together
with the idea of xCloud
even serving the Switch.
That did not happen,
but I don't think that's
entirely off the table either.
I think Xbox is really pushing this idea
of bringing their platform and their games
to as many different
things as possible, and...
That'd be some pretty significant news,
and I think they're
waiting for the right time
to really talk about that
as a possibility even to begin with.
Another thing that goes with
this idea of play anywhere
is the fact that last month they announced
that Xbox Game Pass is coming to PC,
and what they announced here is that
for a single membership at,
I believe it was 15 bucks a month,
you're able to play Xbox Game Pass
on your Xbox One, on your PC,
and get Xbox Live Gold all
together in one package,
which is a pretty awesome deal.
All of this plays into this new future
I think Xbox is really trying to focus on,
which is the idea that, yes,
Project Scarlett is going
to be this amazing system,
but it's not going to be the
be-all end-all way of playing Xbox,
they want it to by tied into everything,
so no matter where you
are, what you're doing
you can play Xbox.
So all this stuff is
super cool to talk about,
but it's also kind of in the far future.
I mean, the new Xbox is
slated for holiday of 2020.
But something that is much
more immediate in the future
that I am really happy to see
make a surprise appearance
here at this show is the new
Xbox One Elite Controller.
So here we actually have the new
Xbox One Elite Series Two Controller
and there's a lot of changes going on
with this versus the original design,
and there's a lot of new
functions this offers as well.
The grip design that it has
used to only cover the back side,
now is a full wraparound
which is much more comfortable
and is gonna really help
if you get sweaty hands
during long periods of gameplay.
The sticks on it are now
not only interchangeable,
but you can also use a little tool
to adjust the tension on the stick,
so if you want a little more pushback
or you really want a very loose stick,
you can adjust that now.
Along with these new features,
there's also some expansion on
what you could previously
do on the old controller.
You now have three different profiles
that instead of being a
switch you move in the middle,
you just press this button right here
to switch between three
different ones you can design,
and the hair triggers now
have three different levels
you can choose from instead of two,
with a new extra-short one
compared to what you could do before.
Favorite change out of everything, though,
is the fact that they are now using
an internal rechargeable battery
instead of relying on AAs.
And according to Xbox, a full charge
will last you 40 hours!
Xbox made a lot of great
announcements today,
and a lot of them have to
do with the far future,
but as far as things that
are coming up a lot sooner,
I am so happy this is here.
And we are back in the office,
featuring a new Xbox pin.
I think it glows in the dark.
Also, better sounding audio.
(laughs) Anyways, the thing is
I've been thinking more and more
about what we saw at
today's press conference,
and something that's
really interesting to me
is that while we got a lot of
game announcements at this E3,
it was a lot of back-to-back
stuff from Xbox,
which was a good move,
I really think the core of
what Microsoft is trying to do right now
comes down to those last 20 minutes
where they really talked about
Project xCloud and Project Scarlett.
Obviously, having a lot of
big name games is important,
and it was something
they focused on last year
and this year was, making sure to be clear
&quot;Hey, we're acquiring
all these new studios,
&quot;we've got a lot of these
&quot;first-party titles in development now.&quot;
But I think the really
big thing comes down to
the idea of Xbox trying
to develop themselves
into being more of a side service.
The idea that &quot;Hey, look,
do you like our games?
&quot;You don't have to own
&quot;the brand new awesome Project Scarlett,
&quot;you don't even have to
have had an Xbox One before,
&quot;we just wanna focus on the idea of
&quot;if you like our games,
we want you to have
&quot;some way to be able to play them.&quot;
And the xCloud is a great example of this,
because part of what they talked about was
&quot;Hey, if you own one of our systems
&quot;you can use it as your own
server to use to play games.
&quot;But if you don't, we
still have our own servers
&quot;you can play on with your phone
&quot;or whatever other device you're using
&quot;so you can access the stuff
&quot;whether or not you own our hardware.&quot;
Which is a really important
distinction to make.
After all, the idea of using
your own system as a server
isn't a completely brand new thing,
I mean you can already
do this with PlayStation
as they recently brought the ability
to stream PlayStation directly to a phone,
and in the past you could
use it with a PS Vita.
Xbox is opening up that door by saying
&quot;Yes, you can do that too,
&quot;but even if you don't own our system,
&quot;xCloud is something you can access.&quot;
Something that also occurred to me
as just kind of an interesting thing
is that, look, having a new
Series Two Xbox One Elite
Controller is awesome.
I've been waiting for that for a while,
and I liked the original Elite,
but this one is shaping up
to be something even better.
I mean, even the short
hands-on time I had with it,
it felt like an amazing controller,
but it's also kinda coming
out a little late in the cycle
if we're getting a brand
new Xbox late next year.
Which raises the question, if
they're releasing new hardware
does it necessarily we're seeing
an entire new generation shift?
See, in the past, every time
a new game system comes out,
everything changes, we
get a new controller,
we get new online services,
we get new everything.
But this time around, I almost
wonder if Xbox's goal is
hey, here's the new Project Scarlett,
whatever official Xbox
name they end up giving it,
and while that is new,
more powerful hardware
that will support games haven't
been able to play before,
they might just stick with using
the same Xbox One controller.
It might just be a thing where, hey,
if you own the brand new
Elite Series Two Controller,
and then you get Project Scarlett,
you just keep using that
controller on there as well.
It's one continuing experience
instead of being a complete heavy shift.
Ultimately, I think a really big takeaway
from this press conference
for Xbox this year
is that while there is a lot of stuff
to look forward to within the coming year,
I really think Xbox is
approaching late 2020
as almost like a brand new starting point.
The idea that look,
the Xbox One ultimately
didn't entirely go as planned.
And a lot of that was botched
by the initial launch of the system,
and a lot of work has been done
to try to build some goodwill back.
And I think the release
of Project Scarlett,
the release of Game Pass on more systems,
the release of xCloud,
is all going towards
this new momentum of hey,
fresh new start for Microsoft.
Going good, yeah.
Look, so we're recording with a lav mic,
so if you want to say anything on camera
you have to yell it into my chest.
- I can do this.
This is fine.
- Yeah, cool.
- This is the way I talk to you always.
- What did you think of the new Xbox?</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
