Uncharted saga is finally here and for
those of you that have played the older
games you might be wondering to yourself
what makes this one different outside of
the fact that it's obviously a hell of a
lot prettier first off is an aim assist
option that I feel like not enough
people are really talking about if
you're the kind of person that wants to
play Uncharted for the storytelling
platforming and adventure but are
terrible at shooters this modes4u sure
in previous games you could just put the
game on easy but that just makes it
really hard for you to die it doesn't
help you with your shots and makes
combat segments take forever with this
option on all of your targeting is
automatically done and this is
full-blown auto aim it's not the kind of
thing where you aim slightly to the left
of an enemy's head and it snaps to them
no in this case you just aim and it's
straight it puts you right on the target
of an enemy making them an easy kill
sure those of you that want to overcome
the game's challenges will not want to
have this option on but for those of you
that want to treat this more like an
interactive movie it's a great addition
second off and one of my personal
favorite additions is a the grappling
hook opens up a lot more options for how
you can explore areas previous games
always focused on you just being able to
do whatever was within arm's reach grab
the next rock jump from here to there so
on so forth with the grappling hook
though you're able to latch on to
certain points allowing you to swing
from place to place safely climb up or
safely climb down large cliffs and this
actually plays a much bigger part in
what I think is one of this game's
biggest strengths over past Uncharted
games the fact that it's much more
open-ended previous uncharted games were
basically a very intricate and pretty
looking hallway there was always one
route you had to take to get from start
to finish
uncharted 4 however features a lot more
indirect options there are multiple ways
to get to the end of an area and each
place is much more detailed all around
rather than just being the one pathway
you have to follow this not only gives
players a greater sense of freedom but
also ups the immersion factor
considerably because you never feel like
you're being forced for handheld just go
the one obvious route which is something
that I've always thought this series
seriously needed fourth up is something
that you won't be able to enjoy right
away when you start off the game but it
is one of the most interesting and
coolest bonus game features I think I've
seen lately
and that's filter options after you beat
the game you're able to unlock a number
of different filters that completely
change the way the game looks making it
black and white making it pixelated
making the whole thing an insane rainbow
landscape this gives you a reason to
want to hunt down every relic you can
find to unlock different options and
gives future playthroughs of the game an
interesting little twist last step is
one of the more subtle additions to the
game but a very very good one to have
and that's the fact that your AI
teammates actually help you out in past
games whenever you had an NPC alongside
you they would usually just kind of hang
out and occasionally help you out any
specific scripted event this time around
however they'll actually hold their own
in combat and help you out if an enemy
grabs you they can help break you free
if your attacking an enemy that they're
also attacking you can perform special
combo attacks this not only makes large
combat segments featuring multiple
characters on both sides a lot more
cinematic but also actually gives AI
teammates a reason for being around
rather than just have them standing in a
corner looking dumb while you do all the
work there are of course other changes
in this game visually is one of the
best-looking ps4 games out there combat
controls have been revised and the game
now features a few occasional dialogue
option moments that just have minor
superficial effects on what happens next
and don't impact the overall story at
all as always guys thank you so much for
