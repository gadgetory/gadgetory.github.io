spin-off games a day that I thought
would never actually come is finally
here
Kingdom Hearts 3 is out and as part of
celebrating that there is a limited
edition ps4 Pro it will be unboxing now
this one's actually a really interesting
one for me to look at because based on
pictures we've seen and even the look on
the box there's this kind of textured
effect going on the top of it and not
entirely sure how that's gonna look in
person so let's open it up and check it
out now as with all limited edition
bundles there's really three main parts
of the system we care about it comes
with of course a copy of the game with a
couple of lecture added goodies and then
there's the controller in system now the
controller in this one is really
interesting because it kind of breaks
away from some of the traditions of what
Sony has done with past special editions
is usually they go with a color that
matches the system and then some kind of
little symbol on the right handle but
this time instead they've gone for a
couple more subtle changes first off
instead of a different color it's using
the same standard PlayStation black but
it's a very very glossy finish it's
actually very similar to what they used
on the 500-million Edition system but
instead of that translucent blue it just
has that standard black design but it
creates this really shiny finish and
it's actually very comfortable Mohannad
really like the way it feels now along
with that something they do do with a
lot of their special edition controllers
is an etching on the touchpad it's a
little subtle on this one because I
don't really use any other colors it's
just a darker black but I think it looks
really nice especially because it lines
up with that black gloss on the rest of
the main body and I really dig the
monochromatic colors on the symbol
buttons instead of using normal for
colors they're just white outlines one
other detail that I almost missed
initially too is that there's a very
small change they've made to the d-pad
so you still the same right and left
arrows but then for the top and bottom
you have a little crown symbol which is
the Kingdom Hearts one that they have on
the main Kingdom key and then the hearts
symbol on the bottom right here so
they're still pointing in those right
directions they're just you know very
thematic symbols all at all this is a
much more subtle approach compared to
what they've done in the past but I
actually really like the way this all
turned down now the same cannot be said
for the system because this thing is
very different from what they've done
before like I said earlier there's this
kind of leather finished look to it that
was really in
to see in pictures and I wasn't sure
what it was gonna be like in person I
didn't know if it was some kind of
sticker or they applied some kind of
material no it's just a very very
heavily etched top to the system it's
still plastic but has this look of worn
leather that's really intense looking
this is a very different approach cool
they've done with past ps4s where
normally there's very heavy emphasis on
just having a nice gloss finish but
sometimes works out really well like
with the Spider Man ps4 and other times
things can get a little lost like what
they did with Monster Hunter but in this
case this is a very different approach
that I think brings some really cool
upsides and some downsides but overall I
think it's a really awesome change of
pace honestly it's pretty tough for me
to believe that this is actually
happening right now like this is a game
that is out that I can play I mean there
are a lot of series out there were sure
it takes a while for a new game to come
out but just imagine Kingdom Hearts 2
was in 2005 I grew up playing the game
was like oh that's awesome I can't wait
for the next one
and so I waited and I waited and I kept
waiting we kept adding different
spin-offs and trailers and hints and all
kinds of insane other things and now we
actually have number three I mean I got
to the point where I didn't think this
was actually going to happen even when
we got an actual release date as we got
to the point where that release date was
only a week away there is still a part
of my brain that was like yeah I'll
believe it when I see it and it's here
and I still don't kind of believe it so
what's the good well I enjoy the fact
that it's not heavily glossed because
that means you can touch it and not
worry about there being all kinds of
fingerprints throwing up anywhere and it
does create this very interesting unique
look where once again it almost looks
like it's some kind of faux leather
finish but it's just hard plastic now
the downside of this is the way the
light hits it has a very massive impact
on how this system will look in the
right light you get just the right
amount of texture being shown and
everything B could still make out all
the symbols nice and cleanly and has
this awesome almost old-school worn look
to it in the wrong light it catches
every single little groove of leather
and it just kind of looks like a mess
similar to what happened with the
Monster Hunter ps4 I think if you just
put this on the right setup it looks
beautiful
you just have to be careful about how
it's lit now as for the actual design
itself it's not really anyone specific
it's more of a really crazy heraldry
pattern which features images from all
kinds of from the game various symbols
including things like the Kingdom Hearts
symbol the kingdom key crown and even of
course Mickey's head and symbols
representing all the true bad guys
there's key blades it's just a whole
bunch of stuff thrown into this very
crazy-looking design that is actually
really cool now while all the symbols
are littered throughout everywhere on
the top the system that you do have a
more simple approach with just a couple
symbols lined up on the front which
feature once again things like Kingdom
Hearts Mickey it just makes a nice of a
clean pattern on the front-engine system
it doesn't run the entire link it's just
standard which i think was a good call
the only part of this design that falls
a little flat for me is because they
went for this heavy leather edge to look
which once again I think it's cool it
also makes certain symbols and words not
as cleanly appearing as they could be
and the one place where this is really
recognizable is in the bottom corner
where you have an emblem that says
Kingdom Hearts on the bottom but you
have to look at a very specific angle
with a lot of concentration to actually
legibly read that it really just kind of
looks like print thrown over this
leather it has its drawbacks so I think
it was a bit of a risky move to try
something so heavily different
especially for such a big game that
people were waiting forever for but I
think it paid off while not perfect
I think this aesthetic of just the
etched leather creates such a unique
design that this stands apart from every
other ps4 Pro Sony has done I might
still personally rank some of the other
ones for simplicity above it but for
just being its own unique design
beautiful</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
