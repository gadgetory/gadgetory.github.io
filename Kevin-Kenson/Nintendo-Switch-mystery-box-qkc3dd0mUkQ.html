and I don't actually know what specific
ones are in here it's a mystery at least
to me but with something to found on
Amazon that was listed for 35 bucks
and supposedly has everything you need
for your Nintendo switch so I'm gonna
open it up see what exactly is inside
and find out whether or not you're
really getting your money's worth and if
it actually does cover all the stuff you
absolutely needs let's check it out
so there's a few things in here I like
how it's not actually I'll throw it in
the box it is box products that just fit
into this larger one so where do I even
begin let's get this one over here
tennis rackets okay this is already
questionable start for me um look don't
you're wrong I think these are cool
pickups if you really like Mario Tennis
that just doesn't really do anything
outside of that one specific game so
kind of a weird thing to include in like
you know stuff you need for your system
it's kind of a special case so if you
love Mario Tennis you plan to get it
this is a good good part of the bundle
if you don't there's already some of the
space taken up so let's this one thing
down else we got protectors okay so big
thing that is useful in any switch is a
screen protector you want to make sure
that the screen on system is nice and
safe especially if you're using it a lot
in portable mode you don't want it while
it's sitting in a bag or while you're
out using it to accidentally scratch up
a little bit so screen protectors are
really important that it also comes it
looks like with an actual case to go
around the body the switch itself which
is another really nice thing to have
again if you like playing in portable a
lot that's a really good thing
especially for kids that way if they
ever drop the system it's gonna have
something actually absorb the impact a
little bit and keep those joy cons in
place instead of having them shooting
off and breaking the locking mechanism
so that's a good one that's that's
definitely something worth getting what
else do we have
oh there's no thank-you note here what
is level up you've just have been
advanced to the next level thank you so
apparently this is actually from like a
small family-owned company that's for
sure
realize that I thought we were getting
something it's just like a random huh
yes okay so this is something that I
know not everyone thinks do you have
honestly it was one of my first big
purchases for the switch I like the idea
of being able to share joy cons with
friends for multiplayer games especially
kind of fun mini gaming ones like
overcooked and I don't like using the
joy clown sideways on their own it's
just very uncomfortable so having little
controller grips like this that makes it
just a little more comfortable to feel
like a real just smaller controller is a
huge benefit so this has always been one
of the things I always tell people right
away like hey if you plan on doing this
kind of stuff on the switch this is
something you need to get so I'm really
glad that this is a part of this bundle
and then we have okay so this is another
situation kind of like the tennis
rackets wheels for the joy cons to use
in Mario Kart now I will say that I
think there are a lot more people out
there willing to grab Mario Kart over
Mario Tennis I mean it is one of the top
five selling games of the switch still
so this is gonna have a little more wide
appeal I think for a lot more people
because it's kind of just a standard
party game pick up I think it's still a
little more specialized but not quite as
crazy as the tennis records I think I
think this is a this is a good inclusion
this works out just because Mario Kart
is that big a charging station so this
is of course always an important thing
to have for joy Kahn's because
especially if you own more than two
there's not really a convenient way to
charge more than to joke cons at once
cuz you just have the two on the system
on the dock and that's it so if you plan
on having more joy cons this is
something you need to pick up and I
think it's a worthy addition to a bundle
like this it is assuming you're buying
more joy cons but I think that's
something that comes up pretty often for
a lot of people so that's that makes
sense and our last item and honestly the
one thing that I immediately assumed
would be in this box
a carrying case I mean it's tough to
talk at all about accessories for the
switch and I'll bring up the importance
of a carrying case because if you're
using it as a portable device that's
just something that you're gonna need to
have to make sure the switch is
protected if you buy a lot of physical
games it gives you a place to store
those and any kind of additional
accessories or cables you need like a
charging cable it looks like this is
their own in-house brand too so let's
actually open it up and see what it has
space for
oh and there's actually stuff in here so
I'm glad I open that uh okay before I
well let's finish off with the case and
then I'll get back there so it's got
slots for multiple switch games it
actually has two rows of these so that
fits a lot physically I feel like most
people aren't going to hit that limit
it's ten on each of these thirty games
that's a lot of space places for storing
cables and such there also looks like
there's a little additional joy cutter
crotch icon additional game case to
store more cartridges that's good here
Oh stylus that doesn't come up for a ton
of games but nice mood yeah there's a
little fitted area to fit this switch
itself we have a couple more accessories
in here we've got jail guards that go
around the joint cons this is a way to
add a little protection to the joy
collins directly I really like using
these three if you're not using them in
handheld mode if you want to use them
you know on their own wirelessly that
way there's protection outside of using
like a more full-blown case again really
good pickup for kids looks like it also
has little gel covers for the sticks
that'll add just a little bit extra
creepiness to them that's always handy
and what is this we go oh nothing oh
it's another gel case cover just black
instead of the neon which is nice to
cover your bases a little bit so yeah
that's actually as far as kind of
affordable cheaper stuff go that's all
covering a lot of bases let's actually
figure out what roughly all these things
independently would be worth and how
that stacks up to paying 35 bucks for
the box so the price in this box does
fluctuate a little bit we paid 35 for it
but I have seen it go as high as 40
dollars but that's still the kind of
general range you're gonna see it at and
that's what we're gonna compare all this
stuff individually against so I looked
for all different things that make up
this bundle I wasn't looking for the
exact same item from the same company
but rather there's a lot of different
jail guards out there on the internet so
just find ones that were the cheapest
more affordable option and see what that
all totaled to versus this 35 to $40 box
so first off getting a pair of racing
wheels like this one right here will
normally cost you about $10 and this
price is shared across some of the other
similar
that just slot the droidcon in some way
for instance the controller grips like
these right here also go for $10 and the
silicone grip we actually found a four
pack that was the same concept where you
got to neon and two black ones that one
also ten bucks as for the carrying case
there are a lot of these out that you
can choose from but as far as a basic
mainline one like this goes you can get
these as cheap as fourteen dollars as
for a protective cover combo like this
one right here that gives you the grip
along with screen protectors cheap
options out that you can find go for as
low as 12 bucks tennis racket again a
little more specialized a lot more
plastic these ones cheap option wise you
can find as low as 15 and then as for a
charging station again there's a large
variety of what you can find for lows
and highs for this particular kind of
item on the low end you're looking about
twelve bucks
finishing off the list with the stuff we
found inside the game carrying case with
the stylus and the game card case both
these go for nine bucks each so when you
total all this stuff out if you're
looking for each individual part at the
best price possible that's a hundred and
three dollars we paid 35 so that is a
great deal so is this everything that
you need for a switch honestly kind of
yeah I mean there is more expensive
individual custom you can track down
like you need more joy cons you want a
pro controller Bluetooth adapter that
kind of stuff but as far as just cheaper
attachments and things to kind of round
out what you need to keep your switch
protected or make it fit a little better
for some specific games this is an
awesome little bundle it is a little bit
overkill I think for some people you're
not gonna need every single item in here
but even if you don't the amount of
money you save buying this versus all
the individual parts is a lot of savings
where I think this is really aimed
though and what its strongest for is
families if you're buying this for a kid
or getting a couple switches for a
couple kids and you want just an opening
bundle that's gonna give you all the
stuff you need to make sure that those
switches are well and protected so they
don't break anytime super soon and you
have a couple special controllers to
match for some of the more interactive
games like Mario Kart or Mario Tennis
this is an awesome bag up</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
