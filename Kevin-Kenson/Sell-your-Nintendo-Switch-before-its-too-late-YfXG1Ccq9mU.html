Lite being officially revealed,
there's a question I think a lot
of people are asking
themselves and that's,
&quot;Should I change over
from a regular Switch
to the Switch Lite?&quot;
Sure, it's aimed at trying
to bring in more demographics
and it's a more affordable option
for people that don't
already own Switches,
but there are people out there
where the idea of a smaller,
more portable focused
Switch is really appealing.
And if you are thinking of changing over
from your current Switch
to the Switch Lite when
it releases in just over two months,
should you try to get rid
of your Switch right now
rather than wait to get
the most money possible?
First let's just talk about whether
or not you should even be
changing in the first place.
Now something that makes this
revision a little different
from other times we've
talked about console changes
like going from a regular
Xbox One to a One X,
PlayStation, PlayStation 4
Pro, is that the Switch Lite
is not a direct upgrade
of the regular Switch.
It's meant to be much more
of an alternative side option
and something that's much more accessible
for some people than a
regular Switch would be
and so as a result it does
have some very unique benefits
but comes with a lot
of trade offs as well.
The biggest of these is
of course the inability
to hook it up to a TV
to play in dock mode.
In other words it's a Switch
that doesn't actually Switch at all.
It's a purely dedicated
handheld and I can say
from personal experience
that for me at least
that's not that huge of a deal.
My Switch is basically 90% always
in handheld mode and there
are definitely situations
where I like having it docked
and I appreciate it but if it was gone
it wouldn't be that huge of a deal to me.
There are some other trade offs as well
like the smaller screen size,
the lack of HD Rumble, but those also come
at the kind of improvements of
having a more portable system
and joy-cons that are
locked into it making
it an overall much sturdier design.
So in this situation the decision
of whether or not you should switch over
really comes down a lot to,
well personal preference
and it's especially
weirder in the situation
to change over between systems
because you're not really just
straight up gaining things
you lose a lot in the process as well.
So you have to really analyze how you've
been using your Switch personally
and whether or not what you're losing
actually matters to you
in the first place or not
and it's worth those improvements
like better battery life and portability.
Now of course right now this argument
is entirely working
around how the Switch Lite
is being advertised and assuming
that is going to be 100% accurate
to what they're talking about right now.
That it's gonna have
the better batter life.
That it's going to be a sturdier design.
That stuffs all cool but
these opinions can change once
it's actually released
and we get a real hands-on
to compare it to the Switch.
Now if you are thinking of getting rid
of your current Switch in order
to get a Switch Lite once it releases,
an important question you have
to ask yourself is do you want
to get rid of it right now?
Because just by the Switch
Lite existing the resale value
of your regular Switch is
going to change even though
it isn't a full blown
revision or replacement.
In fact if you look on Ebay right now
and compare prices of what they were
before the Switch Lite was announced,
the average price has already gone down
by about $25 and that's gonna change.
And if you're gonna
take the easier way out
of say going to a store
and trading your Switch in,
well right now GameStop
lists their trade-in value
of a Switch at $200 which is
the MSRP of a Switch Lite.
Which is cool but as more people decide
to trade-in and do that
they're more likely
to bring down that trade value
so you're gonna get less
the longer you wait.
Now of course there are some reasons
to hold of and think about this as well.
First off we don't actually
know how the Switch Lite
itself is going to for
sure perform at launch.
We can always assume based on
how they've talked about it
but who knows it could be
something that releases,
we discover something about it
that's flawed or broken in some way
that's really annoying and
guess what you already got rid
of your Switch to switch over
and that's not a good position to be in.
Of course another reason
why you might want
to wait on reselling or trading
in your Switch is that sure if you do
it sooner you're gonna get a higher value,
but that also means you're
not gonna have a Switch
until late September and
you're gonna miss out
on the chance to play some major games
as they're being released.
Sure it's not the holiday season,
we're seeing a bunch of stuff back-to-back
but there's some individual big titles
that're coming out like
Fire Emblem: Three Houses,
Astral Chain, and Marvel
Ultimate Alliance 3.
If you don't get the chance
to play those right away,
you're kind of missing
out on the initial hype
and conversation which
can suck really bad.
But if you're willing to be patient
and wait for it it can be worth it.
There's one other weird bit of news
that's started going around recently
that can also affect whether
or not you want to try and
sell your Switch right now
to get a higher value and that's the fact
that we actually might be seeing
another new Switch, a
regular one, kind of.
Shortly after the announcement
of the Switch Lite
another bit of news that's
been circling the internet
is that people found filings suggesting
that Nintendo's going to
be doing a model refresh
of the standard Switch
featuring a new processor.
Likely the one that's going
to be in the Switch Lite.
However, there are a lot of people hoping
that this could mean
that there's some kind
of significant benefit that
the regular Switch could have
if you bought one of these newer models.
Specifically having better battery life
like the Switch Lite has,
having more stabilized frame
rates for certain games
that sometimes have dipping issues,
and maybe even speeding up loading times.
Now to be clear I'm not saying that none
of those things are going to happen,
I just don't think they're going
to be significant enough
to actually really matter.
But if they did it could
mean that for people
that actually pay attention
to these numbers the value
of a regular Switch that was released
before this refresh would
go down in comparison
to these newer slightly
more powerful ones.
Compared to reselling
or trading in Switch now
to get ready for Switch Lite
this is a much riskier thing
to bank on because again
I really don't think
it's likely goin to be
something that's going
to have a significantly
noticeable change in performance
and even if it has a slight increase,
you're still gonna end up having
to spend money out of pocket
because a regular Switch
is still gonna go for 300
bucks not the 200 price point
that the Lites are selling at.
Really the more important impact
of this news is just based on the fact
that there could be a quiet refresh
of Switch models does mean
that there's more reasons
why a current Switch can sell
for less in the coming months.
By the way if you are
thinking of reselling
or trading in your current Switch
to get a Switch Lite or maybe even
the quiet refresh regular
Switches please make sure
that you take the necessary precautions.
Make sure you have a Nintendo
Switch Online account
and backup all of your
cloud saves and keep in mind
that not all games actually
support cloud saves yet.
So there are some titles like Splatoon 2
where if you move over to a
new system you're not gonna
be able to currently move
that information over.
Nintendo has had rumors and talked lightly
about improving the
system and making it work
a different way so that
you can more easily move
from one system to another
but for the time being some
games simply will not do that.
So really think about
whether or not you want
to lose progress for those specific titles
and make sure that you back up any games
that do support cloud saves.
I know some of you guys
watching this right now might
be thinking who would
be crazy enough to trade
in a Switch they already
have just to buy a new model,
but it happens there are people
that are always excited for new models
to come out and on top of that there
is of course the issue that some Switches
have simply not been aging super great.
Mine in particular has already begun
to crack and all apart
in a lot of sections
and it can be really
tempting to get a new version
that comes out with
hopes that it's not going
to have that same aging issue.
So let me know down below in the comments
that if you guys already have a Switch
are you planning to get a Switch Lite?
Do you want to hold on to both of them?
Are you going to trade
one in to get the other?
Let me know and I'll see you guys later.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
