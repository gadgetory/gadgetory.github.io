list of the coolest gaming gear you can
grab for yourself or as a gift this time
for all 25 and under and to begin with
let's check out these final fantasy
themed coasters so one thing I love
about these right away is the fact that
some actual thought went into them all
too often it's way too easy to find a
coaster glass or mug design we're all
someone did was take an image or piece
of art people are familiar with and
slapped it on but instead each of these
coasters features a design that is not
only original but playfully combines
popular final fantasy tropes with drink
references there are four designs in
total then the whole set only costs ten
bucks before shipping their actual
construction is pretty simple but the
designs more than make these worth the
price and they're a fantastic grab for
any final fantasy fan whether you want
to actually use them for their
functional purpose or just a show-off
now if you're already going down the
route of grabbing some video game themed
to drinking gear then an absolute
must-have is one of these NES cartridge
flasks now while taking a closer look
betrays these things it's actually
surprising how well these flasks blend
in with real NES cartridges and the
label design sports a pretty fantastic
pun on a video game classic not only a
name but the label art itself personally
I went with the drunk hunt design
because it's just a work of art but they
have plenty of other designs too to
scratch an itch for another series
including Final Fantasy Mario Brothers
Mega Man Legend of Zelda and more being
made of plastic it isn't exactly going
to keep whatever you're storing in them
super cool but the novelty alone is
completely worth having a warm drink
when in need now if you want to show
something off with a cartridge theme
that's a little more family-friendly a
really cool item that you could find
everywhere on Etsy our NES cartridge
clocks this makes a fantastic addition
to any nightstand or desk setup the
designs super simple with a traditional
analog setup and it just takes a single
double-a battery to power it
this particular seller posts the Mario
Brothers and duck hunt combo cart as we
go to design but they take requests for
any other games you'd like and they're
all made using a reproduction label so
the rarity of the game in question does
not matter if there's an NES classic you
absolutely love then this is a great way
to have a memory
little collectible of it that you can
have out on display without just simply
having a basic cartridge hanging out for
no reason
so with two functional items rooted in
the old school let's take a look at
something a little more recent a fallout
4 cereal bowl specifically sugar bombs
now me personally I love collectibles
that make in universe references rather
than just blatantly advertise the title
of game no one's gonna care you got a
bowl with the name fallout 3 or fallout
4 or even simply fall out in big old
letters instead this bowl throws a
reference to one of the tastier sounding
consumables you can find throughout the
series letting fellow fans appreciate
the reference while everyone else can
think you've just got a cool retro style
cereal bowl now saving the best for last
is this Legend of Zelda
playing card deck this thing is simply
freaking awesome with each of the card
suits redesigned to match symbols from
the Zelda series like rupees and the
Triforce with face cards all showing
characters from numerous games all
printed on quality cardstock that
matches up to any real deck my only
complaint with these is that they missed
a perfect opportunity to use Skull Kid
with Majora's Mask as one of the Joker
cards but the rest is completely on
point this particular set came in a
golden design to celebrate the series
but for a little cheaper you can grab
the decks in a more traditional red or
blue design and the website that sells
it fangamer also sells a similar deck
themed after final fantasy 6 if that's
more your style now I got links for all
these down below if you guys want to
check them out for yourself
as always guys thank you so much for
watching and I will see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
