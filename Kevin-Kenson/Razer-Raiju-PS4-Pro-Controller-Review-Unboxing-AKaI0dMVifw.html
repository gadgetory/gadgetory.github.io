two pro controllers that Sony released
in its European territories the Nikon
revolution and today I got my hands on
the other one the razor rises so we're
going to open this up and check it out
and see what's a little different about
it so first off we have a little paper
here congratulations there is no turning
back that's kind of weird
okay so kind of cool actually comes in a
pouch right away open it up little rays
just a moment front and here is the
controller now just like with the
revolution this is clearly more based on
an xbox one instead of the ps4
controller because like I said before
leash a little more comfortable
there's a lot more bells and whistles on
this one though what's really
interesting right away you'll see it has
a little control panel on the bottom
that's really just like the headset
controls that are on Xbox one
controllers you can attach that comes
with a lot of pro headsets although
there are some different buttons here
also another difference right away is
that unlike the revolution this one
keeps both it sticks low like this
instead of switching the d-pad and stick
like they did on the revolution to match
Xbox one controllers so there's a few
more different buttons and things to
look over here so let's break down what
exactly this controller does differently
instead of a regular ps4 Dual Shock to
begin with I have got to say this is one
damn fine good-looking controller from
the button and d-pad shapes to the home
button and Razer logo on the touchpad
and more than anything really I love the
use of blue trim on the grips to give it
some contrast originally looking at the
box I thought the little control center
at the bottom would visually bother me a
lot more but it actually blends in
really well with the rest of the
controllers shape so it looks good but
what does it actually like to use this
thing well turns out is actually really
really comfortable
I love the grips on this thing one of
the more interesting choices they made
though is that the buttons on this are
actually mechanical so it's a lot closer
to actually like clicking a mouse button
than using a traditional controller
which is really weird the first time you
use it but once you get the hang of it
actually really really like it it's
especially for situations where if you
have to click something really rapidly
it's way easier something I don't like
about this controller though is the
sticks now I get the idea of moving them
both down here so that matches with a
dual track for
controller but with this controller
design it just doesn't feel quite as
comfortable only the bigger problem I
have though is the grips themselves they
won't with the sort of plastic Matteson
you can have that gives more grip and
texture to your thumb some people really
like this personally I've never been a
fan they are removable though the
downside though is when you remove them
you find out that it's pretty much a
flat design which is not great to use
it's not concave enough to really grip
your thumb it's not domed it's just this
flat shape that just doesn't work that
great so besides the build quality what
is this controller going to do for you
that a regular dual shot can't well
first off it has four additional buttons
that can be programmed to act in place
of others I really love the placement of
these buttons each of them is
comfortable they're easy to reach and
they help keep your thumbs freed up so
they can focus on just using the left
and right analog sticks and if you don't
like having all these extra buttons and
feel like the back to get in the way of
your grip you can actually remove them
to have a flush back instead which is
really easy to do there's also a couple
things you can do with the triggers
you've got these switches in the back
that activates short stops on them or if
you prefer you can actually turn on an
actual hair trigger mode so the
slightest pressure is gonna count as
pressing down now all of this is done
with this little command center on the
bottom here you'll notice some
traditional controls like you can do
volume control over using a headset or
mic mute but what's more important are
these two buttons right here which are
going to allow you to activate switch
between and even customize two different
special profiles and what's really
interesting about this controller is
that you're not using some kind of
software and computer up hooking it up
to anything you're actually able to
customize your profiles all through the
controller directly as an example if you
wanted to find one of the mapable
buttons to copying the circle button all
you have to do is hold down the profile
button then whichever button you want to
assign a command to and finally just hit
the circle button a similar command is
also used for turning hair-trigger mode
off and on meaning you can at any time
really easily customize the controller
on-the-fly the only downside is that's
really it for customization on this
controller no stick acceleration no
macros just easier trigger pulls and a
handful of extra buttons so your mileage
may vary with this thing personally I
don't use those options very much so the
rise you is plenty for me but if you
want those off
this controller is going to fall short
for you that if you have commitment
issues the controller coming with the
letter saying there's no turning back
now
might scare you just a little bit</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
