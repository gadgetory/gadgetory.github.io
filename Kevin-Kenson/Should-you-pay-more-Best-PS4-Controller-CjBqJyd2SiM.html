lot of PS4 controllers
on this channel before,
including awesome cheap,
affordable ones, expensive pro options,
just straight alternatives
to the DualShock 4s.
But we've never really talked
about it as one overall group
and whether or not you
need to get anything
aside from the standard DualShock 4.
So, we're gonna talk about
the best cheap controller
you can get, the best expensive one,
and whether either of them
is truly worth your money.
First, let's talk about the
best cheap controller options.
Now, the weird thing about PlayStation 4,
when it comes to cheap controllers,
is that they have been really stingy
with licensing out official
controllers designs.
There were a whole lot of different
third-party PS3 controllers,
back during those days,
but nowadays with PS4 there's
really only, well, one,
when it comes to cheap options, at least.
It's this guy right here,
the Hori Mini PS4 controller.
Now, this is not the
only cheap PS4 controller
you can grab, it's just the only one
that's an actual,
officially licensed thing.
If you go on Amazon,
you can find all kinds
of different cheaply-produced
controllers that will work
on a PS4, but oftentimes those
have connectivity issues,
the button quality isn't great.
And even if you manage to find one that is
actually pretty solid at first glance,
they usually don't have much durability.
So really, almost by default,
when you're just looking
for a great cheap controller,
the Hori is the way to go.
But it does come with its oddities.
Now clearly, looking at this guy,
it's not exactly a
standard controller design,
at least by modern
standards, it's much closer
to something old-school, like an SNES.
The reason for that is 'cause it is geared
a little bit more towards kids.
I mean, if you try using it as an adult,
the button quality sticks,
everything feels pretty fine.
The only real lacking
thing functionally is
you don't have a full touchpad.
But, because of the redone grip design,
it's a little awkward if you
don't have, well, kid hands.
So when it comes to cheap controllers,
there's a couple different reasons
why you might wanna get one.
Either you want something for multiplayer
that you can just stick your friends with,
which doesn't happen too much these days,
there's not a lot of couch co-op anymore.
More so, the reasons are,
either you want a cheap,
quick replacement if
you break a DualShock 4,
or you want something to have a kid use
so that way, if they break it,
(throws controller)
it's not as big of a deal.
This is definitely a controller option
that's more in that later camp.
If you want something for
your own personal use,
that you want as a replacement,
not as strong of a choice.
Now, before moving on to pro controllers,
I wanna take a second to also
talk about mid-range options.
What I mean by mid-range is controllers
that basically cost the same as
just getting a standard DualShock 4.
Usually when you look at
third-party controllers,
they're either cheaper for
the sake of being affordable
or they're more expensive
and are for pro stuff.
It's pretty rare to see things
that are the same price range,
but one particular example
is this guy right here,
the Onyx PS4 controller.
Now, this one is currently
only available in Europe,
but it is really easy to import
if you wanna pick one up.
The main pitch for it is
that it is a PS4 controller
for people that would rather
use an Xbox One controller,
you like that grip design better.
And on that pitch alone,
it does a good job.
I actually do like the
grip design on this guy
more than a standard DualShock 4.
The thing to be worried
about, though, is that some
of the buttons just aren't
quite up to the same quality.
The main area that's really
an issue is the triggers.
They have this kind of extra tension
that just doesn't feel very
comfortable and very reactive.
The rest of the buttons are fine,
they're okay, it's a little lighter,
Overall it feels just a tiny bit cheaper,
but it still works well.
So if you love Xbox One controllers,
this is a solid alternative
and it's not that hard
to get ahold of, if you wanna import one.
However, most people, I
will say, the DualShock 4
is still gonna be the better
way to go in this price range.
Now, for pro controllers,
things get a little
more complicated because the big draw
of a lot of these different things is
what kind of additional features
and functions they have.
Not all of them offer the same benefits,
so part of it does come
down to personal preference,
what exactly kind of additional features
you're looking for, whether that's
the mechanical buttons
offered by a Razer controller,
the programmable sensitivity
of the NACON Revolution,
or just the straight
performance quality of the SCUF.
Now, I gotta be honest
here, before we talked
about these guys, I've always kinda leaned
towards really liking
the Razer controller,
but in recent time, the SCUF
Impact has really grown on me.
I really wasn't a big fan of the Infinity,
the one before this, which was kind of,
basically like a Frankenstein
of an actual PS4 controller.
The same is kinda true of the Impact,
but it involves a new shell,
which works a lot in its favor.
The redesigned grip on the
Impact is the most comfortable
out of these controllers,
and on top of that,
I really enjoy the fact
that all the little bits
of customization this
thing has is all on-board.
You can adjust the triggers,
you can program the paddles,
you can adjust the sticks,
all of that stuff is done
on the controller itself,
you don't have to hook it up
to a computer to do any
kind of side programming
like you would do with,
say, the Revolution.
Also, one of the biggest
things is just the fact that
I really enjoy the fact that you can
still use this guy wirelessly.
I understand the benefits
of having a wired connection
for a pro controller, but
just having the option
to go wireless when you wanna relax
and still use a better controller
is just a really big benefit.
Now, it's worth noting
that this is the second
controller design that
SCUF has done for the PS4.
They have a third one on
the way, called the Vantage,
which, unlike the Impact or the Impulse,
which are like modified DualShock 4s,
that one is a completely
new controller built
from the ground up, licensed by Sony.
I got a small hands-on of it at E3,
and based on how it's at least shaping up,
I can't wait for it to
actually get fully released
'cause I really think
that's gonna end up being
the best option out of all of these.
So look forward to that in a few months.
So we've talked about
the best of the cheap
and the best of the pro, but
the real question here is
whether or not it's worth
grabbing either of them
over just sticking with a
standard DualShock 4 controller.
Well, starting with the cheap,
it's kind of a weird situation because
when it comes to Xbox One
and Switch, there are a ton
of different awesome cheap
controllers out there
that I think can do a great
job of being a substitute,
especially if you wanna
save a little money.
But with Sony, there aren't really a lot
of choices out there, and the
main one right here works well
as far as button quality
and everything goes,
but like I said, the grip
design is just awkward.
It works well for kids, but as far as
an adult substitute goes,
it's honestly worth spending
more money just to stick
with a standard DualShock.
Now, when it comes to pro controllers,
the amount of additional
money you're gonna be spending
to get extra features is
quite a bit, especially
when you compare it to
the price difference
of going from this little
guy to a DualShock 4.
But honestly, I do think it's worth it,
especially in the case of the SCUF Impact.
The grip is a lot more comfortable
than using a DualShock 4,
at least for me, and all the
additional customization bits
are really handy to
make sure that it's fit
to your particular play style.
The DualShock 4 is a
perfectly fine controller
that's one size fits all,
but if you want something
that's going to get you the
most performance and fit the way
you play, this is gonna
be a much better option.
Based on my limited experience
with the SCUF Vantage,
that's only gonna be even
more true once it's released.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
