I gotta say pretty solid here I mean I
don't think we any huge Mike Straub
moment - this time around back to campus
but there were a lot of solid game
announcements and new gameplay shown for
games you already know about so let's
talk about the ones that I think were
the best first let's start with a game
that I'm a little shaky on and that
anthem I have a bit of a love-hate
relationship with Bioware the past few
years leaning a little bit more towards
hate I mean I still like a lot of the
games they've released but they don't
really have the degree of polish that
they used to and so a project that
sounds this ambitious and it's something
so different from what they've done
before has me a little bit worried at
the same time though I am a massive
sucker for anything involving power
armor or robots customizing loadouts all
that good stuff that is entirely my jam
so seeing that proof of concept gameplay
with exploring and these power suits
looked amazing to me so on the one hand
maybe too ambitious to be true on the
other hand I am absolutely down to try
attack on Titan fall zero da second is a
game I had no idea how badly I needed
until was debuted at Microsoft's press
conference and that is Dragon Ball
fighters or Fighter Z I'm not entirely
sure if marketing is a little unclear to
me but the point is it looks amazing I
grew up on Dragon Ball Z so the Estela
is already strong there but what's more
important is that while we've had lots
of Dragon Ball fighters in the past none
of them to me felt like they truly
captured the speed and intensity of the
fights you would see in the show and
that's where arc system software is just
a perfect fit I mean guilty gear is
basically how I imagined Dragon Ball Z
fights should be in a video game plus
you're adding in a 3v3 aspect I love
Marvel vs. Capcom I am completely sold
already
next up this game we already knew about
but we finally got some gameplay for and
was easily the highlight of Sony's press
conference and that is the spider-man
game for ps4 now to be honest I'm not a
huge fan of how quick time event heavy
this gameplay demo was near the end but
that's pretty easily balanced out by
everything else we saw the combat looked
absolutely amazing I love that they're
taking a bit of a stealth element to it
but more importantly the web-slinging
this is something that no previous
spider-man game has ever really gotten
right before because to be honest it
actually is kind of a hard thing to do
right it was always the situation where
you're running around in New York just
having webs go up into I don't know what
two birds playing something high above
you this time around we actually saw in
the gameplay attaching to building
zipping through going super fast in a
way that is hopefully intuitive if it
plays as smooth as it looks
this game is going to be incredible
fourth up was the most pleasant surprise
I had this e3 and honestly the highlight
of EA's press conference for me and
that's a way out a new game from the
same developer behind brothers now if
you've never played brothers before
that's your weekend plans now it is a
cheap game it takes three to four hours
to complete it's on pretty much every
major system go play it it's worth every
penny what was really interesting about
brothers is how it messed with the
concept of co-op you were one player
controlling two characters and that
really impacted the way you viewed the
story a way out it's continuing this
idea by focusing on true split-screen
co-op even if you're playing online the
game forcibly must be played in
split-screen there is no way to do this
as a single-player game
the entire idea is placed two separate
characters handling situations together
and seeing how the story evolves based
on what you guys do it's a rather
ambitious idea but after what I saw with
brothers I completely believe they could
pull it off and then we have one of the
biggest hits of this year's e3 Super
Mario Odyssey this is a game that I
already went into being pretty excited
for and the trailer and all the gameplay
we got has increased that hype
exponentially this looks like the first
true brand new Mario game we've gotten
since Mario Galaxy back on the Wii in
2007 a decade ago all the mechanics they
showed off just looked like so much fun
like being able to possess different
kinds of enemies and also regular humans
which is actually a little disturbing
when you think about it don't think too
hard but you can also possess it to your
ex with T which is incredible and if
you're watching more gameplay beyond
just what was in the trailer they also
showed off all their new stuff like
lifting mechanics from link between
worlds where there's actually a 2d Mario
mode when you climb up walls and even
the music changes to retro with just
have you ever seen a game that looks
like pure fun and joy that's what this
looks like
speaking of Mario there is another game
I want to talk about and that's what I
think is really a big Cinderella story
of this e3 Mario cross Rabbids now in
usual Ubisoft fashion this is a game
that ended up getting leaked ahead of
its official release and it was met with
a lot of skepticism
and Tessa you ever say a word so many
times that you like okay I want to say
pessimism for some reason yeah that's
not a thing except when you really hate
the movie the pest with John Leguizamo
it was terrible oh no did that Pelt make
it now I'm not a big fan of rabbits I
never have been but even I have to admit
they have their charm here and there and
something about the way that it was
mixed with the Mario universe in these
trailers just felt natural in a way that
I never would have expected and what's
even weirder about it is I never would
have thought that a crossover like this
would have just resulted in XCOM and in
the end how badly I want Mario cross
Rabbids cross XCOM I mean you would
think that it would just be some kind of
simple fun party game but it actually
looks like a really in-depth tactical
game that's also silly and fun at the
same time this is not a game I would
have ever asked for or even thought it
is even possibly existing in any
universe but here it is and honestly
Ubisoft kind of making me a believer so
those are my favorite games of e3 2017 I
intentionally left out anything that was
purely just trailers or announcements
without actual gameplay make sure to let
me know your favorites down below in the
