- Microsoft has just officially revealed
the very long rumored new model
of the Xbox One, the
Xbox One S All-Digital,
a system that removes the disc tray
in favor of making a
digitally focused experience
and they were awesome enough
to send us one early to check out.
The goal of this design is
to offer a version of the Xbox
that is focused entirely on
just the digital experience.
In fact, you can see that
not only have they removed
the disc drive, but they
even removed the little slot
from the front design, making this a One S
that looks a little bit
more like the One X,
it still has the same dimension as the S,
but no longer has a
visible disc tray at all.
To also emphasize this
concept of being all digital,
it does come bundled with
three digital codes right away,
Forza Horizon 3, Minecraft,
and Sea of Thieves,
which, by the way, I already
have all these games,
so pay close attention to this video
and you might see some
of those codes make a little appearance.
There's also a deal for people
who don't currently have
accounts with Game Pass
to sign up for three months for Game Pass
for one dollar, which is also
the deal going on right now
for their spring sale, which
is a really great price
to be able to access all these
subscription based games.
Now some of you might be
looking at this system
and wondering, why, why
make a system that cuts out
what is arguably one of the
key features of a system,
the ability to play physical games,
or even watch physical versions of movies,
and the answer is, well
'cause it's the future.
Look, I know there is
that part in everyone
who's grown up gaming where
you have this attachment
to the nostalgia of
physical media, I get it,
I am the same way, I still buy
most of my games physically,
but at the same time I understand
that there has been a very heavy shift
in the way the gaming
industry has been going,
and that a lot of people
honestly, don't care about that.
As the years have gone by,
and digital has become more
and more accessible and
more people are comfortable
with the concept of buying
something digitally,
there's been a very heavy
shift towards this idea
of people aren't really
buying physical games anymore,
I mean if you even look at
stats comparing physical
to digital sales over the last ten years,
numbers from 2009 to 2017
basically show a flip
in users where, way back then
you had 80% people physical,
20% digital and now it's more like
80% digital, 20% physical.
Reasons for this are numerous,
first off, for a lot of people,
digital is a lot more
convenient, you don't have to go
to a store, you don't have to
wait for something to ship,
if you wanna play a game
the moment it's available,
you can preload it on your system
and at midnight or 9
p.m. or wherever you are,
you can just play it the
second that it's now playable.
Now, something that has been
a bit elephant in the room
for this system is the
fact that it's $249,
which is $50 cheaper than
the MSRP of an Xbox One S,
but that's not necessarily
how much it actually costs
to get a One S these days, if
you search the right places,
you can pretty easily
find discontinued versions
of the bundle that go for lower than $300,
and even lower than
$250, with that in mind,
it's gonna be interesting
to see how as time passes,
if deals start to show up for this thing,
and it goes down over time,
how it's gonna start
comparing to those options.
Now as for the actual experience
of having one of these,
it is interesting to see
that there's just kind of
small differences right away
in the experience of having
this versus a regular One S,
again visually it doesn't
have that disc slot,
which I do think looks
a little bit better,
I think the One X pulls
it off a little more,
because it has that slightly
thinner form factor,
but I still like the visual
of having not anything
interrupting the middle here,
and just having that one solid color,
and I'm really curious if down the line,
they start doing other
bundles or versions of this,
what other colors might start to pop up.
It's also interesting when you're actually
just physically pick one of
these up compared to a One S,
because there is a difference
in how the weight feels,
because it's not just that
it's missing a disc drive,
but it's because the disc drive normally,
just occupies this side of the system,
so it almost feels a little more lopsided,
which isn't normally gonna be an issue
when you just have it
set up sitting somewhere,
but it is an odd thing
to notice the first time you pick one up.
So seeing as how the main
difference is the removal
of the disc drive, I'm curious
what the actual weight
difference is gonna be,
between these two systems,
so we'll start with the regular One S,
and, that weighs in at six pounds,
just under eight ounces,
while the All-Digital,
is five pounds, seven ounces,
so it's a little over a pound lighter.
So seeing as how the big difference
in the new One S is the removal
of the disc drive, I'm curious
what the weight difference is gonna be,
so we're gonna start off by
weighing the regular One S,
and see how the All-Digital compares,
so to start we'll weigh this one.
And we've got 2.9 kilograms,
let's see what we have
with the All-Digital,
let's set this one down,
this one,
and 2.4 kilograms, that's
a whole half kilogram off,
that's pretty noticeable.
So to see if there's anything different
about the actual inside of this,
which I suspect it really is
just gonna be a whole One S
with the drive ripped out,
we're gonna open it up.
So the first step is to void our warranty,
yeah so normally the disc drive
would be right under here,
but this looks different
from how it normally would.
And there's just a big ol' empty space,
where the drive used to be.
Yeah, so they reinforced
with this bit right here,
to make sure it still feels strong,
but it's just a big empty space.
This model also ships with
a one terabyte hard drive,
which has basically become the standard
for a lot of current
models of the Xbox One,
and even of competing systems,
now with stuff that's preinstalled
and the actual software
of the system itself,
this really leaves you with
about just under 800 gigs
to work with for games
to install on the system.
Of course, if you ever want more storage,
than that one terabyte,
you do have the option
of using external hard drives
that you just plug into
one of the USB ports,
or if you wanna go really extra,
rip the system open and
replace it with your own.
And again, I get it,
there's benefits and reasons
to wanting to have things
physically, I'm the same way,
I still buy a lot of games
physically when I can,
but it's just not the way a
lot of the market's going,
and this isn't something
that's being hardcore forced
on everyone just yet, I mean,
this isn't replacing the One
S, this is another option
to the One S, if you don't care
about physical games at all,
and you just wanna buy
all your stuff digitally,
that's what the All-Digital is for,
if you still want physical games,
well they're still selling and producing
those regular versions
of the One S and One X
if that's what you want.
But I think this is a very clear sign
of something that
Microsoft's been doing a lot
the last couple years and
that it's another market test
to see how much people
really care about this option
if they'd rather just save the money
to have a no disc system,
and this all comes back
to what I think our tests
for what the next generation
of systems are going to look like,
and we've talked a lot about the idea
of a streaming focused system
that's a cheaper option
that doesn't have anything
internally in it at all,
it's just a way to play
games over the internet,
but there's also the comparison of,
if there's multiple new models
of this next generation system,
maybe there's an option that
is just a digitally focused one
and then the pro one that costs more,
kinda like here with the One X,
is gonna be one that
includes a disc drive,
and this isn't the first time
this idea's been messed
with before either, in fact,
PlayStation did this before
with their PSP system,
where they had the regular PSPs
that had the UMD disc things
but then, as an alternative
model, they eventually released
that did develop a cult
audience was the PSP Go,
where because it didn't have
to worry about having
that reading technology,
it was a lot more compact
and had this flip design that
was a really cool change.
The debate of physical
versus digital media
has been going on for a long time,
especially with video games in particular,
and part of that argument's always been,
well, yes there's the
merits of one or the other,
but at some point, physical is just going
to die off in exchange for the digital,
and when is that gonna happen,
is that gonna be this next generation?
I don't think so, not 100% at least,
I think there's still going to
be physical options out there
but they're going to be
less and less focused on,
and eventually the way they're
gonna get people used to this
is by offering these kind of
cheaper, all digital options.
Oh, and I almost forgot, the
new Xbox One S All-Digital
will be releasing in just
under a month, on May 7th.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
