a very interesting announcement
regarding them having a sort
of partnership with Sony.
And while the specific names
of Xbox and PlayStation
weren't really used in the announcement,
it seems more or less like
that's basically what it's really about.
Now what exactly they're talking about
is in regards to Microsoft and Sony
working together in terms
of Cloud Based Technology.
Specifically, both of them
making use of Microsoft Azure.
Now where this comes to play with systems
is likely to be the very
heavily talked about future
that Microsoft has been involved
with, with Cloud streaming.
Now this news is really interesting
for a couple different reasons.
First off, there's the
obviously long time rivalry
between Xbox and PlayStation when it comes
to just old fashion console wars,
dating all the way back
to the original Xbox
coming out verses the PS2.
But another reason why this is interesting
is because Sony hasn't really been talking
about streaming services too much lately.
Yes, they do have a
history of working with it,
for instance, with PlayStation Now,
allowing people to play some PS3
and PS4 games in streamplay.
But it hasn't been
something they've focused on
as far as future discussions
for what they're working on.
However, obviously, this
announcement points to the contrary
that not only is
Microsoft still interested
in pursuing this future for themselves,
but that PlayStation
wants a cut of it as well.
And it's something that they're willing
to work together on to try
to excel the technology.
Well, Cloud Based Technology was the focus
of the announcement, it was also mentioned
that working together on semiconductors
and AI technologies as well,
which more than likely play
into these same services.
So, does that mean this is it?
It's over?
The console war is just gone?
No, not at all, at
least not any time soon.
Look, this is a very strategic partnership
with one specific goal in mind.
Microsoft and PlayStation
wanna work together
to deal with Google.
Microsoft has been talking a
while about Cloud based gaming.
Ever since the Xbox One came out, in fact.
And while it's something
that they've been working on,
they haven't really had
any true competition
in that aspect until the
recent reveal of Google Stadia.
Now there have been a lot of opinions
about whether or not Google Stadia
is gonna be something that actually works
when it launches later this year,
at least in testing phases.
But whether or not it does,
the fact remains that it is a major
threat to something that Microsoft
for a while didn't have any
obvious competition for.
And in that regard, it really
isn't that surprising at all
that Microsoft is willing
to work with Sony.
In fact, I think that
at this current time,
Microsoft doesn't really care
about the concept of console war.
At least, not in the way that
a lot of other people seem to.
And I think Microsoft's
main goal is to try and work
with as many companies as possible
and make themselves ingrained
in all gaming culture.
They don't care what system you play on
or what you're doing, as long as Microsoft
is involved in some way.
That's why we've been
seeing things like Xbox Live
come to Nintendo Switch.
Or even some originally
Xbox exclusive titles
like Cuphead make their way to the Switch.
And in this respect, the really surprising
business news actually is that
Sony is working with them,
because after things have gone so well
since the PS4 came out, Sony
really hasn't had a reason
to try and play nice with everyone else.
I mean, a really key
example is the whole idea
of cross-platform play where
they completely abstained
from it entirely until enough people
complained for a few specific games,
and that's how it still stands.
You get cross-platform Fortnite,
you get cross-platform for Rocket League.
Everything else?
No.
And let's not forget
that both these companies
have already begun talking up
their next generation systems
with PlayStation already
dropping some hints
about what the PS5 might have power-wise.
And Xbox giving even more vague hints
about how theirs is going
to be even more powerful.
So no, the console war is not over.
At least not for the next generation
where we're still going
to see major consoles
from both systems and are
both of them are still
gonna have exclusives
and reasons to compete.
So what does this actually
mean for the future?
Well, I think on the Sony side of things,
it shows that there is
actually a much larger interest
in streamplay than was previously shown.
At least in recent years from Sony.
I think that means for
the PS5 we might be seeing
a continuation of PlayStation Now,
or PlayStation Now
taking on some new form.
I don't think it's going to
same degree as Microsoft is,
where we might even see something
like a streaming focused
basic Xbox, but I think
PlayStation is going to offer
some kind of newer version of
a PlayStation Now membership
that focuses on using
that streaming technology.
As for Xbox, this is just one more example
to throw in the pile of
how Microsoft is trying
to actively work with more companies
instead of actively against them.
And so this leads a lot more credence
to some of the rumors and
theories people have had
about how Microsoft plans to work
with other companies in the future.
For instance, with Nintendo.
As we've already said,
they have things like
offering Xbox Live and
having some exclusives
go over to the Switch.
But I think this also means
that we could be seeing stuff
like the entire theoretical
future where Xbox game streaming
could come to the handheld system.
Which is honestly a
best case scenario thing
that I really hope ends up happening.
Because the idea of being
able to play something
with One-X, or even future
Xbox system graphics
on a Nintendo Switch handheld
while you're connected to
Wifi, that sounds awesome.
Provided that you know, it
actually streams through
cleanly and doesn't break all the time.
The fact of the matter is
that while this sounds like
huge, awesome news right
now, it's not gonna be
something we see any real fruits
of until much later down the line.
They are working together
to develop technology
and whether or not that technology
plays a big role in
gaming in the near future
we're just gonna have to wait and see.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
