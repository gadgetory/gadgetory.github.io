today which we've been waiting up for
some time this is one of my favorite
games they came out during the SNES era
and it's a video open wanting to work on
and I actually never had it on the
original lesson yes I only played
remakes on the PlayStation on the DS so
finally order it for the Super Nintendo
cruncher yes what is chrono trigger so
chrono trigger is an old RPG from SNES I
actually just realized I was looking it
up earlier it's gonna be almost its 20th
anniversary from when it came out which
was not intentional what I said I want
to do this video I was just sort of like
oh hey eight years old when this came
out but I wouldn't have known because
you were a Sega kid yes poor deprived
child oh man Sega man so there's a lot
of screwing around I could do here but
I'm gonna just kind of do them oh yeah
now this guy was what's his deal that
Harry its Goku that's actually okay so
Toriyama the guy that does Dragon Ball
and all that stuff he was the artist for
this so that's why like if you look at
portrait its red-haired Goku like
flat-out this is one of the best games
on the SNES but I don't know if it's one
that like was a universal you know oh if
you had an S and yes this was the game
that you knew you know it's like a Mario
equivalent it wasn't my fault though but
you weren't in Tendo no because my mom
got me one and then the duck hunter was
the first game I ever played and I
couldn't stop playing it and between me
and my brother we ended up fighting over
it and of course she said that's it like
that's just going back back to the store
didn't have a console eventually got a
Genesis right I actually have no memory
of like when I got what system were went
because I think most of them were bought
for Josh's benefit initially and then I
just kind of kept playing them as time
went on I was using the more than he was
okay so this was one of the things that
was awesome about this game so if you
ever played in like old-school Final
Fantasies or even recent games - yeah a
lot of them did that random encounter
 the thing where you know you're
walking around the screen almost sudden
everything shakes yeah and now you're in
a random endless hallway fighting guys
with this one kids blur ation and combat
are in the same place okay I'm waiting
for my turn so it's still turn-based
guys but it all
happens on the same screen okay so like
when you run into an enemy you know you
pull your weapon out combat starts music
starts and then when it's over you go
right back to exploration and there's no
awkward pause in the middle of that you
know there's like a split-second of
loading in and out of the fight yeah
it's not like this thing that just
interrupts your day and angers you over
time and instead of the mole being
random all the encounters are
intentional you know some of them aren't
avoidable like this one yeah oh there's
others where it's like yeah there's a
guard just don't get seen by them or so
you can't avoid I couldn't if I hide
this one but there's some you kid yeah
once again one of the things this game
did is that it didn't really hold your
hand too much with where you need to go
mm-hmm
there's definitely some linear parts the
farther you get but early on it kind of
just throws you places and forces you to
explore and talk to people and figure
out were you're supposed to go something
that a lot of more recent games don't do
anymore some of them hold your hand you
know oh go here follow the subjective
point yeah yeah and these these ones you
could look up a guide to know where to
go but most the time you'd end up
talking to everyone in town to get an
idea of where you're supposed to go one
of the things that makes this game great
too it's not just like what I was saying
earlier though you know oh it did
certain things differently that just
really meshed well but it's also one of
those situations where it kind of just
hit all the right points simultaneously
yeah you know it's sort of the the music
was good the visuals were good the plots
great it's got this great mixture of
sort of being you know very kid-friendly
but then these random really Solem kind
of adult moments that's well done so
yeah just for its time and just kind of
what it all hit simultaneously is a
classic I mean it's kind of crazy when
you think about it because this game has
been remade twice now okay you can get
on the PlayStation and you grab it on DS
and even with those remakes existing
that doesn't affect the fact that the
original is out there and people want to
get that original yeah and pay more for
it you know there's a lot of if you hunt
for like old SNES games you can find a
lot for you know 30 to 60 reps depending
what they are this one you know looking
on Amazon like a hundred bucks right 120
inches yeah and that's for just the
cartridge that's not getting a box a
manual nothing oh you're not like see
what if you find one pristine like oh
like sealed stove those those were going
for like a grand geez yeah if you can
find a pristine one stone so yeah we had
fun in hunting this down for which you
are yeah
segways right
so yeah the reason why did we decide to
hunt this down is like I was saying
earlier this is one of my top three
favorite games of all time and the style
of video I really want to start getting
into is talk about you know like retro
classics games that like you know from
your childhood Rossum but the point is
to kind of re-examine them and see if
you know going back today if they're
still great because some games just
don't age well something that you know
they might have done something cool back
when they came out but now it's just
been done to death in later games yeah
you know or you just played it as a kid
never realized oh this is actually kind
of bad yeah so or Jaime I've never never
seen it
yeah well that's actually I want to do
later ones where you know it's a game
I've never played just so there's that
pure like no nostalgia going on but
because this one was just such a huge
classic for me and I just know it so
well and I really do argue that I think
this game holds its age really well
compared a lot of other games yeah so I
want to start with this because it's
just you know one of my favorites and
then go from there so yeah that's just a
little sneak peek at us plank row sugar
and me explain John why it's awesome I'm
gonna do a more full video we're
actually kind of do the end up of how
everything's aged you know what about it
is so great and why it still works today
so make sure to scrub if you haven't yet
so you don't miss out on that and thumbs
up as well</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
