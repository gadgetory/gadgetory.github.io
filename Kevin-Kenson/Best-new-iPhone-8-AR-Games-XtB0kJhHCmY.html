get the release of iOS 11 which for
gaming opens up the really cool
opportunity of true AR now there have
been a are games in the past for iOS but
it's usually just using your camera and
then putting a bunch of objects on the
screen not really having a great sense
of where the floor walls or other
objects are but now we have our games or
you can actually have whole Maps built
on tabletops or have objects bursting
out of the ground in front of you so
let's talk about the best AR games you
can get right now for your iPhone now to
kick things off I want to start with the
game that I think is an excellent
introduction to AR gaming and that's a
more any one is a very simple game where
all you're doing is using the AR camera
to summon pieces of a stone statue in
front of you that bursts out of the
ground and you have to look at them to
make them complete from the correct
perspective now this starts off very
very simple but coupled later personal
start to get a lot more complex because
they'll start throwing things in your
way like extra stone pieces you don't
make use of or boards that get in the
way of making the image complete now the
reason I think this makes a great
introduction to our gaming is twofold
first off there's not any kind of real
time limit or challenge to this the game
other than just looking around and
trying to find the right angle so you
can take your time get used to a are
tracking and really get used to how to
manipulate and look at objects in an
augmented reality game the second reason
is that you're going to look uh Turley
insane playing this thing so you're
gonna think it comfortable the fact that
just like with any another AR game if
you play this people are gonna think you
look crazy and you need to be
comfortable with that bag now after I'm
on there's another game with a similar
premise but it does gamify it a lot more
and that's key do now keto is one of
those games that it's already existed
before and it messed with perspective
gameplay a little bit where you could
just tilt the screen to make platform
must be lower or higher but with the
release of iOS 11 they've added an AR
level as well and with this one we're
actually climbing a whole tower having
to constantly move around and looking at
different angles to make sure the
character can cross safely now given
this is only a single level they are
hopefully patching more in time but I
really like this one because this is a
style of game that AR is messing with
there's a couple different titles that
have come out as well like arise which
have the same basic premise but on all
those games even though it's a single
level Kito actually feels the most
polished to me and actually is the best
use of tracking and just feels like a
very comfortable and great
looking experienced third up we have
Euclidean lands now just like with ki do
this is a game that existed before
already and it was successful fun little
puzzle game that has regular levels
still but with the release of iOS 11
you're gonna get special AR levels as
well now now if you haven't played this
game before
imagine a mixture of the art style and
kind of puzzle elements of monument with
a Rubik's Cube where you have this sort
of floating little stone thing where you
can rotate it around move a character
around to avoid enemy attacks and you
have to get to a finishing goal point
honestly even without AR this is just a
fun game if you're a fan of puzzles but
what these new levels added it's a great
demonstration of what you can do with AR
puzzle games all right nothin puzzle
platformer games let's move on to some
action titles starting with the game
whose title pretty clearly explains what
it is right up front and that's zombie
gunship of revenant now the way this
game makes use of AR is actually pretty
interesting because it doesn't just use
the basic camera out looked where you
can actually you know see the room
you're in instead it applies this kind
of blackout night-vision effect to
everything so it still looks very gamey
even though you can still occasionally
make out like you know where a table or
chair is in the background a concept of
the game is very very simple there is a
base you need to protect there are
zombies swarming you and you need to
shoot them with your zombie gunship this
game can be played without AR but
actually find that it plays a lot better
when they are activated especially if
you send it up on like a table because
it allows you to move around and zoom in
a have a lot more freedom movement that
just feels very natural compared to the
regular gameplay now I'm not gonna lie
this is one of those titles where
advancement is somewhat slow and they're
definitely gonna try and gouge you for
it hey you want to just buy real monies
you can do stuff faster you want to buy
real money so you can do so fast or you
want to buy real money so you can do so
faster but it's not that bad actually if
you just use it as an occasional kind of
pick up and play sync a little time here
and there it's very easy to unlock a lot
of different guns upgrade stuff in a
regular fashion and just have fun with
it every now and then and we have the
big flagship title that Apple has been
really pushing as a representative of
what AR gaming can become and that is
the machines now on the surface level
the machines is a very straightforward
meat and potatoes RTS game you have your
army you're moving around you have hero
units that have special powers and
ultimately your goal is to blow up the
enemy's base but what's really
interesting about it is how it shows off
how much more dynamic and a our map can
be
a lot of other air games currently make
use of very flat lands or just build a
singular tower that you can walk around
and look at whereas the machines has
much more dynamically designed maps
where you can actually walk around
didn't really get a sense for the lay of
the land and where you want your units
to go you can look through little
underpasses you can check out which
areas higher than others to get an
advantage it just gives you such a much
more interesting map layout that other
AR games just aren't really making use
of yet so there you have some of the
best AR games you can grab right now for
your phone now aren't these the absolute
just best games in general that you
could ever grab no ARS and alergic
technology controls aren't always going
to go the way you want them to things
sometimes get a little fickle but they
are a step in the right direction that
is really showing us where this
technology can go and hopefully we're
going to see some way better games in
the near future</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
