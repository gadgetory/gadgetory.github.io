what do you think of the alleged Pokemon
switch leaks okay so for those of you
that don't know what that is or what's
been going on a little while back and so
we talked about that they are working on
a new pokemon game for switch and that
was about it was gonna come out maybe in
2018 maybe later we're not gonna say
anything specific there's just a Pokemon
game in the works and recently people
have uncovered trademarks for something
called Pokemon let's go with the idea
being that's Pokemon let's go Pikachu
Edition and Pokemon let's go Eevee now
because of these names a lot of people
think that it might be either a remake
of Pokemon yellow in which you start off
a Pikachu and Gary / blue whatever you
want to call them started with Eevee
other people saying that it's just
pointing to the fact that the game is
going to be featuring the original
starter area and then there's also a lot
of people kind of assuming that it might
have some kind of crossover with Pokemon
go because of the names Pokemon go
Pokemon let's go but it's all kind of
just conjecture based on the naming so
as far as where to think about them I
mean it's all wild speculation the only
part about it that I do really believe
personally is the fact that it is going
to take place in the original starter
location from the first games pok√©mon
red and blue the reason being is because
even before all of this news Nintendo
was already playing really heavy hints
they were kind of gonna revisit that
area I mean Pokemon Sun and Moon
constantly mentioned the Kanto region so
yeah I think that you know those might
be the names I think it's gonna be in
the first area but that's all I really
personally believe out of all those
rumors everything else is just people
kind of making thin connections so one
of these that got a lot of questions on
are my thoughts on the new Call of Duty
Black Ops for when there were two main
things that really came up first off
what do you think about Call of Duty
making a battle royale mode and do you
think Battle Royale is the future of
gaming well I think it's a little
extreme to say that battle royale is the
future of gaming I don't think it's
gonna replace all games out there but it
certainly is the hot thing right now and
I think all major big-name shooters are
gonna offer some kind of battle royale
mode for quite a while until maybe the
genre starts getting a little too old so
you know call duty I think even
battlefield I think all those companies
are gonna start having some kind of
battle royale mode in their games even
if it's not the focus and kind of like
when MOBAs blew up and we got a flood of
those in the market the same is gonna be
true there's on run we're gonna see a
lot of smaller companies and big
companies pumping out Battle Royale
to try and cash in and compete against
pub G and for tonight is it gonna be
something that's just gonna be the main
standard for all shooters from now on I
don't think so I think it's gonna be
really popular for a while I think
there's gonna still be games that
celebrate the genre but like all trends
it's going to be something that has its
peak and overtime just be another game
genre and second do you think call of
duty black ops 4 will actually be as
successful as black ops 3 because of the
lack of single-player campaign or old
many players abandon it personally I
don't think the lack of a single-player
campaign is going to affect sales at all
and if it does it's gonna be really
minor don't get me wrong I like
single-player campaigns I know there are
people that look forward to that in call
duty but it is just not the focus of the
franchise anymore I mean even Activision
has said that for black ops 3 less than
10% of the people who played the game
actually finished the campaign it's just
not the target audience anymore and
making those campaigns is expensive I
mean they have to hire acting talent and
especially design levels it's just a lot
of resources that could instead go to
making the multiplayer better and giving
you even more maps to play on so yeah I
don't think it affects sales at all and
honestly I think it's the right move do
you think we will get VM Cuban GP a
virtual console get ready to ride
popping jaw-dropping GameCube action yes
and no so Nintendo has said repeatedly
that they are not putting Virtual
Console on the switch but I don't think
that necessarily means that they aren't
going to have retro games so the entire
system Virtual Console is that on some
of their other platforms you've had the
option to buy some retro games for like
you know six bucks apiece as digital
content and play the games there but it
didn't cross over between systems and
was kind of annoying it was a whole
thing and they said that they're not
doing that on the switch but they have
said that retro games are going to be
some part of their paid online service
so what I think Nintendo is doing is
they've been really trying to like pick
up on a lot of the business strategies
that other companies are doing for
longer we've been seeing a lot more DLC
in their games that kind of thing paid
online service so I think that if we're
going to see retro games on the switch
instead of being virtual console where
you're buying individual titles they
might move on to some kind of new system
that's more along the lines of
PlayStation now or the Xbox gamer pass
where you have a membership and that
gives you access to a number of retro
games now that might be just all one
thing under the online membership or
maybe that's just sort of a taste of it
and they announced a more full service
down the line if they're going to do
retro games in this way
I think that's the direction they're
gonna start going would you rather see
the return of Fable with a proper fourth
entry the resurrection of scalebound
or a new xbox IP any of these would be
really tempting because I would just
love to see some more exclusive content
on the Xbox between the three of them
fable I think it's time is just done I
mean lion head is gone the original
creators and around anymore and now
they've just done like a card game with
it I think it's just the times over it
was a fun series but it's just it's gone
between scalebound a new IP the new IP
ii is really really interesting to me
because it's just like it could be
anything maybe they do something
entirely brand new or something really
cool that'd be awesome
but on the other hand I was really
excited for scale about I like the idea
of writing dragons and blowing stuff up
and kind of having a little bit of that
Devil May Cry style action mixed in like
that all called an appeal to me a lot so
if that could actually get resurrected
which there's been rumor that maybe it's
back on track that'd be great
either way I just Microsoft needs some
more exclusive games that would be
awesome do you think any other Zelda
games will be ported to the switch for
example twilight princess or Majora's
Mask so for a little while Nintendo got
really hooked on porting some of the
bigger Zelda games to the Wii U and 3ds
on the 3d guess we got both n64 games
Majora's Mask and Ocarina of Time
whereas on the Wii U we got Twilight
Princess and Wind Waker and yeah I think
it's possible they might bring those
over again to the switch especially with
the high number of Wii U games reading
to be released on the switch but I think
is necessarily a top priority I think
they've already got a lot of other
bigger games they've been bringing over
and I think doing a port of a port just
isn't quite as high and if they do do it
I really hope they don't just do them
individually again I would love if they
just did like a collection whether that
was having Wind Waker and Twilight
Princess together maybe even throw in
Skyward Sword so we have that whole kind
of run of games all together that'd be
cool
I just don't think it's a top priority I
think down the line some point for so
much maybe
issues a new switch with better
resolutions at the same battery life or
a new switch with the same resolution
but way better battery life which would
you choose
you know resolution is nice and all I
mean I've even said in videos before
that I would love to have some version
of the switcher you do have a 1080p
screen because it does
a lot better but honestly if I have to
choose between that battery life I would
take the battery life because if I want
to have better-looking visuals I can
dock the system but when I use in
handheld mode the whole point is to be
portable and if I can get more than just
you know three hours while playing
certain games that would be fantastic
and really if we're talking about
performance versus battery life there's
actually a third option I would maybe
take instead of battery life which
instead of better resolution
I would love higher in more consistent
frame rates because while a lot of games
do run great in handheld mode it really
breaks my heart when I play some games
that I really like but then in handheld
they have some framedrops they're not
really doing a steady 30 it's just high
consistent frame rate was definitely the
best way to go for me but between
resolution of battery life battery life
hands down</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
