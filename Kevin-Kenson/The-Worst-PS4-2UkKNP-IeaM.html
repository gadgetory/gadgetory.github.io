where people are building the ultimate
ps4's this disaster that sits in front
of me are some of the most popular ps4
accessory a little video called building
the ultimate ps4 you may have caught our
building the ultimate ps4 and I use the
word ultimate very lightly there that's
cool me don't you bro we've gotten
caught up in that kind of stuff here too
we have reviewed all kinds of really
cool awesome controllers and awesome
headsets and stuff that is you know not
exactly cheap but at the end of the day
how really important is all that to
shape in your game experience is it just
the game itself or does all this stuff
accent in some way well let's find out
let's go ahead and build the worst PS
first let's start with the right kind of
ps4 to build off of now yeah there's ps4
pros and ps4 slim is out there now that
you can buy brand new but let's go older
let's get an original ps4 the kind with
that super loud fan
and on top of that let's not try to find
one still boxed and nice let's go get a
used one that's gonna be maybe even beat
up a little bit and try it out
so our way right now to our local
nondescript major chain game it seems
we're going to gamestop and the plan is
we're gonna pick up a used ps4 now when
you buy you stuff they've used and
refurbished we don't want refurbish
that's like they clean it up and fix
stuff up we don't want that we're gonna
ask for the ugliest used one they have
where some guys just traded it in maybe
there's some dents I'm hoping and
they're just reselling it as is that's
the hope so we've grabbed our ps4 here
and it's actually not quite as beat up
as I was hoping but that's fine it's
fine
it does have some scratches on the gloss
which is a little messy looking
especially in the right light but that's
okay because we can cover that up with a
skin
oh yeah
all right so our ps4 is wrapped in this
beautiful beautiful skin and now the way
that we got to talk about what
accessories we're gonna use for this
terrible idea
so we've got our ps4 next up we need to
grab what is probably the most important
part of how you interact with the game
the controller now yeah we can go with
the regular Dual Shock on the ps4 but
let's your pollen Amazon and read some
reviews useless
these are cheaply made malfunctioned
after a few weeks we bought two in the
court fell right out of one of the
controllers exposing the wires the
buttons started sticking on the other
one one star disconnects one star waste
of money one star warranty one star POS
one star tragic don't get one star we
got it it's not even like taped properly
it's got like oh yeah this is what we
needed it's just enough like a ps4
controller that oh wow that's how that
feels that is awful I can't wait to hook
this up an extra try it out but first
before we can actually finish up this
whole setup there's one important part
we of course need and that's a TV now
we've gotten all kinds of 4k systems and
stuff before that look awesome but once
again what's the others is for a
terrible experience so let's go to see
our team
so we've hooked up our ps4 to this old
Samsung CRT TV which we may have taken
out of the Pokemon snap station
anyways don't worry about that the point
is we have our ps4 running on the CRT
now if you're curious how we do this
it's not magic or anything all we did
was plug in the ps4 is HDMI cable into a
converter to AV and it goes right in CRT
no problem and surprisingly it actually
looks really good so with all these
things coming together the CRT TV the
really bad controller the money skin on
the ps4 how does this affect the
experience and what does it like to
actually play games on it okay alright
so this actually looks pretty clear I
mean relatively it's obviously not 4k
but I can see things that being said
playing a game where it's important to
shoot things like directly in the eyes
is a bit harder when you're in whatever
lower resolution this is that if we're
gonna stop my head up I'm stuck going
left the controller is just only reading
left now but yeah I'm just running in
circles and getting dizzy can we unplug
that INRI plug it in yeah I gotta be
honest when we first kind of pitched
this idea in my head I was like it
doesn't matter what TV you use or what
controller you have I mean if a game is
fun a game is fun and I still kind of
believe that but this definitely kind of
ensures to me that there is a certain
baseline you need because it's kind of
insane that we're using a controller
that's constantly disconnecting and a TV
that's over two decades old ripped out
of pokemon snap station so yeah I think
if thing to really realize is you don't
necessarily have to have the most
expensive a nice stuff out there
whatever you got at home is definitely
better than this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
