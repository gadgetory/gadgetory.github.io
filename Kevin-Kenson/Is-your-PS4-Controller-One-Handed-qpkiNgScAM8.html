controllers before in this channel and
normally when we do it's a fun little
history lesson about where a controller
came from why was made what game it was
for and whether or not it was actually
maybe even useful in certain situations
this time it's a little bit different so
we went on the internet we searched and
bought a bunch of weird controllers and
one of the ones we found was this little
one right here the horrid jog dial for
PlayStation now I had never heard of
this controller before and so we picked
it up I tried that a little bit and we
did some research and I found almost
nothing as far as we can gather the main
idea behind this guy is that it is a
one-handed controller for RPGs
specifically mining the idea being that
a lot of RPGs back then were turn-based
they were slower so you didn't have to
worry about things like hitting buttons
quickly or having coordination doing
button combos you could just with one
hand make options and selections and do
what you need to do in the game it's not
an accessibility controller it is not
designed to make it easier to do any
kind of other game one-handed it is
specifically just a way to more lazily
play RPG use with one hand which does
make a little bit of sense there is
another line of older controllers that
had the same idea as well called the
ASCII grip and that was the same kind of
setup right here now like I said we did
find one article in Japanese talking
about it and the little extra info we
can glean from that is that there are
these two buttons at the bottom here
which have a D and T on them I wasn't
terribly sure what they did before but
based on article it sounds like their
mode change buttons which might be the
words fight and protect or defend or
something that which kind of makes sense
because for the T the Japanese word
provide is Tata Kai Wow
the T could be the first letter in that
the D though I'm not so sure because
other than just straight up using the
word defend any Japanese word like that
doesn't start with DS so it could be
mixed languages or it might be totally
unrelated terms that I'm just messing up
here it's just I'm not sure and the
thing is not even knowing what these
buttons do as far as the names go just
trying it out I still can't figure out
what they actually do I've hit them all
playing different games trying different
things it doesn't seem to be any kind of
turbo function or changing what buttons
do they're just mode changes that might
do something one of the thing we did
figure out too is that while we ordered
this thinking it was a ps1 controller
which it will work for still it applies
to that it looks like it might have
actually been released for the ps2
specifically in mind now as I said this
is supposed to be for RPGs
supposed to make any other kind of game
easy with one hand so let's actually
give this a shot let's try it on some
RPGs and then maybe some other games
that it's not designed for so real quick
first we're gonna test this on the kind
of game it was actually designed for
with one of my favorite PlayStation
titles Final Fantasy 9 idol 10 deceit so
this should be pretty simple I just have
to use the d-pad and hit X every now and
then maybe something else this is still
called a demon d-pad when it's like a
circle like that probably it counts so
for Final Fantasy's from ps1 it is a
little different because it's not
actually turn-based there's like kind of
a sense of time but it's not rushing you
that much that you should still be fine
doing stuff like I could imagine some
specific things that come up later where
you might have to use rather a hand to
quickly hit one of the other buttons at
the same time but those are like weird
isolated incidents most of the game this
is yeah fine no brainer next let's try
something a little more complicated I'm
gonna do Gran Turismo 2 it's your
vehicle too because with a racing game I
mainly just need to worry about
accelerating and turning at the same
time and then I guess if I want to be
good at the game I should break every
now and then but let's let's see how
that works out with with this thing hey
guys important questions do I pick a
slow car so I can actually control it or
should we just go fast all the time so
it's gonna be weird about this is that
accelerating is X and so if I want to be
able to hit that but also turn at the
same time I'm just gonna rest my thumb
here press down and then turn which I
can't imagine being comfortable oh yeah
this is this is not off to start it
doesn't help that the brake button is
next to accelerate so if I turn too hard
to the right I hit that and start
braking I'm doing it I'm turning and
stuff I've been second for now oh no
it's about to go bad like this certainly
isn't optimal but it's not bad so far
once again though like I'm not really
playing pro now I'm also uneasy so
that's what Oh No okay now it's like bad
alright so next I'm gonna go with
another ps1 classic with Castlevania
Symphony night
that's sylvania Symphony ayat which is
like a side-scrolling action game so I
have to worry about moving jumping and
attacking and all kinds of other stuff
at the same time so this is gonna be a
little more weird it's definitely more
time-sensitive in the other game
so far all right so I can move forward
with the myth a little difficulty let's
just go ahead and try and do some other
stuff real quick before we even try
fighting anyone yeah that's Jeff I can
jump in oh no this is this is bad the
other thing too is that so since the
buttons are below the d-pad and I'm
gonna try to hit a button and the d-pad
at the same time using only one hand I
end up pressing down a lot which causes
me to crouch in this game and that's
that's not good this isn't good but it's
not as bad as that was afraid of at
least so far having the trigger
definitely helps but it's really
difficult to simultaneously jump attack
and just do all those things at once
while trying to move at the same time
dodging moves is a problem I'm now I'm
dying I don't even know how I just did
that
I forgot this game viable yes good god
at all this is this is a bad idea
don't don't try playing Castlevania with
with this don't do that let's go one
step harder okay so for our last test
I'm gonna try playing Metal Gear Solid
Bill Gear Solid so I need to worry about
crouching moving holding my gun aiming
all kinds of stuff that I can't imagine
even being remotely possible this
controller suppose you mean consider
that you have the bottom buttons and the
shoulder buttons divided by this entire
distance here and I only have the one
thumb attack attack nope bad I can't be
stealthy when I can't control very well
nope that's I really need to stop taking
the trigger because this just making me
crouch which is not a good idea when
people are firing at you now I'm not
saying it's impossible together the
first room it's not that's not a thing
it's impossible for me to do it right
now with only having this with this
controller in the game for a minute look
man I'm not one of those people it's
gonna be dark souls using a Guitar Hero
Qatar it's just not I'm not that's not
me
so when this controller says that it's
for RPGs and nothing else it means it
really don't try using this other stuff
unless you just want hard mode stick to
a regular PlayStation controller I can
kinda understand why it kind of just
disparate in history because it is such
a weird specific use but that's also
more the reason why I want to know
anything more about it so if any of you
guys watching know anything about this
guy that we have already talked about in
this video let me know in the comments
please cuz I need to know</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
