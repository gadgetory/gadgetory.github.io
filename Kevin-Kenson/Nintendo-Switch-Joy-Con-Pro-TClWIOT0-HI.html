that I've really enjoyed is the joy calm
these tiny little controllers that can
be used by themselves or a combo'd pair
and but more importantly can be attached
to a very large variety of different
accessories to give them a ton of
different specific special uses so we're
gonna go over some accessories today
that give you some interesting uses for
some droid cons or just to get the most
out of them first we're gonna be more on
the interesting side with this a
keyboard grip for your joy cons now
we've talked before about how a lot of
keyboards are starting to show up for
the switch there's not time applications
just yet but a lot of the ones on the
market are actual USB keyboards that
plug into the dock which it gets the job
done but it kind of feels like it goes
against the grain of what's kind of fun
about the switch and this is a really
interesting elegant solution to that now
what this is is a grip the droid Clemson
slide into it does add a little bit of a
comfort grip to the back right here but
of course the main focus is the full
keyboard in middle now this does have
its own internal battery that you just
charged up so it's actually able to be
used wirelessly and also actually
charges the joy cons at the same time
and the way connect to your switch is
with a separate wireless dongle now this
can be used mainly in dock mode but with
little creativity and adapter you could
use this in a tabletop setup as well now
admittedly a keyboard is something that
does currently have a little bit of a
limited use for the switch at least in
the u.s. it has a lot more uses in Japan
right now but as more and more games are
gonna come out that actually start
supporting stuff like this this is an
awesome little add-on to pick up
speaking of things that will charge your
droid cons if you're like me joy guns
are something that are kind of easy to
start amassing and collecting a lot of
because of all different colors that are
out there and that becomes a problem
when you want to make sure they're all
actually well charged and ready to go
when you want to grab them so get in
charge of the Oxford Rubicon's is a
great idea now there are a ton of
different options out there but one of
my personal favorites comes from Amazon
actually with their Amazon basics joy
calm charged standard does for joy cons
at the same time and it's actually one
of the more interesting looking Docs
I've seen a lot of the other ones
usually very basic they just put like
the joy cons on the sides kind of
simulating the grip in this case though
it actually does a little four-way
pattern it's pretty cool this is gonna
make it a lot easier to make sure that
all your joy coms are topped off and at
full power instead of having to just
constantly change them on the dock
itself there's also a little indicator
lights done you know when each one's
fully charged but most importantly while
there are a lot of different charging
stands out there on the
it senses the name is on basics one it
only looks good but it is a little more
on the affordable side next let's talk
about comfort because well that is
really cool that joy sons have all these
different accessories they can attach to
they're not always the most comfortable
to use by themselves now there are a lot
of solutions out there for when you're
using the switch in handheld mode
there's a ton of switch grips on the
market but it's not really useful if you
want to do say using just the joy
collins with a TV mode or tables hub
mode and that's where these come in
little gel cards to put on the joy cons
these are really easy to apply to your
joy cons you just slide them on or take
them off no big deal at all they don't
always look super pretty but
functionally they get the job done great
they add a little protection in case you
drop the joy cons but more importantly
adds this little grip design to the back
so they're a lot more comfortable to use
what's really useful too is that if you
do want to use these with handheld mode
or any other kind of switched on
accessory these don't cover the rails at
all so you can still attach them to
different things by the way if you're
wondering about all these differently
colored joy calls away up in today's
video these are actually skins that are
made by today's sponsor D brand they've
made a whole line of switch skins that
are completely safe to use you can get
them for the joy con for your switch
itself or even for the dock in a large
variety colors or even in this white
which i think looks really nice if you
want to pick one up for yourself make
sure check out the link down below now
that's a great solution if you're using
to joy cons at the same time but what if
you're just using a single joke on in
the side waist position because this is
not comfortable at all and I love
playing a lot of party games that make
use of this when you have everyone using
a single joke on by themselves it's just
terrible to use that's why you need to
grab one of these this is actually one
of the first accessories that talked
about as they must have to get for the
switch and to this day it's still one of
the most used ones I've had because it
just makes using a single jewel con such
a better experience it's really easy you
can just slot either a left or right
hand enjoy con it into it it doesn't
discern either way and it's gonna give
you an actual controller feel when
you're using this single joy con it also
makes hitting the shoulder buttons a lot
easier because instead of there's just
those tiny little inset buttons inside
the railing it actually adds little
bumpers so it feels like an actual
button honestly if you play a lot of
party games a lot a local multiplayer
this is an absolute must-have now
another part of the joy con that can be
improved is the thumb stick because look
it gets the job done it's fine it's
compact but if you're doing any more
serious gaming sometimes you need a
little
more precise control over it and
something's gonna make sure it sticks to
your thumb and that's where some grips
come in handy now control freak is one
of the biggest companies that for a long
time has made a lot of different thumb
grips and they're the ones that I really
like using on the switch in particular
they're really easy to use they just
snap on over the stick itself it gives
it a little extra height so there's more
precision and control early on and it
sticks to your thumb really nicely I do
have a little warning note about these
guys though is that while I absolutely
love using the one on the Left joique on
depending on the kind of game I'm
playing
I might remove the right one mainly
because with how its positioned how you
normally grip a joke on sometimes you
bruh bit a little bit whenever you're
hitting the B button which depending
where you're playing can be a problem so
if you're using something that needs
twin sticks all the time definitely use
both these if you're playing something
we're really only using the left stick
and you don't want to accidentally ever
hit the right one take this one off just
on occasion</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
