upgrading from an xbox one s an original
Xbox or this is your first Xbox one
we've got a list of some necessary
accessories you need to get the most out
of your system we're gonna kick things
off with something that I've probably
talked about to death for you guys for
something in your system but seriously
for the 1x this is an absolute necessity
and that's an external hard drive a 1
terabyte hard drive for a system has
been mostly enough for most people on
the Xbox one s but with the 1x the
increased size of games that now support
native 4k textures is leading to games
being huge in size you're gonna fill up
that harddrive super freakin fast and
that's not even including those of you
that are interested in using your system
for recording gameplay which is gonna
fill even more space so getting a strong
hard drive basically a necessity for the
system now I've talked before however
like the Western Digital ones but
another option are Seagate where they
actually these branded ones for Xbox if
you want one that matches with the
system these are a great way to go next
up we've got something once again that
is familiar but with a twist this time
and that's a carrying case for your 1x
now I've talked in the past about having
backpacks ID bags really traditional
kind of stuff like that but the 1x is
considerably expensive system so you
might want something a little more
protective for it and that's why I
really like this hard foam case this is
basically a more affordable version of a
Pelican case something that's used for
carrying really expensive important
equipment that has cutouts designed for
the Xbox one in particular so that way
the system sits nice and snug you've got
a place to put a controller and some
games as well now like I said this one
in particular is designed for the 1s in
mind thankfully the 1x is so similar in
shape that it's actually able to still
fit nice and comfortably and really
tightly so you're just gonna make sure
that's not rattling around when you're
moving the case hopefully though they'll
make a 1x specific version in the future
if you want to wait and get your hands
on that either way this is a great way
to protect your system now another thing
you're gonna need to make your Xbox 1x
complete is a charging solution for your
controllers now before anybody gets mad
yes there are benefits to just sticking
with double A batteries namely how long
the controller will last before you need
to actually switch out those batteries
or doing any kind of changing but for
some of us we just don't want to deal
with that we don't have to deal with
actually going to get batteries at some
point it's a lot easier to just
charge overnight and have it ready to go
every time you want to play so in that
case you have two choices first one of
the more affordable and efficient
options is to grab a third-party
charging solution like this right here
this is gonna come with a charging stand
dollars you have two controllers going
on at once - or chargeable batteries I
really like this one in particular
because instead of being like this weird
dock thing we have giant holes on the
back of the battery pack you just had
these two little dots right here which
are a little bit of a distraction of the
regular design but much more minut than
other options now another option if
you're willing to spend a little more is
to take the more official route we're
instead of getting a third party charger
you can get an official Xbox playing
charge kit which is gonna just put a
little battery pack inside of your
controller so you can still use the
actual back shell and nothing's going to
look different at all
the main we are gonna charge this is by
just plugging it in your system and if
there's no one way to actually display
your controller I have it in a nice kind
of stand position you can also buy these
little stands right here which puts your
controller on a nice little display now
you can get this in white and black and
if you have any of these special edition
controllers like the Gears or more for
one you can buy a handful of different
special designs that match those as well
now so far this list is a bit all kind
of just well necessities good things
that anyone should grab for their 1x but
it wouldn't be a good video without
going a little excessive on one thing
and that's why in order to celebrate one
of the big exclusives that the Xbox one
X has this year 4 to 7 we've included a
racing wheel now this is a branded one
coming from Logitech that's meant for
the Xbox one specifically it's got a
really comfortable grip a three pedal
setup so you have not only acceleration
brake but also a clutch and honestly it
just has this incredible force feedback
system that makes the game feel so much
more alive so there's really no better
way to experience four to seven they're
not only having on the Xbox one X to get
that 4k resolution in 60 frames but to
throw in the proper controller to go
with it
so there you have all the necessities
you need for your brand spankin new Xbox
one X everything is gonna be listed down
below in the description if you want to
pick anything up and we'll see you guys
later</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
