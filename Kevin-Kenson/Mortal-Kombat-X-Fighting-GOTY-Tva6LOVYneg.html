ups and downs but originally started
with a classic trio of arcade games was
followed by five core games and a number
of spin-offs that are either mediocre or
complete and utter crap only to be
redeemed with a new peak with Mortal
Kombat 2011 which leads the question can
NetherRealm Studios keep up this
momentum with Mortal Kombat X what's up
Internet Kevin here now I know just
simply looking at gameplay from Mortal
Kombat X probably makes you think that
it's just morn the same as Mortal Kombat
9 but that's really not the case there
have been a lot of changes here a lot of
things have been added and a lot of
things have been dropped and the
question is whether or not those changes
were for the better starting with the
core gameplay
now while Mortal Kombat X does have its
additional new features the core
gameplay itself at least while you're in
the middle of a fight is pretty similar
to Mortal Kombat 9 there's really only
two huge changes worth noting first off
while the game does still have your
special meter for IX tax combo breakers
and of course those always satisfying
extra attacks you also now have a
stamina meter which allows you to break
out into a full force run to close
distances very quickly but only for a
short period of time second the game
also has added interactable objects from
injustice enabling you to interact with
the background like picking up crates
and throwing at enemies which is a great
addition because it makes each stage a
lot more interesting beyond just simply
being a backdrop so at first glance
Mortal Kombat X just looks like Mortal
Kombat 9 with some new features added
from injustice but what really makes
this one different and interesting is
what they added right before the match
and how you can finish it specifically
variant fighting styles and brutalities
the way variant fighting styles works is
that while the roster only consists of
24 or 25 characters of your period or in
grabbed Goro each of them actually is
three different fighting styles to
choose from now they all shared the same
kind of core you have the same kind of
combo attacks and certain special
attacks but with each fighting style
you'll also get additional unique
special attacks some of your abilities
will have different properties or you
might actually have very few special
attacks but in exchange get larger more
powerful regular attack combos now
there's two things that really make me
love this change first off each
character has different play styles so
if there's a character you really like
in concept but you don't like the first
fighting style you pick well there's two
more to try but the bigger thing is the
fact
since there's so much more room for each
character to be different and
interesting nether room actually took a
little more of a chance in this and made
a lot more interesting unique mechanics
that we haven't seen in this game before
for instance some characters have
special aura abilities where you set up
a little thing on the ground and while
you stand on it you have special
advantages or other characters have
temporary benefits like you can enchant
your fists to be on fire for a little
while or there are stance change
abilities it's things like this that
really make each character come a lot
more to life and stand out as being just
a bit more unique especially when
there's three different versions of them
to play as now as for brutality's that's
a term that's come up in the series
before but they work a little
differently this time now the game still
has traditional fatalities which are
some of the goriest and most ridiculous
ones in the series ever if you haven't
seen my top 10 favorite ones yet and go
check it out because some of them are
absolutely ridiculous
but in addition to using those there's
also now brutalities which are not as
over-the-top gory but they're a lot
faster and what's really great about
them is that it's a built-in way to
taunt opponents the way it works is that
a brutality happens when you finish off
the opponent using a very specific move
and also meeting a number of other
prerequisites like throwing them so many
times or using so many interactable
objects so as a result it's not only a
cool way to finish someone off and give
a little more variety to fatalities but
it's also a great way to in-game taunts
someone because you made sure to finish
them off with a specific move and they
couldn't stop you from doing it now if
you watched my 5 things you should know
about Mortal Kombat X video brutalities
and variant fighting styles were - the
things I was excited for and the third
thing was the story mode because this is
something that we've seen in both
injustice and Mortal Kombat 9 that not a
lot of other fighting games really do
you know most traditional fighting games
just have you do an arcade mode where
you fight eight guys back-to-back fight
a boss and then get a quick little
epilogue scene but in Mortal Kombat X
there's actually a full-blown story mode
where you have 12 chapters playing as
different characters and it basically
plays out like a full movie now to be
perfectly honest I did like the story
mode in Mortal Kombat 9 better I think
it was more well written but X's is
still really solid my only real
complaint about it is that I feel like
it was a bit of a missed opportunity
when it came to fleshing out some of the
game's new characters there are eight
new characters in Mortal Kombat X and
out of those six them got pretty well
fleshed out in the story mode but two of
them were pretty much left in the dust
specifically ferret or
and Aaron black now to be fair fair tor
is kind of a two-dimensional character
to begin with all you really need to
know is that it's Master Blaster on
steroids but for Aaron black it was
really disappointing because all he ever
really comes across is that one Lackey
of Kotal Kahn that uses a gun so when
he's introduced in the multiplayer mode
as another character you can play as he
just ends up feeling really stale and
flat compared to everyone else that has
a lot more personality traits and
background revealed already now story
mode is not the only option if you want
to do single-player there are of course
the traditional towers or you can do
things like classic arcade mode survival
endless and a test your luck mode where
different random modifiers mess with the
match on top of that though the game now
also has a more interesting option of
challenge towers and living towers now
challenge towers are really just a form
of indirect multiplayer where you score
as best as you can on a tower and then
your friends have to try and top that
score living towers though are an option
that gives you a sort of arcade style
mode that's constantly fluctuating
basically there are three towers that
are always being switched out one of
them is hourly another one is daily and
then there's a premium tower which works
on different cycles but one of the big
benefits is that it helps preview other
content for instance when the game first
came out it lets you play as Goro even
if you didn't pre-order and other DLC
characters are going to be playable
through it as well without having to buy
them so it gives you a little way to
test them out before spending extra
money but that still doesn't really
solve a problem that I'm gonna bring up
later which is how heavy this game
emphasizes its DLC now it is worth
mentioning the game does have one other
kind of single-player mode and that's
the Crypt now this is a returning mode
from past games where it was basically
the way you could unlock different
in-game stuff like concept art costumes
music so on so forth this time around
though they've made it much more of a
mini game where you actually have to
explore a crypt and solve little simple
puzzles and occasionally fend off
enemies with QuickTime events it's kind
of interesting at first but the novelty
wears thin once you solve most of the
puzzles which doesn't take that long
after which it just gets really annoying
because every time you want to spend
coins to unlock stuff you just end up
having to re-enter the dungeon every
time you make any amount of money and
navigate your way through this little
crypt area on top of that the game also
gives the option to just straight-up buy
everything in the crypt with real world
currency at 20 bucks which once again
DLC so as far as single-player modes go
there's quite a few options and
really overall I think Mortal Kombat X
does do one of the better jobs for
single-player experiences in a fighting
game but of course that's not why most
of you are gonna want to buy Mortal
Kombat the reason most people buy this
game is because they want to beat the
crap out of the friends and multiplayer
which it also does an excellent job of
local multiplayer is fantastic all the
variant fighting styles the brutalities
all the stuff I mentioned earlier comes
together beautifully and there's also
alternative modes to give you a little
more fun for instance one were you and
your opponent can pick different special
modifiers that affect yourselves each
other or both at the same time and
really make things more interesting
where things get a little more awkward
though is the game's online options
starting with the factions so the
factions were Mortal Kombat's attempt at
having a more interactive and engaging
online community the way it works is
when you start the game up you join one
of five factions and as you play the
game you get points your faction and
after every so many days and cycles the
faction with the most points is reward
with coins and other cool stuff the
problem with this is looking at who the
factions are and the fact that you're
not automatically allocated to one
faction or another it's pretty easy to
tell who is going to consistently win
because it's basically sub-zero's
faction versus Raiden's versus knose
versus Sonya versus Quan Chi and had it
been something like Sub Zero versus
scorpion I could see some you know more
interesting competition going on but
when you have Sub Zero up against four
other characters that are series
classics but aren't as huge it's just
really obvious that his faction is going
to win which it has so far consistently
now a factions aside the other problem
with online multiplayer is that as of
right now at least input lag is a
problem I've had a few matches that go
through smoothly but I've had way more
that's suffer from a lot of input lag
which isn't that surprising for a
big-name game that has a very successful
launch but it doesn't make it any better
knowing that it is something that will
hopefully get fixed with time as servers
suffer less stress and more patches come
out and maybe they upgrade the servers
but as of right now online can be a bit
of an off-and-on mess it is also worth
mentioning that online doesn't consist
of just traditional 1v1 multiplayer
there's also a couple of the modes to
choose from one of my favorites being
the team mode where you have groups of
three or five players compete against
each other and put it into simultaneous
matches the team that wins the most
matches overall wins the game what's
kind of fun about this though is
if you finish your match first you can
watch the other matches but you're not
watching them directly you just get
status updates in the form of life bars
moving so with zero context you end up
finding yourself cheering for your
teammates or not understanding why
they're getting their asses kicked so
badly so yeah lag online is an issue but
that is something that can and more than
likely will be fixed with time as server
traffic lessons and things get upgraded
there are a couple other problems I have
with this game though that aren't as
easily addressed starting with the fact
that I just feel like there's a little
bit more content that could be here
that's missing for instance I really
liked the tag-team mode in wall Kombat 9
I realized it wasn't exactly the main
attraction but it was a great option for
4 player multiplayer that didn't resort
to just classical round-robin matches
and having that not come back just feels
like a big loss especially because it
doesn't really feel like it be that
heart of a mode to implement second off
I think the cast was just a little too
heavily cut I understand the variant
fighting styles give a lot more variety
to each character and for how many
people they cut I think they did an
excellent job of choosing who to keep I
think all the essentials are here but
there's still some big time series
veterans that are missing
for instance noob saibot and sindell
which leads to another issue that there
are some characters that show up in the
story mode as enemies that are clearly
not fully fleshed out characters but
they're pretty close and it's kind of
surprising
they didn't take a little more time to
fully add the new game including sindell
ring and Tania Tania of course is one of
the four DLC characters so she is
getting fully added which leads to
really my biggest problem with this game
how heavy it is on DLC this is something
that we've seen before with both
injustice and Mortal Kombat 9 and really
a lot of other WV based games where
before the game even came out we already
knew who the four DLC characters were
Tania tremor predator and Jason Voorhees
and before any of them were even
released you can just buy them all in
advance in a season pack for 30 bucks as
well as a handful of costumes so if you
want the real full game you have to
spend an extra thirty dollars making it
90 total now this by itself is annoying
but there's a whole lot more DLC going
in this game you can unlock the entire
crypt by spending $20 in real life and
the game has easy fatality tokens that
you can buy for real money as well in
groups of five or thirty so if you have
trouble doing inputs or you have kids
the game that want to have simpler
inputs as well which is an entirely
other separate issue you can buy these
tokens to where you just have to press
two buttons to see cool glory shit
happen now to top all that off I think
the real cherry on top about everything
is that if you look at Series history
with MK 9 and injustice six months to a
year from now we're going to get a mark
Kombat X complete collection where you
can get all those DLC characters all
those costumes everything together for
60 bucks maybe even as low as 40 so as
opposed to just grabbing it right this
second with the worse online experience
and spending 90 or even more dollars you
could just wait a year have a more
patched and balanced game smoother
online experience and all that content
together for cheaper which just makes it
really hard for me to justify buying
this game right this second you know
don't get me wrong I really really like
this game I think it's one of the best
releases to come out so far this year
but spending 90 upwards to a hundred
dollars on a right now when there's all
those benefits to just waiting for
completed collection I don't know why
you wouldn't just wait unless you really
want to play local multiplayer with some
friends which if you guys want chipping
together and do it great otherwise just
wait and save your money because you're
gonna end up enjoying it a lot more
downline well that was my review of
Mortal Kombat X if you guys enjoyed the
video make sure to hit that thumbs up
button to let me know as well subscribe
if you haven't yet if despite my
warnings you just have to get your hands
in the game right this second I do have
a link posted down below in the
description as always guys thank you so
much for watching the video I'm Kevin
Kenton and I'll see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
