of that I was actually really surprised
that Microsoft did not do a special
edition for the system so kind of the
spirit of getting excited for it I was
thinking maybe we do is set up but
instead let's actually make our own
custom-designed Xbox 1s themed oncea
thieves now I actually haven't seen it's
under here and I haven't seen it yet I
put forward ideas for what should look
like and stuff but everyone in the
office is kind of kept it hidden for me
so this is a reveal to both of us let's
let's see how this looks
let's find out just hope I don't break
it in the process of lifting this black
Oh
so like I said this is a custom design
that we actually commissioned we hit the
guy Excel team we've worked with them
before you might assume that we did that
retro style SNES ps4 controller and we
really wanted to just try and capture
what's already been done in some of the
branded see a thief's stuff and put it
on an xbox one which I think you did a
really good job of actually capturing so
we've got the kind of green skull thing
that's been seen on a lot of the brand
stuff David on the controller they have
it on the hard drive they sold
separately and then colorist team wise
we're using that kind of lightly bluish
tinge green mixed with purples and
blacks kind of splatter effects and one
little lace like detail that I'd like to
that he's able to do is that we got the
Xbox logo in the corner here actually
done in gold so that's a really nice
detail that adds a little more accent
just what other colors we have going on
oh my god holy how I never noticed that
until now you intended to bring it up
while we're rolling so you could catch
it you said of I was always like yeah
it's a skull that's like you know it's
stylized done because it's all uneven
and stuff no those are ships that's
freakin genius great job whoever did
that at rare Microsoft you get a race
that's that's cool yeah I will say
something I was a little worried about
that I heard about before the unveiling
is the fact that as part of the custom
job one thing it's a little harder to do
it's really easy to take off this top
part of the system but it takes a little
more effort if you want to do the back
and I thought it's gonna be like this
crazy offset anything it actually looks
pretty good still you're just seeing the
back part with the white and the ports
and considering you're only gonna just
have this on your shelf in the front
totally still looks like this cool
special edition system don't even see
the white on the back but it really
doesn't clash at all actually really
like how that looks still now as we said
earlier a lot of the inspirations for
how we designed the system is based on
other branded stuff that Microsoft has
done for instance the controller now if
you haven't seen this thing yet it is
really pretty cool there's actually my
favorite things that Microsoft has made
so it's got the same color scheme that
we used for the system you've got that
purple in the back using the green
highlights everywhere what's a really
nice added bonus about this one though
that we weren't able to do with the
custom job sadly is that this paint here
is actually glow-in-the-dark so if
you're playing late at night
is all gonna be shining a little bit
which is such a nice little effect and
this really plays into the whole thing
I've talked about before about how I
think Xbox has done an excellent job the
past few years of just nailing
aesthetics cuz it's not just the overall
look of this controller it's all the
little details to like you actually have
a little laser etched bits here that are
kind of like wood eaten away on a ship
or like particles and stuff just has
that kind of ocean feel to it and
something I've took me a while to notice
when I was using this controller is
actually around the left joystick you
have all this little compass design
right here which is really freaking cool
and that's just what's going on in the
front of control there's actually a
couple of other little cool things in
the back like we have these undead in
our walls that are jousting for some
reason which is neat but also the
triggers are asymmetric so you have one
that's just the regular black and then
one that's in gold which normally
asymmetry I'm not always for in
aesthetics but it just pulls off really
well on this one now this controller was
a limited run thing that they did and
they are currently sold out as far as
official sales go you can still grab
them but they're going for a lot more
now from resellers going as high as 140
or even 160 bucks so you can track these
guys down for a better price do it cuz
it's really cool I know this isn't the
only thing that has been done by xbox
that's branded there's also this little
guy right here now this actually isn't
out yet Microsoft was cool enough to
send it to us which I'm really thankful
for but it's actually a Seagate hard
drive it's an external 2 terabyte that
also has the same kind of general
aesthetic the controller had I mean we
have the main symbol right here with the
skull that purple and green mix and a
little compass at the bottom which i
think is really nice a note and then the
gold etchings for xbox which is where we
got the idea to do that on the system we
made not like I said this one is
actually isn't out yet so unlike the
controller you still have the chance of
grabbing one if you're interested in
checking this guy out I'll put a link
down below you can pre-order them they
come out in early April by the way if
you like this thing good news for you
we're actually giving it away so check
out a link down below in description
it's gonna give you all the stuff you
need to know on how to enter and have a
chance of winning this guy right here so
yeah all this stuff looks really cool
but it's not like we just saw branded
things that were neat and want to do our
own I mean the entire reason for this is
once again I am really excited for Co
thieves I mean I've always enjoyed kind
of pirate related stuff and actually
from this game that recaptures this
feeling of piratey adventure but it's
also kind of light-hearted and fun and
silly but still has some adult themes
going on it just seems like this perfect
balance for everyone who grew up
doing the kind of daydreaming inviting
his pirates and now can do it in a game
with their friends you know Microsoft
has just been knocking out of the park
when it comes to making special edition
systems and controllers I mean even the
Minecraft one that thing is a work of
art not even like minecraft you know I
think they just did such a good job of
taking a popular franchise and creating
the special division system that really
is inspired by it and celebrates it and
that's why when we didn't see anyone
announced Rossio thieves I wanted to
make this happen you know and maybe it's
not impossible maybe it's not too late I
mean it's getting a little late but they
could still maybe announce one and
that'd be really cool but in the
meantime I think that what we had
commissioned here is something really
special</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
