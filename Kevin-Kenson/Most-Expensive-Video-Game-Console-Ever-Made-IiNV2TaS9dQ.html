disc but actually it's an interactive
encyclopedia a stimulating match with a
tennis pro an interactive adventure
through fantastic world in the history
of gaming there has been some expensive
consoles probably the most notorious of
which in recent memory is when the ps3
first launched for $600 but when you
reach further back that is absolutely
nothing compared to the Philips CDI
released back in 1991 the original model
of the CDI launched for $1000 adjusted
for inflation today that is just over
1,800 that is almost four times the
price of an xbox one X now the reason
for this insane price point is because
when the CDI was originally
conceptualized and marketed it wasn't
supposed to be just another gaming
console was supposed to be new this idea
of a multimedia device that is somewhere
between a gaming system and a PC and Mac
where yeah it'll play games but you can
also listen to music watch videos that
have all kinds of different kind of
educational apps and even Madonna
karaoke yeah I'm not doing this
basically the CDI was trying to do
things during the fourth generation of
gaming that really didn't become normal
or popular until the sixth or even
seventh generation was way ahead of its
time it even was one of the first
systems to offer an online component
where you could buy a separate accessory
with a modem that related to connect to
the Internet to do some browsing or even
shop online now despite all these
different things that it could do and
it's insane price tag at launch it's not
really known for any of these things
still there's really only one thing to
see the eye is still popularly talked
about today and that's what it did with
Nintendo why'd you do that I just saved
you from Ganon you did not
back when Nintendo was developing the
Super Nintendo one of the things that
were working on possibly doing was a CD
attachment for the system similar to
something they had done back with the
original Famicom called the Famicom disk
system and something that we saw Genesis
do with the Sega CD except this plan
never actually came to fruition now when
they were working on it there were two
main companies they worked with Sony who
would be making the actual hardware for
the system and Philips who developed the
media format they would be using all the
discs CDI
now for numerous reasons this didn't end
up happening and because of some of
those reasons Sony went on to make their
own gaming system - PlayStation which is
a whole nother story but for Phillips's
and they were already planning on making
the CDI but as part of their deal to
Nintendo
they got licensing rights to using some
of their properties which they did to
horrible effect
princes restore the celestial signs and
rescue rained fire the CDI has a number
of games based on Nintendo franchises
including a bizarre arcade game called
Mario's hotel but probably even more
famous is a number of Legend of Zelda
games they made which to their credit
Summerlin progressive because they
actually featured Zelda as a playable
protagonist but this was all heavily
balanced out by the fact that these
games were awful let's go play one all
right let's give this a try so I at
least know how this starts because I've
seen this opening cutscene so many times
the internet and it is an abomination
this is I found out actually eventually
that this wasn't done in house with the
company that made the game this was all
outsourced to an animation company in
Russia and so that's why it's kind of
this weird disjoint between how this
looks and how everything looks in the
actual game is just it's bizarre enough
how about a kiss for luck you've got to
be kidding squadala
we are off yeah this is weird I've heard
some organs before this is actually kind
of a good game if you ignore the
cutscenes because those are just bad but
it's hard for me to believe that why
play this I think I'm a little biased
because for the timing of when this came
out this game is based on the play style
of Zelda 2 The Adventure of Link which
is all the weird kind of side-scrolling
style and I just don't really care for
that at all it's sorry to tell it's
really going on in this game it's weird
too because you get hit by all these
things and you you don't react like you
don't fall back or anything you just
kind of keep getting a hit and like you
have a shield which I think you can kind
of block with but you can't move it
except by dodging or crying or jumping
or crouching so this one in particular
this is a link the faces of evil where
this is the one game where you do plays
link there were two other Zelda games
they made one was kind of a companion
piece to this where you play as zelda
called zelda the Wando Gamelin i think
and then there's a third one that's just
called Zelda's adventure and that one's
like a top-down but from what I
understand that's somehow even worse
than this yeah yeah the guy was it
called
what's bizarre about it too is that I
don't feel like I really have in any of
what I'm supposed to be doing like at
least in Zelda games when they give you
very little information you kind of
figure it out along the way it's it's
intuitive this is just weird oh you talk
to people by hitting them with your
sword that makes sense and then they pop
up and this is weird-looking FMB game
standing for full motion video games
were really popular during the late 80s
and early 90s and it was alternative to
more traditional games that were
basically interactive movies they didn't
offer the same amount of actual gameplay
as more traditional games but they
offered visuals well beyond what a lot
of their competition could do thanks to
the CD I actually being a more of a
multimedia system they were able to
support a lot of these kind of games
including ports of really popular arcade
ones like dragon's lair and Space Ace
and even had some really successful
original ones like burn cycle but this
was basically too little too late
because while these games were cool they
still require to you to buy a very
expensive system and that wouldn't
actually even run them out of the box
you'd have to buy a separate component
called a digital video cartridge which
would enable the system to run videos as
well as FMV based games like these
otherwise any other games you played on
the CDI were honestly pretty lacking the
FMV support was cool but other games it
just didn't have any of the processing
power to do anything interesting or
better than its competition well the
initial price tag was insane Phillips
did try to control a little bit by
releasing a lot of different sub models
of the CDI down the line including a
cheaper option that was meant to be more
like a straight-up game console the 450
which is actually when we got the set up
right over here still though even with
these cool FMV games and cheaper models
made available later it was enough to
counter all of the lost investment in
the system where the CDI ended up being
abandoned in 1998 after Phillips
reported having a total loss of a
billion dollars making this not only the
most expensive console to buy when it
came out but even one of the most
expensive consoles to make</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
