today we are doing this limited edition
Star Wars Battlefront 2 ps4
now what's really kind of cool edition
about this one is most times that we've
gotten special editions tied the games
it's only for one version of a system
but in this case they actually launched
this one for both the ps4 slim and ps4
Pro but we decided we had to go big and
grab the pro version so let's open this
thing up and check it out as the usual
got another box then before we get to
the system as usual we have the
controller alright let's check this
thing out so the big theme going on with
this edition and with battlefront in
general is we have the different
factions going to war so to kind of
include that on the controller we've got
the rebel symbol right here and the
Empire right here which actually I don't
like this kind of concept but I almost
wish there was maybe a little more color
going on it wasn't just this like
greyish white symbol on top of the
controller that looks good the other
thing that we may not be able to notice
until you take a closer look is the
touchpad right here actually has the
word Star Wars over and over and over
again as a pattern on the entire
touchpad you know I gotta say when I
first saw picture this I thought I was
going to hate this but it's a lot more
subtle than I thought it would be let's
go ahead and get to the system though
that's that's the important part
that was the game that just fall on the
floor hey it's okay guys don't worry
yeah we're good and there it is oh man
so once again we're going with a really
glossy top on this one on the top of the
system here we're going to that same
theme of having the two competing sides
rebels and Empire and in the middle we
actually have the symbol for the Inferno
squad which is who you play as during
the single-player campaign for the game
so that one's taking center stage right
here otherwise it's a pretty traditional
black console look at the PlayStation
symbol in the corner right there and
then one thing that I'm gonna I'm gonna
rant a little about this later but one
other little design choice is that on
the front end right here you've got the
Star Wars logo on the bottom
you know growing up I was a huge Star
Wars fan I mean that was basically one
of the like three franchises that
basically defined my childhood it was
like that Power Rangers a little earlier
it's not Veronica the high ground and
then Pokemon but this was huge for me so
whenever there's like a special edition
Titan kind of thing I'm always kind of
excited to see what they do and honestly
actually really like this one at first
glance I was a little unsure when they
first revealed it but seeing it in
person I've ranted before about how I
don't like having these kind of half
glossed half matte finishes but I think
for this it actually really works really
well I mean especially when you're like
think of the movies and the Empire
there's always these heavy gloss
finishes on everything you know Darth
Vader's helmet alone is a good example I
can't breathe in this thing so I think
this actually fits really well like it's
this kind of deep black look to it that
you wouldn't get with a matte finish the
symbols I like on as well and a proto
Squad symbol I think it all ties
together really nice the only thing
about this system that I'm just not a
big fan of is that we have the Star Wars
label right here because this basically
violates what to me is one of the most
important rules when you're getting any
kind of cool branded stuff it could be a
t-shirt the skin of your phone whatever
I hate whenever anyone decides they need
to put the name for the thing on the
whole point of a system like this is for
fans of something to celebrate something
that they love and we don't need to know
what the title is you know I know this
is Star Wars just seeing the rebel and
imperial symbols it just gives this cool
feeling to it that I know what this is
but then all of a sudden it's like just
in case you weren't sure though guys
this is a Star Wars system as a result
you know using the system I definitely
think that I would end up keeping it up
in tower mode a lot more often because I
want to show off this side which I think
they did a fantastic job with while the
front just so close now of course along
with our special edition system and
special edition controller we also get a
copy of Star Wars Battlefront 2 but this
is not a regular version of it this is
actually the elite trooper deluxe
edition which has a couple little
add-ons you don't get the regular game
some more weapons and upgrades of able
to your main troops and
a more interesting upgrade is they get
two knee costumes for kylo Ren and Rey
based on their appearances in the last
Jedi as opposed to their more
traditional design that's based on the
force awakens so there we have our
special edition Star Wars Battlefront 2
ps4 like I said well it is a little bit
more of a minimal design and I really
wish it didn't have the Star Wars label
on the front is actually really like how
this one turned out if you guys are
interested I'll put a link for this down
below as well as just for the game I'll
see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
