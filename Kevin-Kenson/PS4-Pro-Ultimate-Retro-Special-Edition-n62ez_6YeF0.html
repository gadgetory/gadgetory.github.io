nan desu kedo Mott Joe ah sorry new home
not back yoga mighty man so step cut I
got places a little over 22 years ago
Japan saw the release of the original
PlayStation and in celebration of many a
gamers love for all things old being
made new color wear has made a limited
run of ps4 pros redesigned in the image
of their great-grandfather now those
have used so many fans with an eye for
collector's editions will recall that
Sony made a batch of their own original
ps4 styled after the original for their
20th anniversary which was awesome but
their main goal with those was to just
bring back all the color schemes and
throw them over a new system whereas
these pros have a bit more interesting
attention to detail to begin with
obviously the system is gray like the
original but you'll also notice that the
middle bar of the ps4 triple-decker
sandwich is a darker gray based off of
the buttons on the original PlayStation
which were a different tone dad a bit of
accenting so the colors right which is a
good start but it's all the little extra
touches that make this thing so cool for
instance the two front USB ports are now
labeled one and two in the same font as
the controller port of the original and
you also notice that the Sony and ps4
etchings on the front are done in light
blue and light green which match the
colorings of the power button and open
buttons text from the original system
the abscess coolest thing about this
redesign Oh to me is how they handle the
logo if you look at a regular
PlayStation 4 pro the PlayStation logo
up top is going to be facing sideways
relative to the front of the system
because what isn't our mode that makes
sense but on the original PlayStation 1
which you're always going to have
sideways the logo is facing the front of
the system so they actually did this
PlayStation 4 pros logo to be facing
this way and I don't know what exact
method they used I don't know if they
sanded it down and put this decal on top
or if they filled it in and paint it
over and put it on but it recreates that
original look which is just really an
amazing attention to detail now taking a
look at the controller you'll see that
Colbert did things a little differently
compared to how Sony approached their
20th anniversary design the same basic
idea is here it's a great finish like
the original system but they even redid
the touchpad
the entire esthetic plus since this is
using the newly redesigned dual shock
it's actually closer because it has
these gray sticks and buttons as opposed
to pure black like you'll see on the
20th anniversary design another thing
too is that it still uses the basic
PlayStation button which is black rather
than using the colored and symbol but
this is actually more accurate to
original ps1 controllers when you look
at those it's just a great place tation
logo not the colorful one you know
looking at the system I can't help but
think about how all of this was made
possible thanks to Nintendo basically
being jerks a long time ago and how much
time has changed the console war
released back on December 3rd 1994 the
original playstation was the new gaming
console in town going up against the
likes of Nintendo and Sega and a handful
of other companies struggling on the
side like Atari and Neo Geo now this
wasn't the original plan originally Sony
was working with Nintendo on a CD based
game expansion before the Super Nintendo
at least that was the plan at literally
the last second CES 1991 Nintendo
announced that they would instead be
partnering with Philips which was not
only a shock to Sony but also planted
the seeds for this monstrosity and stain
on the Legend of Zelda franchise how
about a kiss for luck you've got to be
kidding
quarter ha Sony instead went on to
making their own console not only was
the original PlayStation a success but a
successor the ps2 dominated generation
and sales and is to this day the most
sold console of all time and that's
really what makes this redesign and
paint job so special it'd be so much
easier to just leave it at recoloring
the system's body and top logo the color
where when really all outs of adding all
these nice little touches that create
more of the style of the original system
beyond simply matching colors not that
there's anything wrong with how Sony
handled their own 20th anniversary
system it's just that with this design
you can really tell how it was handled
with the love and care of true fans</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
