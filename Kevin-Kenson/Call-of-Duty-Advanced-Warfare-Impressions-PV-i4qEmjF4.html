singular thought that ran through my
mind while playing the new call of duty
holy crap this is actually something
relatively new to a series that for the
past four iterations has just been
adding slightly different coats of paint
to the same formula what's up guys this
is Kevin here and if you've seen any of
my college of you reviews in the past
you'll know that this has been my chief
complaint every time since modern
warfare 3 or despite new campaigns and
new maps you're basically just buying a
rebalanced game over and over again now
this isn't to say that this one is
completely unrecognizable or that that
core Call of Duty formula isn't in there
because it's definitely in there but in
my opinion this is the first call of
duty in nearly five years since modern
warfare 2 to actually make some real
changes and feel like a brand new game
first off the fairly obvious fact that
this one actually has experienced a
graphical facelift the past few titles
have all looked more or less the same
with some minor updates whereas advanced
warfare is a clear and noticeable
improvement in visuals fit for the
newest gen of systems and decent gaming
computers character detail and facial
animations are particularly worth noting
especially when so many characters are
clearly just motion-captured versions of
their real live voice actors including
most notably Kevin Spacey and Troy Baker
finer details on environments can be a
little more hit and miss especially on
cars that all have a very flat plain
look overall not the absolute best
looking FPS graphics but definitely a
huge improvement over what the series
has brought us to the table the last few
years now as far as the actual gameplay
is concerned the core of Call of Duty is
still definitely here it is a more
fast-paced which based FPS shooter with
a focus on run-and-gun style gameplay
players still build character classes
equipping two guns out of the numerous
popular categories like assault rifles
SMG snipers and shotguns they're still
passive perks special abilities and
score streaks and the game's core
controls are exactly what the rest of
the series has brought us accustomed to
the changes here aren't so much the
removal or tweaking of these core
mechanics but the introduction of more
things that you can do in game primarily
through advanced warfare is big in
setting
stick exo-armor XOR gives players new
movement options outside of the
traditional walk run jump and slide
adding the ability to double jump or
perform immediate side and back dashes
to try and quickly avoid danger on top
of this the exosuit introduces
additional activatable abilities some of
which are just temporary passive booths
like running faster or quickly healing
others though actually change up your
combat options like being able to hover
in the air for a short period of time or
deploy a protective shield to block
attacks while you find safe cover the
exosuit plays a large role in the games
campaign missions which has a focus on
the idea of the development of near
future military technologies and the
influence that PMC's will eventually
have on a global scale all things that
sound very much like there's a bit of
influence from a certain solid metal
series campaign missions alternate
between different exosuit sets offering
a number of different bonuses and
there's even a very super simple upgrade
system employed between missions
rewarding players for completing
objectives and kill goals with points
that can vastly improve your performance
like reload and aim speeds defenses and
carrying capacity the story so far is
actually not too bad that definitely
shows its colors as a call of duty game
with a big emphasis on explosions
ridiculous combat scenarios and
adrenaline junky characters obsessed
with how skilled of fighters they are
now aside from the campaign the game
does of course also offer its
multiplayer mode which is why most
people out there consider buying this
game in the first place with this one
offering a pretty solid array of
different match types ranging from all
kinds of traditional options such as
free-for-all capture the flag and
domination with slightly more uncommon
choices as well such as infected as is
the series standard you level up
completing matches unlocking new guns
and abilities with which to customize
your loadouts advanced warfare does Hank
one noticeable change from ghosts in
that it's using black ops 2's model for
having an overall limit of equipment and
abilities and giving players the freedom
to allocate them as they see fit being
able to create builds that focus on less
equipment for more passive abilities or
more fully upgraded singular guns at the
expense of less variety and etc etc last
up game does offer a third mode focused
on co-op survival this is of course a
horde style mode situation facing off
against regular armed soldiers the big
emphasis
around though isn't just on upgrading
your guns but also purchasing upgrades
for or altering your exosuit as the
match progresses choosing different
styles that offer various degrees of
protection and mobility now I've really
only dabbled in each of these modes so
far so there's still a lot of ground for
me to cover before I gave you guys my
final thoughts the feeling I'm getting
as of right now though is that if you've
never been a fan of Call of Duty then
this one still probably won't change
your mind but if you're one of those
fans out there that liked the series in
the past but found yourself slowly
drifting away as things began to get
more stagnant this might just be enough
of a change to reel you right back in so
I'll finish up the campaign and soak
some more time and all the multiplayer
modes to give you guys my final verdict
on whether or not this one stands on its
own as a proper brand new title now
