first glimpse at cuphead and a lot of
people myself included immediately fell
in love with the game's unique art
direction which really captured the look
and feel of old-school 1930s cartoons
and ever since that e3 I've been waiting
year after year for this game to finally
get released after push back and push
back and Microsoft was awesome enough to
actually send me a review code for this
game so I just could not resist and had
to do a dedicated video on it because
thankfully this game did not disappoint
at all now obviously there are gonna be
some minor spoilers in this video but
I'm gonna focus mostly on just showing
boss battles from about roughly the
first third of the game so there is a
whole lot more to it than what you're
gonna see right here but this gives you
a good general idea of how it actually
plays now before we get into gameplay
the first thing I want to talk about is
how well this game knocked a park with
capturing that old-school aesthetic of
old cartoons now some of this is fairly
obvious for instance the visual ISM you
can see the hand drawn characters
hand-drawn backgrounds that kind of film
grain effect and the dust and dirt that
goes on the screen just like an old
cartoon but there's a lot more to it
than just that there's also sort of an
audio component to it where all the
sound of the game has this very kind of
muffled warm feeling to it it's just
enough to where you can understand what
people are saying
but at the same time it definitely has
that kind of dirty realistic feeling
that those little cartoons had but what
really impressed me was the game's
approach to frame rate now obviously for
an action intensive game like this it
makes a lot of sense for it to be 60fps
which it is but that's not exactly true
to kind of actual film experiences which
are 24 but what they ended up doing was
everything that's very clearly in 60fps
is stuff that is important for gameplay
cuphead himself the projectiles you
shoot projectiles you have to dodge but
everything else the backgrounds
characters everything else moving around
on the screen while it is technically in
60 it's all designed to look like it's
actually running at 24 which gives us
this really much more true film effect
now this does create a little bit of a
dissonance between you know your
character moving around and everything
else around him but you're so focused on
the action most of the time and it just
looks so good despite that fact that
it's not really an issue now I don't
want to go in depth on the game's story
I'll let you guys actually find that out
for yourselves if you play it but just
to kind of give you a basic general idea
it's fairly minimal but just like with
the visuals and audio this is very
intentional it's very true to the kind
of style of these old cartoons more than
anything it's just this odd mixture of
kind of fun silly stuff but then also
kind of surreal and weird and oddly dark
and adult it just it just all works so
well now as for the actual gameplay
cuphead is a running gun shooter very
much along the lines of think of Mega
Man but instead of focusing on
traditional levels that are then fold
with a boss fight it's instead focused
on just being a boss rush mode the whole
way through your fighting boss after
boss after boss with just a couple more
traditional platforming levels thrown in
the middle which mainly act as ways to
give you a little practice and ways to
save with gold to buy new abilities that
might make certain bosses a little
easier which you will need because this
game is freaking hard just like the
old-school retro games that it's
emulating gameplay wise it also uses a
lot of old-school game decisions for its
difficulty there are no checkpoints in a
boss fight if you die near the end you
won't be sent back all the way to the
beginning there is no way to recover
health what you have at the start is
what you have the whole way through and
you just have to do your best to learn
all the enemies different gimmicks to
avoid taking damage and take them down
little by little over time and it is
such a great feeling when you actually
beat a boss in this game there's just
something so great about the idea of
spending a whole hour tackling one level
over and over and over
again and when you actually do it right
it actually only takes about two minutes
I mean really pure constant wise this
game is maybe only about an hour and 20
minutes if you do everything perfectly
but in reality you're probably gonna
spend at least eight if not ten or
twelve hours depending on your skill
level
now cuphead does also offer a co-op mode
which you might think oh yeah I'll just
use that if I want to try and get
through it easier not really the case
unlike other co-op games or normally
bosses are just compensated to have a
little extra health because you have
double the firepower
cuphead I think also puts into account
the fact that you not only have double
the firepower but you can also keep each
other alive by reviving your teammates
so enemies end up having tons of health
when you're a co-op which keeps that
same satisfying level of difficulty even
if you're going with a friend and
hopefully you're playing with someone
that's actually really good otherwise
you've probably stopped talking to them
so so far this is pretty much been
non-stop praise for me there's gotta be
some downsides to this game right
honestly not really as far as I'm
concerned I mean my only real complaint
after finishing the game is that the
difficulty curve does feel like it's a
little all over the place there are some
boss fights during to that I had a lot
more problems with and I did in world 3
and vice versa
but honestly considering how relatively
short the game is and how difficult it
is the whole way through
it hasn't really that big of a deal
really Cup had to be is another example
of something we've been seeing a lot of
this year we have these games that are
technically indie in their scope they're
indie studios but they have the
financial backing of major companies
other games like pyre and hell-blade
where it's this very focused experience
and the game knows exactly what kind of
game it wants to be it's not a triple-a
title where they're taking this kitchen
sink approach trying to make sure it has
everything that's buzzword you know make
sure it's open-world make sure there's
RPG elements add this and this and that
instead they just know what kind of game
they want to cup it to be and made
exactly that and for 20 bucks it is
freaking great</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
