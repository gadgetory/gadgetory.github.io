the Future day it's the date that Marty
McFly travels to the future in Back to
the Future Part two so to help celebrate
it I wanted to give you guys a list of
my top 5 favorite games that are about
time travel they had to be clear I did
leave a few games out of this list
because I didn't want to have games
where time travel is a big surprise
spoiler bit so in a game where you know
the antagonist is actually you from the
future
isn't on this list we're just gonna
focus on games where time travel is
right up front and present starting with
the Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time now
chances are if you ask any Zelda fan
which game is their favorite they'll
probably list this one if not have it in
their top three along with link to the
past it was the first game in the series
to make the move to 3d and it blew a lot
of people away at the time with its use
of time travel switching between a young
link during a very idyllic and happy
Hyrule and adult link after a whole
bunch of shit hit the fan some of the
game's quests and dungeons required you
to do stuff as a young link so the
repercussions of those actions could
help you complete stuff as an adult it's
also worth noting the game's direct
sequel Majora's Mask also feature time
travel but only has you reset time by
three days rather than traveling between
two different eras both games are
excellent and definitely worth checking
out if you've somehow missed out on them
second up we've got an older game that
admittedly the time travel is really
just a backdrop and story bit and not
something that's actually a mechanic but
it's still a great game and that's
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles turtles in
time now if you had a chance to play
this game growing up either in the
arcades or on the SNES and two-player
it's pretty hard to deny that this is
the best Ninja Turtles game ever made
and quite possibly one of the best
side-scrolling beat'em ups ever
especially for its time taking you
through all kinds of different time
periods like fighting enemies in the
Wild West while riding a train or riding
hoverboards in the far future this game
was just a ton of mindless beat-em-up
fun now this game did get a full blown
remake a few years ago but honestly it
had a lot of trouble living up to the
original
so you've ever find one of the
old-school arcade cabinets or you have
an SNES and you can tract one of these
down it is something you absolutely must
experience playing with friends
third up we're gonna go a little more
recent but still older than a decade
with time splitters - now this came out
in a time when online multiplayer was
just
to get big on consoles so it's still
focused on split-screen multiplayer and
it was the best game to do it since
goldeneye on the 64 allowing you to
experience multiplayer levels in a
storyline taking place over all kinds of
different time periods and different
genres building weapons varying from
double-barreled shotguns from the Old
West to futuristic plasma rifles now
admittedly this is one of the games that
hasn't aged quite as well as the others
because so much has changed in the FPS
genre since then but it's still stupid
fun to play with a group of friends in
split-screen just running around firing
blindly forth up is prince of persia the
sands of time now the entire trilogy is
great but more specifically the first
game is by far the best and while you
don't do a ton of time travel within
each game the entire overall plot
focuses on the idea of constantly going
back in time trying to fix different
mistakes and really only thinking things
worse for yourself
in the long run and within each game you
do have a limited degree of time control
by being able to rewind things you do
either to save yourself from a stupid
mistake like jumping down a pit or
saving yourself from a bunch of damage
that enemies inflicted on you this game
was a huge success when it came out and
was by far one of the best action games
of its time and while later games in the
series didn't fully live up to this
trilogy its influence can be felt across
most 3d platformers and action games
that have come out today now last but
far from least is a game that is close
to my heart because it is one of my top
3 games of all time and that's Chrono
Trigger on the SNES this was one of the
first games to successfully use time
travel as a mechanic having you do
things like travel past to make one
decision that will have effects on the
future that you're trying to save and
along the way you recruit a whole party
of people from different eras including
a cave woman a robot from the future and
a night curse to live in a frog's body
it's one of the best games to have time
travel as a mechanic it's one of the
best RPGs ever made and is an absolute
must play in my opinion for anyone that
likes retro games no those were the five
that I think were some of the best games
to have time travel but there is one
honorable mention I think we need to
make especially for why I'm doing this
list and that's the Back to the Future
game from telltale now this isn't one of
Telltale's best works but it was the
first one to be really popular and began
to really fine-tune the formula that
we've seen across so many of they're now
really
successful games like The Walking Dead
tales from the borderlands or the wolf
among us not only that but it was a
great unofficial continuation of the
Back to the Future storyline basically
acting as a fourth movie as well as
featuring voice talents from the
original cast if you're a fan of the
franchise and you've never picked this
up it's definitely a title you'd need to
check out so those are some of my
favorite games to have time travel like
I said there were a couple more that
were really great but I didn't want to
include them here because how they use
time travel is just a bit too spoilery
