a new set of special controllers
called the Tech Series.
A line that's meant to
include a higher-quality
Xbox One controllers,
kind of somewhat tied into
the impending launch of the Xbox Scorpio.
And just recently, we finally got
the first in the series, the Recon Tech.
Now, this is currently
exclusive to Microsoft stores
and GameStop, it runs
at an MSRP of 70 bucks,
so it's just 10 bucks more than
a regular Xbox One controller, although,
honestly, you can find them
for as low as 45 or 50,
if you know where to look.
So, what does this do differently,
compared to a regular Xbox One controller?
Well, if you've seen any
advertisements for it,
or gone to the product page on Microsoft,
you'll see some features noted,
like twice the range of
previous Xbox One controllers,
and the ability to remap the
buttons, which is all true,
but it's also true of every
Xbox One controller released
since August of last year,
when the Xbox One S came out.
These are all standardized features now.
What is different about this one, though,
is it's more premium design.
Microsoft has released a whole bunch
of other colorful controllers,
and there is, of course,
the Design Lab where
you can make your own color palettes.
But, for the most part, those all share
the same physical body.
Whereas the Recon Tech has a lot more
finer detailing to it.
Honestly, when I first saw
pictures of this thing,
and even looking at
the picture on the box,
I wasn't really all that hyped up for it.
But seeing it in person,
this is actually a really
good-looking controller.
There's a lot of details
here that you really get
in seeing just a picture of it.
For instance, this gold
etching on the front
is actually laser-etched in,
you can feel the detail right here.
And on the back, while all
new Xbox One controllers
have an improved grip,
this is the first use
in new design that involves
a rubber diamond set-up.
Where, it's not a very
thick layer of rubber,
it's not going to be pliable or push-in
when you push against it,
like some pro controllers may have.
But it does get the job
done of being non-slip,
and is more comfortable
than the usual dotted design
that other Xbox One S controllers have.
Now, as the name Recon Tech implies,
this is supposed to be a
military-themed controller,
which I kind of, kind of don't see.
I mean, I get it with
the main color option
of going with this dark
grey, that makes sense to me,
but otherwise, I don't
really see it, to be honest.
I mean, I'm not a huge military guy,
but my first thought
for it isn't necessarily
gold trim, and as for these
symbols in the middle,
I'm pretty sure these don't
mean anything, at all.
I mean, if you read the Microsoft
press releases about it,
they talk about how this controller is
inspired by military
tactics and technology,
which, maybe this is their attempt
at having abstract
symbols that capture that,
but I, I don't see it at all.
Honestly, if I look at this
thing with zero context,
not knowing what it's supposed to be,
I have a way different
concept that comes to mind,
and that's actually the
Dishonored franchise.
I mean, really, think about it,
when you look at the main
characters of Dishonored,
the main color themes
that we're always seeing
is a dark grey or very dark blue,
that's contrasted with
highlights of metallic colors,
usually copper or gold.
Which is exactly what we have going on
with this controller right here.
And also, the Dishonor
franchise has a huge love
of esoteric and weird symbols
that are supposed to be
all occult and stuff, which
pretty much these symbols
in the middle are.
For being a special edition
that really isn't tied
or themed to anything too specific,
it's easily one of the best ones that
Microsoft has released,
and easily now my favorite
one aesthetically.
Seriously, though, what
the hell are those symbols?</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
