their subscription-based model for
playing and basically renting video
games called Xbox gamepad something that
a lot of people are calling a Netflix
version for video games which there have
been other services kind of like this
like ea origin but definitely their
biggest competition right now is Sony
with PlayStation now so let's compare
the differences between
first off let's take a look at one of
the most obvious and simplest points of
comparison pricing now the Xbox game
Pass is going to cost you $9.99 a month
which i think is just the right price
point for something like this because
with any kind of subscription
month-to-month model I think a lot of
people start to get a little more
questionable with it when you're hitting
that fifteen to twenty dollar price
point which is exactly the problem that
PlayStation now having they're asking
for a full twenty bucks a month though
you can spend a little less if you buy
months in bulk for instance it's forty
five dollars for three months or for a
full year you can spend 100 which does
bring the action total cost down to
being about the same as Xbox game pass
but you're paying it all upfront for
months that you might actually not even
use so Xbox game path definitely has the
advantage there of course how much you
spend is important but what's even more
important is the actual value you're
getting for your dollar and that's where
things get a little more interesting see
with PlayStation now currently the
catalog reaches over 400 ps3 games and
Sony has also said that sometime this
year they'll start adding ps4 games as
well and for the most part this is the
catalogue that's been very slowly
growing over time and they haven't
really been removing games at all there
have been some but that's more the
exception than the rule so it's a pretty
large library Xbox game paths on the
other hand currently offers 112 games
and they've specifically said this is
going to be a rotating model kind of
like with Netflix with movies so every
month they're going to see some games
leave some games get added it's not
going to be necessarily as large of a
library so during any given month
PlayStation is going to give you the
larger library of games to choose from
but in the long run as you're playing
over summer months Xbox game paths might
just pass that up over time now what's
also really interesting about this is
that while you can play these games
while you're a member of the service
Xbox game path also offers the
additional benefit of being able to buy
games at a 20% discount as well as a 10%
discount on any DLC for these games so
there's something that you really like
let's say you really got into Halo 5 you
never bought it before you're playing it
a bunch and now it's leaving the catalog
you can buy it at a discount now
currently this discount only applies to
Xbox one games and on Xbox 360 but for
the most part a lot of those older
titles are going to be cheaper anyways
so this count wouldn't be a significant
now there is one other interesting
difference between these two services
and obviously I think this is the most
important difference and that's how you
play these games
see with Playstation now everything is
handled via streaming you're not
actually installing anything on your
hard drive not even keeping any saved
progress on your hard drive it's all
handled on a remote Sony server and the
big problem with this is if you have
terrible internet that's going to
heavily and negatively impact your
ability to play these games thus making
PlayStation now more or less completely
useless to you on the other hand with
Xbox game path everything it's handled
much more like a traditional digitally
purchased game where everything is going
to be still be stored on your hard drive
your game info is being installed there
your save data is there it's a much more
seamless normal experience that is way
better than streaming game it's just
going to require that you still be
connected to the Internet so can make
sure you're still a game past member and
make sure the game is still part of the
catalog which like I said earlier if the
game is leaving the catalog anytime soon
it's going to warn you you can purchase
it at a discount if you want now all of
this in concept sounds really really
great I mean if you're just looking at
how Xbox game passes as a service
compared to PlayStation now it
completely blows PlayStation out of the
water but things get a little different
when you actually compare them based on
what games are on them right now if you
like I said earlier PlayStation now has
over 400 games about what's more
important is a lot of those are big hit
games from the ps3 stuff like the
infamous series or Red Dead Redemption
so on so forth while Xbox game pass
right now is mostly 360 stuff and
specifically stuff from the 360 arcade
which is really cool if you want to
reappear Ian some very simple games like
Double Dragon the DND beat em up games
Soulcalibur and Soul Calibur too great
but if you're looking for big hit titles
right now it's basically halo 5 and all
three Bioshock games and that's it
putting this all into consideration
honestly right now if we're just looking
at this month alone even though it's
twice the price and has all of the
problems PlayStation now kind of feels
like the better value to me I mean yeah
you're paying twenty bucks but you're
getting a whole lot more games you could
marathon back-to-back whereas with Xbox
one game paths you could just buy Halo 5
and call it a day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
