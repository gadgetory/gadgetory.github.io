is a video that would normally go up on
TLD but things are just a little hectic
over there at the moment you should go
check it out but in the meantime I
thought I might as well upload my top 5
iOS games of the month here on my own
channel now there's no fancy intros or
graphics on this channel just yet so
let's just say gwai right into the top 5
games first up on the list is a pretty
high-profile title especially as far as
app games go and one dime pretty much
required to have on this month's list
because it's that good the wolf among us
from Telltale Games I'm not a fan of
putting individual episode things on
this list especially when they're
consistently good it just stifles my
options but wolf among us has officially
released its final chapter this month
bringing the five-part series to an end
and delivered a satisfying great finish
to the story for those of you that are
unfamiliar with it as well as other
telltale games like walking dead the
entire thing plays out pretty much like
a show that you yourself direct choices
impact how some of the events take place
later on and the narrative adjusts to
fit how you choose to handle different
situations actual gameplay pretty much
boils down to just choices and QuickTime
events but combined with its
storytelling and sense of immersion
you'll have zero regrets picking this
one up either for 1499 as a package or
1999 if you choose to buy all the
chapters separately it's worth noting
the first chapter is free so you have no
reason to at least give this game a shot
next up is a game that's part of a
yearly released series and is also one
of the titles on this list that's
actually a multi-platform finding itself
available also on PC and consoles magic
2015 duels of the planeswalkers now
actually the full review in the works
for this one that'll be going up
tomorrow so we're going to skip some of
the details here but the summed up
version for now is this honestly it's
not my favorite entry in the series it
feels like a step back in some ways but
still at its core it's an addictive
great title for those of you that enjoy
card games for just ten dollars you get
access to a whole bunch of cards to
actually customize your own deck this
time around and can compete with your
friends in two to four player matches if
you're the competitive type you'll
easily get your money's worth out of
this game though some of its in-app
purchases are a little frustrating
overall it's still a fun great title to
pick up and when you compare how much it
cost to get into the actual card game
way more affordable okay so the list so
far has been a little on the pricey side
for app games I know so let's talk about
some other
cheaper games that were absolutely great
this past month starting with the very
aptly titled traps and jen's a small
genre that slowly been gaining steam
lately is the classic dungeon Explorer a
concept that owes much of its origin to
Indiana Jones and other pulpy tomb
raiding films traps and gems has your
intrepid explorer navigate his way
through a tomb finding hidden rooms
dodging traps and collecting ancient
relics in all asti it's not very hard to
complete the base version of this game
especially since the punishment for game
over is extremely forgiving but it's
solid fun throughout and actually trying
two hundred percent the game finding all
of its secrets and collectables is
another matter entirely an easy but
really enjoyable explored of title traps
and gems will help you kill time for the
price of 499 now forth upon the list I'm
surprising myself once again I said a
couple of months back that I couldn't
believe I picked a movie based app game
to put on this list and I'm doing it
again with guardians the galaxy the
Universal weapon not gonna lie a healthy
bit of this game is that it's a marvel
facelift of an older really fun iOS
title that I've mentioned before on this
list battle heart slap on a code of
marvel paint with popular heroes
reverencing an upcoming movie and this
is basically what you get which isn't
entirely a bad thing the mechanics are
simply get addictive and there are
actually some party building logic and
customization going on thanks to combo
moves the UI is a tad clunkier than I'd
like for items but that aside the rest
of the game is a simple grindy really
fun way to kill time worth its price tag
of 499 now last but not least is by far
the simplest title on this list and the
one that can most appropriately be
called a nap title marble drop this is
another one of those games where the
premise starts off very simple yet as
you get farther and farther stuff gets
really complicated really quick all you
have to do is drop colored marbles down
a little chute and do it in the right
order so that they all land in the
corresponding correct basket yet with
each level new rules and complications
are added mixers that combine colors
platforms that move after each marble
touches a switch or baskets that require
multiple marbles in the right order and
it all gets very complicated in the best
possible way I am bothered a little bit
that the game does offer it in that
purchase that helps to severely reduce
the difficulty of some puzzles with a
rainbow marble which then also can screw
up high scores when comparing it to
friends but outside of that if you just
want tackle the game's challenges head
on without
hang any money it's phenomenal and best
of all completely free well those are my
top 5 iOS games of July 2014 there were
a lot of other great app games that just
didn't make the list this time I know
and if you really loved one of those
titles and you want to let me know that
it's a travesty that didn't make it into
the top five then go ahead and let me
know in the comments down below as
