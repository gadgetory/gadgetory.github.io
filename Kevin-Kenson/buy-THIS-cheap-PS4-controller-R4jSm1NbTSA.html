- Today we're taking
a look at a controller
that you can't normally get in the US,
and that's the HORI wireless
mini game pad controller
for the PS4.
There is a wired version of this
that's been available in
the US for some time now.
But the wireless option is
actually a Japanese exclusive
that we had to import.
And we were actually able to get it
for only $36 off Play Asia.
It can be a little more money
depending on where you look.
But that puts it at about half the price
of the MSRP of a brand
new Dual Shock Four.
What's really intriguing about this
is that we've talked
about a lot of different
third party wireless options
for things like the Switch,
or the Xbox, but when
it comes to PlayStation,
they don't really license out
their controllers very much.
At least this generation.
There's a lot of stuff for the PS3,
but on the PS4, there's
mostly nice, expensive,
pro controller options.
And that's about it.
The wired version of this
is one of the few options
officially licensed in the US.
So finding something that's
still an affordable price
and wireless and officially licensed
is actually kind of rare.
So we're gonna compare
what's different about this
compared to the wired version,
aside from obviously the
fact that it's wireless,
and then we're gonna really put it through
some heavy tests to really see
if this is something worth picking up
as a cheaper alternative.
First, let's take a look at what's changed
in the wireless model, from the wired.
There's actually been a lot of different
little minute changes that overall make
for some cool little minor improvements.
First off, the biggest
of which is the sticks.
The original wired
version of this controller
had these sticks that were
made of a very hard plastic
and had these little
nubs on the side that,
it did do a good job of keeping
your thumbs on the sticks,
but they just weren't very comfortable.
The wireless version on the other hand
makes use of stick
heads that are just like
on the actual Dual Shock Four controller,
which feels just like home.
Another more noticeable change
to the body design right away
is they actually rearranged
some of the buttons
in the center area.
Instead of having the
touch pad button up top
with these buttons below,
and then a turbo button
on the very bottom,
they've all been removed a little bit
to now be a cross shape on the top,
which I find to be a little
more natural to reach for
especially for the turbo button.
Because you're normally used
to going for middle buttons
by reaching up not down
below between the sticks.
Aside from those two major changes,
everything else is pretty
minor but still works out
in the wireless controllers favor.
I think the D pad is
just a little crisper,
feels a little nicer to use versus the one
on the wired controller.
There's also a change to the grip design.
It's the same shape.
But there's now this kind of
cross hatch texturing to it
that is not present on the wired one,
which helps to make it
just a little grippier.
I also really appreciate the change
in just visual design.
While they both look very similar,
the US wired ones all use
just flat, solid colors.
Whereas the wireless one
features this transparent look,
which is think is a great call back
to older style controllers,
especially from the PS2 era.
And I just think it makes for a much
better looking controller.
Let's actually put this
one through the ringer
a little bit and really see how it stands
as a controller on its
own both kids and adults.
So we're gonna test a couple
different recent games.
I'm gonna start with Kingdom Hearts III
because I think that's a
good balance of something
that's a fun, action game.
You need to hit a lot of
buttons quickly and stuff.
And if you're playing
on higher difficulties
it's important to have good control.
But at the same time, it's not anything
that's super precision heavy.
So we're gonna see how
comfortable this is for that.
This controller actually
does have a light as well
under the touch pad, which
the wired version does not.
And just like the Dual Shock Four,
it does have all the different colors
for different things depending
on the game you're playing.
So right now it's glowing blue.
That's a nice touch.
Okay, so just starting out,
I'm not actually having to
hit too many buttons yet.
But like I've kind of noted before
with the wired version,
the grip design on this
is very much like an
old school controller,
which for me there's that
nostalgia feel to it,
but I could definitely see someone
used to a modern controller
thinking it's a little more uncomfortable.
It's also definitely something designed
a little better for smaller hands.
Anyone that has big hands that already
finds like a Dual Shock
Four to not be comfortable
is not gonna like this.
So the sticks on this
are definitely an upgrade
over the ones on the original wired one.
They are still a little close together
which feels different
from a Dual Shock Four.
But the different stick heads
are much more comfortable.
The front facing buttons
on this one feels good too.
You rely on these buttons a lot more
on something like Kingdom
Hearts and other action games
like Dove May Cry coming out soon.
And they're snappy.
They're not like the
highest quality out there.
But once again, $30 controller.
You know, I have to say, so far at least
for something like Kingdom Hearts,
this works really well.
I think I would still personally prefer
to use a Dual Shock Four.
But if I'm just looking for
a cheaper option to use,
if I need to replace one,
or again like with the wired ones,
these are something for kids,
this is getting the job done really well.
So let's try it on something a little,
little harder.
Next we're gonna test this
out on Resident Evil 2,
which is definitely a
different kind of experience
from Kingdom Hearts.
The really big test on this one
is gonna be the shoulder buttons,
which is honestly one of
the parts of this controller
that worries me a little bit more
because it's not like you have
a proper trigger or anything.
It's just these small
older school shoulders.
Which might not work as well.
Also, while we still use the
sticks in Kingdom Hearts,
that's a lot more faster pace
than just running around,
whereas in this game it's a bit more
about precision and aiming.
So we'll see how this works out.
Okay, sticks feel fine.
It actually is a lot
like the same experience
as using a Dual Shock Four.
My thumbs are maybe
reaching in a little more
because they're placed closer to
the center of the controller.
As far as how the game
is reading and everything
it's basically the same
experience so that's good.
Yeah, I mean the buttons work.
It doesn't feel quite as satisfying.
You're not really getting
that trigger pull feeling
that you get used to.
And obviously these aren't analog
so there's not any kind of
degrees of pressing down.
It's just push or don't push.
I don't think I would
recommend necessarily
buying this controller for FPS games,
especially if you're doing
anything competitive.
Now one more test I wanna
do is trying this out
on retro games because
when I see a controller
shaped like this where it's very much
sort of old school SNES style,
I think, maybe it'd be awesome for retro.
So, I'm gonna test it
out on one of my favorite
recent indie titles, Blood
Stained Curve of the Moon.
If you have not played it yet,
it is some amazing old
school Castlevania fun.
One of the things that
felt a little different
about this controller
versus the old wired one
is that the D pad felt like a bit
of an improvement, a little snappier.
And now that I'm actually playing a game
where I'm focused on using it,
that's definitely the case.
It feels a lot more like I'm using
an old school SNES pad.
It definitely feels naturally
when playing a game like this.
It's not uncomfortable at all.
And again, all of the front facing buttons
on this one feel pretty nicely crisp.
I've definitely used better ones
on like pro controllers,
but for an affordable option that's,
you know, just meant to
be kind of comparable
to a Dual Shock Four,
it feels really good.
Honestly the only buttons
I've been hitting so far
that bother me are all of the
kind of extra options buttons.
Options, share, the home button.
They're not particularly great.
They kind of have this
awkward softness to them.
They feel cheap.
But considering none
of these are important
for actual game play,
it's pretty forgivable.
I gotta say, this controller surprises me.
I went in really thinking that,
yep, it's a cheaper
alternative controller.
It's probably not gonna be that great.
It'll be okay for the money.
It's actually really good.
I like the sticks on it a lot.
I like the front facing buttons.
The D pad is solid.
The only real two things about it
that are marks against it versus say,
a Dual Shock Four, is the lack
of a more modern grip design.
It's just not super comfortable.
If you like that retro vibe,
where it's something like
an older school controller,
it works for that.
But if you just want comfort, not so much.
And the lack of triggers
is kind of a bummer.
It still worked for things like FPS
but it's definitely not optimal.
So depending on the kinds
of games you wanna play,
this thing can work pretty well.
There is one other thing though about it
that does bother me a little bit,
and this is just more
of a pet peeve thing,
it didn't come with a cable.
Overall, this is a great little pick up.
If you just want an
alternative wireless controller
to have for your PS4 either as a backup
in case something goes
wrong with your Dual Shock
or you need a replacement
and you don't wanna spend
that much money,
you want something for a kid to use
but you don't want a cable
leading into the system,
this is an awesome import.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
