design we approached by not only
worrying about what systems to put up
what TV to use and what knickknacks to
decorate with but starting with
something entirely unique to set it
apart a custom entertainment console and
since I don't know anything about
woodworking I went to get help from
Chris from four-eyes furniture okay so
this is the idea I had I really wanted
to kind of drive home this idea of like
you know big X for Xbox you know
thematic thing is this something we
could do or is this a bad idea and I
don't understand how a carpentry works
it's something that we could do but I
think that a lot of what you're going
for is probably gonna get lost because
of the supports that are gonna be needed
to make it actually function just not
this because if we did do this it would
fall apart the moment put anything on it
it might or to make it where it wouldn't
it might kind of lose the X Factor that
you're going for
ah thank you no pun intended turns out
this was only a minor setback though as
Chris came up with his own new idea and
spin on incorporating the X now he's
actually put up a video on his own
channel showing the making of this so
make sure you check that out and all
that hard work led to this
so when Chris first showed me this
design I was immediately in awe for a
few different reasons first I really
loved how it maintained this idea of
having this very clear X symbol
incorporated into the design by making
it recessed in a little bit and using a
darker wood almost making it look like
the shelves are kind of floating in
space around this X design that you can
clearly see in the middle another
thought I had to right away when seeing
it was how it actually kind of reminded
me of the original Xbox which featured
this X design on top and a number of
lines coming out of the side obviously
there's fewer more prominent lines and
the X isn't quite as big but it gave me
this feeling and thought right away of
Xboxes roots so let's take a look at
what we decked this thing out with
obviously it wouldn't be an Xbox setup
without of course X boxes so going with
this sort of tiered arrangement we have
the original Xbox on bottom above that
we have a 360 opting to go with the slim
design over the fatter original and the
annoyingly bucks like 360 II and on top
taking center stage is of course the
white Xbox 1s easily the best-looking
gaming console Microsoft has ever
released now of course the one is going
to be getting the most use out of the
system's here so set up alongside it on
the top we have a single charging dock
for a controller a great way to keep the
controller charged make it easy to find
and grab and put it on display all at
the same time on the lower shelves we
also added some hugo lights to help
accentuate the X making it really pop
out at nighttime now last time we did
the ultimate PlayStation setup one of
the things we did to try and spice it up
was incorporate a little figure of
Nathan Drake from uncharted and I want
to do the same thing this time but taken
next level and when you think about
Microsoft and Xbox the one series you
have to keep in mind is Halo so we
grabbed this full-size replica of a
needler from the series which is way
larger than I expected to be but the
light-up effects and everything just
perfectly complement this set up I still
wanted to keep a few smaller figure
knickknacks around so I had to bring in
good old Marcus Fenix of Gears of War
Fame and threw in my favorite pop figure
Titan for good measure titanfall - may
have gone multi-platform but the
original is still
the best console exclusives to grace the
Xbox ones now now of course most of the
things on these shelves are for show or
obviously the system's we need to play
the games but there's a functional side
that we can't entirely ignore and that's
what we brought in these shelves down
here now with this you're going to be
able to fold a lot of different items
that you might need to grab every now
and then whether that's controllers for
the older systems or some your favorite
games you want to have on hand to pull
out whenever you want to play then of
course there's the TV the thing that
ties all of this together to make gaming
as immersive as possible I wanted to
make sure we grab something that support
both 4k and HDR to get the most out of
the Xbox one and this Samsung 4k ultra
HD smart TV felt like the perfect choice
at 65 inches it is the perfect size for
this cabinet with a virtually no bezel
keeping gameplay as the center focus and
what's even better is this is one of the
lowest latency modern TVs on the market
which is an absolute must for
competitive gaming I feel like with this
design we accomplished all the goals we
set for it
something that makes a statement right
away with its unique design showcasing a
clear love of Xbox franchises but at the
same time doesn't get bogged down with
too much stuff cramped everywhere
keeping it looking clean and emphasizing
the sort of aesthetic and direction the
system is going with the Xbox 1s also if
you're wondering what this little box is
it's the emergency Doritos candy and war
Mountain Dew stash</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
