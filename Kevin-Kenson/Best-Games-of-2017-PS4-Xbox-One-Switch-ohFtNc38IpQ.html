of games coming out so to celebrate I
want to go over the 10 I'm most excited
for now if your fave didn't make this
list or you're also super excited for
one of these make sure to let me know
what you're looking forward to down in
the comments so going in order of
release date or at least suppose it
release date first off is Resident Evil
7 I am so excited for this one growing
up I loved the older Resident Evil games
on PlayStation and Dreamcast and ever
since the series hard pivoted to action
games
I just haven't cared I was a little
worried at first with the demo over 7
because it felt very blue first person
view and spooky things are happening so
scary but after a few updates revealing
the full demo I really like what I see
here there's a very old school Resident
Evil vibe with collecting items and
solving puzzles and what action there is
is much more do what you have to do to
survive and not just shooting zombies in
the head left and right like an action
movie hero next is for honor slated to
come out February 14th Valentine's Day
of all days this game caught my eye
immediately when it was first announced
at Ubisoft's III press conference back
in 2015 the very idea of a game
dedicated to knights versus Vikings
versus samurai just got me so excited
and that excitement was confirmed when I
got a chance to play in the game's alpha
test last year while it is a bit
repetitive the foundational gameplay is
just a ton of fun and I really love how
each class feels very different to play
and takes different strategies for
baiting and overwhelming opponents more
than anything it's just a refreshing new
take on competitive multiplayer
especially for third person action third
on the list is horizon zero dawn which
is pretty safe to say one of the most
anticipated games this year especially
on ps4 I will say Sony has been a little
over the top with how many trailers and
ways they've been trying to push this
game enough that I am a little worried
about the hype train running away but
what we've seen does look awesome and
it's hard to go wrong with giant robot
dinosaurs
I did get a chance to play this one a
little bit at last e3 but the demo was
very bare-bones enough to confirm that
the core controls do feel comfortable
but not much more so here's hoping the
final game lives up to the hype next up
is Mass Effect Andromeda now I love the
first two Mass Effect games and while I
enjoyed some parts of the third one its
ending did leave me feeling pretty salty
so the prospect of a new game in the
same setting that divorces itself from
the original plot is something I'm
totally down for and from the looks of
it the game will be having a much bigger
an emphasis on exploration with a bit of
a Star Trek vibe maybe not that part of
Star Trek Bioware has been really
tight-lipped with the overall plot and
direction of this one which I'm all for
to keep the full game a surprise I'm
just hoping it's a good one this time
now for a total change of pace from all
of these is quite possibly one of the
greatest titled games ever South Park
the fractured butthole
I love South Park the stick of truth and
not just because it was a fun game that
brought loads of references and jokes
that felt right out of the TV show but
because of its own it was also just a
good simple RPG done in the style of
Paper Mario so taking that idea and
redoing it for Super Heroes and a
tactics RPG system genre I'm always a
sucker for is a pretty easy sell to me
though I am a little sad it won't be
coming from the same dev team sixth up
and honestly the game I'm most excited
for on this list is the Legend of Zelda
breath of the wild the Zelda franchise
has always been one of my favorites
something I loved about the old ones is
that they were actually very nonlinear
in open-world for their time as they'll
de entered the 3d age it got more and
more linear with every game and this is
something it looks like breath of the
wild we'll be taking a break away from
opening the world up in a whole new way
I did get a play a snippet of this game
back at last e3 and it felt like a
phenomenal mixture of classic Zelda and
a new direction that I cannot wait to
get my hands on
next is a game I've been waiting for
quite some time now thanks to pushbacks
persona 5
I love the Shin Megami Tensei franchise
with persona 3 being one of my favorites
to come out of it and what I've seen in
plate of 5 does not have me the least
bit worried about upholding the same
level of quality the gameplay is fast
familiar and fun
but with some remixes thrown in like
bringing back mechanics from older SMT
games that were dropped in three and
four plus the game's UI design is
astounding it's been a long wait but
this looks like one well worth it
to make sure the game is as polished up
as can be now this next game is most
recently announced on this list from
just a month ago Marvel vs. Capcom
infinite despite having always played
the series horribly wrong and being
terrible at it I can't help but have fun
and love the MVC franchise for giving me
a chance to play my favorite Capcom
characters against Marvel heroes and it
does look like it's taking a different
direction than the core series going
back to two-man teams rather than three
and is gonna play up the Marvel
Cinematic Universe a lot more all I know
for sure is that Megaman X is in it so
my hype levels are already dangerously
high so here's hoping the game has a
better launch than Street Fighter 5 now
taking a break away from triple-a studio
stuff is another game that's been pushed
back so so many times
cuphead this end below are two games
that I've been wanting to come out on
the Xbox one ever since they were
announced and we just keep getting
teased again and again with an official
release always seeming like it's just
around the corner only to have it taken
away
I love side-scrolling running guns and
the art direction is just perfect in how
it recreates that old-timey cartoon vibe
it just needs to come out please now I
know I said celebre the wild was my most
anticipated game on this list but this
next one comes really really close Red
Dead Redemption - there are so few good
games that capture the western genre and
the original Red Dead Redemption was the
best and at that time Rockstar took
another look at it while we still have
very few official details about the game
there have been plenty of rumors one I'm
personally hoping is true is the game
will be taking one of the best parts of
GTA 5 giving us multiple playable
characters that we can switch between
giving more perspectives to the main
story it's still a ways away and will
hopefully be out by the end of the year
but then again knowing the rockstars
