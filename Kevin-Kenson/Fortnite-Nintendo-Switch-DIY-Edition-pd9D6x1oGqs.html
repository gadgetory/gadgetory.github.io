on this channel based on a variety of
big-name paddles and sometimes you've
gotten a little over the top a little
excessive with how we show some of them
off but one game that I know you guys
love and we want to see more stuff of is
fortnight we've done a couple different
fortnight themed things in the past but
something we haven't really touched I
think is a really big missing piece is
customizing our very own fortnight
themed switch so what we're gonna do is
we're gonna customize our switch the joy
cons and the dock we're gonna take a
look at a couple different accessories
as well to round up the whole thing so
that we have the setup that's not only
celebrating a little before tonight but
also giving you the best functional
experience playing it as well first
things first we want to customise our
switch in dock for the colour scheme as
we want to celebrate the game and
there's a couple different ways you can
go about this depending on skill level
price that kind of thing some of the
pricier or riskier options include doing
things like paint jobs but you really
want to make sure you find someone you
trust to do that or even shell exchanges
I think a good safe option for most
people though is a skin so we actually
went with skins from deep brand they
make a whole bunch of bones that are
safe to use on the switch and when
thinking about colors I associate with
fortnight the main ones that really pop
in my head are blue purple and sometimes
yellow florin a dozen really have a
singular color that use all the time
because it cannot changes all the
seasons but those the ones that I feel
kind of recur the most so went for a
blue skin on the switch itself this was
actually my first time applying a deeper
and skin to a switch itself and I was a
little intimidated at first I was very
probably a little overly cautious when
applying it but it really isn't that bad
at all I followed the instructions step
by step and it was pretty easy you just
have to apply the kickstand and little
flap right here for the game card first
then you do the back of the switch and
that's the one that can get a little
weird because you have to like carefully
wrap it around screw holes and stuff and
then the front is actually really easy
because you have this like fake cover
that goes over the screen so it's just
one solid piece first and that just
comes off after you get it all sealed
around the edges so it actually turned
out looking really nice so as for the
joy cons like I said other colours are
really heavily associate with the series
as the seasons have gone by are purple
and yellow I didn't really like the look
of doing the yellow and purple together
as one unit but doing either of them
simultaneously looks really nice so I'm
leaning towards double purple right now
though as for the dock I wanted to do
things a little bit differently but
still maintain a common theme so I kept
the same
for the front of it but then we went for
a white trim instead of the purple or
yellow in this case I really like the
way it breaks up on the front I will say
too that during the whole deeper end
scan an application thing the only part
that did not me a little bit was doing
the side on top of the doc because you
have to very carefully apply this thing
and wrap it all the way around without
accidentally getting off-track so I
still did it I think it turned out great
but yeah that's that's the one to be
careful on I think out of all of this
now another reason why I went for the
white on this is because I think it's
gonna work really well but the next step
we're gonna take for customizing these
little further because I think the color
schemes are great to kind of get the
base idea across but as of right now if
you just show this to someone they're
not gonna think four guys are gonna
think blue and purple so we need to
start adding a new symbol something that
replaces the switch logo that just
screams for nine that's where vinyl
stickers come in before this idea we
picked up a lot a lot a lot of different
vinyl stickers that are for night beam
these are not hard to find at all you
give me just go on Amazon and find a
whole bunch of different ones but while
shopping for them and picking a bunch up
we realized that at least for the switch
itself you got to be really careful what
size sticker you get because you can be
a little deceived by how much room you
have to work with because yeah if you
just go by the size of the switch
there's quite a bit here but if you want
something that's gonna be centered and
look really good on it you've got to be
worried the fact that you can't use the
bottom here because the vents and the
kickstand really messes stuff up for
horizontal space because you really only
use this area here if you want it
centered so the two options we have I
think I'm going to work best are the
actual four-night logo at the city which
looks good but I think it's a little too
off-center it's too little too wide for
our space so instead I want to go with
dude hang gliding it I think this really
just screams for tonight right away I
mean it's weight every single patch
starts so we're gonna have this set up
and just angle it a little bit so it's
gonna fit around all these little things
in the way so with that big doubt for
the switch we got to look at what we
wanna do for the dock and there's a
couple of different ways we could
approach this we have a few stickers
that are just tall enough in the right
size that can fit on either side of the
switch logo for this if we can go with
the pinata right here but actually the
idea that ended up being really sold to
me is taking this logo that we almost
put on the switch and putting it right
on the front we're gonna cover up the
switch words and have it just Eclipse
the switch logo a little bit notice has
this like Disney Castle vibe I really
dig and think it's gonna look really
cool so let's go ahead and get these
attached
right now to our dockets which
so we've got our switch and our switch
dock all set up next let's take a look
at some accessories to really rent out
this whole setup to really make it a
fortnight's which when it comes to
improving your game the main two things
to look at is how you're controlling it
and how you're listening to it now for
control the droid cons look nice and all
I think the purple is a great aesthetic
but let's face it if you're not playing
in handheld there's better ways to
control the game especially docked so
you want to go with the switch pro
controller and a way to improve this is
with thumb grips now there are some
branded ones for fortnight I mean
they're not officially for night but
they're battle royale ones that look
like they definitely fit from control
freak they don't actually make them for
the switch pro controller but turns out
the ps4 ones fit it perfectly fine now
this does give you a raised surface
which you might not like for both sticks
so another great option they have is the
ones they actually recommend for tonight
specifically these are the CQC combat
ones they don't have quite the same
height on them but this is designed for
switch specifically grips nice and tight
and makes it a lot better for your thumb
on the other hand if you're feeling a
little more morally ambiguous about what
counts as cheating there is also a
keyboard and mouse that how it works on
the switch as well which is definitely
useful for tonight I'll have that link
down below along with all this other
stuff and we actually did the dedicated
video covering it which I've linked at
the end of this one as for audio there
are a lot of awesome gaming headsets out
there but they are all available for the
switch normally because the switch lacks
Bluetooth compatibility but there's a
couple ways to fix this and one of the
latest ones that's really cool and you
can look forward to dedicated video on
this soon is the Genki adapter this
attaches to the bottom of your switch so
in handheld mode you're able to use it
to use your favorite pair of Bluetooth
gaming headphones it also has an adapter
that connects to the dock of the switch
so you can use it for dock mode as well
o else have this cool light-up thing I
found it doesn't really do anything
improve your game I just think it looks
pretty</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
