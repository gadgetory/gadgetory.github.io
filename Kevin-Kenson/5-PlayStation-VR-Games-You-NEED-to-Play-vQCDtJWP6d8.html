affordable and easiest option for
jumping into virtual reality gaming and
thankfully it's launched with a lot of
games to choose from so for those of you
planning on getting one ASAP I've put
together a list of the best games out
right now that require psvr to play that
you have got to try first off is
battlezone based on the old-school
arcade classic battlezone has built upon
the original tank simulation game and
brought it into a more modern era with a
layer of tron paint thrown over to keep
that retro 80s feel you take control of
one of a number of different tank
designs deploying on various missions
across a randomized campaign against AI
enemies offline or other players online
the interface might be a little
intimidating at first but after a match
or two you'll get comfortable with
reading the entire console keeping an
eye on your shields and ammo while
simultaneously skirmishing against your
enemies
the learning curve isn't too high but
this is one of the more difficult PS VR
games and as a warning is also one of
the more draining for those you with
motion sickness so be wary if a slower
more tactical vehicle game is your style
this is the best option on psvr right
now second up is until dawn rush of
blood now this game caught me off guard
I really didn't expect much out of it
but it is so much fun especially
considering it's one of the cheaper
games you can grab for psvr right now
it's relation down until dawn is a bit
tenuous it's mostly an excuse for a
branded rail shooter but for a rail
shooter it's really really good the
ambiance sucks you in there's a lot of
stuff going on making you look around
constantly and there's a bunch of hidden
goodies to discover making the game
worth multiple playthroughs you can't
play it with the DualShock 4 controller
but it is a much much better using a
pair of motion controllers allowing you
to independently aim your guns and make
the game a lot more immersive this is
one of the simpler games on psvr
but it's a great game that accomplishes
exactly what it sets out to do be a
creepy on Rails shooter making it a
no-brainer for fans of classic arcade
horror games in the vein of House of the
Dead now for number three we're going to
take a step away from the more serious
and dark games and go to the entire
other end of the spectrum with jobs
taking place in a far future where
robots do all the work
job simulator is an imagining of what
exactly people might think we used to do
these days with pretty hilariously off
ideas it's not exactly complex or a
particularly deep game and more than
anything is really just a proof of
concept of what you can do in VR but at
the same time capitalizes on how
imperfect VR controls can be right now
that makes the whole thing
tongue-in-cheek
and just a ton of fun if you want to be
our game with less of a normal game goal
and more just a funny way to mess around
in a VR environment this is a must grab
on to number four on the list is the
game that's really been like the poster
child for VR gaming this past year Eve
Valkyrie Valkyrie achieves one of the
most immediate dreams many of us have
had about what we could do with VR
flying through space and it does it
pretty well the entire game boils down
pretty easily into matchmaking
dogfighting in space which is a lot of
fun but what really makes Valkyrie stand
out is how it's an example of how
immersive VR can be right when you lift
off for the first time you just
immediately see and feel the difference
VR makes for this style of game and
while there are plenty of different
cockpit based dogfight games out right
now and in development Valkyrie stands
out as being one of the best last and my
personal favorite on the list is Riggs
all the other games on this list while
fun do feel a little more like pricey
proof of concepts ideas to be built upon
for future games except for Riggs which
really feels like a fully fleshed out
gaming experience combining the idea of
mech combat and professional sports fuse
together
Riggs puts you in control of a
fast-moving mech scoring off against
other players or AI in 3v3 matches that
are either as simple as blow up as many
enemies as you can or something more
like football or soccer where you fight
over control of a ball and race to the
enemy's goal there's four different
kinds of base mechs to use from and a
whole lot of different powered up
designs featuring special abilities and
weapon loadouts and you can unlock more
customization options for your pilot by
completing sponsored challenges like
getting so many kills touchdowns or
assists in a single match you can treat
it like a single-player game just
playing the offline League mode or you
can go online for full competitive
multiplayer either way it's easy to lose
yourself in this game's intense combat
and is one of these strongest
arguments for why to grab a PlayStation
VR now I do have one last honorable
mention which is Batman V are basically
a point-and-click puzzle game in the
form of running around as Batman solving
a mystery sharing its universe with the
Arkham series of games it's fun to play
if only to think you're Batman for even
just a moment though some people might
be disappointed if they're looking for
anything particularly action-heavy
make no mistake this is a mystery and
story driven game first and foremost
whose biggest appeal really is that it
has a coat of Batman paint thrown over
it if you're a fan of Batman this one's
worth grabbing and it's may be worth a
quick look if you just want try VR games
with a more interactive element that and
also lets you do this which is pretty
amazing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
