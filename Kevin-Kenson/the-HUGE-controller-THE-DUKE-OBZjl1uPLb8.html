to talk about I am a huge fan of
anything that involves mixing retro and
new tech together and this is a very
good also a little weird example of that
and then as we now finally have the new
do
this is a Xbox one and PC compatible
controller that is made by hyper kin in
association with Xbox as a recreation of
the original giant Duke controller now
if you don't know what that is when the
original Xbox came out this was the
first controller design it had which was
just this gigantic thing the Xbox is
everything the rock is cutting-edge
powerful exhilarating and like the rock
had very mixed response some people
loved it and others not so much because
they couldn't really well reach all of
the buttons and as a reissue this guy's
got a couple things going on a little
different obviously I mean for a fact it
works for Xbox one and not the original
system they've actually added these
little tiny shoulder nubs up here which
are a little awkward and they actually
do the same thing as the black and white
buttons so that acts as sort of a
stand-in for modern games which have the
dual shoulder setup you can do that now
along with that this one's using a
actual wired connection that you can
unplug it's just a little micro USB
right there and by far the most
intriguing thing about this guy's design
though is the Xbox logo here actually
lights up and does a whole animation
while it's plugged into your Xbox the
one thing missing from this guy is the
fact that while this is still very much
the same design up top here everything
is sealed off whereas on an original do
controller like this guy right here you
actually these two slots right here
which are used as expansion ports you
would use this on the old Xbox to do
things like have a memory card plugged
into the controller or even using a chat
headset now look at these guys you might
be wondering how a controller this large
actually got into full production and
it's kind of a long story
we'll do the short version so back when
the original Xbox was in development one
of Microsoft's big goals was to try and
go head-to-head against what was at the
time the biggest gaming company Sony
with the ps2 on its way
the third place the way they wanted to
accomplish that was by making their own
system which was also gonna do things a
little more differently and potentially
also listening a lot more to gamers
which led to some cool design aspects of
the Xbox like having the breakaway cable
on the controller so you don't rip it
out every time that you're playing a
game and get a little too excited so
when it came to the controller for the
Xbox one though they actually did this
to an outside contractor by the name of
and I'm sorry if I messed this up
Denyce ontari now the problem is she
wasn't given free rein to actually build
the controller from top to bottom
instead she was handed a bunch of
designs that were already done just kind
of gave the general idea of how they
wanted to control her look which was
very clearly inspired by a Dreamcast
controller and they had already decided
what kind of functions they wanted the
controller to have like having the
expansion slot where you can do memory
cards and chat heads ends and all kinds
of stuff that sounded cool at the time
but resulted in a main circuit board for
the system which was huge and already
made so instead of making controller and
trying to make all these parts fit
inside of it she already had the
internal parts and had to make the
actual shell which was gigantic so like
I said bit of a rough situation and so
the end of the day of the area became
well we're stuck with this this is wave
to work with so let's make the best
Bergen ohmic most comfortable trailer we
can with this size which honestly
actually kind of worked out I mean if
you have big hands Jack Kelly lawyer
this is actually a really comfortable
controller and it did have a lot of fans
when the system came out but there are a
lot of detractors as well and eventually
down the line this guy did get replaced
by a slimmed-down controller which we
really owe basically to Japan
fascinating when the Duke was first
being shown off to a lot of different
game devs and companies about the system
that Microsoft's working on a lot of
Western devs were fine with it they
thought it was a little comically large
but something people could still use
however when they showed it to Japanese
devs it was universally hated everyone
was like this is ridiculous this is way
too big no one could possibly use this
and basically the threat came that we're
not even gonna make games for your
system if this is the controller you're
gonna have because
no one's gonna use it which led to the
creation of this guy the original Xbox
controller s now the way they really
make it so guys so much smaller is
because thanks to the fact they actually
took more time to make it because they
were making it for a whole another
market they actually had some
information that they didn't have back
when the Duke was made with the Duke
they were forced to work with one
gigantic circuit board but it was
discovered later that the way a lot of
other gaming controllers stay smaller is
they actually use a dual circuit board
design where there's two boards laid on
top of each other with a cable
connecting them so they were able to do
this internally make the S controller
and also shifted a couple things around
to make it a little more comfortable in
general they did a different stick
design the d-pad is an actual d-pad
which was a huge improvement and the
black and white buttons removed to the
bottom rather than the top right here
and the back and start buttons are moved
to the side making just overall a much
more comfortable controller for someone
that doesn't have big hands well my
hands look this small on the screen now
this was exclusive to Japan at launch
when it came out back in 2002 but after
basically all other audiences saw that
this was a thing that existed it was
demanded that this come to other
territories as well and it did
officially make its way to the US and
Europe as a new bundled package with
Xboxes completely replacing the Duke and
its infamous history as this just
gigantic thing now I don't want you guys
walking away with the history of the
Duke kinking that was just some kind of
awful mistake that never should have
happened this is a really historically
significant controller that had a big
impact on how controllers are designed I
mean the designer did the best job she
could with the circumstances given and
made a comfy controller we still used
these trigger designs the button
placement and most importantly this is
one of the first big-name controllers
that actually use sticks that were not
symmetrical you look back at all the
PlayStation designs those guys are
symmetrical Nintendo at the time only
used a single stick with Xbox though
they embrace doing something a little
different based on player feedback and
made in my opinion a more comfortable
controller design and it's a design that
stuck with the S controller with the
Xbox 360 - controller to this day with
the Xbox one which is in my opinion the
most comfortable controller that's out
right now so with all the history out of
the way and going back to the hyper Kim
doop which is for modern systems how
exactly comfortable is this guy to use
all right let's do some cuphead I'm
probably gonna regret this decision
and I definitely remember this feeling
jinke I remember being at like demo
units way back in the day when they were
just first wearing the Xbox and I tried
using these controllers or have a smush
younger and smaller this is weird this
definitely I think varies bit based on
what kind of game you're playing because
so far just relying on triggers and like
traditional face buttons this is pretty
comfy okay so I'm already seeing like
the immediate one weird thing is
anything where you need to use the not
the bat not the triggers but like the
shoulder buttons are really bizarre
feeling because it's just kind of shoe
or Dan on the top of this guy and you
have to reach up really high to switch
to them and you can use the black and
white buttons with the same but that
requires just as much reach in but with
your thumb now which takes away from you
know normal controls no it's just it's
it's travel distance it's how much you
have to move your fingers to any once
again there's there's a reason they
moved away from this design over time
obviously like a current Xbox one
controller is gonna be more comfortable
than this you always have to like to use
a different grip style than you would
with a normal controller like where you
always have like your middle fingers
were on the triggers instead of your
index which I know some people do but
it's never been that computer for me so
if you're looking for a new controller
or a place like your standard Xbox one
controller maybe don't go this way but
if you're a collector if you like kind
of cool old retro stuff and something
that's kind of this weird fusion of
old-school design and something you play
on modern system this is a really cool
idea time's it perfectly with me dying</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
