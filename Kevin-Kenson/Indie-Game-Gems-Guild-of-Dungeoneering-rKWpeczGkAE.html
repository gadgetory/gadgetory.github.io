store and you stumbled upon this pencil
drom looking game called the guild of
Dungeoneering and for a moment your
brain kind of goes the hell is this well
this is Gilda's engineering a game that
as they might imply has a lot of
elements from dungeon crawlers and
roguelikes but really at its core is a
card game the basic idea is that you're
in charge of a guild of adventures and
send them out to complete a number of
different missions things like going to
kill so many enemies find a big bad boss
collect so much treasure so on so forth
but you don't control the adventurers
directly instead they enter the dungeon
and then it's up to you to build the
dungeon around them every turn you're
given a hand of five cards which either
include new rooms they can explore
enemies they can fight to gain
experience or special treasures or
treasure cards that will create piles of
gold that will help to attract the
adventure in a certain direction like I
said you have no actual control over
where the adventurer goes so a lot of
the idea comes down to building rooms in
the right order and putting treasure in
places where they're going to explore
the rooms you want them to to get the
best treasure possible or to accomplish
that particular dungeons objective now
while you can't directly control where
the adventurer is going to explore you
do control them in combat which is
another cards based mechanic the entire
dia is that when you're fighting an
opponent they show what card they're
going to play next which might be a
physical attack an unblockable move
healing and you can respond with one of
three cards that you drew from your deck
each adventure has their own different
starting deck with different abilities
which focus them a certain way as well
as having passives that specialize them
for instance the bruiser has a lot of
cards that block damage and if you
successfully blocks all damage in a turn
he deals damage to the opponent or the
thief where whenever you kill enemy you
have additional treasure types to choose
from so you can get better gear faster
or the mage where you get more magic
abilities alchemists that can heal
better mimes that can copy enemy cards
all of them have their own unique little
sticks making them all interesting to
play as and might make them more suited
for tackling certain dungeons because
while you do build each dungeon in
process there's definitely certain cards
or enemy types that show up more often
based on individual ones so if you're
going to a dungeon that has a lot of
enemies that use magic attacks well
you're going to want to use a character
that can block magic more often now what
adventure using isn't the only thing
that determines what cards you have
available whenever you kill enemies
you'll pick up equipment and those offer
new cards to add to your
deck with different themes based around
them so for instance if you pick up a
sword you're going to get a lot of
straight forward attack moves if you
pick up a shield it's going to give you
more blocking cards other abilities will
include things like offering more magic
attacks ways of healing drawing cards so
on so forth one of the things that I
immediately really liked about this game
after playing it for a bit is not only
as the mechanic really solid but it's
something that leaves itself very open
to short play sessions because every
time you enter the dungeon you're
starting from level 1 your adventurer
doesn't carry over any gear any
experience from previous adventures so
every time you go to a dungeon it's a
new delve right from the start so it's
never any kind of long-term progression
you have to care about too much instead
you can just play each game on its own
and just take whatever time you want
with it now this isn't to say the game
is completely devoid of long-term
progression whenever you complete
missions or even when you die you're
going to come back with a little bit of
gold which can use to expand the guild
in one of three different ways you can
either unlock new heroes that have their
own new starting decks and passive
abilities you can unlock idols which
grant you different special bonuses
while delving like getting bonus health
choosing from our treasures more often
or you can unlock new items that will
spawn while exploring a dungeon save a
chance of finding uncommon or rare more
powerful weapons armor that your
adventure can make use of overall design
wise i think they struck a really nice
balance between having long-term
progression but at the same time
allowing you to just focus on one
individual game at a time something kind
of along the lines of what you'd see in
rogue legacy where you do unlock stuff
over time but you're still just doing
individual runs one by one so the
mechanics are solid but one of the
things that definitely makes this game a
bit more sellable is the aesthetic the
whole pencil drum looking design with
randomized heroes is really charming but
even better everything is accompanied by
a bard there are numerous songs recorded
in this game where whenever you recruit
a new adventure or when adventurers die
or succeed on major missions there's a
bard singing a song about what just
happened and there are far more songs
than you would expect when you first
start playing this game admittedly it's
a little jarring when you first start it
but they become quickly lovable and
definitely helped make the game a lot
more memorable you know for 15 bucks
this game is easily worth picking up in
my opinion though I will say that it is
definitely one of those titles where if
you wait for a steam sale in the future
you'll probably be able to pick it up
for 750
five bucks or even less after a year or
so that being said though definitely
worth picking up right now if you just
want to get your hands on it it's a
great game to play in short bursts or if
you just want to dedicate an afternoon
to unlocking as much stuff as possible
so those are just my thoughts on guild
of Dungeoneering if you want to learn
