year now in that time they've amassed a
great library of games now of course
some of these are the big first party
titles we all know like Zelda and Mario
but another thing that's been going on
is there's a lot of awesome games that
originally on playstation xbox pc and
phones that have made their way over to
the system at ports and some of them you
may have heard of some of them maybe not
either way if you've never played them
before there has never been a better
time to play them than now on the switch
first on the list is a game that really
needs no introduction it's been a huge
hit since it came out back in 2015 and
that's rocket League combining cars and
soccer to create this really insane
multiplayer game where you have teams of
three going against each other even
though it always seems like there's
really only one guy in each team that
knows what they're doing but either way
it ends up being fun for everyone now if
you like playing your switch and dock
mode a lot you might be wondering
whether or not this is really worth it
because honestly compared to other
systems all you're getting is lower
resolution and sometimes frame dips but
that's not why rocket league is amazing
on the switch the reason it's amazing is
because handheld 60 frames cross play
the fact that you can just have a switch
in your hands playing rocket League
portably on the go and you never worry
about not having that much competition
to choose from because the switch
version of the game supports cross play
with Xbox one and PC users so you're
always gonna be able to find a match and
you're always gonna have fun players to
go up against next up on the list is
enter the gungeon a top-down roguelike
shooter that just like rocket League has
been on a bunch of systems before but
the switch is its first foray into
handhelds which make an absolute perfect
fit for it and honestly it makes me
wonder why we don't have more roguelikes
on the system yet because it works so
well for the genre I mean the entire
idea is that you're just doing the same
thing over and over and over again but
with the randomized elements trying to
do your best to get as far as you can
and being able to do that on the go
where you can just make attempts
whenever and wherever you like it's just
so fun and on to the fact the game does
have local two-player support and you
can do that portably as well thanks to
switches unique design and there's just
been no better way to experience this
game till now now before we move on to
the next item on this list I want to
address one elephant the room and that's
the
fact that Skyrim is not on this list now
don't get me wrong
being able to play Skyrim on-the-go is
awesome but it loses out just to the
fact that on the switch you will never
be able to experience this moving on to
number 3 is another game that I have
probably talked about way too much on
this channel but doesn't change the fact
that you should absolutely play this on
the switch if you haven't yet and that's
shovel knight shovel knight is an
amazing love letter to the 2d
platforming genre not just cuz it does a
good job of paying tribute to the
conventions of it but because in and of
itself it's just one of the best games
to execute the formula and it's not just
one game but three so far with a fourth
one on the way in 2018
now as for why it's best to play on the
switch well not only did the ability to
play it handheld on the go you do co-op
on the go as well and it's pretty
obvious Nintendo loves the game because
well it has its own amiibo with three
more coming two fourth up is one of my
absolute favorite indie games from 2016
if you missed out on it last year or the
year before now is the time to play on
the switch and that's awesome free
oxen-free is essentially a
point-and-click adventure that is an ode
to the 80s as plot line pulls very
heavily from the themes of teen and
horror films of the time only the synth
soundtrack that is honestly one of my
absolute favorite soundtracks to come
out of gaming it's best experienced
playing in a nice dark room where nice
and cozy and while the game has been
evade available portably before via
phones the screen size never really did
the game justice like you would get from
say a ps4 or PC so the switch is giving
you that perfectly happy medium rare
able to play portably with a larger
screen or if you want to hook it up to
your TV docked you can do that too
either way it makes for an excellent
experience next on the list is a game
that originally released on PC earlier
in 2017 and didn't really get a ton of
attention until it found its true home
on the switch and that's blossom tales
now the reason why blossom Tales finds
its home on the switch is because it is
an unashamed clone and tribute to Legend
of Zelda a link to the past some of the
game is not at all shy about constantly
alluding to while you're playing it and
while the core experience is very
obviously the same idea where you're
wandering
going into dungeons collecting gear
getting collectibles finding hidden
walls and all that good stuff it's not
afraid to make a few of its own unique
twists to it one of the most interesting
is the fact that the whole game is told
from the point of view of an old man
telling a story to two kids who actually
dictate some parts of the plot here and
there like which kind of monsters you
encounter when you go to a village
that's under attack while it may be a
clone it ultimately does a great job of
accomplishing the same kind of feeling
while taking a few of its own individual
risks and if you love the Zelda
franchise especially the 2d ones this is
a game you do not want to miss out on</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
