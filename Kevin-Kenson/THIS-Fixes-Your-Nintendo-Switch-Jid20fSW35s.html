had with the switch is the lack of any
kind of wireless audio support in fact
when there's been these rumors about a
potential new switch I switch 2.0 Pro
switch whatever people want to call it a
lot of people want to have Bluetooth
audio but that doesn't really do much
for people that have already bought a
switch now we've talked about a couple
different ways you can address this fact
there's a lot of new accessories and
adapters that have shown up to offer
this kind of compatibility and I'm
really excited today to talk about the
actual original accessory that really
popularized this idea the game
this was actually the original first big
accessory to really talk about bringing
Bluetooth audio to the switch it was on
Kickstarter IndieGoGo and it was a huge
success but because of that success a
lot of other companies tried beating the
market with other options and supposedly
despite those competitors this is still
supposed to be the best one out there so
we're gonna try it out look at
everything it offers and really see how
it compares to the competition first
let's take a look at everything that
comes the Genki and what its gonna do
for you so the main gank adapter itself
is a bluetooth adapter for the switch
and it is something that has been built
from the ground up for the switcher
specifically a lot of the other ones
you're seeing on the market that are
popping up for the switch are really
repurposed adapters that have just kind
of been put together to work for the
switch whereas this is a brand new one
meant for the switch specifically in
fact supports bluetooth 5.0 which offers
a couple of very important differences
the most important is the fact that like
the other Bluetooth adapters we've
talked about this supports standard
Bluetooth codecs as well as aptX but
also supports AAC now if you don't
remember what all that means stand
Bluetooth codecs are what most bluetooth
receivers use aptX is something that
some headsets support and gives you
super low latency which is really
important for gameplay because that way
the sound you're hearing in your
headphones is aligning with what you're
seeing on the screen well AAC is an
additional format that is a lot more
common than aptX and while it does have
a little more latency it's still below
the threshold for what most humans are
capable of even noticing and offers way
better audio and most importantly is
supported in a lot more headsets than
aptX one of those interesting examples
of this is air pots if you're an iPhone
user and you own a pair of ear pods
those support AAC and thus you can use
them with your switch and have an
awesome experience
now some additional handy features of
this has this slot right into the bottom
of the switch it draws power directly
from the switch and doesn't impact
battery life and all really noticeably I
mean does tree in a tiny bit but it's
not gonna affect performance at all and
even has the ability to support two
different headsets simultaneously that's
why we use two different buttons right
here one for going to when it said one
for the other and I really appreciate
the fact too that you can tell they
really designed this for the switch
because even to the color matching for
the neon joy' cons which is a really
nice touch while you can't buy the Genki
by itself standalone like this you can
also spend a little bit more money to
pick up a full kit that comes with a
couple of electric acessories if they
think really nicely round out the Genki
and they even come in this handy little
switch style case that called the Genki
so along with all the extra accessories
and even a couple game cards as well but
the first accessories and I think
honestly the most important one is this
stand so you'll notice that because the
gain key attaches to the bottom of the
switch you can't exactly put it in its
traditional kickstand mode one of the
many weird design choices of the switch
but with this little stand you're able
to plug in the Genki and support playing
in tabletop mode at the same time which
is really handy another really handy
thing is this little USB adapter this is
so you can plug the Genki into this and
plug it in your switch dock so you can
use it not only in handheld mode but
also in your docked TV setup lastly if
you want to make use of in-game chat for
games like for tonight it also does come
with this handy little boom mic that
plugs into the audio jack so you just
plug this into the top of the switch put
this at the bottom you're getting audio
in your wireless headset and can you
communicate via voice chat with this
little mic so that's everything getting
the complete kit now that we've taken a
look at all that let's actually test out
the ganky and see how it compares to
past adapters we've used so we're gonna
test a couple different things
simultaneously right now I'm going to
connect two different Bluetooth headsets
to the Genki and see how well that
functionality works and I mean use two
different kinds I'm gonna use the apt x
headsets we used before for the gully
kit to make sure we still get that same
performance on super low latency but I'm
also gonna try it with a pair of Apple
earpods to see if we're gonna still have
something that doesn't have any
noticeable flag and give us better sound
quality so first let's go ahead and sync
these together it's really simple all
you have to do is hit and hold the sync
button for whichever headset you want
the blue or the red one and then set
whatever headset you're trying to
connect to to syncing as well so we've
got both synced up let's start with the
apt X now once again I'm gonna test out
by just playing a retro game that's very
old-school style because usually those
are really easy to notice differences
between sound and the image you're
saying because it's just a very simple
thing I attacked with a weapon I get the
sound right away yeah this is seamless
I'm not seeing any jobs so this is just
like we were seeing before what we're
using the Gullah kit so now let's switch
over to the air pods on their own and
see we're gonna have that same kind of
experience
okay so trying out the air pods yeah
this sounds better although that could
just because you know theropods sound
better to begin with actually really
yeah it's a lot clearer audio compared
to using the apt X's but as far as the
link C goes it's definitely pretty
seamless
I don't know if it's because I'm aware
of the fact that AAC is a little more
latency than aptX that makes me feel
like maybe there's a little bit I can
notice this is still pretty seamless I
feel like it might just be because I
know logically that these are slightly
lower latency I think you can if you're
really looking for it I think with the
aptX you can still notice that it's a
little better and more seamless but here
it's it's so close I honestly don't
think it matters for most people why do
you you just wouldn't evil even tell
okay so having them both connected I am
definitely getting lag on the aptX these
are the ones that are supposed to be
super low latency and I'm not getting
that right now while both are connected
so it could be that we're having both is
messing with its latency so maybe the
sharing hits that idea is great for when
you're not caring about okay so
apparently if you're using two headsets
at the same time you organ experience a
little more latency which if you're
sharing with someone and you're playing
game that's not you know super focused
on making sure that you're not having
any delay at all not a big deal and it's
handy but definitely if you're focusing
on just getting the lowest latency
possible for a single player game you
don't want to connect to anyone else
after you're getting out I got to say
the Genki is definitely the best option
out there I mean if you're just gonna
rely on aptX headsets either way
the other options out there still work
but as far as supporting the widest
range of possibilities more headsets and
getting better audio quality the Genki
is definitely an improvement once again
you are gonna notice a couple little
latency problems if you're playing with
shared headsets with someone else but
for a single-player focus situation
especially ranked on a competitive games
this is a perfect solution</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
