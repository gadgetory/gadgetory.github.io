hurts me a little bit to rank this one
solo because I love the franchise but
just not this system quite as much and
that's the Star Wars ps4 Pro no this was
released as part of celebrating Star
Wars Battlefront 2 it was bundled with
the game and I'm just not a big fan of
how this was handled it's very very
basic and at the same time I think kind
of misses the mark too because look the
main focus here is what's going on on
the top of the system which has the
Empire and rebel logos great fine little
simple but traditional Star Wars stuff
makes sense the center focus though is
the inferno Squad logo which I get it
it's your battlefront to original
characters and you know the main focus
for that storyline but at the end of the
day if I want to buy a Star Wars special
edition system I want something to
celebrate
Star Wars not some specific thing that
you made just for this one-off game that
doesn't really connect with the rest of
the franchise I just didn't really care
for it
the other problem I have with this guy
is the fact that on the front side if
you're just going to have this in normal
sideways mode the only thing it has
going on is also one of my biggest pet
peeves when it comes to special editions
it's just the name Star Wars right there
though I didn't know what these symbols
were a reference to it's just it's an
okay looking system it doesn't look bad
it's just the wrong mixture of being a
bit too plain and just the energies
directed in the wrong place
coming in at 4th place for honestly kind
of boring and really simple reasons is
the all-black standard ps4 Pro and the
reason why is because that's just kind
of basic this is the standard ps4 Pro
and it looks fine it doesn't look bad by
any means I mean I'll take it over the
Star Wars one because that one just
misses the mark but it's just kind of an
all-black system you know it's what sony
has done ever since the ps2 their main
line since then I've always been these
kind of all-black focused designs at
least in the US and yeah it just it
looks fine it looks good it looks
standard traditional there's nothing
with that it's just compared to some of
the ones we got going on here are their
color mixes you know for me personally
one of the things that always kind of
holds back these kind of designs is the
fact that they are just all black
entirely I wish there was just some kind
of color trim going on somewhere which
is something I'll get to when we talk
about the white one in a bit but unless
guy just having the all black I mean it
just it's just plain number three is the
white ps4 Pro which is released as part
of a special edition bundle with destiny
to now like the black system one of the
main things that holds this one back a
little bit in my head is that it's just
basic it's plain and which is fine it
looks good I think the white is
definitely a benefit over the black
though for a couple of reasons first off
the white just looks cleaner I think it
makes the system in general look a
little more trim and because it's still
using black in the mid areas here it
gives you some color contrast which I
think just makes it look a lot better as
opposed to the black one which is just
all black everywhere now something that
happened before too is that Sony has
made a slim version of this in the past
and I liked that one but one of my big
complaints is the fact that the
PlayStation logo had this kind of
frosted white look to it which made it
not pop at all compared to the white
skin thankfully for the pro version they
changed that switching to a chrome
reflective surface just like on the
regular ps4 Pro and that makes it pop so
much more and look a lot better when
you're using it in tower mode for our
second-place winner is the Monster
Hunter World special edition ps4 pro now
as you might guess this came out as part
of Monster Hunter World and I really
like a lot of stuff that's going on in
this design now one thing that I've
never been a huge fan of that so many
likes do with a lot of special editions
is the mixture of matte and gloss
finishes and I think it works both for
and against the system because when you
have this in just the right light this
is a really cool looking special edition
where you just have Rathalos with fire
coming out of its mouth in this crazy
little image but that's kind of the
problem too is that it needs to be at
just the right angle since they're both
kind of the same shade of black if
you're not looking at this is just the
right way or to have it set up in just
the right spot it can be a little
confusing what you see going on here now
I will say - I know I've said before
over and over again even earlier in this
video one of my big pet peeves is
putting the name of something on the
system which this guide
do I putting it here in the corner but
I'm a little more forgiving when it's
off center like this it's not the main
focus they're not trying to be like in
big words oh this is the thing that
you've spent money on it's just almost
like just a little kind of little
PostScript to the main image which is
focused right here so I'm a little more
forgiving on this one really cool design
I just wish that I almost think this
might have worked better if they'd gone
with maybe just like a muddy red design
kind of like the controller that comes
with it and then had Rathalos and just
all black to really give this hard
cool-looking contrast but the design is
so sweet now one other thing about this
one going on on the front is that we do
have some symbols going on right here
which are the different fleets from
monster hunter world it looks solid I
think it gives kind of like a cool
little idea and a nice reference for
people that know what the game is about
so that way that if you don't like
having your system tower mode you still
have a nice little sign that you have a
special-edition system really cool
design
and finally for our number one position
is the most recent ps4 pro to come out
the God of War ps4 Pro now if a month
ago you told me that I was gonna rank
this guy at number one I would have
thought you're crazy because when I
first saw it I didn't really fully get
it yet but after getting my hands on the
system and seeing it in person and
playing the game a lot more I really
loved the design which is something that
I think really speaks well of how a
special-edition system can be designed
because I always want to celebrate the
game itself and not just be something
that's necessarily a very easy pandering
mix which this thing does a great job of
because once you realize that this is
the ax and the way it captures the ax is
runic designs it looks really cool with
that idea in your head and something
anything at nails are really well that
none of the other special editions
really do is color choices you know one
of the problems I have of the monster
hundred one is that it was black on
black mixes that made it really hard to
tell what was going on with the design
you couldn't always make out Rathalos
really clearly with this guy though
we've got a darker silver for the matte
a lighter gray for the gloss parts with
these gold accents that break it all up
which is just way more visually pleasing
to me and as far as the front side of it
goes you've got the eight different
runes for all the different realms in
the game which i think makes for a cool
little front design that's just a subtle
nod to stuff going on in the game and
that's what really appeals to me about
this it's just the fact that it really
celebrates and does a great job of
capturing what's really now become an
obsession for an hour with me it just
it's so well done it's easily the best
of the ps4 pros</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
