end of it a little bit of interesting
news that came out is that the lead
developer for video land announced they
wanted to bring the media app VLC to ps4
Roku and most interestingly the switch
but what we talked about what this could
mean for the switch potentially first I
realized that some of you guys don't
actually know what VLC is clearly you
did not pirate anime in the mid-2000s I
guess you always do what your big sister
tells you to do okay well what VLC is is
a media app available on Mac PC iOS
Android and even Xbox one and the main
point of it is that it's a media app
that supports a very large array of
different video formats way more than
any kind of stock media app would on
your OS now how this news actually came
about is during the into CES during some
interviews the lead developer for video
land the company that makes VLC mention
some they're planned upcoming updates
including the ability to use airplay on
their Android version of the app and
have actual native VR support for video
but the more interesting thing was sort
of a side note he dropped about their
interest in bringing it to more
platforms including the switch and why
this is especially interesting the
switch is because as we all kind of know
something that that platform is very
weak on right now is media options we've
brought up various times before that
there's a lot of really popular
streaming app options that are not
actually on the switch yet they're
available basically everywhere else the
only thing it only has at the moment is
Hulu and YouTube we don't even have
Netflix yet which is you know one of the
biggest trimming options out there so
the idea of having something like VLC on
the switch is very interesting because
unlike more traditional streaming
options that actually open up a whole
new room of possibilities on the switch
because we're not just talking about
being part of a membership or service
that gives you access to specific
content but it actually gives you a way
to intentionally load content to your
switch directly either by loading
something on SD card or potentially by
streaming it from some kind of media
server this would greatly tap into some
potential that the switch has to be
something much more than a gaming tablet
the only shame is it's probably not
gonna happen in the past we've looked at
a lot of weird workarounds to show what
the switch is capable of that Nintendo
is currently limiting doing things like
being able to access an internet browser
use YouTube before YouTube app was
actually released and even went so far
as to actually order
uber with one and it looks like he's
gonna be here really quick actually it
says two minutes now but they're already
turning on the street I think that's him
but an important difference between all
those different applications we've
talked about before is that those are
all very specific things in mind
streaming apps services things that are
designed to do a specific task whereas
something like VLC opens up a little too
much of the switch in a way that I think
Nintendo is not really comfortable with
they've made it a point in the past with
previous systems and especially with the
switch to really focus on the idea that
this is a gaming handheld not a tablet
despite what it is capable of despite
what kind of potential it could have at
the end of the day Nintendo wants to
market this as a way to play the newest
Mario game not a way to order a car part
of this comes down to Nintendo's
dedication to preserve what they see as
their image which they have relented on
a little bit with us which we are seeing
a lot more M rated content third-party
games and just more don't worry in to
stuff in general with the switch as
opposed to the usual very kid focused
approach but at the same time Nintendo
still wants to have that limitation of
these are the brains and things that
represent us we don't want anything that
gives people full control over what kind
of content is available on the system
another reason that's kind of tied into
that as well and similar but different
is also Nintendo's immense paranoia
about piracy now to be clear this
doesn't mean that not allowing VLC is
not going to allow piracy to happen
there's already been all kinds of
homebrew stuff opened up on the switch
it's just going to happen no matter what
Nintendo tries to do but that doesn't
change the fact that they have this
intense belief that they have ways of
preventing further piracy and that
includes making sure that there is very
strict control over what kind of
applications are available on the switch
and honestly I just think this is all
kind of a real shame there's so much the
switch could do that Nintendo is just
handicapping it from doing out of fear
of something it would affect their image
or possibly allow for more piracy which
let's face our seas just going to happen
no matter what they try but it's just
this entire argument of what is the
switch meant to be and I do agree the
switch is a gaming handheld first and
foremost but that doesn't mean that it
can't do more things as just an option
just by adding more media streaming apps
or more utility maps or more just
different things that are available on
most traditional tablets doesn't mean
all of a sudden Mario won't run on your
switch or that you didn't buy it for
games in the first place yes obviously
you're not buying a switch because you
want to have some kind of all in one
utility device but it wouldn't hurt to
have those things available as well
because it can do it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
