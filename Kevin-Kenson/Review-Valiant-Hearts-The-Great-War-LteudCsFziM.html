you guys my full review of valiant
hearts the great war from Ubisoft
Montpellier now this is available on ps3
ps4 xbox 360 xbox one and pc all
gameplay will be seeing here as well as
my personal experience is based on the
pc version so ubisoft has been getting
into the recent habit of developing
almost india like style games at lower
price points we saw another example of
this earlier this year with child of
light we're instead of focusing on just
Triple A titles where you have the
latest graphics huge open worlds and
supposedly epic story lines we instead
get these nice little fifteen or twenty
dollar games that have a more artistic
approach to their presentation and also
have their own little bit of charm and
valiant hearts is a great example of
this it's a very simple game
straightforward not too long only six or
seven eight hours tops to play but it's
got a lot of charm and it hits you right
in the fields so valiant hearts takes
place during World War one and while the
art and specific situations don't always
exactly reflect real events a lot of the
set pieces and chronology of events is
based on actual history the game does
this kind of interesting jump between
gameplay and almost tongue-in-cheek
presentation of history to a very
serious old school history channel
narrative dealing with the events of the
war and each of the different characters
motivations and lives during it even
within the game's levels there's all
these collectibles you can find that not
only serve as a simple hidden item for
completionists to look for but also
provide encyclopedic entries that detail
little bits of history even providing
sources for the information so all the
specific stories of valiant hearts are
dramatis Asians and fictional characters
it's all framed in a very real and an
awkward way historically accurate
setting cartoon eNOS obviously aside now
as far as the actual story and gameplay
goes there's basically four main
characters you shift between the points
of view of including a French soldier an
American who's serving with the French
army because much of this takes place
before the u.s. is involvement a German
soldier and a French civilian who ends
up acting as a nurse during the war
perspective constantly shifts between
these characters sometimes their paths
cross and they work together or they
both see the same event through a
different side while the backdrop itself
is focused on the war the story is
almost really more about each individual
character trying to find or get back to
their families with the exception of the
American who's just out for cold-blooded
vengeance leading to a much more combat
focused story why
I said earlier this game also jumps
around a lot in terms of tone there's a
lot of parts where there's very
light-hearted reinterpretations of
historical events or of cultures but at
the same time there's other moments that
really just clash with the games ascetic
and get very serious and really kind of
make you face the atrocities and horrors
of war now actual gameplay itself is in
the form of a puzzle game despite being
in a war you never actually fight much
outside of using a stealthy melee attack
to knock out an enemy or a few minigame
ish segments where you take control of
the tank the rest of it is entirely
focused on just finding ways to navigate
from point A to point B collecting items
and using them in a certain way or just
solving puzzles within a single room to
get an item you need or open a door it's
all focused on environmental interaction
and each character brings a little bit
of variety to what they can do uniquely
such as the American having bolt cutters
or the French soldier using a shovel to
dig at some point each character also
has the chance to work alongside the dog
who ends up playing a huge role in most
of the games puzzles acting as a second
character that you can command to reach
items your character can't interact with
far off objects or simply hold switches
for you the games there was in a few
other gameplay elements here and there
tank segments like I mentioned earlier
car chases matched up to classical music
and applying first aid in the form of a
rhythm game the entire game is very
simple and in all honesty it feels very
much like an app game at times having
very simple gameplay in a very simple
aesthetic and only lasting about six to
eight hours depending on how good you
are with puzzles and how much of a
completionist you are so to sum things
up valiant hearts is a simple game with
a lot of charm it's not the longest or
most complex title out there but it's
worth a fifteen dollar purchase thanks
to its strong storytelling and it's
interesting spin on historical fiction
if you're the kind of person that enjoys
puzzle titles games the simple but
delightful art or games with stories
that just aim to hit you right in the
fields then valiant hearts is easily
worth it's fifteen dollar price tag but
if you're looking for something a little
more action e than not so much I
personally really enjoyed it zero regret
on the money I spent for it though if
you are playing on PC it's definitely
the kind of game you'll probably see on
a seasonal sale sometime down the road
if you're willing to wait well that was
my review of valiant hearts the Great
War if you guys are interested in
