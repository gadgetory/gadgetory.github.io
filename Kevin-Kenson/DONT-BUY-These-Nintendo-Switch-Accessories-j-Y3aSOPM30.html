Nintendo switch much more than most
other consoles because a portable like
that just opens itself up to so many
different ideas and options and I've
even covered a number of them on this
channel before certainly not all of them
can be well good so let's talk about
saline into the switch accessories that
you should absolutely not buy perio I
mentioned before about the importance of
having a screen protector for the switch
but not all screen protectors are equal
and one of the worst ones comes from PDP
which really sucks by the way because
there's actually the mainland that's
pushed at most retailers even says you
know oh it's the official one for the
system don't fall for that trap this is
not a good one to have it's going to
create a ton of air bubbles no matter
how hard you try there are a lot of
other options out there from companies
like Horry you can also get higher
quality ones like glass screen
protectors when it come to just getting
an affordable cheap one don't buy this
one it is just not a good idea next
let's talk about some official Nintendo
products that aren't exactly up to
quality snuff starting with the joy con
wheel now to be honest I'm a little
biased in this because I don't really
care about using motion controls in
Mario Kart but I did it before on the
Wii and that 15 dollar piece of plastic
still was pretty fun to use because it
was a full-sized wheel that felt kind of
natural this one because the joint con
is smaller it's also a smaller wheel
that just feels honestly really weird
and doesn't really get the job done it
just feels like a slightly larger joy
con at the end of the day also the
design itself isn't that great the
shoulder buttons have the larger travel
time so it doesn't really work the way
you want it to and you need to jump or
use items it's just not comfortable I
mean for a kid this could maybe work I
think it's fine in that case but if
you're like me and spend all your time
just playing video games as an adult
and you want a wheel that's actually
going to perform well not a good choice
there are knock-offs third-party options
that are larger and probably going to
suit your needs better don't go with a
Nintendo one unless you have the hand
size of a ten-year-old then we have a
product that isn't bad in the sense of
that it does its job terribly I mean it
gets the job done fine for what it says
it'll do but I just it solves a problem
they don't see anyone having it and
that's a battery extension for your joy
columns now to begin with this is a $35
piece of plastic that holds batteries
let that sink everyone I mean you get
two of them great but it's still 35
bucks for this for giving a 20 hour
battery life droidcon additional charge
time I mean I've not once had a droid
kondaiah me because they just plug it
back into the switch whenever I'm done
playing and they recharge up perfectly
fine if for some reason your droid cons
are dying a lot though you could use
this to make it a bulky monstrosity that
just doesn't really do anything that you
need to have it do I mean if it maybe
charge the system at the same time
that'd be cool but it can't because it's
blocking off the controller and using it
as a solo joy Connor I just don't buy
this you don't need it just plug the joy
Khan in overnight and you're fine next
up let's give Nintendo a little bit of a
break and talk about third-party
accessories again with the level 1 chat
headset now before we even get into
talking about the quality of this thing
let's just let the concept sink in that
this is a chat headset for the switch
which doesn't currently have chat
capabilities so all this is is a mono
ear headset that sounds terrible you
might as well just use regular ear pods
and be done with it instead though they
have this chat headset which isn't very
good now I mean I get why it exists this
is just a rebrand of their ps4 and Xbox
one models it has a little red mark
instead of a blue or green one but even
then this is a cheap headset that is the
definition of cheap it just doesn't
sound good the chat qualities aren't
great it just feels flimsy it's not
comfortable just don't even when the
switch does spork chat with that
monstrosity the system that we've seen
advertised for splatoon don't buy this
one get something else have you seen the
we'll get a picture of the splatoon
headsets concept it's because the switch
is going to use phones for chat
yeah next we're going back to Nintendo
with a little bit of a hot take I hate
the droidcon grip I can't stop you from
having any of these obviously because
you're going to get one when you buy
your switch in general please don't
spend money on buying any more of these
it is not comfortable remotely if you
want from a traditional controller setup
save up your money and buy a pro
controller and otherwise just stick to
using the droidcon separately that is so
much more comfy than using the thing and
if for some reason you do like this
still don't buy them because you can buy
another option that actually charges the
controllers at least you're getting some
kind of additional function out of it
other than an awkward grip that just
don't you know I I don't like this we
already said this in the initial switch
review you were there that's insanity to
me so there you have five accessories
for the switch that you should not buy
now this is by no means a knock against
either company as I talked about here I
mean this was all pretty much an
official Nintendo and PDP but VP I love
your pixel pals keep making those
nintendo everything else you're doing is
great it's just some of the accessories
aren't quite the things you should grab
now I will link below some alternative
options to some things I talked about
better screen protectors the charge grip
all that good stuff but I'll do stuff
don't grab those please</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
