in the US and whether it's your first
3ds system or you're upgrading from
previous one chances are there's going
to be some accessories you want to grab
to get the absolute most out of your
system so let's go over the best
accessories for the 2d SXL first off
it's something that I've talked about a
thousand times before but I will keep
talking about every time we do a video
like this because it's that important
screen protectors now especially in the
case of the 3ds or 2d s XL here it's
really important to have one of these
because that touchscreen is getting so
much more use compared to most other
portables especially if you have kids
I cannot list how many times let's going
to D s with a ruin touch screen because
the kid doesn't understand you're not
supposed to be pressing down with the
stylus with the force of a meteor now
you can get just regular plastic screen
protectors for just five or six bucks
but honestly I think it's worth
upgrading just for a few dollars more to
get a glass one it's going to give you
the best protection possible some of the
plastic ones are just the tiniest bit
opaque which can ruin the screen clarity
so this is going to avoid that as well
and you're much much less likely to get
any kind of air bubbles when you're
applying it next is another form of
important protection and that is a
carrying case now the 2df XL thanks to
its clamshell design compared to the
original 2d s can fit in your pocket
pretty comfortably but at the same time
if you want to carry your own things
like your AC adapter or game cases these
are going to come really handy now if
you look up on Amazon you're going to
see a ton of these listed with all kinds
of four brand names attached and they
can get a little difficult to cite kind
of sort through which ones are good
which are bad for example this kenton
one here is currently the top seller and
it's fine it's perfectly okay expensive
it's going to cover all your base
but honestly not my favorite choice some
of it just feels kind of cheap to design
and it's only going to carry eight games
at once on the other hand first a few
dollars more you can grab this case
which carries up to 24 games another
important thing to for the two DIA
specifically is the fact that a lot of
these cases also come with a place to
carry an extra stylus which normally
isn't a huge necessity but considering
the one that the two DF carries is super
tiny this is really handy to have now
now that we've got the usual suspects
out of the way let's talk about
something a little different a grip for
your two DS now I would argue that out
of all the different designs Nintendo
has heads to the 3ds the 2d s Excel
is one of the most comfortable but it's
still designed for portability not
necessarily having the most comfortable
grip possible that's where an attachment
like this is going to come in handy the
2d s snaps into place nice and securely
it's not going to fall out or anything
and while it's not exactly as portable
anymore it's not going to fit in your
pocket easily you're going to have way
more comfort levels playing the game
over long periods of time and when you
need to go on the move
just take them apart and you're good to
go and as you may have noticed when I
picked it up it also has a built-in
kickstand giving you a way to display
the system on a tabletop or any other
flat surface and then we have of course
amiibo now are these Nintendo's thinly
veiled attempt to sell us overpriced DLC
and the form of addicting little
collectibles yes
is this a marketing strategy that works
definitely yes now if you never owned a
new 3ds before or you never bought the
attachment and if see reader for the
original 3ds this is gonna be the first
time you can actually scan these things
to use in your 3ds games and if you're
not sure which games actually support
them all you gotta do is look at the
case right here on the top corner will
have the amiibo symbol this opens up all
kinds of additional content and games
like fire emblem Super Smash Brothers or
more recently hey Pikmin so if you never
got the chance to actually use amiibo's
before definitely jump on it now now we
live in a day and age where people carry
all kinds of different portable
electronics and if you're a Nintendo fan
chances are you might actually have two
different portable gaming systems and as
a result sometimes becoming more and
more handy to have on hand is a battery
bank now this is what I've talked about
before it's one of the best ones that
works with the switch comes from anchor
and so it's a good one to have on hand
if you're going to have that along with
the DS obviously the DSS battery life is
a little better but you're still going
to run on those times where it's on a
low battery and you need that extra
charge now some of you might be
wondering how exactly am I going to
charge my BS with this because the
charger that comes with it it's just a
straight up AC adapter well that's where
this comes in handy you can buy cable
adapters that are USB 2 DS for super
cheap this is a four-foot one that cost
very little for a couple looks Morgan
get a 10-foot long one if you need that
extra reach but yeah basically in this
SD at this point so there you have all
the accessories you need to grab for
your brand new 2d s XL I'm gonna have
everything linked down below in the
description along with a couple
alternative choice
as well I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
