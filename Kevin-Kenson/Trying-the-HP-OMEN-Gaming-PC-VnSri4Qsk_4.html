we're going to take a look at how easy
it is to order and set up an awesome
pre-built high-powered gaming PC the HP
so first things first we need to
actually order our omen PC which is
really simple all you have to do is go
to HP's website select the configuration
you wanna do we're gonna look at the 881
60 se which is one of the more powerful
configurations you can get and then
customize all the little bits and pieces
you want now there are some pre-done we
recommend two configurations you can do
but I'm actually to skip that and just
go to doing each and every section
because I want to max this thing ours
now our first choice is what processor
want to have which for this
configuration we have two choices and
this is gonna be the main brain of the
computer that really makes sure that
everything runs nice and efficiently our
two choices are either in i7 8700 or an
i7 8700 K which the main difference
there is the K is gonna let us overclock
which we want to do so we're gonna grab
that one and next up is our memory now
the more this we have the smoother and
faster the system's gonna run and you
can get as little as eight gigs twelve
or sixteen but I want to go all out with
this system so we're gonna grab a 32
going down the list next choice you have
is what storage options you want which
we need a lot of that to make sure we
have room for all of our games DLC and
I'm gonna be doing gameplay capture so
that's gonna fill up really quick so
there's a few options you can get just a
one terabyte hard drive but I want to
have a combination of hard drive and SSD
that way everything in the SSD is gonna
load a lot faster well the hard drive is
all the mass storage so we're gonna do
the biggest option here which is 512
gigabytes of SSD with a two terabyte
hard drive now next is our heatsink
which is really important because with
all the power that were putting in this
PC we need to make sure that it well
doesn't melt and there's a few choices
here you can get an air cooling system
but I'm gonna go a little extra to get
the liquid cooling solution that's gonna
make sure that it's not only cool but
it's gonna run a lot more quietly on top
of that I'm gonna grab the option that
goes to the side window cuz if I'm gonna
have this much power in a PC I want to
be able to see it now our last and
probably most important option is what
graphics card with one half because
that's going to determine just how good
games can look and there's quite a few
choices here you can start at the
introductory of a geforce 1070 but once
again we're pushing this thing to the
limit so i'm gonna go for the top option
with a pair of 1080 t eyes and sli
alright so now we've got everything
picked and ordered
now all we have to do is wait for it to
arrive so now that Roman is here it's
actually really easy to set up and it's
ready to go right out of the box but
before we start playing on it let's take
a look inside they can get a little bit
of a look at the side window here but
let's actually open it up this is one of
things that's really cool about the omen
is there's a lot of pre-built out there
that make it a chore to open up if you
ever want to upgrade anything to change
it out not the case here really easy all
you gotta do is put the switch on the
back is slide the little lock button
here hit this button and then just pull
this off and there we are so there is a
lot going on in here so let's take a
look at everything we have so you can't
see the CPU because it's actually
covered by a liquid cooling unit right
here and next to that is all of our RAM
now below that we have our pair of 1080
T eyes which is a lot of power and below
that is our hard drive storage options
right here and I was really cool about
the omen is that you do have some
additional places for hard drives as
well which is actually up top where all
you have to do is open these flaps and
you have a pair of drive caddies to
easily swap in and out any additional
hard drives you might have so now that
we've confirmed that everything we order
it is actually inside the tower which is
a good thing let's close it back up and
actually start playing some games so to
get it real grasp of how powerful the
system is we're gonna play the crew 2 on
the omen as well as on an
eighth-generation nondescript home
gaming console and to start we're just
gonna drive around tempest let's go for
a little bit and really see how
everything looks which is beautiful by
the way I'm not even playing the game
yet and something to noticing right away
is it's taking a lot longer to get
started we're gonna get there though
this just wait a bit all right we can
start and we have everything on max
settings right now we're using a 10 DB
monitor and we are getting a solid 60
frames that is not dipping at all for
even a moment so another thing is the
console version of crew 2 is only at 30
frames so it's going at half the frame
rate of what we're seeing on the omen
and it's just it's just a little choppy
especially in games like this that are
so fast and require reflexes having that
lower frame rate can even actually of a
negative impact on your gameplay the
frames aren't dropping at all it also
looks like well it's targeting for that
30 we're getting a little drop off one
star stuff really starts taking off
there's a lot of other little things too
going on all the ones
the reflections on the car how far you
can see in the distance everything is
just looking really Krista nice here you
can see in the distance how there is a
major difference in draw distance so
next let's go ahead and switch over to a
boat and here's where you can really
notice since we're in the ocean and just
far away from all land you can see how
far the draw distance actually is it's
still a good looking game but compared
to playing it on the omen it's just
those hits and frame rate and the
inconsistency of it plus the drop in
just resolution in details it's not
really as immersive and Ted comparison
so I think it's pretty safe to say that
when it comes to performance The Omen
absolutely kills it and getting the most
out of your games now if you're
interested make sure to check out HP's
website for more info on this tower and
the rest of the omen line and I'll see
you all later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
