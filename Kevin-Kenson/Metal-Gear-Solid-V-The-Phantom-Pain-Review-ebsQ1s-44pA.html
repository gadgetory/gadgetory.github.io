one of the most consistently critically
acclaimed game series out there and for
damn good reason and with Kojima leading
Konami at the end of this year it looks
as though Medicare solved five the
phantom pain may be the last one were
ever gonna see and as a result a lot of
hype has been built up for this game the
question is can the game live up to this
hype and is it the final note that fans
have been wanting the series to go out
on which is actually a really
interesting question because phantom
Bane has a lot less to do with the style
of gameplay we saw in the other corner
maracle titles in the series and is
instead much more like an expansion of
what we saw introduced in peace Walker
which does share a lot of the same core
elements but it takes them in a little
bit different of a direction see a lot
of the older Metal Gear games were very
linear in nature while there might be
some backtracking hair there the main
point is to push the story onward
constantly there might be some side
constant here and there but ultimately
you're always doing the same things in
the same order peace walker and phantom
pain on the other hand phantom pain in
particular is much more nonlinear in
nature while there are main missions
some of which you have to do an order
and some of which you can sometimes gain
in Mass and just do them whenever order
you like there's also two wide free open
areas that you can explore on your own
time you can just screw around in these
areas if you like but you can also take
your time completing side ops and more
importantly collecting resources and
personnel to fill out your army at
mother base which is really the biggest
mechanic in this game aside from playing
the core story basically whenever you
find soldiers that have high skills or
you find useful resources that you can
use develop your base you can collect
those and put those into developing
different aspects you can do things like
make new weapons that you can equip find
new technologies you can make use of in
your missions you can upgrade different
passive effects like your Intel how
often you find out when the weather
changes or how many enemies are in the
upcoming area how quickly can get supply
drops so on so forth and what's really
nice is that these two aspects going
through the main story missions and
building at mother base are really
intertwined very quite well because
there's gonna be a lot of main missions
where you can't do them until you
develop some sort of technology for
mother base which is gonna require you
to build it up to a certain point and
this goes on for a good bit of the game
it doesn't last the entire main story
there is definitely a certain point
where you can just boost forward now if
you want to but you
may take time growing up mother base
which i think is nice because it also
helps the pacing of the gameplay a lot
because it allows you to take your time
learning all the different mechanics
trying out new weapons trying out new
pieces of technology that you unlock and
gadgets you can use and this links into
what I really think is the Phantom
Pain's biggest strength its core
gameplay which is by far the most
refined stealth experience in the series
just because it gives you so many
options of hey one tackle each mission
if you want to do things the traditional
route and just stick to quite stealth
and use a tranq pistol you can do that
if you want to utilize an ally or a
helicopter to create a distraction while
you do your business you can do that if
you just want to go into guns blazing
while support helicopter flies above you
glaring rebel yell as loud as possible
you can do that there are just so many
additions in this game that give you the
ability to tackle missions just the way
you want to to begin with the move to an
open world does make it to where you can
just approach mission from any angle
you'd like there are multiple ways to
infiltrate fortresses and objectives
don't always need to be completed in the
same order second off there's now the
ability to call supply drops so in the
middle of a mission if you realize you
brought the wrong equipment or you just
need to refresh what you have you can
call on a drop and get new stuff third
up is the ability to interrogate enemies
so if you're able to get up close and
subdue them you can find out useful
information like where more guards are
posted or where there are useful items
you can have or where your objective is
and last but not least is the buddy
system where over the course the game
will gain for different allies that you
can use that offer very different
benefits to different playstyles there's
your horse which provides a form of fast
travel that can also be a little
stealthier compared to a vehicle since
you can hide on the side of it there's
your pet wolf which can automatically
detect things like enemies landmines of
additional items and can even quietly
dispatch enemies once you've upgraded
him a little bit there's my personal
favorite the sniper quiet who can scout
out enemy bases as well as provide cover
fire to keep enemies distracted away
from you and last there is the D Walker
a personal customizable mech which can
be given a couple different loadouts
it's really useful full frontal assault
you can also use it in a stealth mode
though personally I feel like being on
foot is just better for that and on top
of that there's just so many different
items to choose from to bring along on
missions you can not only unlock a lot
of different weapons to choose from the
tons of usable gadgets as well like
different kinds of grenades decoys and
of course the series
additional cardboard box with so many
ways to handle every mission the game
gives you it's just part of not to fall
in love with this core gameplay now
while I think the core mechanics are
excellent I do feel a little more iffy
about the story aspects of the game for
a couple different reasons now to be
clear I think the overall story is
actually really quite good it's just
that there's some problems with how it's
delivered first off there's the pacing
of the game by moving it to open-world
there's so much time you can spend
between major missions that it just
really messes up the flow of the
storytelling especially in the later
half the game where a lot of the main
missions aren't actually new story
missions they're just repeatable
admissions with new added layers of
difficulty so even though there are 50
main missions it's really more like
there's only 37 or 38 that are actually
important to the plot second off is the
fact that the game relies a bit too
heavily on cassette tapes to give a lot
of the game's exposition in Prior games
you'd spend a lot of time in audio
transmissions learning more and more
about the plot but in order to cut a lot
of that fat out and focus more on the
pure gameplay now you're just given
cassette tapes to listen to at your own
leisure which is cool until you get too
focused on the gameplay and start not
really realizing what the full story
going on is because you haven't taken
time to listen to every tape and the
last and really biggest reason I have a
problem is the cut content in this game
see if you get the collector's edition
of the phantom pain you get this little
bonus disc that has a lot of
behind-the-scenes content like
interviews and trailers but more
importantly it has an overview of a cut
final mission the thing is this cut
mission is basically a second full
ending of the game and in my opinion
it's a much better ending than the one
we already have it connected a lot more
to the rest of the series and so I
thought it gave the game a much better
point to end on because it just
reflected the whole series again rather
than just having its own isolated plot
now with all that being said I still
think what story we have here is really
good it's just that it could have been
even better with that cut ending and
could have been a little cleaner with
better delivery aside from the game
plains storyline everything else in the
game is really really solid as well the
graphics look great great level design
good sounds music is a little hard to
judge because there is no normal
soundtrack running with the game instead
you can use your cassette tape to either
listen to the phantom pain original
soundtrack or listening to a collection
of eighties hits which make for very
different but both equally amazing
experiences now the last thing we need
to talk about is the multiplayer mode
now this is not the same thing as Metal
Gear Online which was introduced in
Metal Gear Solid 4 that is going to be
added to the phantom pain currently
planned for October 6th but for now
there's instead this invasion mode
focused on your bases see alongside with
billing at mother base you also have the
option to build what are called fo B's
forward operating bases and these are
basically cheaper more efficient ways to
grow your overall base without having to
build some kind of super version of
mother base the problem is these fo B's
are vulnerable to other player attacks
which can lead to not only having
resources stolen but even useful
personnel as part of your arms so the
whole mode revolves around the idea of
assaulting other players to take their
resources while defending your own it's
a very indirect method of multiplayer it
is possible to actually go head-to-head
with a player but most of it really
comes down to just going to a base while
the players away and just doing the same
infiltration mission over and over again
the specifics can vary because you can
make your defenses bigger and better so
you might kind of one player that hasn't
really invested much yet just has a
couple guards with nothing else or you
might run into a guy that has an army of
soldiers armed with the best equipment
along with security cameras pressure
sensors all kinds of crazy crap so the
specifics can vary but you're still
going to the same mission area over and
over again which just got really
repetitive for me thankfully this mode
is not required at all to get further in
the game it can speed up the process of
which you build up mother base but it's
completely a hundred percent not
required to play the storyline so if
screwing with other players to steal the
resources is something that sounds fun
to you then this could be a fun side
option but if not you just want to focus
on the main story it's not gonna
interfere with that whatsoever
so overall Metal Gear Solid 5 the
phantom pain is an amazing game well I
do have some complaints regarding how
the storyline was handled and how the
plot was delivered and I'm not the
hugest fan of the multiplayer aspect
they added none of that really detracts
from just how freakin awesome the core
gameplay element is and the fact that
the overall story is still really quite
good with so many different options of
how you can approach every mission and
just so many ways you can just screw
around in free roam if you want it's
really easy to lose a lot of time into
this game if you're a fan of the medic
you're stalled serious and you haven't
picked this game up yet it's worth
grabbing just for filling in all the
little bits of plot and expiry
what is in my opinion by far the best
stealth gameplay experience the series
has to offer and if you're not a fan of
the series it might be worth reading
some synopses of path games or in my
recommendations playing through them
because they're all great games just so
you can play through this one because
the core gameplay is that fun well that
