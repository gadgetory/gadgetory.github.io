year since our last best accessories for
the ps4 and in that time there have been
software updates that allow us to use
new stuff of the system and more
importantly just new products that have
been coming out so let's take an updated
look at the best accessories for your
ps4 Pro first let's take a look at
something I've done a couple dedicated
videos on and that's a pro controller
option for your ps4 now the regular
DualShock 4 is a perfectly serviceable
controller but there are some upgrades
that you could get out of moving onto
one of these first of all a more
comfortable controller customizable
buttons and honestly while some people
may view a wired connection to be a
downgrade honestly finds that the cord
length is plenty long enough to use with
my systems and I never have to worry
about the low battery life of the Dual
Shock 4 now there's a couple options
that are out the two main ones I've
talked about that I really liked are the
Razor ratio and the nikon revolution
back when i did that of kid videos i
kind of put this one as being the little
better option but as time has passed
I've actually really grown to love the
nikon revolution instead they actually
have a new version coming out that's
gonna be adding a lot of new functions
and improving on some of the downsides
this version had for instance actually
using a USBC cable instead of this
proprietary connection that's just
really annoying next up is something I
always like recommending on accessory
lists and that's a carrying case for
your system now I have talked carrying
cases before that'll work for the
original ps4 and ps4 slim but the pro is
a bit of a different situation because
it's a larger system and honestly just
an awkwardly shaped one a lot of bags
and caring devices aren't designed for
something this square in design it's
certainly something more narrow like a
laptop so for the pro you're gonna have
to keep your eyes open for more
specially designed bags like this one
right here it's a little bulkier but
it's designed to be protective of
hardshell to make sure it's safe there's
room inside to fit the pro as well as
some additional accessories like
controllers or even a headset this one
in particular is not the prettiest
design but I actually kind of like that
to be honest because it's a nice subtle
way of transporting your system without
advertising what you have but there are
more stylish ones out there so I'll go
ahead and link both down below for you
guys to check out now for something a
little more different than our usual is
a wall mount for your ps4 pro now I've
talked about a couple different ways you
can show off your system different
setups you can have it in tower mode
using a stand or just having it the
regular sideways position but sometimes
depending on the space
see if available the best way to show
off your system is just put it right on
the wall for display now as low key as
this thing is there's actually a couple
different models available you can get
it for the ps4 slim the ps4 pro like
this one or even for the original ps4 if
you're still rocking it and it's a
really simple thing to set up you just
have these little bottom lips right here
that attach to the bottom of your ps4 a
little place to screw into what would
normally the stand hold on the ps4 to
make sure it's nice and locked in and
secure and boom you've got your ps4
setup on the wall on display and it'll
look great
on top of that they normally make these
racks for the system itself but they
also sell little hooks to display your
controllers as well you can get these in
a 2-pack bundle with the rack itself or
you can buy them separately to fit your
needs
fourth up is something that I've talked
about before but only my Xbox accessory
videos because it was never really a
choice for ps4 until a certain point but
thanks to an update which honestly isn't
super recent but it is after my last
accessory video you can now use external
hard drives with your ps4 now even if
you have a ps4 Pro you only have one
terabyte of storage which if you just
play games occasionally is gonna be
enough but if you're playing a lot
you're buying a lot of stuff you're
gonna fill that thing up quick in order
to save yourself some time and hassle so
you're not constantly deleting and
reinstalling things you can get an
external hard drive like this to hook up
to your system it also makes it easy if
you want to move games between different
systems now personally I'm a big fan of
Western Digital I like to my passport I
like the look I like the size they have
a low failure rate and you can get them
in a variety of colors to match your
taste or even get one matching your ps4
like this blue one right here and then
we have something a little special to
tie into a recent big exclusive release
on the ps4 Gran Turismo sport and they
go hand-in-hand with that we have a
racing wheel to play the game with from
Thrustmaster this is their mid-range
option the t-150 there is a more
affordable and below that called the
t-80 but honestly not the best
experience you're a lot better off
saving up your money to get this one
we're skin of all the features you need
to get a solid racing will experience
most importantly force-feedback if you
want to go all out they do have a more
expensive option called the 300 that's
gonna set you back a lot more money this
one's gonna have everything you need the
only real downside to this design is
that the pedals on it or a little light
side it takes a little modification if
you want to make sure they're nice and
sturdy in a good place but once you get
your setup going this is gonna offer you
a much better racing XP
so there we have some of the best
accessories you can grab for your ps4
I'll list all these down below in the
description along with a couple of
additional options as well and we'll see
you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
