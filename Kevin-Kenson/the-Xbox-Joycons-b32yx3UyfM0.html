Something that's been making
rounds in the news again
that we actually haven't talked about yet
is the concept of Xbox Joy-Cons.
I know that's a weird-sounding concept,
but that's actually a
pretty accurate description
of what they are.
I've had people ask me
numerous times before,
whether or not Microsoft will make
their own version of a handheld.
Something like the Switch,
where they make an on-the-go system,
and I always say no, I
don't think they are.
I think what they're more interested in
is bringing the Xbox One
experience to mobile platforms,
and the main way they've
really talked about
and pushed this is xCloud.
For those of you who don't know,
xCloud is Microsoft's currently
in-development service
that will allow people to
stream-play their Xbox One games
to different mobile devices,
like a phone or tablet,
and so, the concept of an X-Box Joy-Con
is their attempt at making controllers
that are specifically
suited to that medium.
Now, this idea itself isn't
very crazy 'cause, keep in mind,
the Switch itself actually
had lawsuit issues
from companies like Gamevice
that have made before controllers
that are designed to go
on the sides of phones.
So, it's something that we've seen
other companies mess with before,
but this is gonna be
one of the first cases
where something that's
designed for a phone or tablet
comes from a major company like Microsoft,
and is designed for their
games specifically in mind.
Now, the reason why
this news has been making
rounds on the internet, again,
is because Microsoft has
actually filed patents
for these products.
In the past, we've seen
a few different early mock-up designs
of what exactly they have in mind.
Now, keep in mind, none
of this is actually final.
It's not stuff that Microsoft
is officially releasing,
but it gives an idea of the kind of stuff
that they have in mind, and
it's really interesting,
'cause I think it takes one
concept from the Joy-Cons
that I really enjoy, which
is the idea of modularity.
The mock-up images that we've seen,
while showing a controller
that is similar in concept
to the Joy-Con is actually
something pretty different,
one of the most notable
things being the shape of it.
Now, Joy-Cons are designed to be something
that are usable when attached
to the side of the Switch,
but are also designed to be useful
when you're holding one
in each hand, wirelessly,
which is why they have
that very long design.
Almost similar to what Nintendo did
in the past, with the Wii remotes.
On the other hand, the Xbox
mock-ups are showing something
that's more along the lines
of a classic-style controller.
Almost something very
similar to the Hori Mini Pad
on the Playstation, but where you take
that kind of smaller
design and cut it in half,
leading to two controllers
that are more square,
roundish in shape, rather than being long.
The obvious downside to this is
that it's not as comfortable to use
if you wanted to have one
in each hand, wirelessly,
but that's not really what
these are designed for.
Instead, the main goal is for using them
when they're attached to the
side of a phone or tablet,
or using a specially-designed attachment
that allows you to put
both controllers together
to form one single controller,
kind of like having a controller grip
on the Nintendo Switch Joy-Cons.
What's really interesting
about this idea, though,
is that it's not just focused
on having these two small,
squarish controllers,
and then a single grip
attachment to put them together,
but also the idea of having different,
choosable grip attachments
that go on the sides of them,
to create that more
familiar handlebar design
that a lot of major
popular controllers have.
And, it wouldn't just be
one singular grip design,
they'd have multiple ones.
A smaller one, a medium-sized
one, a large-sized one.
That way, it works for
different hand sizes,
instead of being an approach
that's one size fits all,
which is always a good idea
if there's only one choice,
but it doesn't always work
out in the favor of people
that have particularly
large or small hands.
Before moving on, I want to take a second
to thank RAID: Shadow Legends
for sponsoring today's video.
Now, if you haven't heard of it,
RAID: Shadow Legends is
a brand-new mobile RPG
that has been a huge success.
It already has almost 10 million players
after only being around for three months.
The game has got something for everyone,
whether you like playing
through the story,
tough tactical battles,
fighting other players,
or just marveling at the awesome graphics.
Me, personally, I just
love collecting heroes.
Just look at the details on them.
The game is growing super fast,
and an update just went live,
along with a new loyalty
rewards program for new players,
where you can get a new login
reward every day for 90 days.
Make sure to check out the link
down below in the description
to instantly get 50,000 silver
and a free epic hero as part
of their new player program.
These grips can be used
both when the controllers
are being used separately,
attached to the sides of a phone,
or if you're using that connector
to treat it more like a
traditional wireless controller,
which is a really cool
idea, 'cause that gives you
a lot of different ways you
can use this mocked-up design.
It's also worth noting that
the attachment allows you
to combine the two controllers together
also looks like it might have
some sort of charging port on it,
so that may be how you charge
the controllers separately,
or even use it in a wired
configuration if need be.
Now, again, everything we
have seen so far are mock-ups
and proposed ideas for how
these controllers would work.
So, the final product, if
and when it does come out,
is something that could
be very similar to this,
or something completely different.
But, if it is the same,
something I find really interesting
to how they chose to design these is that
in order to accommodate
those different attachments
you could use, was where
they placed certain buttons.
All the front-facing ones make sense.
It's where you would normally,
traditionally view them,
but the trigger designs
are closer to the the inside
middle-back of the controller.
So, you're reaching farther in
when it's designed like
a normal controller,
but it might feel a little
closer to natural grip design
when you're using them
on the sides of a phone.
The reason for this being
that you want to be able
to make room for where the
grip attachments would go
in on the sides, so they can't really be
on the outside of it, they
gotta be further closer in.
All in all, I think this
is a really cool concept,
and while I don't necessarily
think the mock-ups
that we're seeing are the
absolute best design out there,
I really like the ideas
that they're incorporating,
and the direction they're taking,
in that this is very
modular focused design,
so it can adapt to a number
of different situations,
and there's a lot of
customization options,
so that way you can
make sure the controller
is at most comfortable
for you, personally.
However, there is one
very important question
about all this, and that's, actually,
how necessary this controller
design is in the first place.
Ever since Xbox One controllers
added support for Bluetooth,
and more recently, Apple announced
that you can use Xbox One controllers
with the devices that use iOS.
It's really easy to take
an Xbox One controller you already own
and use it with a tablet
or phone of your choice.
So, it raises the question,
why exactly do you need
to buy a new, specialized
controller for that?
In fact, back at E3, I even got a chance
to go hands-on with xCloud in use,
and the way they had that setup
was with Xbox One controllers
with a phone clip attachment,
and using the phone to play games.
I think when a lot of
people pictured the idea
of using a traditional
controller with a mobile phone,
this is exactly the kind of
setup that comes to mind.
So, really have to start thinking about
what does this alternative
option offer that you don't get
out of just taking a
controller you already own
and using that instead?
And, I've been thinking about it,
and there's three main reasons
that really stand out to
me of why I would want
to pick up and use one of
these modular controllers
instead of just sticking with
an Xbox One controller I already own.
The first one is tablets.
Sure, if you want to use
a traditionally controller
with a phone, phone clips
make that really easy,
and if you want to use it with your tablet
in a tabletop setup like with the Switch,
that makes a lot of sense.
But, if you want to use the
larger screen of the tablet
on the go, when you're moving,
well, there's not really a feasible way
to use the normal controller.
Even if they made a clip
large enough to fit that,
it's not going to exactly
balance very well.
So, the idea of something
where you have controllers
that attach to the side of it,
allowing you to walk around
and play at the same time,
makes a lot of sense.
Second off, one of the core
concepts of this very design
is that concept of
modularity and customization.
Sure, an Xbox controller is a really good
one-size-fits-all option, but you may find
that using one of these
modular controller designs
allow you to find a grip
that is perfectly suited to your needs
and ends up working out a lot better.
Not to mention the way
this whole thing works,
where it's multiple
pieces, you can break down,
put together, take apart again.
It allows for something
that's way more portable
than a traditional Xbox One controller.
We don't have a full
sense of scale just yet
for how big these controllers can be,
but it's entirely possible
the two main modules
could fit in your pocket,
making it a lot easier to carry around
and put together when you want to play,
as opposed to a full-sized
Xbox One controller
where you definitely need a bag
or a carrying case, or something.
The third reason, and
this one that comes down
a little bit more to personal preference,
but it makes a lot of sense to me,
and that's the orientation of controls
relative to the screen you're using.
Now, look, when you're using
a phone on a phone clip
with a controller, it
makes sense, it works.
But, at the end of the day,
I do really prefer the idea
of having hands on each
side of the device,
and having a screen right
dead center in the middle.
It gives you the ability
to look at your controls
and the screen all at the same time,
instead of it being a slightly
more divorced experience.
And, this is why most handheld
systems work that way.
It's very rare that you have
all the controls at the bottom,
and the screen up top.
The only thing I can think
of that's popular is the 3DS,
and that's because,
well, it has two screens,
so it needs to do that.
So, the idea of having
traditional Xbox-style controls,
but on the sides of your screen,
instead of down below on
a separate controller,
is something that works
really well, I think.
Is that enough reason alone to
buy a specialized controller
over just saving money
on a cheaper phone clip?
Probably not, but adding on
to those other things I
was talking about earlier,
like the modularity and the customization,
and portability over everything else,
I think it all comes together
to be a pretty compelling argument
to use a controller like this.
Either way, this is something
that is going to be a bit of ways off.
We just saw the patents
filed, and after all,
think back how long we heard
rumors and early designs
for the adaptability controller
up until that actually released.
So, it's gonna be a bit before
this thing becomes a reality.
We more than likely will not see it
at the same time as when
xCloud officially launches,
but it could be something that comes out
sometime late next year, and I, for one,
am very curious to see
what it actually becomes.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
