editions and today we're gonna count
down through all 11 that were released
here in the US so they're gonna be a
couple missing like the animal crossing
des which is an honorable mention but
there are some awesome ones gonna go
through especially Sony who has five
play stations that came out this year
that are on this list so let's take a
look at all of them first up and I'm a
little sad to have to put this here at
number 11 is the super smash brothers
switch now to be clear I think this is a
cool design I think it is something that
is better than just getting a regular
switch if you're getting your first one
overall I don't know if it's necessarily
something you should upgrade into but
the biggest problem the system really
has is that it's just very low effort as
far as qualifying as a special edition
in fact I was even a little hesitant
about putting it on here because the
switch itself is just a regular switch
there is nothing unique about it instead
all the different design choices go into
the joint cons and the dock the
left-right con is awesome featuring the
cross design for the smash brothers logo
while the right joi con without the
context of being with it is a Greyjoy
clone with a server line on it which is
just kind of weird to me the big one for
this special edition though is the dock
featuring characters from Smash Brothers
crowded in the left and right sides
facing each other like a vs. screen very
much the promotional art style they've
been pushing for this game and it's one
of the parts that really has the most
attention to detail out of everything in
the system
well I still wish there was a little bit
of color involved somewhere the black
and white approach doesn't look nearly
as bad as I thought it would in person
it's a really cool thing and I hope hope
that for those of you they didn't pick
up the system that it gets sold on its
own on the side because it's definitely
with a cooler dog options out there next
up at number 10 for very similar reasons
as the smash brothers console is the
Diablo addition switch once again there
just isn't a whole lot going on here
although which parts are missing are a
little different mixed up in this case
we have a special design on the switch
itself with regular joi cons and I'll
get to that problem in a moment and then
a redone dock design once again now the
switch on this end has a half design of
Diablo spaced from Diablo 3 on it which
I think look really cool it's a very
small minimal thing but it's a little
hard to work with the back of the switch
right now when all you really have is
the logo and the kickstand so you don't
want to take up a lot of space it looks
cool but once again I
I wish there was some degree of color
just some way of mixing it up a little
bit as for the dot design this is
actually something I think is a really
cool deep cut for anyone who's a
long-term fan of the habl√≥ franchise
because the art on here with the angel
and devil facing each other it's
actually based on the original Diablo
concept art not stuff that was made
apparent and later gamez so if you've
been a longtime fan this is gonna be
something that you get react to and it's
just a really cool choice to go with
really the biggest problem this system
has that is kind of fixable is the fact
that it just has regular greyjoy cons
but just seems like a really big missed
opportunity for Diablo because you
usually associate very warm hot colors
with it reds oranges maybe if it's just
a little yellow highlights there's so
many things that could have gone with
now thankfully since the switch is a
modular system if you bought this one
you can make it cooler still by just
going out and buying the right kind of
joy cons either hunting down the Mario
red or even just going for the neon red
ones that have more of an orange look
either those are gonna look way better
on this system the only thing is well
you're spending more money to make a
system cooler that should have been just
this cool in the first place coming in
at number nine is the first of many play
stations on this list the Monster Hunter
World ps4 Pro now this is one that I
actually really liked in concept but I
think it runs into a little bit of a
problem when it comes down to the
execution so the main draw here there's
a couple little things going on but the
really big thing is the design of
Rathalos on the top of the system it's
this whole half gloss half not gloss to
create this print design and then flames
and red which I think stand out really
nicely but the black on black approach
just gets a little too muddled too
confusing and results in a system that
looks really cool when you look at it
from a very specific angle and then the
other angle it's kind of just an unclear
mess which is a real shame because when
you look at the controller that was
paired with it which has this muddy red
finish I think that looks really cool
and I really wish they would have
focused on that being on the main system
itself either by adding mole redecide
from the fire or making the main part of
the system red with the Rathalos and
black just some more color to make it
really stand out a lot more clearly
because the art once again is really
cool it's just you can't really skip
most of the time aside from Rathalos up
top it does also feature the name of the
game in the bottom corner of the top
written in gold which is a nice little
static although I you normally I'm not a
huge fan of swapping the title of stuff
on this
correctly and then on the front of the
system are a couple symbols that if you
haven't played Monster Hunter just kind
of looked like nonsense but they're
actually referencing the different
factions of the exploration team in the
game then at number eight we have the
Gold Rush Xbox one X I think okay look
we get a lot of special division systems
I actually missed out on grabbing that
one this year so like it had this gold
the black kind of shade design which is
cool but I don't know if it was the
right color choice I just looking at
pictures I think that's where this one
goes this list at number 7 is another
ps4 Pro the God of War 4 edition now
this is one where I think it's
simultaneously a really cool design but
also kind of not depending on what you
know of the game and how much you've
actually played because it's a very busy
looking system and if you don't get what
it's supposed to be a depiction of it
kind of just looks a little weird at
first so this is actually supposed to
depict the main acts that Kratos uses
throughout the game and with that in
mind it's a really cool-looking design I
love the color choices I like that we
want to sort of like a dark steel with a
grey and some gold trim all really fine
choices but if you don't picture that
and just look at it from a pure
aesthetic standpoint it's a little crazy
the front of the system also features
this kind of gold braid design for the
middle tier which I'm a little hit and
miss on because I think the gold looks
really nice next to the dark steel but
with the lighter gray not so much it
also features the runes representing the
different realms on the bottom which is
a really nice touch for the front as I
have said many times before I'm always a
huge fan of silver on systems so for the
controller to actually just embrace a
silver look instead of using either of
the Grey's on here I think it's really
nice touch featuring the God of War logo
and sign right here on the touch pad and
just a little logo on one of the handles
again I think this is a super cool
design for anyone that's played the game
and you get the imagery of the Leviathan
acts right away but on a shelf
back-to-back with every other system
it's just a little bizarre
fellow human Kevin a lot of gaming
systems so he is giving one away check
out the link below for chance with
Nintendo switch next up is the Pokemon
Edition Nintendo switch now this is
these special editions which design that
I think is the best one they've released
thus far and a large reason for that is
because it's the only one that actually
uses some kind of special design on each
major aspect of the switch we have a
design on the back of the main switch
body itself special joy cons and a
special limited edition dock design now
while this is a Pokemon edition of
switch the main focus here is on Pikachu
Eevee the two choices for Pokemon let's
go and that plays a role in each low
aspect here on the main switch body
itself on the back we have this print
design that features outlines of both
Pikachu and Eevee and different stances
and positions and I think that while
this is probably the lowest key option
and still not going as far as I would
like special editions were just ago it's
the best effort out of what we've seen
so far and what really plays well here
though is how the Doc interplays with
the joy Kahn's so go along with any of
Pikachu and Eevee you have designs where
the joy comes each side are matching
colors for those different pokemon and
in fact the wrist straps which I don't
have attached right now because it's on
the switch offer an alternate color
design that kind of represents the other
colors on those Pokemon which is a
really nice touch although personally
I'm never going to see that because I
never use the wrist straps and then the
front of the back features Pikachu and
Eevee along with the joy hunt they match
and what I really like here too is that
unlike the other designs we've seen
where they always have a black and white
approach they actually did embrace
colors here and then I start eating
garbage at number 5 is the 3rd
PlayStation on this list and the only
one to come out this year that is a
special edition ps4 slim and honestly
it's my favorite ps4 Suleman that
they've made the days of play
PlayStation now what I really like about
this one is that oftentimes Sony's
really trying to heavily push the idea
that PlayStation consoles by default are
black and I get it it's a popular move
for systems right now but really the
color that I've always associated
PlayStation with is blue and embracing
that for the system I think is a really
good look if you're not familiar with
why this PlayStation exists something
that Sony's started do the past couple
years is during e3
they'll have a promotion called days of
play where a lot of different systems go
on sale there's
limited-edition bundles all that kind of
thing and so the big thing this year was
this special edition PlayStation which
not only goes to that blue color that I
really like but to accent that in a
really cool way is having the four main
PlayStation button symbols in gold not
only large but with little ones kind of
flying around as well which I think
looks really beautiful now what all this
works on the system itself I think it's
pulled off really well actually on the
main controller itself where you still
have that same kind of shade of blue but
it's not the glossy look that's on the
top of the system but also on the
touchpad is a constant repeating pattern
of the four symbols in gold which is a
nice touch I'm not always a huge fan of
stuff being put on the touchpad but I
think this is one of the better executed
ideas they've done number four the last
one before we get to our top three is
the white xbox 1x now I can already hear
some of you guys it's a little weird I
know to put a simple white system this
high up on the listen we've had so many
cool crazy designs coming before it but
honestly I really think this is a
great-looking xbox and I think this is
the color double NX really should be I
understand the appeal of all black
systems I get why they did that for the
launch 1x but I think the white just
looks so much cleaner and works a lot
better what the 1x is aesthetic versus
what they did with the 1s a large part
of this is the change in how they've
approached to having the disk drive so
on the 1s is the disk drive was put in
the middle here where it kind of
interrupts the main body whereas on the
One X's they moved it to being in the
kind of little crease area between the
base bottom and the main part of the
unit system and so it hides that disc
tray and it allows this whole top part
of the system just be this singular
clean looking kind of monolith and it
works so well with just the plain white
and I've said this so many times before
and I'm sure somewhere in the Edit
Matt's going to include a joke about
this but I love the approach to having
two-tone jam I don't like having a
system that is all just one color I want
to have some contrast and the black and
white just does that so well kicking off
our top three is a 2d s that's right a
2d s this system might be slowly dying
off but it hasn't stopped Nintendo from
releasing new designs as the years have
gone by and this year you normally see
either cheap newer bundles and slightly
different colors or special editions
like this Hylian Shield one right here
and this looks so amazing and this is
exact
what I'm talking about when I talk about
how with the switch Nintendo knows how
to do better because we can see examples
of it right here
inspired by the iconic shield present in
a lot of the games in the series I think
this takes all the most important
elements and makes it something that
isn't too complex but still has a lot of
stuff going on I think the blue and
silver is a really good color contrast
but you still get that little hint of
gold on the Triforce and red for the
bird symbol and on the inside you're
still focusing on those main two colors
of blue and silver ish gray which is
just a really nice color contrast when
it comes to 2d s is a Nintendo has
really started out the game on special
editions even though it's kind of dying
off right now this is a very close
competitor for my number one paper
design they've done period because the
Polka ball one from last year is also
really amazing look I know this which is
the big hot thing right now but if you
still like a lot of the 2d s library or
you've never picked one up you should
really look into getting one of these
cuz it is a great looking system and
there's still a ton of awesome games out
for it by the way if you're looking for
a way to customize your own system or
maybe just change up the joy cons and a
special edition to which a great option
is the skin from today's sponsor D brand
they have a whole line of skins that are
completely safe to use on your switch on
the joy console and the dock and you get
a whole bunch of different colors
different designs for instance going
back to the Diablo suit you talked about
earlier if you just want to be able to
get some red joy cones or even orange
ones on that you just get the skins
themselves and apply them looks great if
you want more details check out the link
down below
coming in at second place our runner-up
for the best special edition of the year
and this was a really tough one for me
is the spider-man ps4 pro because this
really exemplifies a lot of the stuff
that I want to see when it comes to a
special edition system it runs such a
great balance between simplicity and
complexity having something that looks
cool but isn't all over the place first
off I really like the reliance I'm just
using two colors at first I kind of wish
there was maybe a little blue to kind of
have the full spider-man suit look work
but I really think just sticking with
the red and white was the right call to
make and just using the giant spider-man
logo from their version of the suit in
the game just looks so cool and
beautiful on it you know they don't have
to put the name spider-man on it they
don't have to add anything else to it
they just have the one main logo taking
over the whole top of the system and it
looks gorgeous I think also how they
approached using these colors on the
controller was a great call as well
where you've got the main controller
being read you should got some red
highlights on like these symbols for the
buttons
but then using white for not only the
buns but also the sticks you're still
keeping black for the touchpad but it
all works so well together it's such a
beautiful excellent design paired with
one of the best games to come out this
year honestly it was a really tough call
to leave this one being the runner-up
and the only reason why it isn't number
one this year is because this next
design is just such an insanely good one
that system the number one system to
come out this year is the 500 million
edition ps4 now this is admittedly kind
of a rough one to compare because well
this was made commercially available
something people could buy it wasn't a
giveaway it wasn't totally random luck
it was a hard system to get they are
very limited they only made 50,000 of
them worldwide and that's represented by
the fact that each of them has a little
number on the front telling you what
number you have now this is a system
meant to celebrate a major marketing
milestone for PlayStation it's not 500
million ps4 sold but it's 500 million
Playstations in general going all the
way back to the beginning and to help
celebrate that once again kind of like
what I was saying with the days of play
ps4 they lean on the color that I think
is really the more traditional
PlayStation 1 blue but instead of doing
a solid color they went for a much more
retro static something they did a lot
with the ps2 s and that's the
transparent design which is so beautiful
with this it's release really reminds me
how odd it is that we don't actually see
a lot of transparent consoles of anymore
because it's something that was done a
lot with older ones and yeah the inside
of those systems were kind of
cool-looking and there was stuff to see
there but as systems have gotten more
complex there's actually more cool stuff
to show off in the inside and more light
effects and things you can do that you
really see in the system and I love the
approach to of balancing out with this
very deep dark blue because it's not a
transparent thing that you can just see
super clearly through it just gives you
little hinting Zoar everything going on
on the inside now this color alone is a
beautiful choice but I think what it
really sells it all together is also the
approach of the kind of copper accenting
bronze that's going on on the logo over
the system the title in the front the
little number plate and it's also
present on the controller in a few
places as well like on the PlayStation
button I think that kind of just metal
color plays really well with the blue in
a beautiful way and they mix this up a
little bit on the controller itself the
main body still has that dark
transparent blue but then as an accent
of that they have a solid dark blue as
well that for the button sticks the grip
and then just a slightly lighter blue
that's used for these symbols on the
buttons again while this wasn't limited
to being any kind of giveaway or
separate sight thing that's super
limited from a consumer standpoint
something you can buy at a store this is
still something that really didn't make
all that many of and it was sold at a
premium price and it shows in the final
design this is easily the best system
that came out this year and honestly I
don't know if Playstations ever going to
this as far as special-edition ps4s go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
