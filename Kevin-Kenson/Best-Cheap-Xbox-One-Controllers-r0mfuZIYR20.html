about different Pro control options for
various systems but something we don't
talk about too much is the opposite end
the chief budget controllers the ones
that you see at the store and they
remind you that time you went to your
friends Timmy's house and you got the
extra spare GameCube controller from
madcap that had 4 extra buttons and a
stick that didn't quite work right but
really when you see one of those which
then is actually worth grabbing so let's
go over some of the best controllers you
can get on a budget for the Xbox one to
begin with let's take a look at this
power a xbox one controller the reason
why I want to start with this one in
particular is this to me is like the
quintessential thing that you
immediately imagine in your head when
you think of an off-brand controller all
the right buttons are here they're all
in the right general place but at the
same time there's something a bit off
you know the shape is mostly the same
but it's little pointy or in some parts
there's a little extra stylisation that
isn't necessarily both necessary and in
general while it still works perfectly
fine you can definitely tell that with
pushing the buttons and everything and
moving the sticks that it's just in
general a cheaper design this isn't
necessarily a bad thing I mean that's
part of the reason why you want to grab
one of these is it's more affordable and
it's completely functional controller
it's just not well great in general as I
said all the buttons work fine they feel
a little cheaper but none of them feel
like they're gonna get stuck or anything
the sticks are okay the only part of
this controller that really bothers me
is the d-pad it doesn't really have a
good rolling motion to it and it kind of
feels sometimes like if you were to say
push left at the same time you're still
also kind of pushing up or down
accidentally because the whole thing
just likes to shift at once second up we
have another controller from power a and
it's a little bit more of an interesting
option in the fusion controller now
what's interesting about this is that
it's very clearly a third-party after
market style controller I mean the
buttons once again or a little cheaper
the grips a little weird and it is
hardwired but at the same time
this one's trying to also be a pro
controller in some aspects so first
let's just talk about the cheap side of
it as well now just like with that other
one all the buttons are fine but they
definitely don't feel like they have the
best design going on one thing it
definitely has over the regular power a
controller however is that the d-pad is
much better actually a little clicking
this to each direction so it really
feels like you're hitting the direction
you want to instead of just being one
flat surface now as for what Pro can
element's this thing incorporates
there's actually quite a few it has a
braided cable it's got adjustable
trigger stop so you can do the regular
full pull or a short stop and it even
has programmable buttons where all you
have to do is hold this button right
here hit the button you want to program
and then hit the button you want to map
to it and on top of all that this thing
even has switchable sticks there's three
different designs you can do a concave a
convex and then a larger concave one as
well next up we're gonna get a little
weirder with a controller from hyper kit
now if you've never heard of hyper can
before there are another one of those
companies that focuses more on retro
themed products mostly making systems
that will play old-school cartridges but
they've also made some accessories as
well like this Xbox one controller that
is meant to be very reminiscent of an
SNES controller and I gotta say despite
its weird appearance it actually very
pleasantly surprised me in some ways and
actually is really good buttons for
being a third party controller and even
more so is the sticks I actually really
like the sticks on this controller the
most out of all the ones I tried for
this video the stick heads are
comfortable and the resistance feels
very close to actually using an official
Xbox one controller still not quite
there but very very close where this
controller loses me is the shoulders the
triggers on this thing are very awkward
it has this very heavy resistance pull
de then that almost makes it feel like
you're not actually successfully pulling
the trigger right and at the same time
the travel distance to the front
shoulders is very unnatural feeling if
you're the kind of person that likes to
play with all four fingers on the
shoulders which I know some people do
this actually works out ok but if you're
like me and you just go switch between
it's very very awkward now as for the
shape of it yes it's a little weird I
mean the SNES controller is cool it's
nice that's reminiscent of that but
there's reason we stopped using that
shape design it's just not very
comfortable at the same time though I
will say that in the case of buying a
wired controller for a younger gamer
this very much reminds me of something
that Horry did for the PlayStation 4
with a mini gamepad where the travel
distance isn't as battles controller
other than the triggers so for a younger
gamer this can actually be a solid
choice if you don't want to give them a
full price official Xbox one controller
and then we have PDP's Xbox one
controller which at first glance
something you can notice right away is
the fact that this controller is much
closer to the actual Xbox one controller
shape and design than
the others in fact that's one of the
biggest selling points of this one to me
is that when I'm holding it and using it
it feels the least different from all
the others it almost feels at times like
I am using my regular Xbox one
controller now like what the others you
do lose this feeling a little bit with
the buttons and the sticks it's not
quite as good as hi Perkins but it is
about on par if not a little better than
the ones on power A's I do like the
sticks on the d-pad it is solid
what makes this controller different
though is that there's just a couple
little subtle things about it that I
think makes it honestly the best
controller on this list
first off audio controls all of these
controllers have a little place to plug
in your headset but this is the only one
of them that offers onboard audio
controls on the controller itself all
you have to do is push and hold this
button right here next to the right
stick and then use the d-pad to do
different options like raising or
lowering the volume the other thing that
this controller has going for it is that
while it is a wired controller like all
the other ones on this list it is the
only one where you can actually unplug
the cable making it way easier to store
way easier to travel with and just in
general way less of a hassle and like I
said out of all the controllers this is
the one that is closest to emulating the
actual shape of an Xbox one giving it
the greatest comfort now at the end of
the day I do think you should just save
up your money and get an official Xbox
one controller but if you're on a budget
or you're looking to get something
cheaper for a kid to use or going like
that this is easily the best choice</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
