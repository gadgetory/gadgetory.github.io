the channel lately is talk about the
best accessories for a specific game in
mind and a big one I wanted to touch on
is fortnight which to be honest I'm not
actually that great at so instead we
want to reach out to someone who's
really an expert on the game and I can't
believe we actually got this
collaboration to happen this man needs
no introduction we're gonna go ahead and
cut to him right now
my name's ali-a I am addicted to
four-night I've got hundreds of wins in
the game and I love making videos on it
and there are certain accessories I need
to have whilst playing for tonight the
really benefit me as a player and I
cannot play without I'm gonna share with
you guys and let you know why I need to
use them and why they help me so much
so first off is the controller itself
this actual my own custom Ally a scuf
controller the scuff control is in
general are amazing mainly because the
paddles on the back of the controller
which allow you to remap any button on a
controller
to these back paddles the main benefit
being you don't have to take your thumbs
off the control stick to hit those
buttons which you normally have to do to
jump field or to cycle weapons or if it
can be done just a few presses of your
fingers on the back of the controller
and it's super super useful if you use
this controller loads because of how
worn down this left thumbstick is
without this controller I would
definitely not be quite as good as I am
on fortnight real quick I want to expand
on that because scuff controllers are an
excellent option if you don't mind doing
something custom order or they actually
gonna make it and send it to you if on
the other hand though you're the kind of
person where you just want to buy
something it works right at a box there
are some alternative options that are
gonna give you those same features and
functions for PlayStation and PC
personally I'm a big fan of the Razer
ride you like Ali was saying a really
important thing is having these macro
buttons on the back which this is going
to give you plus two up top
you're also getting onboard audio
controls and adjustable trigger stops
now if you're playing on the Xbox one
scuff is also once again great option if
you want out of out box option though
you can't go wrong with the Xbox one
elite controller you're getting those
back paddles changeable sticks all great
stuff
okay back to Ellie next up these bad
boys right here these are actually my
headphones that I use these headphones
for turtlebeach 800 X's they're fully
Wireless they're connected via a optical
cable so they get real
quality audio and it also have noise
cancellation as well meaning no external
noises are gonna put me off as I'm
playing for tonight now sound is so
important in fortnight because you need
to listen out for any footsteps chests
traps audio is so important for winning
gunfights knowing where enemies are and
looting up really effectively with these
headphones on and with this controller
in my hand it makes me almost
unstoppable in for tonight unfortunately
do still get some losses like everyone
but it certainly helped me get a lot
more wins so for you guys found is
useful and now know a few little secrets
behind the equipment that I use to get
my wins in four night awesome thank you
so much again la ever doing this
collaboration I still actually can't
believe that just happened if you guys
are interested any the stuff of the here
I talked about I'll have that link down
below in description and if there's any
loss that you guys want to hear insights
from for what gear they use for what
games let me know down below in the
comments and I will see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
