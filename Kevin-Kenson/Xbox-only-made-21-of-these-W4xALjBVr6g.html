today I got this box in the mail and I
didn't know what it was so I opened it
and there's kind of some crazy stuff in
here so okay so this is for crackdown 3
and it's a bouquet of rubber duckies
with Terry Cruz's fate oh and I pulled
them out no it has this no it's actually
signed by Terry Crews and it's been
confirmed on Twitter oh these are custom
Jordan ones based on crackdown 3
features the logo of the game on the
side it ship a little Xbox note up here
and number three on the back oh maybe we
shouldn't have that sound oh this is
definitely custom oh that is pretty oh
that's actually the same yeah this is
definitely best pearlbox never forgotten
so these are a custom pair of German
ones it actually looks like they took a
pair and did a redone kind of paint and
stitch job on it I really once again
loved the color combo that they used I
mean it is the colors from the game that
kind of white almost you know lightly
grayish look with black and the blue
trim the blue trim is really what ties
it all together for me and I think the
best part about it on the shoe is the
stitching I love seeing that light blue
stitching just running through all the
black it just makes this awesome clean
look I also really like the way they
incorporated a lot of the brand name
from crackdown 3 into the design of the
shoe they added new stitching on the
back and cisors have the logo along with
the number 3 cuz the third game and then
adding the Xbox logo to the tongue was a
really nice touch there's actually also
customization on the insole of the shoe
we had to take the stuffing out but I
can't actually pull it out because it's
glued in but inside of it is actually a
design that looks like the in-game map
of the world so that's that is an
insanely cool little detail
a sport the design will controller is
clearly based on the armor that
characters wear in game you can actually
make out this right here is like a chest
piece I think this is meant to be the
shoulders with the arrows that glow on
them and in the middle smack-dab we've
got the logo for crackdown maybe take a
closer look at the controller you'll
notice that on the white parts which are
just kind of more of an off-white
there's a little bit of gray oh maybe
almost a little bit of cream texture to
it there's actually a pattern going on
with it and I think it's supposed to be
this carbon fiber aesthetic it doesn't
look exactly the same obviously because
it's not made out of metal but for a
paint job it actually comes really close
looks really good leading up to that
whole armor look as for the Xbox 1x
itself this is actually the first one
we've got to take a look at on this
channel that has a special design on it
all of the retail available Xbox 1x is
so far I've just been different colors
like the white one or there's been some
slight patterns like the gold rush which
has that gold the black fade but this is
first of all with actual symbols stuff
on it so this one's clearly kind of
based more on the idea of a crosshair
with the main crackdown logo right dead
center like what the controller we're
working with lava seeing colors we have
black for the main body you have that
white part with the patterning but
something I really want to draw
attention to on the console is what they
did for the light blue because again I
love light blue LEDs and something
they've done that's a really great
attention to detail is that all the
light blue on here actually has this
light fade effect on the arrows you can
see it's a brighter almost white on the
edges and then it moves into a deeper
blue and on the center part it's more
focused white on the middle part and
that creates this kind of illusion like
it actually is LED lights even though
it's just paint but it looks really good
it just contrasts really well with the
black that surrounds it and where I
think this really shows the best is
actually on the front of the system
where it says the title crackdown 3 you
have that same kind of focused blue
light effect on the words and it just
really makes it pop on the front overall
this is a great looking system I think
so I think it really showcases is how
the 1x is really well designed for
special editions and a weight that the
1s and original Xbox one were not
because well those looked like great
systems when they had they're kind of
have great design that just worked for
the regular system it didn't really work
for special editions because limited the
space you could work with so for the
wedeck's where it's just one flat piece
they can work with that entire canvas
and this really shows that something
else to that I personally really
appreciate is that this design is made
for when it's laying flat a lot of
special editions are
designed for terra mode in mind which I
get tower mode is great for just showing
something off but most people myself
included we play with it flat and I
really appreciate that with this system
this is the latest Xbox one next to be
part of a special promotion it's
something that Microsoft has been really
heavy on the last couple years there's
always been a history of gaming consoles
that have been maybe tied into some kind
of special giveaway or some kind of
major promotion but it's just a small
handful ones there have been a lot of
special edition Xbox bonuses and 1x is
that honestly just look amazing I mean
there's way too many even start listing
but they've done them for games they
didn't do any kind of wide special
edition release for like cuphead or SIA
thieves which the CD was only released
in France is beautiful but also ones
tied into different movies like they did
a Star Wars Han Solo one they did one
for Black Panther it's just there are so
many different special edition designs
they've done that are gorgeous</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
