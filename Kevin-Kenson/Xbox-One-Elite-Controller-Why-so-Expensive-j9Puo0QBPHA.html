this year's e3 was the unveiling of the
new elite controller which is Christ at
150 bucks now some people were like oh
wow that's really cool a new controller
while other people are going holy 150
bucks for controller that's it for twice
the price of the regular Xbox one
controller why would you spend that much
well thankfully I did get the chance of
trying this out at the e3 show floor so
let's talk about what this one does
differently and whether or not it's
really worth dumping that much money now
to begin with here's some of the obvious
differences right away this one does
have a rubberized grip unlike the Xbox
one controller a lot of people are
saying that this makes it so that it's
not going to slip at your hands if
you're squeezing really tight but
honestly that doesn't really happen that
often with Xbox one controller unless
you have really really sweaty hands
what's more important is the fact that
when you're squeezing it it will give
just a little bit so when you're playing
for a long period of time it's going to
be more comfortable for your hands
the other big noticeable difference is
that if you look at the bottom of the
controller this one has a 3.5 millimeter
audio jack so you don't have to use just
the standard Xbox one chat headset or
one of those pro headsets that plugs
directly into the system this gives you
a few more options to use the headset
you'd like
now those two changes are nice but the
real big deal about this controller is
just how customizable it is most
noticeably the fact that it has a
modular design there's a lot of bits and
pieces that you can switch in and out
first off there are three different sets
of control sticks you can choose from
you've got the standard concave design
like you'd see on a regular Xbox one
controller there's another concave one
that's taller which is a little awkward
feeling to use at first but it does
offer a greater amount of precision with
movement so especially in games like FPS
is where you want to be very careful
about where you look and how quickly
that's a huge deal and third off there
is a dome-shaped head which is very
reminiscent of a ps3 or ps2 controller
now there are a lot of debates out which
of these is actually better to use some
will say that concave design gives you a
better grip other people say that you
have more precise control with a dome
top in the end for me at least it really
just comes down to personal preference
which this does give the option of using
that one or concave or once again that
taller one now along with those
different joysticks you can also switch
out one of two different d-pads now one
of them just looks like the standard
Xbox one controller one which personally
I've never been a huge fan of it does
offer precise control if you just want
to press up down left or right which
really only comes up mostly in fps or
some tactical games
the other option they've added though is
a faceted design which emulates a
directional input which is a lot more
use
and way more comfortable in situations
like let's say for fighting games
because rolling it's a lot more
comfortable this was actually my
favorite changes controller when I was
trying it out I absolutely loved the
feel of that design compared to the
regular plus symbol
now those just the changes you'll see on
the front on the back side you'll notice
there are also four slots you can add
these little back paddle things these
are meant to give you additional control
options the main idea being that it
gives you a way to press buttons without
having to resort to your thumbs for
instance let's say there's a game you're
playing where you have to keep your
thumb on the right stick for some reason
but then something comes up where you
need to hit the a button well instead of
having to quickly move your thumb over
press a then go back to the stick you
can keep your thumb on the stick and
then press one of those back paddles
which you've mapped to the same thing as
the a button so it's a really useful way
of having a shortcut in alternate ways
of controlling your favorite games now
in addition to all the modular pieces
there are some other ways you can
customize this controller right on it if
you look at the back side you'll notice
these little switches which allow you to
change the triggers from either standard
mode or hair-trigger mode in
hair-trigger mode it's going to stop the
trigger from going down at about the
halfway point which is where actually
the button is actually already being
pressed it's just letting you know so
it's a lot easier to rapid-fire pull a
trigger as opposed to just having it in
standard mode and repeatedly hitting it
thinking you're timing it just right
there's also a switch on the front side
which allows you to switch between two
different pre-designed profiles which
you can customize in the downloadable
app now this software is really where
the controller gets even more
ridiculously customizable one of the
first things is that you can remap all
the buttons if you want to switch a and
B you can do that if you want to have
the left trigger and right trigger
switch you can do that if you want to
have clicking down on the right stick be
the same thing as pressing Y you can do
that and you can save to different
profiles immediately on the controller
like I said you can switch between so
let's say you're playing a first-person
shooter like Star Wars Battlefront well
you can have profile 1 for that but then
you want to switch over to say Killer
Instinct a fighting game you can switch
into mode 2 where the controls are
designed for that along with remapping
buttons the software is going to offer a
few other little things you can change
for instance you can adjust the
sensitivity on sticks when you're moving
them and you can just how powerful the
haptic feedback is in each corner of the
controller so those are the features
that it says it adds but as far as how
it goes into actual hands-on experience
I gotta say I really like the controller
I think the faceted d-pad is a great
design I like the hair triggers one of
the things I think they did a great job
though was him
a perfect balance when it came to how
easy it is to remove all the different
modular pieces you know there are some
gaming accessories where there's
something that you can remove but it
always feels like you're going to break
it or snap it off if you're being not
careful enough with these ones they
always snapped off with just enough
force so it always felt not too hard to
do but it also didn't come off too
easily so when you're using it there's
never that fear that something's going
to pop out when it's not supposed to now
that being said I do think the asking
price of $150 is still a little
ridiculous you know like I said earlier
that's over twice the price of a
standard controller that's almost half
the price of the whole system which
includes a controller and if you compare
it to third-party pro controllers those
not only go for about 8090 maybe a
hundred bucks so 150 is definitely up
there you know I think for having the
ability to say is a first party brand
controller 120 would have been fine
that's twice the price controller
totally worth paying for the
customization but 150 just feels a
little bit too steep so it really comes
down to what you think it's personally
worth to get this much customization
really useful but really really pricey
so those are my thoughts on the new Xbox
one elite controller it's going to be
available in October at an MSRP of $150
like I said they will work on not only
Xbox one but also on PCs that are
running Windows 10 now as always if you
