thing I had two thoughts I thought this
is like a cool idea but something that
practically is a really bad idea
I don't actually have a lot of really
clear memories of being at like
full-blown arcades as a kid what I do
remember is being at places that would
just have that solitary cabinet by the
entrance arcades or something I did
later a lot what I got because my
college had that arcade on campus and
there are a few local arcades that are
really popular that's when I really
started doing more like the actual
full-blown arcade scene we're really
when I got into like being more serious
with fighting games before we actually
constructed it we did the painting first
because we decided we wanted to do a
little bit more of unique design beyond
what the stock parts would let you do we
really wanted something very colorful
and very switch themed so we went for we
still actually had spray paint left from
a previous project where we did an Ikea
desk in switch colors so we still had
that red and blue on hand so we started
by painting all the pieces we kind of
roughly sketched out which sides we
wanted to be which color and we would
hope that it would come together looking
good like it did in our heads and
thankfully it did and then as for the
actual construction it was pretty
straightforward and easy all the
instructions are very clear about like
what latches into what and having worked
with the no lab oh stuff before it's
basically exactly that it's all
cardboard so it's mostly just folding
tabs in making sure that the right shape
and then locking it all together so it
was pretty straight forward the only
part that was a little difficult was
because of the paint we used it maybe
got a little bit too thick on some parts
and it didn't cause any visual problems
but it did certainly weaken the
cardboard a tiny bit so there's a couple
tabs where I had to be really careful
shoving one thing into another thing
because then it would just easily
collapse and not go together well
there's really only one part that ended
up getting messed up but it's not very
visible in the final product which I'm
really thankful for if you look for it
you can find it I can point it out but I
don't want to do that so you'll never
know where it is
right here it didn't take me very long
to put the whole thing together I mean I
didn't time myself but probably only 30
minutes I think they bring it over here
bring it over here she bought me quick
and mixing up the different products to
show filings and then my liquor bottle
in general like to make a gender
generalize the women that I'm sitting at
Google spit on my galaxy in the morning
but I like if y'all like what I like to
my night is finite blur we get this
started up cool you got curved pain
let's cure your friends so again we
really wanted to have like a theme for
the cabinet we didn't just want to build
it to have it be this plain cardboard
looking thing like came with little
stickers to customize stuff and that was
kind of neat but we wanted to go a
little more all-out than that so we did
the paint job and wanted that to be
switch colors but then we also wanted to
go with a Super Smash Brothers vibe so
we ordered a lot of decals that were
just plain simple white ones we've done
this before a lot of you designed for
like car windshields they're really easy
to apply so we got a couple different
sizes we didn't really measure anything
out we just ordered a bunch and would
make do a lot of them actually weren't
just decal designs but it was also a
ways for people to make their own
unofficial smash talk like it took the
designs from the collectors edition
smash stock and then just made it
something you could apply to a regular
doc but in our case we cut them out and
put them in different places of the
arcade cabinet so it took a little care
to cut them the right way to not look
terrible and if it's you know really
up-close looks you can definitely see
some uneven cuts and like not the most
precision we've ever done but it
actually looks really good from afar I I
was surprised I was honestly a little
worried in the midpoint how some of it
was gonna translate but it ended working
out really well
what about the arcade experience is that
it does two things differently I think
from normally playing a game multiplayer
I mean growing up you still had like you
know couch co-op where you'd have couch
versus I guess in this case where you
know I would play a lot of Street
Fighter 2 and play against friends on
Super Nintendo that kind of thing but
doing it an arcade did two major things
one it increased the size of who you're
actually fighting against it's not just
like you and your friend which might
happen but you know you'd have
situations where you're lining up and
there's all these people people you've
never met before people maybe just kind
of knew a little bit that are all trying
to play the same game and to it added a
stake like it was at a small stake it
was just a quarter or whatever maybe 50
cents but now you had something that you
were investing and possibly losing well
you lost it no matter what but it's how
many you're losing you know depending on
if you win or not so it created this
whole kind of fun sense of community
that you wouldn't get just playing games
in the house and you'd meet people that
way you play matches and you would have
no idea who this person is you're up
against but if you're playing at the
same arcade often enough and you run
into this person again and again you
kind of get this weird almost friendship
like eventually you start talking about
random stuff or you just talk about like
you know oh like that was a cool thing
you learned how to do they're like you
shoulda do that that kind of you know
there's just a it builds a rapport with
people it was a way to kind of ice break
conversations that you normally wouldn't
do and it was really it was really fun
since the community that just opened out
smash has always had a really special
place in my heart too because that's
something that came out right when I was
like really starting to get games on my
own I mean the n64 was the first console
that was mine I was really into like the
original smash when I was a little
little kid I even have vague memories of
I not only played it a lot with friends
but I even remember I mean you know
because I was once again like a little
little kid so your imaginations at like
5,000 percent of the time you're just
making stuff up so everywhere even me
making like little stories and just
playing out fights against the cpu that
played into the stories like whatever
I'm playing as Fox and I pick this enemy
and I've whatever the plot is for this
episode I win move on to the next match
it's just dumb stuff ideas a kid that I
did a lot was mash
yep being something that's just made
entirely at a cardboard it does the it
accomplishes its concepts really well
giving you a way of taking the switch as
it is and turning it into a little
arcade setup yeah there's a couple of
really cool ideas in there the cardboard
is strong enough to hold everything in
place they give you a little way to
shove the switch in and then a smart
little idea was they added a hole on the
other side which at first I wasn't sure
what that was for and then I realized oh
it's so when you take the switch at
you've a place to just kind of shove
another finger in because you have to
lift it a little bit otherwise it would
just slide out all the time and then
another cool thing that I thought was a
nice added touch was the slots for the
joy columns you don't just put the joy
Kon in instead there's like an actual
plastic shell that you put the Drakon
into that show make sure that it fits in
the slot really well and it adds those
extra buttons so you still have access
to the Eldar buttons on the joy con so
yeah overall as far as just
accomplishing this concept of making a
little functional arcade cabinet it does
the job well I still wouldn't recommend
actually playing on it a lot but for
accomplishing the look and like at least
making it something you can try to play
on yeah I think the main draw of
something like this isn't because you
want to build a functional thing it's
because it's a conversational piece it's
something where you put it together and
you're like hey guys like you know
normally when we're playing smash we're
gonna put on the big-screen TV we're
gonna use pro controllers whatever but
if you just want to be like look I made
a little arcade thing like it's fun and
especially I think something where the
switch fits really well for this I mean
first off just the entire modular design
of it I always talk a bunch about how
it's just cool how the switch can adapt
all these different ideas but the
digital library in the switch has a lot
of arcade titles and so being able to
play those in like a little mini form
there's a it's a gimmick it's a fun
gimmick ultimately you know one of the
things I think the circadian complices
is just another great example of how the
switch can do a lot of different things
like I still think Nintendo hasn't fully
realized what they've made like they've
experimented a little bit with it with
the lavvo and making some of the
different joy con accessories but this
entire concept of a portable screen that
can hook up to a dock with controllers
that has hash to the sides or separate
that can be played together they can be
played on their own there's so many
options with how these things work
that you could put them together in
insanely cool ways and this isn't just
another great example of how to do that
you take this thing that can just be a
handheld but now it's a little arcade
cabinet I've had enough of this not</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
