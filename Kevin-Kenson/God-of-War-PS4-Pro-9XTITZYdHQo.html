able to get our hands on the
limited-edition Leviathan gray ps4 pro
and you know I've been really excited
for this game so I wanted to make sure
this unboxing was done right so we got
ahold of a Viking axe let's get to it
we are more than that
now to be honest with you guys what I
very first saw as council revealed I
didn't actually see the trailer where
they kind of explained the concept or
anything I just saw still image and I
wasn't sure it seemed like it was just a
kind of a bunch of stuff thrown on a
console and didn't have much meaning but
then when they showed the idea that it's
supposed to be the axe from the game and
it's recreated right here I was like
okay I can buy that a little more and
now that I see it in person I actually
really like the design of this system
there's a lot of stuff here that I don't
think necessarily gets translated the
best in a picture when you actually see
it in person it just comes across so
much stronger one thing that really
stands out right away is the fact that
often times I feel like Sony tends to
almost over abused gloss finishes on
some of their systems and this one stood
ops for using a mixture where you have
gloss in the segments that aren't really
the axe
whereas the axe is this matte just
slightly shiny kind of finished with
this dark silver almost steel kind of
design which looks really good
especially with the accents of gold to
here and there so the axe design at the
top I think works pretty well now as for
the front of the system we've got two
different things going on first there's
this kind of gold weaving going on in
the middle which honestly I'm not really
a huge fan of but below that we've got
these eight rooms now if these symbols
don't look familiar to you they're
actually etched into the main logo for
this game which is on the shirt I'm
wearing right now it's these eight guys
right here and these aren't rooms now
ruins can have just their own kind of
letter meanings but these don't actually
spell anything out when you line them up
instead you have to go by what actually
the symbols can represent for instance
this symbol that can be the M letter M
also means man overall excellent design
that I end up living way more in person
than I thought I was going to cuz yeah
at first glance if you don't really know
what's going into this guy it's a little
bit much but once the themes come across
really cool now as for the controller
this is something at I have kind of
little more mixed feelings on because
first off I love silver and I think the
dark gray that contrasts it works really
well together
I'm also a big fan of this approach that
Sony's been doing with a lot of their
special edition controllers where they
just use one little kind of subtle
symbol on the right grip which i think
is a nice touch then where they lose me
you don't really need to put the game
right here I think this is a great
choice I think color options great I
didn't
know the name of the game I know what
this is celebrating and so sours a
little bit but overall really cool
looking controller so overall this idea
of incorporating the axes design the
system I think is really cool it might
seem a little bit much to someone who's
not really a fan or just know what's
going on but I actually really like that
idea the fact that you know a true fan
is I don't know what's going on with the
designs are gonna appreciate the design
choices instead of having a system where
they're just gonna plaster the word god
of war all over it here and there I
think works out really well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
