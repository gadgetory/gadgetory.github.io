old-school edge for your favorite
gameboy games from childhood but you
don't want to actually scratch ground
for an old actual Gameboy maybe just use
it on your phone well that's the idea
behind the smart boy from hyper kid a
product that was originally teased a
week ago as an April Fool's joke but was
quickly revealed the following day on
reddit to actually be a marketing ploy I
need to see whether or not people are
actually interested in buying the
product now to be perfectly honest with
you when this thing first popped up in
my feed I didn't even give it a second
glance but then shortly later Jon from
TLD as well as my brother Josh brought
it to my attention basically saying hey
have you seen this thing called the
smart boy it looks really cool and then
I proceeded to tell them why at least me
personally I wasn't very excited and
mostly comes down to the fact that
there's just a whole lot of problems
that can keep this thing from succeeding
the first which is Nintendo now the
reason why Nintendo can be a problem for
the smart boy isn't because of the tech
because the Gameboy is old enough now to
where you can actually remake the
hardware and make devices that play
gameboy games the issue though is
trademarking the fact that it's called
the smart boy which is clearly imitating
the name game boy and that it looks just
like an old-school Gameboy that's been
cut in half it doesn't matter if it's a
fully functional device or not that goes
with your phone it still imitates the
look of a gameboy and Nintendo is a
company that isn't really a fan of
people making knockoffs of their stuff
so this is exactly the kind of thing
that they can get riled up about and
send lawyers after it's exactly for this
reason that we lead to my second problem
the fact that you have to actually use
the old-school cartridges now if you've
read into what the smart boy is this
might sound like kind of a dumb argument
because that's the entire idea behind it
you can hook your phone up to it and
then plug in a cartridge and play your
old-school favorite games but I don't
think a lot of people have that response
when they first look at least the
mock-ups for what the system is they see
it where you can put your phone in this
device and it acts like a game way which
you know your phone is a hard drive it
can play games directly from it so a lot
of people I think have this
misconception where it's going to come
with prepackaged Nintendo games or have
an in-app store we can download stuff
which isn't the case because if they did
do that that would definitely be
infringing on Nintendo and would cause
whole kinds of problems so instead you
have to use old-school parches which is
quite the extra step if all you were
looking for was a simple device to use
your phone to play old-school game
and that leads us to another big problem
the fact that well actual game boys
still exist if you're going to take the
time to hunt down old-school game boy
cartridges why wouldn't you just go the
extra mile and get an actual game boy I
mean you can go on Amazon right now and
look up a Gameboy Advance SP and get one
in good condition for about 40 or 50
bucks now given if you wanted to go even
more retro and get a Gameboy pocket or
even the original brick that's gonna
cost you quite a little bit more
especially for good condition but if you
just want to play your favorite
old-school games 50 bucks is a pretty
fair price and unless the smart boy
something a lot cheaper than that I
don't see how it offers itself as a good
alternative which leads to my fourth
problem the novelty of the thing the
fact of the matter is that for me at
least this thing just comes across way
more as a novelty gift item rather than
something that's actually functional you
know it's the kind of thing that you buy
to shop to your friends for two or three
weeks but then you leave it in a drawer
and forget about it you know compared to
getting an actual Gameboy that's a piece
of history that's something that you're
gonna want to show off to people and
take good care of and hold on to for a
while because it's the real deal with
this though you're just gonna buy it use
it a few times but then the novelty is
gonna wear thin and just gonna end up
forgetting about it and that's what
leads to really my final big issue that
I really don't know who the target
audience is for this thing if you're an
old-school gamer you're more likely
going to be down to get the actual real
deal original Gameboy then buy some kind
of product that's just gonna let you
emulate the cartridges whereas if you
just want to buy it as a cool little
accessory for your phone to play some of
your old favorites well it's going to
ask you to do a little more than that
because you're still going to have to
hunt down old cartridges now if you have
a couple still sitting in your attic
awesome but otherwise that's going to
end up costing you a lot more money than
you thought you were going to pay at
first which once again comes back down
to price point now to be fair there are
some upsides about the smart boy that I
do recognize you know I really
appreciate the fact that it's a legal
way to play your favorite old cartridges
but still get the benefits of emulation
you know you can have save states and
load states you can save and load any
part of the game and it also gets around
the fact that the save batteries have
died in a lot of old-school cartridges
and it has an online database to access
different cheat codes almost like you
have a game genie built in all the time
but part of the problem is there's stuff
a lot about this product we still don't
know yet you know outside of a mock-up
image the basic premise and a few
really vague answers that the devs gave
on reddit with some more information a
lot of my points could end up getting
addressed especially where the MSRP is
concerned because if it's less than 50
bucks I could actually see some of the
merit and grabbing it but if it's
anything more than that and I really
think it's going to be then I just don't
see the point grabbing one over an
actual Gameboy now you might think
differently from me you know you might
see this and think wow that's a kick-ass
item and I can't wait to grab one ASAP
and if that's the case let me know down
in the comments while you're at it if
you enjoyed the video let me know by
thing that thumbs up button and
subscribing if you haven't yet I've got
more content planted on the way for you
guys but until then I'm Kevin Kenton and
I'll see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
