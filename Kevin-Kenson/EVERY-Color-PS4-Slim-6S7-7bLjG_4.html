released officially by Sony so I think
now is about the time that we take a
look at each one of them and I'm going
to rank my favorite one aesthetically
from worst to best
taking things off at the bottom is the
original all-black ps4 slim now this was
first released in September late last
year coming with a 500 GB hard drive
although ever since April of this year
they now include one terabyte and I got
to say when it first came out not a huge
fan of the redesign I actually like the
original ps4 more but as I've spent more
time with these systems and I've had
them around is a grown on me a lot in
that situations actually flipped that
being said this original design still my
least favorite out of all the ones
they've done because honestly I find the
all-black design to be kind of boring I
mean I guess that's sort of the main
color Sony uses for a lot of systems
it's been the default color of every one
of them since the ps2 it's just not
interesting at all you know I like the
fact that they went with all matte this
time it didn't really use any gloss
outside of on the logo here which really
makes it pop out but otherwise it's just
really simple and plain coming in at
number four is the special edition Final
Fantasy 15 ps4 slim now as the name
implies this was released alongside a 15
during November and is currently the
only actual game tied special edition
system right now until the end of this
month when the Dragon Quest 1 comes out
in Japan only now I'm a little
conflicted on the system because I
really want to like it you know I'm a
huge fan of Final Fantasy I think
there's a lot of great ideas going on
with this system but there's just a few
things holding it back for me you know I
love the moon design I like the 15 in
the middle with the gold itching I don't
know why they felt the need to list
character names underneath it like a
cast and crew notes or something it just
seems really out of place to me and well
I like the moon in concept I don't like
the approach of doing this ultra lean
gloss and matte finish kind of thing
because well it does look kind of cool
it now adds a gloss feature to the
system which I don't like because it now
is a fingerprint magnet it would have
much cooler my opinion if they did
something like a matte black design with
an etched in golden or silver moon or
just something that maybe added a little
more color to it instead of being this
all black design also since everything
cool about it is on the top you
basically have to have it in tower mode
all the time to actually show off this
unique system you have next up is the
gold ps4 slim now this particular model
came out in the US during e3 as part of
Playstations days of play promotion work
came out at a temporary lower price
point of 250 bucks and included a one
terabyte hard drive later on it made its
way to Europe but that version only has
a 500 gig hard drive but does include
two controllers now before you even get
into what I think of the gold color
itself I can give you a very very simple
reason why I like this one and all the
other ones on this list more than the
first two and that's to tone the fact
that there's this little black line in
the middle with gold for the rest of the
system I don't hate the black color of
the other two systems I hate the fact
that it was one single color throughout
the fact that this one actually gives
you a little bit more form and design by
using two different colors that kind of
contrast each other just makes it look
so much better now as for the gold
itself for our runner up we have the art
is an Arctic our glacier white you kept
saying Arctic and now I'm like half
convinced it is yeah Berenstein the new
Berenstein you're from the universe
where was barren anyway so we still
rolling we're still rolling it is
glacier white okay originally released
as an exclusive system in Europe but it
did make its way over to Japan as well
as the US and the US release was
actually very very quiet its action
exclusive to Walmart that comes in a
bundle with called GUI infinite warfare
that's the only way to grab the systems
if you want one that's your only option
in the u.s. at least and I definitely
like this one a lot more than the gold
you still have that kind of contrast
look with the black line in the middle
but I think the white works a lot better
with it then the gold does it's not this
overly gaudy system it's just this nice
cool-looking white with the black
contrast now I do have one kind of weird
nitpicky thing about the system I know
it's very very minor but it does bother
me and that's the fact the PlayStation
logo is just a bit more subdued than the
other systems all the other ones have
either a very gloss or a even full-blown
chrome design that makes it pop out a
lot whereas with this one I think it's
part of the kind of the glacier design
they went instead with this frosted look
which is reflective but not nearly as
most of the others so it kind of just
blends in with the rest of the system a
lot more and doesn't pop the way that I
would like it to and this leaves at our
number one top spot this silver ps4 slim
now just like with the gold system this
one made its way to Europe coming with
two controllers and if I
or gig hard drive but unlike the bold
one this one did not feel released in
the US before or even after if you're in
the u.s. you want one of these currently
your only option is to import now I'm
going to be honest part of the reason
why this one is ranked number one for me
is that I have a huge bias for silver
systems I love the look of the silver
GameCube well though they called that
one platinum I like the look at the
silver ps2 and there's just not a lot of
consoles that have been released in this
color scheme and I think the ps4 slim is
an excellent fit for it
just like what the white system I think
the black trim gives it a nice just
balanced look but unlike the white one
you're getting this nice popping
PlayStation logo using a chrome finish
and just like with the gold while it is
a little reflective I don't think it's
nearly as gaudy or flashy it's just this
nice balance of all these factors that I
think make it look like an amazing
system that's my favorite one let me
know down below in the comments what you
guys think what's your favorite system
rank all five of them whatever let me
know that we'll see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
