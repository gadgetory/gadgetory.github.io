love of retro gaming and when it comes
to Nintendo the only real solutions
they've given us for ways to do it in
the modern day is a couple of
downloadable titles in their main
systems and these guys the classic
editions a way to play a whopping 30 or
21 of your favorite games on one little
unit but how could they do this even
better
don't get me wrong I love the classic
editions I think they're a great way to
experience some old classic games
especially introducing them to a new
generation but the idea in and of itself
is much more of a novelty than a true
celebration of retro gaming I mean the
very idea is just to take the biggest
hits put them on a little tiny console
with equally tiny cables for the
controllers for some reason and then
have people play just these big hit
games they've heard about before but it
doesn't open up the true expansive
library of these consoles and this
brings us to the super analogue NT a
system that allows you to play your SNES
or even Super Famicom games on a modern
day TV in 1080p now if you haven't heard
of analog before this is actually their
second system what kind of third they've
made another system called the analogue
NT and the analogue NT mini which is
actually this system right here and the
thing is while it was a cool way to play
in ass games it was a bit much in
multiple senses of the words I mean to
begin with the system ran for 450
dollars and the reason for that is
because it uses an aluminium shell and
that only supported playing games on a
HDMI but it also supported RGB as video
AV all these different options of stuff
that honestly Thea they aren't entirely
necessary when your main goal is to just
play a classic system on a current TV so
it was a neat idea but something that
was just a bit much even from an
enthusiast ants and that's something
they've changed with the super now of
course the obvious difference between
these super analog in the original is
the fact that this is designed for as
Gnaeus games or as the original was for
NES but there's a lot of differences in
the design logic that went into the
system that make it much more affordable
and honestly in my opinion 10 times
better than the
first off there's just what they're
built out of I mean the original one is
this aluminum case which is kind of cool
but way over the top it makes the system
bulky and heavy the super on the other
hand uses a more traditional plastic it
still has a little weight behind it cuz
the insides it actually feels like the
perfect amount and just looks much more
like an actual gaming system rather than
this monolith we have right here a nice
little touch - is that actually has this
nonstick surface on the bottom so it's
gonna stay nice and steady wherever you
set it up another huge change is when we
look at the back of the system when we
talk about the ports the original analog
like I said earlier supported all kinds
of stuff RGB s-video AV whereas the
super analog chooses to focus just on
HDMI which yes is technically a downside
we're losing more options but honestly
the main point of the system is to hook
it up to a modern TV so this is
obviously to focus on just that and
makes the system way more affordable
there's some other changes to to how
they handle the hardware inside of the
system the important thing is this is
able to play your SNES games and instead
of costing you for in 50 bucks like this
guy it's only running for 190 under half
the amount what's great about this thing
though is that despite the fact that
it's under half the press the analog it
still maintains the same core experience
which is the most important part of the
system and lets you play Super Nintendo
or Super Famicom games on a modern TV at
1080p resolution and gives you a whole
bunch of options for how to customize to
get the best image possible what's
really nice too is that they actually
give you an easy option where you can do
things like just modify the resolution
how large the picture is and then maybe
add some fake scan lines or if you want
you can enter advanced mode where things
get a lot more nitty-gritty for those of
you that want to fine-tune the image and
does all this while still letting use
your favorite old-school SNES
controllers or you can even buy a
wireless Bluetooth adapters to let you
use a wireless SNES controller instead
and in fact they actually made a whole
line of them that are paired with these
systems which by the way I may not have
mentioned that this plastic design now
comes in four different options this is
the classic inspired by the SNES but
they make all kinds of other ones too
based on the Famicom a pure blackout
design or even just a clear one so look
I think it's pretty obvious that I'm a
big fan of what the super analogue NT
does I think this is a really cool piece
of tech
but at the end of the day this is $190
system not including the controller that
lets you play games from 1991
so clearly the main goal here is
something for enthusiasts to enjoy and
it's not for everyone so you just have
to think what is the happy medium
between this and what Nintendo is doing
with the classic editions imagine if we
had a system that was something the size
of the super analog inti still allows
you to play old-school games in 1080p on
a modern TV but dropped all the focus on
fine-tuning and things for the
enthusiast and said focusing on
something friendly to the average user
and combined that with a digital
storefront something that allows you to
play games digitally like on the classic
editions but instead of limiting you to
just 20 or 30 games it's something that
you can expand over time purchasing
stuff and if Nintendo doesn't have the
rights to a game anymore and can't sell
it that way well no big deal find the
cartridge and play it I mean it's just
the perfect happy midpoint and something
that I just why is it Nintendo doing
this he said it</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
