Xbox one
it's slimmer has a few new functions and
is ever so slightly more powerful but
how does it stack up against the ps4 if
you've been waiting to grab one of these
consoles you've got some new questions
that need answers so let's break down
what they each have to offer and which
ones right for you first off let's talk
price the new Xbox one test runs between
three and four hundred dollars depending
on what hard drive size you get ranging
from 500 gigabytes to 2 terabytes while
the ps4 comes in a 500 gigabyte model
that runs for 350 with there being a
little variety based on game bundles now
before we get into the nitty-gritty
let's just look at the system's the
original Xbox one was massive compared
to the ps4 but the S has gotten things a
lot closer the ps4 is still a little
shorter and a good bit less wide but the
1s is a bit less deep both systems can
also be set up in a tower mode if you
buy a separate stand though some Xbox 1s
bundles come with one for factor wise
they're pretty much the same the ps4
having a small advantage in that it has
two front-facing USB ports as opposed to
the single one on the Xbox one which
really only matters if you want to play
with multiple USB plug-in controllers
like a pair of fightsticks but even then
it's just a matter of convenience moving
over to the controllers both are really
comfortable though the Xbox one is a bit
more so especially with the new redesign
that has a textured grip and built-in
Bluetooth a feature ps4 has had since
launch one big advantage the ps4
continues to have though is that it's
controllers are rechargeable whereas the
Xbox one is going to have you throw down
25 bucks for a plain charge kit because
for some reason the controller still
uses double-a batteries
don't family enjoys it next let's talk
UI visually I love the ps4's interface
more it's simple and clean and has
remained pretty much the same since
launch the only thing that really
bothers me about it is all of your apps
are organized by what you've most
recently played which is really annoying
that you can't actually customize them
but this is something that Sony has said
they will address in the next major
patch which will allow you to create
your own folders and in comparison this
sense of customization is something
where the Xbox one really shines as soon
as you start up your system your most
recent game is immediately highlighted
in a single move to the right you can
check out your full list of installed
games and apps and if you scroll down
you can go to a personally crafted set
of favorites the ones UI also emphasizes
community a lot more with an entire page
dedicated to what your friends have been
playing recent achievements and showing
any clips of gameplay they've uploaded
while both systems have voice controls
the Xbox one offers Cortana which has a
much greater variety of commands
compared to ps4 so if talking to your
system to make it do stuff gets your
jollies up
that's something the Xbox one is going
to do better this all comes with one big
downside though in that the Xbox one's
UI also doubles as a freaking billboard
where every page is cluttered with ads
for recent releases ongoing sales and
all kinds of other stuff that you just
don't need on a home screen now let's
talk media the ps4 covers all the common
and most popular apps like Netflix Hulu
YouTube HBO GO etc but the Xbox one
covers all of those and ridiculous
number more for more niche tastes the
real big recent win for the Xbox one
though is that the 1s supports 4k video
and HDR for greater color range which
the ps4 does not another situational
benefit for the Xbox one is if you're
using cable or satellite for TV the Xbox
one has an integrated IR blaster and an
HDMI IN port so you can combine it with
your top box for an all-in-one user
experience ps4 on the other hand offers
its own cable competitor in the form of
the PlayStation boo app a monthly sub
service that's a package of some of the
more popular TV channels as for music
Xbox one has Pandora as well as groove
which will allow you to stream stuff
directly for a monthly fee or load up
stuff from your Microsoft onedrive
while the ps4 can play music from a
media server USB Drive or directly
through
Spotify if you have an account so with
all that out of the way let's talk about
the main reasons why you're actually
looking at one of these systems the
games over the last three years there's
been a bunch of great releases a lot of
which are on both systems and it's worth
pointing out that some of those games
run at a lower native resolution or even
lower frame rate on Xbox one compared to
ps4 though there are a few exceptions
where the Xbox one comes out ahead on
the flip side though the new Xbox 1s
supports 4k upscaling and HDR in some
select games a big advantage for those
of you that own 4k TVs more importantly
though is of course exclusives both
systems have quite a few of them now so
let's take a look so as you can see lots
of good games on both but the Xbox one
side does have a habit of being on PC as
well which is going to now be the case
for all upcoming Xbox one games so if
you've got a powerful gaming rig and
you're really just looking at a console
for the exclusives the ps4 has an edge
now as far as exclusives coming out this
year goes on Xbox one we've got cuphead
recore Gears of War 4 and Forza horizon
3 all coming out around the holiday
season while the ps4 is sitting a little
bit thinner with King of Fighters 14 and
just another week and later in the year
we'll have Gran Turismo sport and the
long-awaited
Last Guardian so let's look at what
other gaming related features these two
systems have both systems allow you to
stream to twitch and both systems have
built-in ways for you to record and edit
short bits of gameplay as well as take
screenshots one of the biggest strengths
the Xbox one has over the ps4 is that
it's backwards compatible with select
360 games the list of which is still
growing ps4 doesn't have this option but
does have its PlayStation now service
which allows you to stream play over the
Internet some of the best games from the
ps3 which you can either buy
individually or have bulk access to
through a monthly subscription now
speaking of subscriptions both systems
are going to require you to pay a
monthly fee if you want to play online
multi
they're games with PlayStation Plus
being just a little cheaper both subs
also come with free games every month a
nice little bonus for Xbox is that all
the free 360 games you get our permanent
while Xbox one games and all the games
you get with PlayStation Plus are only
available to you as long as you're
paying both systems also give you a way
to stream games to another device Xbox
one allows you to stream games to a
Windows 10 PC letting you play your
games at different rooms so that having
to move your set up while the ps4 has a
remote play which will allow you to play
games through a PC as well or their
handheld system the Vita which depending
on the game can either be an awesome
experience or utterly painful so with
all that being said which system should
you buy
honestly it's up to you the most
important questions you need to ask
yourself are which exclusives actually
appeal to you and which systems your
friends have so you can make sure to
play together or you could just be
patient and wait one more year for the
next upgrades to both systems the
PlayStation neo and Project Scorpio or
build a PC</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
