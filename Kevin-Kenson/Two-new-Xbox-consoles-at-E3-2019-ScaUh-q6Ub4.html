getting longer and longer
over the years and based on the past few,
the kind of normalish run
time is somewhere between
an hour and an hour and
a half, but this year
it sounds like Microsoft might be running
potentially as long as a full two hours.
And there is a lot of stuff
you can cover in that time.
I think there is three main general areas
they're going to focus on.
First off is hardware and
I think it's something
that a lot of people are looking for
out of Microsoft's press
conference this year.
There's been a lot of talk
about different projects
in development and if we
are likely seeing a system
some time next year, now would be the time
to at least do the early
announcement of it.
So if they do that, I could see it being
sort of the capsule announcement,
something that happens near
the end of the presentation
where it's like, hey, we talked
about all this other cool
stuff we're doing for the Xbox One
right now, but here's the future.
Now something that's
a little bit different
about this potential announcement
though, is that it sounds
like Xbox might be working on
two new systems, not just one.
Normally when we talk
about a new generation
or new cycle, new consoles coming out,
it's usually like, hey,
here's the new thing.
This is the Xbox One, that's it.
Sometimes there's multiple models of that,
but they boil it down to being
basically the same system,
it's just a matter of oh,
this one comes with a bigger
hard drive and maybe a special color.
This time however, it sounds
like we might actually have
two completely different
models coming out at launch.
They'd be running the
same library of games,
but with different emphases,
the idea being that we have
the Project Scarlett which
is the high super power
Xbox system in development
that could be more powerful
than what PlayStation has
announced with the PS5,
and then a more affordable cheaper option
which may even rely on
Project xCloud which is,
they've been talking about
a lot regarding the idea
of stream playing games over having
to just use the system directly.
Now the popular theory
slash rumor right now
is that Xbox's new system or new systems
will be launching in spring of 2020.
If that's the case, then it's very likely
that what we'll see at this
year's press conference
will actually be a full
reveal which would be awesome.
Now if we don't get a
full reveal and instead,
it's something that's
a little more of just
a hype up reel, where we just
get an official title name
and they show us a
silhouette, kind of like when
they first started teasing the Xbox One X,
that means that either the
system's going to be coming out
even later, maybe more like
holiday season of 2020,
or it could be that
they're just waiting to do
maybe a standalone conference
focused on the system
and have E3 more dedicated
towards games and services.
I think what's most interesting
about this possibility
is that if we do get a full
reveal that maybe even includes
just a light bit of
talking about launch titles
or things that'll be coming
out alongside with it,
the possibility of actually
seeing real playable demos
of these things because on
Sony's side, they've talked about
the power behind the PS5,
and kind of used a reference
of like, oh look how much
faster it loads these PS4 games.
But if Xbox can actually show gameplay
for its next gen system, that
is a major win in the battle
of trying to build up
hype for their console
versus what Sony has released thus far.
Assuming it actually is more powerful.
Now while the potential of
a big hardware announcement
is I think the thing a lot
of people are excited for,
of course the main
focus of the press event
is going to be games, lots of games.
We're gonna see stuff
from third party companies
that'll be on Xbox, probably
also things that'll be
multi-platform as well,
but in a recent Tweet,
Phil Spencer already announced
that they are going to have
14 first party games at the show,
which sounds pretty high compared
to they've done in the last few years.
Now based on games that
have already been announced
since last E3 or at other
events, there's a few of these
games that we already
kinda know what they are.
There's gonna be of course Gears War 5.
There's also two Gears of War spinoffs
that might be counted
as part of that list.
One was this kind of more
kid friendly POP game
and the other one was a
tactics game for mobile.
There is of course, also Halo
Infinite which we're still not
entirely sure what separates that
from the regular Halo franchise,
but it is another title that
we at least know exists.
And then of course we have
some smaller titles that
we've talked about before like
Ori and the Will of the Wisps
which I am super excited for personally.
And also a new Battletoads
game, which again,
we don't really know any fine details of,
just that it's a thing that is happening.
Now even with all those games in mind,
that leaves a lot of
space open for new things
to be announced, especially
if they're going to be
first party, I mean, there's
always the chance we're gonna
see some announcements from EA or Capcom
or other third parties they
work with, but that is a lot
of first party stuff to work with.
So, there's rumors going
around of whether or not
we're gonna see some old
IPs come back like Fable
for instance or we're gonna
see some brand new stuff.
Now it is worth noting that the big focus
of last year's conference
was, hey we're buying up
a lot of studios, and so we
might be seeing the fruits
of some of those start
to come in this year.
I don't think every
single one of those teams
is gonna have a game for
this E3, but hopefully
a couple will have something to show.
I think what I'm most
curious about when it comes
to these 14 games and how
many of them are unknowns
is what the division is like between
the triple A style titles and
some of the more Indiesh ones
'cause Xbox usually has
a pretty steady stream
of some more Indie focused
style games, but if we're seeing
this many first party titles
talked about this year,
it would be great to have one surprise
as far as something that's
going to be really big budget.
Whether that is a new
Fable which would be cool
or something entirely brand new.
Whatever it is, one thing
that I think we know
it's not going to be which
is kinda surprising this year
is that we might not actually
see a new Forza game.
There's been a new Forza for
Xbox one basically every year
alternating between the
Motorsport and Horizon games,
but at least based on reports
from earlier this year,
the team behind Forza Motorsport
is in still the very early
stages of working on the game and instead,
the focus might be this year
on just working on Horizon
a little more, maybe
releasing some DLC for it
and pushing a new Forza Motorsport
all the way til next year
maybe even making it a next gen title
instead of something for the Xbox One.
One other area that I
think Microsoft could be
spending a lot of time
on at this presentation
that could be very
interesting is their services.
This is something they
always bring up a little bit
for some of their press
conferences whether they're
talking about Xbox Game
Pass where it's like,
hey spend so much money a
month and you get access
to this library of games, and in fact,
we already have in recent
news the fact that they are
gonna be bringing Game
Pass to PC in some form.
Then of course, there's
also Project xCloud,
a service that Microsoft
has been pushing a lot
which has the idea that
you can play Xbox games
through other devices, whether
that's a phone or tablet.
There's already been some
discussion about the idea
that we could be seeing
a Beta later this year
and full launch potentially next year
lining up with their new system.
Now what can be really interesting
about the services aspect
of this conference is
that I think a narrative
that Microsoft really
wants to start pushing
is the idea that they
are no longer trying to
directly compete with
all the other companies.
Yes, they in some ways
wanna make a better system
that what Sony's doing with PlayStation 5,
that's still there, but at the same time,
they wanna make it so that you can access
Microsoft products no matter
what device you're using.
That no matter what you
wanna play on or how you like
to play, somehow
Microsoft can be involved.
So as a sort of long shot kind
of prediction theory thing,
I think there is the
possibility that they could talk
a little bit more regarding
the partnerships they've been
developing with both Sony and Nintendo.
Nintendo more so, Sony's
been a little more
in the background, they've
talked about working together
on their streaming technologies,
but Nintendo in particular,
we're already seeing something's happened
like Xbox Live features being
put in certain Nintendo games
that are cross-platform
and even some originally
Microsoft exclusive games making their way
to the system like with Cuphead.
Part of those early rumors
about when we first started
getting an idea that Microsoft
and Nintendo might start
working together, there was
the discussion of the idea
of Game Pass making its
way to the Switch as well
and maybe even Project xCloud.
The idea that there is a
membership that you can have
that not only applies to Xbox and soon PC,
but also the Switch, and the idea that you
could play an Xbox One X quality game,
say a new Gears of War title coming out,
and do that portably on
your Switch via Streamplay.
This would be a huge move because
they would be dedicating some of that
long time of the conference towards
pushing the idea that, hey, we're not just
about us, we're about being
friendly with everyone else.
And to give Nintendo
just a little bit of time
on the show floor.
I don't think this is 100% a thing
that's gonna happen, but based on things
that have been happening
over the last year
and the kind of narrative
Microsoft's been pushing,
I don't think it's actually
that huge of a long shot.
Overall I think this
year's E3 is a little bit
of an enigma, normally
there's a lot of big stuff
to look forward to from every company,
but this time, with Sony dropping out,
and other companies kind
of running the well dry
a little bit, I don't
really know what to expect
from all of them.
But if anyone's going to have potentially
some of the biggest
surprises, I'd put my money
on Xbox this year.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
