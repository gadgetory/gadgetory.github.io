we're still giving away spider-man ps4
bro in case you missed our initial
announcement last week we are still
giving away that spider-man ps4 Pro
check out the link download description
on how you can get a chance to win it
now on to the questions
what games are contenders for game of
the year so for what's come out so far
this year that we actually like you know
have played and can say things about I
feel like there's two main titles that a
lot of people are associating as being
most likely at least a contender for
Game of the Year and rightfully so and
that's got war and spider-man sorry it's
just too sudden exclusives but they're
great and you know if I had to pick
which one I personally like more they're
both really good I'm sorry I don't who's
a fan of it but I'd have to give it to
God for spider-man spider-man is a great
game I think it does an amazing job of
kind of capturing that feeling of like
oh you are spider-man and going through
the storyline but God of War I feel like
just throughout the entire game hit all
these really awesome emotional notes it
had awesome gameplay doing all the bonus
bosses and stuff but just it gave me
some of the best feeling of like
difficulty in that style game that I
haven't had in a long time aside from
Dark Souls which is a little more on the
punching side rather than just you know
good balance difficulty they're both
great I just right now God of War that
being said there are still a few more
games coming out this year that are
probably gonna be amazing so we'll see
what happens which fall game are you
most excited for so this is the time of
year when a lot of big-name stuff really
starts to come out I feel like this year
is a little slower than some of the past
ones and almost got pushed back to like
February March but there's still a
couple really big things to look forward
to in October and November
of course like big-name ones that
everyone talks about is gonna be like
Red Dead Redemption to Super Smash
Brothers as far as kind of like other
smaller titles that I'm personally
really excited for I cannot wait for
Megaman 11 which is just a week away I
grew up playing Megaman and so finally
having a new one that actually looks
like it's kind of respecting the old
style it's just awesome and then another
would be Soul Calibur 6 I almost lost
track of how many there are
I've always been a huge fan of Soul
Calibur it's been one of favorite
fighting games I know it's not like the
biggest one out there but I don't know
it's just one that really kind of
resonated with me so finally getting a
new one and having Geralt as a guest
character cannot wait after Red Dead
Redemption to what rock star game would
you like to see I'd like an le noir
sequel elegant war is actually pretty
good guess of what they could do next
because they were really pushing that a
lot especially with laters ports and
stuff but also as far something that I
would like to see them do next I feel
like it's about time for something new
because no me wrong I
Grand Theft Auto I really love Red Dead
and I'm super excited for too but I
really want to see Rockstar take the
formulas they've done with those games
and apply it somewhere else anew because
I think that's something that can really
bring a little extra a new life and
everything and let's face it they are
the company that really popularized that
open-world format a lot of open-world
games we're seeing today are heavily
inspired by what they did with Grand
Theft Auto 3 and games going on and so I
really want to see them do something
that other companies been trying to do
but have their own kind of Rockstar spin
on it whether that's doing some kind of
open-world sci-fi game or pirates or
feudal Japan just something outside what
they've done so far so you can get kind
of an interesting remix while still
getting that quality gameplay that they
bring I'm glad you asked Richard so we
actually customized our switches with
skins from dbrand
today's sponsor they've made a whole
bunch of different skins that are
totally safe to use in your switch you
can use them on the switch itself joy
Comstock whatever check out the link
down below if you want to grab one who
are you gonna Mane in Spanish ultimate I
don't know cuz I haven't played it
enough yet to decide who I really want
to use a lot in past mash games I mainly
used Ike and sometimes Zelda those
really the main two I went with a lot so
I'll probably mess with it a lot winner
comes out as far as new characters go
that I really want to kind of dive into
and potentially become a main we'll find
out
Simon Richter I really like Castlevania
I liked a lot of what we saw in like the
gameplay trailers for how they handle
personally just you know design and
character wise like Richter a little
more but we'll see how each of them
plays what's your opinion on console
manufacturers cashing in on gamer
nostalgia for example the rise of
PlayStation classic old-school Nintendo
switch controllers games etc it's weird
for me because I'm basically the main
target demographic for that I'm someone
who grew up playing all these systems
and has all that you know fun nostalgic
memories of them and I'm now old enough
to wear all this themed stuff coming out
I have money to buy it used to be and on
the one hand you know they're cashing in
you know they're doing something just
because they are aware that there are
people out there that are willing to pay
the money but that's thing I'm here and
I'm willing to pay the money I think a
lot of the stuff is really
and even though part of my brain knows
that it is yeah a little exploitation as
long as the ideas are there and they're
executed well I'm fine with it as we
hear rumors of next-gen consoles what do
you want to see in next-gen controllers
so this is actually really interesting
is this a question that we were talking
about kind of behind the scenes recently
when we were reviewing the scuff Vantage
and you know I think as far as like a
standard controller goes if both Xbox
and Playstation have really gonna figure
it out what basic design they need to
have in button placement so I think we
need to start seeing more traditionally
viewed pro controller options show up
regular controllers like having back
pedals that are remappable and you know
it's kind of extra quality features that
really set it apart from what we
currently have on the Xbox one and ps4
thoughts on one of the games you would
like to see on PlayStation Classic so
this is really funny because you know
last month in the QA I was asked you
know what you know classic system would
you like and I said a Playstation one
and now we actually are getting one and
the context back then was that I was
really into the idea of seeing a lot of
JRPGs from the ps1 because that's like
an amazing system for that genre and so
far we have two confirmed on the system
already found a c7 and Wild Arms there's
a lot more that I would like to see I
doubt we're gonna see all of them I
really hoped specifically that five high
c7 doesn't knock out other potential
squaresoft games like Chrono Cross or
Final Fantasy Tactics I think would be
amazing aside from that I mean it has
been rated as Peggy 18 in Europe so
hopefully the ins are gonna see some of
the awesome M rated games that were on
PlayStation like Metal Gear Solid Silent
Hill there's just there's a lot of good
that says we can do and I really wish
there was more than 20 games</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
