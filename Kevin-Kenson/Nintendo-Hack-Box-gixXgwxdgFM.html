(flickering)
- You're probably wondering what this is.
We'll get to that in a second.
(flickering)
Nintendo has always had a reputation
to be a bit on the sue-happy side,
whether that's protecting
their IP by getting rid
of any fan projects that
are using their characters
or pursuing legal action against people
that host ROM and emulation sites
and any form of piracy they
can get their hands on,
which has been really
relevant the last couple years
as a lot of major ROM
and emulation websites
have straight up shut
down after they did some
pretty hefty lawsuits against people.
Now some people see all
these lawsuits and go,
&quot;Jeez Nintendo, just calm
down, it's all right.
&quot;You don't have to do this,
just lay back a little bit.&quot;
But really a large reason
why Nintendo is this way
is that they've had to deal
with this for a long time.
See, nowadays when people
think about pirating games,
especially if it's any kind
of old school retro ones,
it's a very straightforward action
that has a ton of different options,
whether that's just
finding a ROM on a website
that you can use on an
emulator on your computer,
on some kind of third-party device
you've bought that supports it,
homebrewing something on your
Switch or Xbox or whatever.
There's no shortage of
ways to play pirated games.
The internet has made
this very easy to do,
but before it was so
widespread and accessible,
there were still ways to pirate
games way back in the day.
And the way it started
on Nintendo consoles
was with the Famicom disk system.
- [Narrator] (speaks Japanese)
- For those of you that don't know,
the Famicom disk system was an expansion
to the original Japanese
version of the NES, the Famicom,
and it allowed you to play
games in other formats
instead of just using the standard cart.
And the main benefit of this is that
floppy disks could hold
a lot more information,
so there were things you
could release in that form
that wouldn't normally
work on a cartridge.
The only problem is that floppy
disks were a form of media
that people were way more familiar with
how to actually read and write stuff to.
In fact, PC games in
Japan were so easy to copy
from floppy disk to floppy
disk that to this day,
renting games in Japan
is technically illegal
unless the license
holder actually makes it
a specific service they make available.
However, this did not stop
people from finding ways
to make use of the technology,
which is exactly how we
ended up with a system
I have behind me right
here, the Gamars Super Disk.
This is a piece of basically pirating tech
that would allow people to take
any kind of Famicom games they owned,
copy it onto a floppy
disk, and give them a way
to permanently access the game
without actually having
to own the original copy.
Now again, in Japan you
couldn't rent games,
but if you had a friend that owned a game,
if you borrowed something from someone,
it gave you an easy way of
building up a large library
with never actually
having to buy anything.
Now this Gamar system that we
have is designed to be used
with the Super Famicom,
but fun fact about that,
because it is basically
just a Super Famicom cart
with a lot of extra functionalities,
it'll work with our Super Analogue Nt.
Now if you don't know what that is,
it's a modern system
that allows you to play
Super Nintendo and Super Famicom games
connected to a modern TV with no problem.
So instead of using a CRT
or relying on a bunch of upscalers,
we're just gonna plug
the system into that,
and we're good to go.
So here we are at the
main menu of the Gamars,
which is actually a little
game in and off itself,
it's like a little world map setup.
And the first time we
set it up, we had no idea
what any of this actually meant
'cause it's not in English.
But we looked up a couple guides,
we say other people using them,
and the main thing we're really interested
in showing off here is
the little power plant,
so we're gonna select on that.
And this is where you
can do the main actions
that really interested in with the Gamars,
where you can take the
data that's on a cartridge
and move it either to internal storage
that is on some of these units,
not on the one we have, or
move it to a floppy disk.
Now on this simplified
menu, you can see a list
of all the main things
we're concerned about
and a couple things I actually
didn't talk about before.
So we have options to play
whatever is on the floppy disk
that's currently in the
system, there's a magic mode
which opens up additional options in game
for doing things like cheat
codes, that sort of thing,
play from the cartridge,
play from the cartridge
in magic mode, and then
an interesting one as well
is the ability to move memory
between the disk and the cart.
So if you wanted to,
you could play save data
that's saved to a floppy
disk while still playing
with whatever cart is
currently in the system.
It's basically a way of giving you
the ability to have more save files
for a game that might normally limit you
to just the one save or
only a small handful.
And on top of that, at the
very bottom we have, of course,
the ability to save whatever cartridge
is currently logged in
onto the floppy disk.
So with this one device,
way back in the 90s,
you were able to do all
this advanced stuff,
like not only pirating games but even
move around and manipulate save data.
Which, look, I'm not the biggest advocate
for piracy or anything,
but that is super cool.
In fact, Nintendo even tried cashing in
on a way of kind of legally doing this
in which the Famicom
disk system had a kiosk
available in stores where you could pay
a smaller fee than a
game would normally cost,
turn in a floppy disk you have,
and they would erase
whatever data was on it
and install a new game instead.
Kind of like a very old, early version
of the Netflix disk system,
or maybe even Redbox,
where you don't have a
membership fee or anything,
you just pay every time you want
a new game installed on that disk.
With how easy floppy disks made it
to physically pirate games
however, Nintendo kind of
shied away from using
that media in the future,
and it's in fact part of the reason why
they avoided using other
common forms of stuff
like CD-ROMs as long as they did.
It's worth noting too that
while this a unique solution
that made a lot of sense for the 90s,
there are updated, newer versions of it
for retro systems that are
still being made today.
They're just updated in ways
that make a lot more sense.
For instance, removing
the floppy disk drive
and just putting a Micro SD instead,
which takes out a lot of room
and makes them much more slimline.
And this is a concept that
evolved further as gaming evolved
and new storage solutions
became available.
For instance, a really popular
version of this that happened
during the sort of
mid-to-late 2000s were R4s.
These were little tiny storage
units you could use in a DS
that would store basically
the entire library.
You couldn't actually
copy or save games to it,
but thanks to the internet,
we didn't really need that anymore.
People were just loading
them themselves on computers.
And that became a really
common way for people
to pirate games on their handhelds.
There's a lot that goes into
the debate about piracy,
whether it's for games that
are currently coming out
or just getting whole
collections of old, retro ones.
But when you look back at the history
of how long this has been an option
and how many ways people have been finding
to get around different
ways companies do things,
it's not really that big of a surprise
to see how Nintendo has approached
the entire subject over the years.
Though I guess you could say
it's also a really good example
of no matter how things work
or what the limitations are,
people find a way.
Life finds a way, Rich.
Life finds a way.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
