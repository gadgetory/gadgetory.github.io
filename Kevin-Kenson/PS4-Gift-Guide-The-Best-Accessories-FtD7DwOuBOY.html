gift guide this time focusing on ps4 and
for this list we're gonna order things
from the cheapest item to the priciest
kicking things off with something that's
a bit more of a stocking stuffer option
squid grips that every gamers had that
night or possibly everyday problem where
they've been gaming for five or six
hours straight and their palms are now
uncomfortably sweaty it might not make a
controller go flying at your hands like
some people may claim but it's
definitely gonna throw you off and this
is exactly what the squid grip helps you
to dodge it's easy enough to apply your
controller and it makes it so your grip
is not only going to be resistant to
moisture buildup but also just going to
make it more comfortable to boot giving
the controller a little more give when
you're holding tight it's a nice simple
way of improving your gaming experience
without breaking the bank at the same
time now another problem that a lot of
gamers experience especially if they're
trying to set up a cool entertainment
system is filling the shelves with all
kinds of cool stuff but not making it a
cluttered mess and for ps4 at least an
easy solution is the Ortz cooling and
charge station now personally I've never
been a big believer in cooling stands
your system should be more than cool
enough as long as you put it somewhere
nice and open but the fan is the least
important feature about this item to me
first off it gives you a stable way to
keep your ps4 in Tower mode which not
only looks great but save some space on
the shelf as well and what makes it even
better is that this stand comes with two
charging stations for ps4 controllers
this way you have an all in one place
that you can store your system and your
controllers that's not going to take up
a lot of space and lets you keep your
controllers charged so you never run
into that problem of oh god I forgot to
plug it into a cable earlier the next up
is a ps4 version of one of the items I
recommended on my Xbox one list the RDS
ps4 carrying case like I said before
this is the kind of thing that not a lot
of people think about grabbing but once
they do it's a major life saver if your
situation as you constantly moving your
system back and forth there's a place to
store and protect everything you need
for your system making it easy and
comfortable to transport without having
to resort to stuffing your system into a
duffel bag or backpack with a bunch of
other stuff hoping to not scratch it
it's not the kind of thing that every
ps4 owner has to have but if your
circumstances call for it it's a
worthwhile investment and makes a great
gift now let's start getting into a bit
fancier territory with that all time
important accessory for the online gamer
a headset and for ps4 one of the
absolute best options is the official
Sony stereo headset
today coming from a third party this is
made by Sony themselves and it does an
awesome job of competing this one here
is Wireless but you can save some money
grabbing a wired option instead for 40
bucks less they're comfy and if control
is located right on the ear cups giving
you an easy place to remember where to
reach to and for their price point they
sound great like I said to the XO for is
in my other video there are better
sounding headsets out there if you're
willing to pay a lot more but for their
price point these are excellent they're
comfy and it's a great way to play games
late at night without keeping up
everyone around you now last but not
least is my personal favorite item on
this list the Horry real arcade Pro for
fightstick one genre that's definitely
gotten a little more love on ps4 Xbox
one is fighting games especially with
Street Fighter 5 just being a couple
months away so what better way to prep
the fighting game fan you know than to
grab a shiny new fight stick for their
console this stick offers solid
performance with a great stick and
buttons as well as being officially
supported and co-developed by Sony
Corey's biggest competitor Mad Catz does
have a bigger and better option with
their tournament addition to stick but
it'll cost you more and consistently
runs out of stock super quick so the
real arcade pro 4 is a much more
affordable and reliable option for your
gift-giving needs while still being a
great product and a huge improvement
over playing with a controller so here's
just some of the best stuff can grab to
the ps4 owner you know this holiday
season I also do list for Xbox one so if
you missed out on that make sure to
check that out as well every product I
talked about is listed down below in
description if you want to take a look
at any of them as always guys thank you
so much for watching and I'll see you
later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
