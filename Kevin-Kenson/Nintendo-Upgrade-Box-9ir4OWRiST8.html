companies right now Nintendo has a
variable of a history of retro system so
much so that a lot of them have been
given new life again again in different
ways whether that's games being ported
to later systems different services that
you access and play these games or even
the classic edition systems which offer
a sort of greats his selections of
things that came on the NES and SNES but
in the rush of all these different
products that allow us to play our
favorite old games there's one system in
particular that's been having the
roughest time coming back and that's the
n64 the NES and SNES are old enough that
a lot of their games are very easy to
adapt to various different platforms
because the button inputs are so simple
and the Gamecube came out just before
HDTV started getting more standard and
so there's a couple different options to
make that work along with just simply
using them with a Wii the n64 on the
other hand hasn't really had those
options a few select games have been
ported over time there were virtual
console titles in the Wii and some very
big hits were brought over to the 3ds
like Ocarina of Time and starfox but
even then there is a very large library
of awesome n64 games that are pretty
hard to play on modern systems I was
just looking at my instrument by the way
if you want to see some more photos of
the super 64 alongside some of my
favorite n64 games that I've tracked
down you can check that out on my
Instagram you can also see BTS shots
from videos like this one on the
Instagram for Sun squared media both of
those are linked down below now this is
an issue that a lot of people are aware
of there's been a lot of clamoring for
an n64 classic edition after we've seen
the other ones there has been talk from
different companies of releasing their
own systems capable playing n64 games
and hooking up to an HDTV and we now
finally have the first of those products
that can let you do that the super 64
from beyond the promise of the super 64
is to be a very easy way of taking your
pre-existing Nintendo 64 system and
hooking it up to a modern TV with as
little fuss as possible giving you not
only a clear image but still maintaining
all the things that are good about retro
gaming like having minimal input
Lag the question is does it work if you
haven't heard of Eon before this is
actually their second kind of third
product they've released the first
project was a similar adapter called the
GC HD which came in two different
versions this is the mark two one right
here and it basically delivered on the
same main promise the super 64 has but
for the Gamecube giving the ability to
hook it up to HD TVs now the GC HD
offered a ton of different options there
were a lot of different ways you could
customize the image and fine tune it a
little bit and most of this was
controlled through the ability of being
able to interact with the universal
remote which was a little annoying but
still offered a lot of great
customization and the default options
were strong I was a big fan of it the
super 64 on the other hand is
considerably simpler compared to the GC
HD whereas the GC HD had a ton different
options ways to customize the super 64
basically has well one by comparison the
super 64 is something that's a bit
simpler and a little more
straightforward it still offers the same
main promise of being able to allow you
to plug in to your n64 that any
additional cables you have to plug in to
power you don't have to add any kind of
modification to the system it just plugs
right into where the video out would be
for your n64 and bam you now have an
HDMI out port to work with what's really
kind of handy about this too is that the
way the n64 itself is designed there's
already a lot of bulk happening on the
back end of the system I mean if you
ever have used an n64 the power supply
itself sticks out way far so while this
does add a little bit to the overall
dimensions of an n64 it's actually not
protruding in any kind of noticeable way
because it's basically just balancing
out with that power adapter now in
comparison to the GC HD which offered
all kinds of different ways to customize
and fine-tune the image the super 64 on
the other hand is much simpler and
really just has one special feature and
that's not because they were trying to
get rid of any features or they were
trying to keep everything like that it's
just that there's only so much you can
do with an n64 video signal compared to
a Gamecube
so for the super 64 there's only one
single feature that it has which is
called slick mode instead of having to
rely on using a new versatile remote to
go through a bunch of menus that are
hidden it just relies on a single little
button right here on the side that you
hit you hit this button it turns on
slick mode when you hit it again turns
it off as simple as that
now as for what slick mode does it
applies a filter to the image that's
being put out by the n64 to smooth out a
lot of the rough edges see when you're
using an adapter like this for the
entity bar it's not adding any kind of
additional lines it's not changing the
resolution of the image it's instead
putting out a nice clean 480p signal
which is all you really need to get a
good looking version of the game but
because it's a 480p signal being shown
on a modern TV especially if you're
using a larger one you're gonna start
noticing all those blocky pixels and
depending on your personal preference
that can look a little annoying but
there are a couple of cases here and
there where I do find the crisper look
of just leaving the slick mode off does
look slightly better to my eyes I think
one of the main examples has to be
starfox 64 so with slick mode it's
adding this effect where a lot of these
hard pixels are now being smooth adapt
to look more like traditional lines now
the trade-off here is that it is
actually creating a slightly blurry er
image but you're only gonna really
notice that if you're using it on a very
large TV and you're playing at a pretty
close distance if you're playing from
further away on our smaller screen
generally it just flat out looks a lot
better in my experience the vast
majority of games that I've played using
the super 64 slick mode is the way to go
some games particularly look way better
like Mario 64 there is an obsession with
trying to recapture this style we had
for old systems we grew up with and
there's a lot of different ways people
have found tap into that now as far as
official channels go things that say
Nintendo has done first hand it's
usually things like making games
available on later systems whether
that's a port or even like what they're
doing with the NES online on the switch
where there's a library of old-school
games you can play and then there's even
of course the classic systems where they
kind of put a greatest hits compilation
of games from those titles on a
standalone little system which is great
if the games you grew up in love or on
those systems great easy option but if
there's some game you love that was a
weird kind of side game that not any one
really knows about or wasn't a huge
popular hit chances are you're not
getting a lot of portunities to play
that again and when talking about the
n64 which is kind of focus of this video
you know there's a lot of love for that
system and everyone was so happy when we
got the NES and SNES classics so you
know fingers crossed Nintendo's gonna
bring an n64 Classic next nope we went a
whole year without any new system coming
out and even on the record while Reggie
was still working for Nintendo he stated
yeah the NES and SNES were cool ideas
they were kind of one
I live in two things we wanted to do
we're not looking to move forward on any
other kind of similar products meaning
the hope of an insectivore system like
that probably isn't happening again
compared to the GC HD the super 64 is a
very simple product I think that's
really the big focus of Avion has is
that this is meant to be a maximum
convenient option for people that want a
way to play n64 games on a modern TV
because there really aren't that many
out there and the ones that exist are
very expensive more so than a super 64
or they're much more specialized involve
things like having to actually open up
and modest system whereas in the case of
the super 64 you just plug this into the
back plug an HDMI cable into it and
you're done
now as for how the games actually look
while you're playing with this honestly
they look really really good there's
definitely some visual aspects here and
there that stand out as being a little
awkward sometimes things don't properly
translate to a modern TV and there are
things that accounted for playing on a
CRT that just doesn't work when you're
doing in HD and this isn't doing any
extra work to try and clean any of that
up it's focused on just being able to
give you an easy way to push that signal
and I'd say that overall it is worth it
it's certainly not a cheap option at 150
bucks this is not aimed at just every
single person out there who owns an n64
the goal is definitely people who are
n64 enthusiasts that one option to use
their systems still today on a modern
screen but that haven't deal with a lot
of hassle like modding or anything
beyond that it's just a good simple
straightforward solution that gets the
job done something I think is really
important to emphasize and point out
about the n64 particular is that there
really aren't that many options out
there for NES and SNES there are a lot
of ways of experience classic games even
the GameCube has a couple options
including the GC HD that we talked about
but when it comes to n64 and something
that's actually a convenient choice this
is basically the first one
so that's where the option of third
parties and more enthusiasts kind of
stuff comes in and yes of course there's
always the option to just straight up
emulating things on your computer or
some kind of dedicated emulation device
but there's always the argument of
whether or not that's entirely legal and
how much that actually recreates the
spirit of the thing look there's plenty
of games that you can emulate I did it
myself growing up but there's something
different about actually playing with an
SNES controller on an actual SNES
recapturing those systems that you
played on the proper way and using game
carts you grew up with to continue those
same save files and that's where some of
these other options like the super 64
come in now those are great options that
I'm a big fan of them but there is also
a certain magic that's gained from the
other option which is something that
just modifies a previous system whether
it's something that is in-depth or
you're opening up an old-school system
and changing the parts of the board or
something that's simpler like the super
64 where you just plug it in and you're
good to go because there's a certain
kind of feeling you get with this
concept of hey this is the n64 I grew up
with these are the games I still have
the controllers I still have and this
gives you a way to take all of that and
just use all of it today on a modern
screen this isn't thing I've talked
about a few times on this channel where
of course I love modern games there's a
lot of amazing stuff coming out and
things that were never possible before
in gaming and most of what we cover on
the channel is modern stuff but there's
a part of me that has always been
fascinated by and has a deep love of any
kind of tech that focuses on taking
those old experiences I grew up with and
finding ways to bring it into the modern
age and for the longest time sadly the
n64 is one of the system's that's just
kind of missed out on that experience
and that's why I'm so happy to see
something like the super 64 come out and
hopefully it's just the beginning</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
