of right now the only way you can get
one is this 500 gigabyte model bundled
with uncharted 4 which we're gonna unbox
right now the first thing we see opening
this thing up is of course another
sturdier less flash your box with
everything inside the power cable HDMI
cable a USB to micro USB cable for
charging your controller and a really
really crappy in-ear headset that I
guess is better than nothing getting
past all that stuff we get to the first
real new thing about this system the
controller this is a minor update to the
Dual Shock 4 with a few little changes
first off if you put it side by side
with the original you'll see that it's a
little brighter gray all around though
it still maintains basically the same
aesthetic there's also now a little
window on the touchpad that lets you see
the light bar from the front side now
supposedly this new dual shock does last
longer than the original which just had
a bismal battery life despite having the
same kind of battery I have yet to test
this myself and I'm gonna let you guys
know for sure in a future video
putting the controller aside we get to
the last but most important bits of this
bundle the brand new ps4 slim add a box
copy of Uncharted 4 looking at the slim
you can see it definitely lives up to
its namesake most obviously it's shorter
than the original but if you compare it
side-by-side you'll see it's also a
little less wide and deep and it's
really funny because why see photos or
videos of this thing I really don't care
for how it looks but in person it's just
somehow better I'm happy they went with
an all matte finish getting rid of easy
finger prints and light scratches I
liked the redesigned more subtle
PlayStation logo placed right on the
middle of the top and bottom of the
system and I really really love the
Easter Egg of the PlayStation button
symbols being system's legs and being on
the side of the system with the O
doubling as where you can screw in a
vertical stand the curb sides I'm still
not really sold on but all the other
changes combined with its smaller size
this limb is actually a pretty
good-looking system looking at the front
of the system you'll see that the power
and eject buttons have been moved to the
inner lip rather than the front side
a lot harder to accidentally press and
you'll also see the two front-facing USB
ports have been spread out a bit more on
the back things are mostly the same as
the original with one big exception
you'll see the power port HDMI Ethernet
and auxilary port for the PlayStation
camera but unlike the original ps4 the
slim does not have an optical out now as
far as performance differences go
between this and the original there
really isn't that much to cover it runs
about as loud and as hot as the original
if you're playing off of a disc it's a
little quieter when running off the hard
drive but a pretty negligible amount to
most people's ears though it does have
less power draw
the only real technical upgrade the
system has is that the slim supports 5
gigahertz Wi-Fi as opposed to only 2.4
like the original did for some
unfathomable reason overall this really
is just a stock refresh there's not
really a reason to buy this system if
you already have an original ps4 unless
you're just that passionate about your
Wi-Fi if you've been waiting on a new
system and you don't want to wait or pay
extra for the pro coming out in November
now is a pretty good time for this trim
down model it's also a good option if
you don't want a system that looks like
a club sandwich that's a nice bonus too</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
