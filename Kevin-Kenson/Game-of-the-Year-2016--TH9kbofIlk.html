Redemption - yeah do you think all the
remastered videogames are necessary
especially for the PC players of moths
now personally I really loved when
remasters first started getting really
big on ps3 and 360 because it was like
let's take this trilogy of awesome games
from ps2 and just bring them all
together at one set price that was
awesome
has it gotten a little more excessive
since then definitely is it necessary
not at all
are people gonna still buy them because
they want better-looking versions of
games yep so it's gonna keep happening
what do you think of the ps4 Pro so far
and by the way I heard it can run The
Last of Us at native 4k which is awesome
I'm really excited for the ps4 Pro I
can't wait to pick one up in a week I
really want to see what games can run
better on the system and what kind of
Pro modes we'll see for more titles as
far as The Last of Us running at 4k that
is awesome
but that is also in the mode that only
runs at 30 frames so personally I'm
probably still gonna play the game at 60
frames cuz for me framerate Trump's
resolution should we expect to VR only
in gaming in the near future also
favorite VR game depends on what exactly
mean by any time soon in the next five
to ten years probably not sometime
during our lifetime yeah maybe I mean I
think regular old-school gaming is still
going to be around for quite some time
but VR is definitely gonna start taking
over and as for my personal favorite VR
game right now it's gotta be rigs I'm a
big sucker for anything involving giant
robots and it's a bunch of fun what do
you think is next for gaming systems
besides VR what's your favorite feature
of any game system ever this is kind of
a weird question for me because honestly
I think VR is the natural way systems
are going to evolve if it's anything
other than that I think Nintendo does
have the right idea with the switch
we're taking what we normally think as a
home console and making a hybrid of it
with portable gaming as far as my
favorite feature of any system before
this is kind of a weird nostalgic thing
and not actually a good feature but I
love to the
you on the treamcast the idea that my
memory card on my controller was also a
little portable game system as crappy as
it was was just the coolest thing to me
as a kid
what's your game of the year for this
year so far this is kind of a weird year
for me because there's a lot of games
that I really really like but there's
really not a single one that stands out
to me is like oh this is the most
amazing game this year I have to tell
everyone to play this nothing's really
hit me that hard yet if I have to pick
something right now and this will
probably change at some point Deus Ex
mankind divided I love this franchise
and this one did an excellent job of
building on human Revolution despite
also having microtransactions added at
the last second which was kind of
annoying also even though it's a remake
I loved the remake of odin sphere on ps4
that was my favorite games on ps2 but it
was a little too pretty for the ps2 to
handle so playing it at a steady 60
frames is just amazing and all the
gameplay updates are superb I loved it
what was your first video game I
honestly have no idea I've been playing
games as long as I can remember I grew
up in a household where there was an NES
and Game Boy and all that kinda stuff
available right away so I don't know
what I played first my clearest memories
are probably Tetris Legend of Zelda and
Super Mario Brothers 3 but which of
those I played first no clue what's
under the beard bees what was your
biggest gaming disappointment as a child
okay so this isn't actually a game but
it is gaming related growing up I was a
huge nerd for Final Fantasy that was my
franchise I loved every one of those
games and so obviously when they
announced a movie based on it coming out
Final Fantasy Spirits Within I was
really excited because that couldn't
possibly be terrible right I mean yeah
sure Super Mario Brothers movie was bad
but not all video game based movies are
bad right
right your must buy PC games Cana this
question may have been looking for what
recent game I really liked and want to
tell people to buy on their pcs but if
I'm gonna talk about my favorite PC game
ever made it's easily elder scrolls
morrowind that is when my favorite games
ever made it is one of the most
immersive worlds incredible lore great
writing the only problem is it hasn't
exactly aged well because the combat was
not great it was you can only play one
game franchise for the rest of your life
what is it well like I said earlier
growing up Final Fantasy was huge for me
and that's still gonna be I think my
main answer am I gonna lick play one
franchise I mean there's so many freakin
spin-offs that I wouldn't exactly be
short on games to play but there would
definitely be one or two that I would
need to ignore ever existing what is
your least favorite console or handheld
ever released and your favorite game on
set device so this one actually took me
a little time to think about because not
counting systems that I've just heard
about that were flops and actual game
systems I've used honestly I'm gonna
have to go with the Wii I mean don't get
me wrong I loved a lot of the games on
it I loved a lot of other Nintendo
systems but I just really hated the we
as a system I didn't like the controller
I hated the interface and since it came
out at the same time as the ps3 and 360
going between games and just seeing how
well the quality was on the Wii it just
wasn't a big fan as far as actual games
on it though that I loved my number one
is probably Legend of Zelda Twilight
Princess but that's kind of cheating
because it was on GameCube as well if
I'm looking at we exclusive games
probably Mario Galaxy because that's one
of my favorite 3d Mario games hands down
what made you start youtube so Real Talk
I was one of those people that went to
college because that's what you're
supposed to do after high school I guess
and I ended up graduating with a degree
in English wasn't sure what I want to do
for sure but I wanted to do something
gaming related I wanted to write about
games
so obviously the easy start there is
reviews well at that same time my
brother was working with John and they
just started up TLD it was a tech bogus
channel and they wanted to do gaming
stuff too but didn't
know much about gaming so they brought
me on board and I did my first youtube
videos which were terrible by the way do
not look those up please as a favor to
me don't do that oh yeah Tildy ended up
taking off i spun off my own channel
right here and that's what brings us to
today or I'm talking to you fine folk
about video games and it's a lot of fun</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
