the first game from Jonathan Blow since
brain so braid came out back in 2008 and
it was this big deal was released it was
one of the first big indie games that
really showed that you don't need
triple-a resources to do crazy stuff I
mean it went for art style over
realistic graphics great soundtrack it
did weird innovative things with puzzle
and platforming mechanics so obviously a
lot of fans of that game are looking for
similar things out of the witness and
depending on which things you're looking
for you're either gonna really love this
game which I'm in that camp or you're
gonna be really salty about it
so initially one of my big fears when I
started is that I felt like I was just
doing the same kind of puzzle over and
over and over again which could have
just been a $5 app game but instead it's
40 dollars because they put a really
pretty backdrop to it which thankfully
that isn't the case once you get farther
into it so one of the things the game
does really well is how it builds up
complexity over obviously that's
something all puzzle games do they start
off really easy and then they get harder
and harder over time but it's the way
it's paced in the witness that is so
good because basically the way it works
is you're on this island that you're
exploring and every different little
area has its own new mechanic for how
puzzles work and it doesn't just force
you to figure it out but every time you
do a puzzle there it's teaching you how
the mechanic works and reinforces the
rules behind it so one of the best
things that can happen in this game is
how you can run into a puzzle that you
have no idea how it works but then you
go somewhere else learn the mechanics
and come back and it's just plain as day
how you solve it and this is where the
environment comes into play too because
the way you solve puzzles isn't just
what you see on the board itself it's
also the environment giving you hints
and clues in some situations and it's
really mind-blowing when you realize
that the way a bunch of rocks are
stacked in the corner of the room is the
solution to this puzzle you've been
stuck on for the past 20 minutes now all
that being said there are some things
about this game that I don't like for
instance there's no music at all I get
it it's an ambience thing it's meant to
make you feel alone and all you hear is
the sound of grass crunching underneath
your feet and it's very deep and all
that I get with how stylized the visuals
in this game are there should have been
some kind of ambient soundtrack to go
with that it doesn't ruin the game not
having it but it just would have been
that much better if it was actually
there instead of just solving puzzles to
the sound of
light beep now the other problem is the
game storyline or the fact that there
really isn't anyone at all I mean there
is kind of a narrative you can find
these audio logs littered throughout the
island that have speeches you can listen
to but none of its really that
constructive of a plot it's a lot of
introspective philosophical rantings
that make you question what the island
is or why you're there who built it all
that kind of stuff
basically bullshit that's fine I get it
I actually enjoyed this kind of stuff
but a lot of people are gonna get turned
off by the fact that there's no real
narrative or answers to why you're there
now once again it doesn't ruin the game
it's not something that completely
destroys everything else it has because
it survives that's strongly on just the
visuals and the design of the puzzles
it's just that if you care about things
like narrative or soundtracks this isn't
for you
on the other hand if you just really
love puzzle games and your idea of a
good time is breaking out pen and paper
to take notes
you're gonna freaking love this game
this is amazing and this is really even
made better by the fact that the game
lets you take whatever pace you want
with it there are over 600 puzzles in
this game but you really only need to do
a fraction of them to effectively beat
it so really if you're unless you're a
hard person completionist you can just
do the puzzles that make sense to you
and get through it and not only does
this game feed a puzzle bug but also
exploration because there is so much
crap you can find in this game hidden
every single nook and cranny and
optional puzzles that reveal other
little mysteries or more puzzles to
solve there's just so many layers to
this game that you could spend a lot of
time in it if you want to do more than
just clear enough areas to beat the
traditional story mode so basically if
you enjoy puzzle games and exploration
get this game absolutely freakin worth
it if you don't like those things and
you want narrative or action or just
anything other than tons of puzzles one
after another don't get this game you're
probably gonna hate every moment of it
and just find yourself in the fetal
position somewhere in the corner of the
room as always guys have enjoyed the
video hit the thumbs up button let me
know as well subscribe and I'll see you
later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
