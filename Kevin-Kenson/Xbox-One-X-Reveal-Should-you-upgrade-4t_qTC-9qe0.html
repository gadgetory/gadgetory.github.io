premium version of the Xbox one the Xbox
1x previously known as Project Scorpio
to be coming out on November 7th at a
price point of 499 dollars now for those
of you that already own a 1s or even an
original Xbox one you might be wondering
whether notes were thrown down that much
money to upgrade let's talk about five
reasons why you should number one let's
get the big obvious thing out of the way
first
and that's true 4k gaming one of the
things that's really interesting about
how the 1x was developed is the fact
that Microsoft was able to look at what
games were already coming out on the 1s
and see what it takes to actually get
those games to run at true 4k resolution
and build a system that would be able to
meet those requirements and exactly what
they did nobody denouncements for games
you already love that are going to have
4k patches for things like Gears of War
4 we also have upcoming games that are
going to be doing 4k and full 60 frames
per second like Forza Motorsport 7
number 2 not only is the system more
powerful but there's also some design
aspects of the body that are really
important to look at I mean at first
glance you might think this is just a 1s
but there's some pretty important
differences for instance how heat is
vented on the one apps you have a lot of
vents located at the top of system where
the 1x has placed them all on the back
and sides and in fact you can even look
at it right here what's really cool too
is actually looking at the system the
fact that the back towards are actually
all the same somehow despite having so
much more power draw than 1s it's still
using the same kind of tower cable which
is pretty freakin cool
number three it's smaller not only is
the design a little different and more
interesting this is actually the
smallest Xbox ever designed smaller than
any of the 360s smaller than the one F
and definitely smaller than the original
Xbox which was kind of a tank of a
system the main thing is that it is a
little thinner than the 1s which is
where you lose most of the space I also
love the fact that for a long time
everyone was clamoring for a 1s in black
and you're finally getting it in the 1x
number for now looks are of course nice
but after all the big thing you're
looking for is power and it's not just
the fact that this thing supports true
4k gaming one of the really interesting
things about the One X I don't think is
really getting talked about that much is
it has a faster harddrive now the main
point of this is that it will support 4k
games so they don't take forever to load
up
but if you're playing into this regular
1080 you're going to see faster load
times on this thing than you would with
the 1s for an original Xbox one as well
and number five you don't have to have a
4k TV to actually enjoy the system this
thing make sure that it gives you its
benefits either way
unlike the ps4 Pro which started off
requiring you to patch specific games to
have 4k support or you know eventually
they added the boost modes you can turn
that on to get a little better frame
rate
this thing is perpetually always in
boost modes you're going to see things
like better frame rates if you're
running games in 1080 it's going to make
you so super sampling to give you a
cleaner better image than you could get
with the 1s and like I said earlier
bathra load times so there's your five
reasons upgrade to an Xbox one X
pre-orders are going live pretty soon I
think I'm going to put a link down below
for you guys to check out in case it
does and I'll see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
