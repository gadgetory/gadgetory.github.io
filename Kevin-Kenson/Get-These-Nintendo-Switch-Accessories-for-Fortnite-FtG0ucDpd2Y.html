has come to the switch giving us a way
to play the game portably while still
having access to actual controllers
instead of having to use touchscreen
controls I got a mobile phone that's
like and if you're playing it on switch
or think about playing it on switch we
got a list of accessories of a hub
maximize your experience and if you
haven't checked it out before you should
really give it a look we actually I'll
link down below it's free to play check
it out
now of course the big deal about it
being on switch is being able to play it
in the switches handheld mode and when
you're playing the switch in handheld
there's two main things you really need
to address comfort and battery life
first let's talk comfort the switch is a
great little handheld but if you're
playing for long periods of time it's
not really the best shape for your hands
it's a very flat back it doesn't really
give you a grip at all it doesn't work
over long periods of time so you can
actually find a lot of cases like this
one right here this is a really good
cheap example which just wraps around
the entire system gives it a little bit
of protection but most importantly adds
these grip designs to the back of the
joy cons are so you have a much more
comfortable grip on the overall system
and is going to help you play for long
periods of time now on the other hand
another route you can go instead of
focusing on comfort is battery life
because there's nothing worse than
playing the game getting pretty far and
then seeing that little battery light
flashing in the corner and this is a
little guy we featured a couple times
that I really really love this is a
battery case for the switch it's fairly
small in size so it'll still fit inside
of a case but it gives you considerably
more battery life when you're playing in
handheld mode and if you still want to
increase your comfort a little bit since
it only covers the main body of the
switch itself you can still get a little
grip still attached specifically the
Joye cons to give you that better more
comfortable experience added benefit to
this option too is that if you like
playing in tabletop mode this is going
to give you a better kickstand situation
as well instead of using the single
kickstand on the back of the switch you
get two of them right here so you not
only going to get that battery life but
a better way to have it set up when you
want to play in tabletop now when you're
not playing in handheld mode whether
that's in docked or tabletop mode
there's one very serious issue we need
to talk about and that's controllers
look I love the droid cons I think these
are great little controllers for when
you just want to play something and
you're relaxing you're lazy or laid-back
it's just something you can comfortably
hold in each hand and play a game but if
you're doing anything that's more
serious more competitive and that
includes Fortnite these just aren't
gonna cut it you need to that's gonna
give you a better sense of being able to
reach all the different buttons a good
long-term comfort and just something
that's a better design for intensive
gameplay and there's a couple of ways
you can improve upon this one of them is
getting a comfort grip to put the droid
cons into now the switch does come with
a Nintendo stock version of the comfort
grip but honestly I really don't like
that thing I mean it puts the
in the right shape but the grips on it
are really uncomfortable so if you want
a cheap alternative to it I really
recommend this one from Powerade at
first glance this looks like pretty much
the exact same thing - not having
Nintendo branding all over it but the
important difference is how the grip is
designed instead of being this flat hard
plastic like the Nintendo one has this
guy is a gripped curved design which is
made out of a softer rubber Stu has just
a little bit of give to it and it's just
way more comfortable when you're playing
for long periods of time now on the
other hand if you're willing to spend a
little more money another option is you
can grab this pro charging grip from PDP
now like the power a one you're getting
the revised grip design which is a lot
better it doesn't have the same soft
rubber which I do kind of miss but it is
still a lot more comfortable the really
interesting thing about this one though
is it also augments the triggers on the
droidcon
so it gives you a little front bumpers
for the front ones and actual proper
triggers for zr and ZL which feel a lot
better especially for an FPS on top of
that this is a full kit so it comes with
a couple other extra items one of which
is these thumb grips right here which
are a really nice improvement then make
the thumb sticks just a little larger
but more importantly make them a lot
grippier now if you want to look into
getting some sticks make sure to be a
little careful with other ones you might
buy because there are a lot of them out
there but a big complaint with a lot of
them is that on joy cons they get a
little too big
Tord interferes with being able to press
the B button comfortably which you know
can be a problem now on top of all that
this is a charging grip as well so make
sure that your joke ons are always at
full power whenever you're not playing
you just put it on this little charge
base right here and they'll be good to
go whenever you want to play before
moving on I want to take a second to
thank Epic Games the makers of 4 night
battle royale for sponsoring today's
video like I said earlier for net
battery is free to play and is on
basically every major system out right
now ps4 Xbox one PC Mac mobile and now
switch if you hadn't played for night
before it's a game that since you in
battles have up to a hundred players in
PvP you can play by yourself or with
friends and duo's or squads
there's destructible environments you
can build structures it's a bunch of fun
like I said it's free so you haven't
played it before check out the link we
got down below
that joke on grips are all well and good
and they're a great option if you'll
want to spend a lot of money but at the
end of the day if you really want to
have an advantage playing a competitive
game on the switch you need to have a
proper controller now of course the
official option for this is the switch
pro controller which if you already have
one great go ahead and use that but
honestly it's just kind of okay
it's a solid normal traditional
controller design it's got all the
requisite buttons you need it's a little
pricey for what you get in my opinion
but it's perfectly okay but there's
other options you can go that are either
more affordable or are just straight-up
better so let's look at some of those
first let's talk more affordable now
when you're looking at wired controller
options for the switch there are a lot
of options out there basically every
major third-party accessory company has
made some kind of wired controller for
this switch and my personal favorite out
of the options there for a nice cheap
one is the one from PDP with the PDP
controller you're gonna get a very
similar layout to the switch pro
controller everything is in basically
the same place collecting that switched
around is the plus and minus buttons
have been swapped with the capture and
home buttons which more core gameplay is
not a big deal at all the buttons and
sticks are all solid quality for being
such a cheap controller I really like
the change to the triggers which are
longer which is a little more
comfortable the really nice thing about
this controller though is not only is it
a more affordable alternative to the
switch pro controller but you are also
getting some remappable buttons on the
back we're gonna give you a couple more
options for game play and can be really
useful to mapping certain commands such
as jump to on top of that the PDP
controller comes in a couple different
designs this one in particular actually
has a removable faceplate which you can
put a Mario or Luigi one instead I of
course went for the better of the two
brothers and put Luigi now going in a
much different direction all the
controllers that currently exist for the
switch are fine they're good but there's
a lot of really cool pro controllers out
there that are compatible for other
systems that would just honestly work
better for playing a game like fortnight
and the great thing about the switch is
that there are a lot of options out
there for using other Bluetooth
controllers with the switch and one in
particular is this 8-bit doe receiver
right here this is
really simple setup you just plug this
into your switches dock and you can use
it to sync up with pretty much any other
major controller out there so if you're
a bigger fan of using a dual shock floor
you can use that if you're a big fan of
using the Xbox one controller which is
personally my usual go-to for just a
standard controller design you can use
that as well which works really well for
FPS games but if you want to go even
farther than this you can use the same
receiver to work with any kind of
Bluetooth controller which is higher
quality for instance if you want to use
the Xbox lead controller or if you own a
scuf controller for ps4 those will work
with this setup so if you really want
the biggest advantage you can get you
can use pro controllers from pretty much
any other system as long as they are
wireless and Bluetooth and use them for
fortnight so there's just a couple of
ways that you can enhance your format
game on the switch once again if you
haven't played the game before it's
totally free to play so make sure to
check out the link we have down below
and I will see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
