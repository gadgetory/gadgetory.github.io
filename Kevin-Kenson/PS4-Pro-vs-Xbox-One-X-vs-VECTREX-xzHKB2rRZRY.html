latest offerings from Microsoft and Sony
offering all kinds of fancy features
like 4k gaming and HDR support but the
real question is can either them give
you a true arcade experience it's your
own personal arcade a high performance
system with a built-in game plus a whole
collection of arcade cartridges so if
you're into video games forget the TV
get in the back light pen and 3d image
are available
now the ps4 pro on the Xbox my necks are
impressive it all with their 4k I mean
what is work here really it's basically
just that it displays somewhere around 8
billion pixels
cool the Vectrex on the other hand
doesn't even need any pixels because it
relies on an entirely different method
of display technology called vector
graphics now if you had heard of the
vector X this is a system that came out
back in 1982 was released by a company
called general consumer electronics and
at the time that it was released this
thing was a big hit for all of the year
but until the game crash happened but
that's a whole other story we'll get to
later the point is this was an entirely
different approach to home gaming
systems that no one else had really
tackled before thanks to its unique
approach to graphics a style of display
that was really only used in some
popular arcade games like asteroids
what's really interesting cool about the
vector X is how vector displays differ
from raster displays which is what we've
kind of gotten used to over the years a
raster is something where it's using
pixel by pixel technology refreshing
multiple lines to create one full image
a vector display on the other hand
relies on a constant electron beam that
is only lighting up specific coordinates
on the screen so instead of trying to do
a whole image constantly it's just
lighting up the important parts and
leaving the rest of it blank this
results in a much cleaner and crisper
image than any raster display has done
of course this also limits you to just
having lines now at this point you might
be thinking to yourself Kevin this
comparison is really stupid clearly you
just want an excuse to rant about some
retro machine I've never heard of
now while the vetrix does make use of
the clearly superior display method when
it comes to the hard Tech Specs it does
lag a little bit behind now both the ps4
and Xbox one X do make use of processors
from AMD with the ps4 pro clocked at 2.1
gigahertz and the Xbox one X at 2.3
gigahertz
meanwhile the vetrix is working with an
older processor from Motorola
about 35 years old that runs at one
point five megahertz as for RAM the ps4
pro does of course have 90 gigabytes the
Xbox one X has 12 and the vetrix is
rocking a solid one kilobyte now of
course the most important aspect of
system is what its graphics card escape
flow of and lately the main way people
have kept track of this is through
teraflops so the PS are Pro is capable
of 4.2 teraflops Xbox one x6 teraflops
very impressive
the Victrix on the other hand does not
apply because it doesn't have a graphics
card at all because once again superior
display technology does not need one
game
as I've always said Hardware alone is
not the important thing though what
really matters is what game each system
is gonna let you play and whether or not
it's exclusive now the Xbox one x2 the
ps4 Pro have a lot of titles in common
but lots of great exclusives as well
lots of stuff come and play to this year
like Co Thieves on the Xbox and you've
got a warped PlayStation but the Vectrex
on the other hand is rockin an entire
solid library of 29 games all of which
are completely unique to the system and
not only does it have all these
exclusives it also boasts one of the
rarest games ever made mister Boston's
clean sweep
a special edition version of the game
clean sweep which is very clearly not
pac-man which featured advertisements
for liquor and what's really important
about the exclusivity of these games is
that once again this display technology
is entirely different than any other
console so even if there's game with
similar mechanics it's not going to look
or feel quite the same way it does on
the Vectrex
it's actually really weird how this
looks because the smoothness of motion
is not it is just an entirely different
display technology than what we've kind
of grown accustomed to like I'm weirdly
Saban's then again it's also just a
bunch of lines
if a quad sees the game actually has
like some sense of physics like have a
little drag and stuff when you turn this
is one of those games that reminds you
how spoiled you are when a game just
lets you hold the fire button and not
have to press it every single time on up
oh can teleport oh god what do we have
let's try Armour attack that's more
colorful I love how you can tell by the
way that this is an old system because
the power button is also the sound so
you turn it and then you keep turning it
to make it louder I think one of the
really cool things but how they approach
making the system though was how they
differentiated the games it wasn't just
a matter of getting a cart that placed
something different but how each of them
came with these little slips that
actually changed the whole interface of
the vetrix itself and also double that's
like a little instruction mail it's just
a really neat idea it really does turn
it almost into like just a little tiny
arcade cabinet like my brain keeps
anticipating that things aren't going to
move as fast as they do or be as smooth
and then I start doing stuff and and
then we have another insert for Star
Trek the motion picture I bet this is
totally gonna be about peaceful space
exploration and making friends this is
not an all about making friends old
school yes kind of turret
this is so weird how they just try to
get these ideas across nope nope nope
nope nope it's really like I wonder how
much of a difference having is like a
little target and stuff makes I'm gonna
take it out let's see how the game looks
without it it's much more dull winning
really white playing this is really
interesting because then I definitely
have all the different like home
consoles that have been made and you
know going back and playing retro stuff
this is completely different because it
uses such a different display technology
and is based on kind of just an entirely
different premise than we've kind of
gotten accustomed to which makes it like
a really unique experience even holding
up to kinda just playing games today
that come out having this different
method of display just gives it this
feeling that isn't really captured with
you know traditional pixelation type
stuff it makes a lot of sense that this
did really well when it very first came
out it just had really unfortunate
timing when it came to market and
completely derailed the whole concept
really decide
now as for the physical design of these
systems I will have to say that the ps4
pro and the Xbox 1x both do an excellent
job of being pretty systems but they
entirely sacrifice function perform the
Vectrex on the other hand is often your
way to store your controller as part of
the system it is a built-in TV screen
and it has a handle making it portable
does your xbox 1x have a handle if it
said more dammit
so what is this amazing system going to
cost you well as we know the ps4 pearl
runs for $400 the Xbox one Express for
$500 the vetrix on the other hand when
it originally launched in 1982 ran for
$200 which sadly caused inflation that
number changes pushing up to now a value
of about $500 a little bit over so bad
on par with the Xbox 1x however that is
not the price that stayed at forever
basically when it first came out the
system sold really well Milton Bradley
bought the company took over started
selling more of them and then the game
crash happened Milton Bradley got bought
out and the vetrix was now worth well
not much money at all and was then
selling for $50 putting it at a
modern-day value about 126 pretty fair
honestly though and you're actually
searching for old-school systems like
this it's gonna run you for somewhere
around $300 a little over if it's in
good condition a lot more than that if
you find it with the box
the vetrix is a really cool and unique
part of gaming history because it's a
system that tried to do something
different than the rest of its
competition and for a brief time did a
really good job at it at least until a
certain games crash happened that ruined
well everything while vector displays
may have been due from the start thanks
to the fact that raster displays would
eventually do things like sprites and
polygons and all kinds of fancier
looking stuff it still offered a unique
experience unlike anything else of its
competition it's the only system to
offer this kind of interface that was a
home system with an incorporated screen
and I think that's so important to
recognize because I think for a little
while now the industry got so focused on
just the competition for higher
resolutions higher frame rates all that
kind of stuff
and lately we're kind of seeing a bit of
a shift again where Nintendo did
something different and it resonated
with people and I think that's what
really shows kind of the spirit of what
gamers want cool innovative fun things
that are different</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
