Gears of War came out and we're now
officially five games into the series so
how do they all stack up to each other
is the brand-new Gears of War 4 the best
worst middle let's rank them and find
out at the bottom number five is Gears
of War judgment easily the worst Gears
of War game it isn't necessarily bad if
it were the only Gears game made it
might even be considered great but
compared to everything that came out
before it it just falls completely flat
on its face offering one of the worst
campaigns in the series it tried to do
this whole mini mission approach to
things where you'd competitively try to
get top scores for each chapter but this
led to a campaign that just felt like a
lot of mini missions with a bear thread
of a plot connecting them all together
and this isn't helped by the game having
some of the weakest dialogue in the
franchise the actual core gameplay was
still solid but it did little to nothing
to differentiate itself from what was
already done in three making it feel
like it really wasn't a new Gears game
at all and ultimately pretty forgettable
coming in at number four is the original
Gears of War now when it was first
released this was an excellent game and
for many people was the reason they got
a 360 in the first place it didn't
reinvent the wheel exactly cover
shooters existed before it but Gears of
War represented a refinement of that
genre to a whole new level
offering tight cover controls and
environments built specifically around
the cover mechanic not to mention it was
one of the best split-screen co-op games
of its generation sadly though time has
not been the best to it and while it was
great for its day it just doesn't hold
up as well when its sequels did such an
excellent job of building and improving
upon it the AI is not exactly the series
finest and the plotline is really really
straightforward and is honestly kind of
adult backdrops just justified needing
to kill a lot of things until you see
the credits roll if you haven't played
any of the Gears games before this one
can be worth checking out first but
doing it later it's just not gonna hold
up now right in the middle at third
place is Gears of War 4 while coming
from a new studio this game did a much
better job of acting as a sort of mini
reboot to the series than judgment wise
its team of heroes are a lot more glib
and give a greater sense of energy than
weariness present in the originals and
while the overall story has its problems
or easily has the best character banter
its biggest strength really comes from
what few changes they did take risks
with introducing a lot of new
environmental factors like strong winds
and cover that can turn into enemies if
destroyed and some really interesting
new weapons like the drop shot rendering
cover is kind of pointless if you can
time it right an upgraded horde mode and
redone multiplayer unlock system around
all this out really nicely but the one
thing holding this game back
is it knew it wanted to be the start of
a new trilogy and drove that point home
a little too hard the last act while fun
is a rush to a finish that doesn't
really feel like a resolution at all
with a cliffhanger that's kind of cool
and concept but doesn't really have that
much impact in the way it's delivered in
the end making it feel like an action
heavy prologue to something greater we
could hope to see in a couple years it's
a great start but the assumption of
future games and having little
exposition about the world keeps it from
really topping the better games in the
series which leads us to number two on
this list Gears of War 3 there's a lot
that Gears of War 3 did right it had
easily the strongest and best opening in
the whole series and for the most part
the campaign kept that energy up it had
some of the greatest variety of
environments even if they were all still
multiple shades of brown it introduced a
whole bunch of new enemies and offered
some of the best specific fights and
battles to stick into your memory its
biggest problem though is how it served
as the original trilogy's finale as much
effort as there was to expand the scope
of the campaign that much more when too
trying to add a layer of emotion to the
story that just couldn't help but feel
forced and unsatisfactory there's a lot
of character development and plot
revelations that come out of nowhere in
the last act it was just trying to do so
much all at once it killed any sense of
pacing it was still a fantastic game
overall but much like for it felt like
had just missed a few important beats to
really put it at the top and that's what
leads us to the best gears of war game
which you've probably figured out by now
by process of elimination Gears of War 2
while 3 did a good job of fine-tuning
the gameplay of to 2 was leaps and
ahead of the original two took what was
originally a macho fueled non-stop
action game with a few hinting zuv
greater plot that was left unexplored
and actually started to take its time
fleshing everything out characters
started to have more backstory and
personality and the thematic tones
running underneath the campaign began to
have a lot more going on aside from just
hell yeah blow stuff up well it didn't
try to tackle his grand of a story as
three that's part of its strength it has
a much more focused plot and storyline
with a handful of emotional scenes that
are still some of these strongest
moments across the whole franchise and
let's not forget an opening that was
pretty much just straight out of Lord of
the Rings corny but pretty epic feeling
at the same time tack on to this the
introduction of the Horde multiplayer
mode a lotta refinements to core
gameplay like chainsaw duels and a much
more fleshed out an interesting Locust
civilization and to just hit all of the
right notes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
