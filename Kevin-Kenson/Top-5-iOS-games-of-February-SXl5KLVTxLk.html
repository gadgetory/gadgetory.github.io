guys another top 5 iOS games this time
for February 2015 this month list has
got a lot of games leaning more towards
the simpler side I got a lot of arcade
inspired games ranging from a
side-scrolling shooter that definitely
owes some roots to Galaga as well as a
game that looks a lot like super hexagon
but a little more on the trippy side
rather than just brutally difficult now
to balance out those four simple games
though I do have one game that's
anything but simple and that's the
charming but also very challenging all
row a monster buffing adventure now to
be perfectly honest this game can
definitely be a little overwhelming at
first you want to make sure you run
through all the tutorials before you
start trying to attempt the main game
but once you do you'll find to be a very
satisfying and very challenging puzzle
game the entire idea is that you move
around the character ro and your goal is
to bump enemies off the side of the map
however they also have different ways of
moving different special attacks
different ways they mess with your
movement and so you have to keep an
account of how each enemy acts the
upside is they all move when you do so
you can take your time planning which
hexagon to move to and which moves you
want to use when to best disable all
your opponents it's definitely on a game
you want to pick up if you just want to
mess with something every now and then
for a little bit but if you want to gain
this gonna challenge you and you can
really soak some time into this is a
great option for $3 not to mention it
has a really charming aesthetic so since
we started with the most complex game
let's start moving on to games in order
of simplicity starting with magic touch
wizard for hire now this is a free
arcade style game though it does have
in-app purchases in the form of buying
currency but all that really does is get
you unlocks faster there are things that
you could get just by playing the game
that often which really is really easy
to do with this game it's very very
addictive the entire idea is that there
are these falling enemies that you have
to prevent from landing on the ground
and the way you do that is by having a
tres different symbols on the screen you
can use both your hands if you want to
draw multiple symbols at the same time
which is basically a requirement when
there's enough enemies showing up at
once and it just gets absolutely hectic
as you get farther and start unlocking
new abilities you do gain special powers
you can use when they show up they hang
around long enough so you don't have to
use them the moment they appear and you
can save them for situations that are
absolutely necessary such as slowing
time down for a little bit it looks easy
at first but it gets very
very quickly and it's one of those games
where I feel like really getting a high
score just has the best feeling of you
having earned it and smashing what your
friends have gotten so far next up at
just a dollar is star drift now this
game definitely owes a lot of its basic
idea to old-school Galaga rules you're
playing as a spaceship that's shooting
other ships and occasionally having to
dodge things that are going to run into
you the difference though is that this
is a side-scrolling game and the way you
control your movement is by holding the
screen to move up really seem to move
down you'll automatically keep firing
lasers and as you pick up power-ups
you'll fire more often or in spread
shots more powerful shots all the usual
upgrades you're used to in this style of
game it's not the most original game out
on the market but it's just different
enough that for only $1 it's a really
great addictive choice not to mention it
just has a solid look now 4th on the
list
at $2 is the prettiest game in my
opinion at least one of the most
relaxing and that's Altos adventure now
this is another game whose mechanic is
really simply doesn't yet tap the screen
to jump you do that to avoid rocks to
land on Rails to catch coins to catch
power-ups or just cash llamas it's
another genre that anyone who's a fan of
iOS games should be fairly familiar with
but one thing that I think this game
does an excellent job of landing right
on the nose is the aesthetic it's the
bright balance of being really beautiful
it is shifting day and night cycles and
it's just a really relaxing game overall
it's not a high stress tapping game it's
one where you can just kind of kill some
time lay back and just enjoy the
aesthetic while trying to get the
highest score you can but you never get
too angry about it now if you're
wondering how you get any simpler than
this well here's psych this is a
free-to-play game that does have
advertisements but you can also remove
them by paying just two dollars psych
follows in the footsteps of other hectic
games like super hexagon where the idea
is really simple all you need to do is
move your arrow forward without getting
on the wrong track but as you play the
game and get farther not only your
things going faster but the screens
gonna start shifting and morphing in
different ways you'll start having weird
waveforms thing is going to change
perspective and it just does things to
really start to well as they would imply
psych you out definitely not the most
complex game but it is one that can get
pretty difficult as you get farther in
the later stages and you really need to
pay attention and have a calm state of
mind to get the highest score possible
well there you guys have it my favorite
iOS games of February 2015 now there
