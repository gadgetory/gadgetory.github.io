us just a quick little video to talk
about the latest DLC for Dead Rising 3
let's see if we can get through the name
without messing up super ultra Dead
Rising 3 arcade remix hyper edition IX +
alpha now this was both simultaneously
announced and released during
Microsoft's press conference and was
really one of the bigger surprises to
come out of it is basically Capcom
vancouver's love letter to fans of all
things Capcom while it is Dead Rising 3
at its core the DLC pulls a lot of
influence from other Capcom franchises
some big some small including the likes
of Megaman Street Fighter rival schools
Breath of Fire Darkstalkers Onimusha and
much much more
the entire experience is one big
tongue-in-cheek arcade style game in
which a single player or up to four
players online can work together to
accomplish a number of different tasks
within a time limit such as killing so
many zombies rescuing pixelated
survivors or just destroyed different
objective points players can choose to
control one of four different major dead
rising characters from the whole series
but more importantly you can lock
playable variations of them cause
playing as other Capcom characters and
getting abilities and fighting styles
mimicking them some are relatively
low-key like getting a lot of gun
attacks while some can get really crazy
like summoning dinosaurs or using magic
players don't start out with any of
these costumes though they have to
unlock them by saving up money from
completing missions or meeting certain
prerequisites like playing a certain
character so many times or finding
arcade cabinets hidden in levels the
heart and soul of this game really is in
both its silliness and nostalgia factors
the amount of crazy things you can do
with each costume is absolutely insane
and if you're a gamer that's kept up
with a lot of different Capcom titles
there's all kinds of different little
references and gems to set off your
nostalgia factor not just in the
costumes alone but in levels featuring
theme songs from previous games like
dials theme from Street Fighter 2 or
Megaman X 2's opening theme power-ups
like Arthur's golden helm from ghosts
and goblins with the beard included or
even mission objectives like destroying
a car fighting zombified versions of
Capcom villains now while it is
completely silly and tons of fun to play
at first and you'll just find yourself
laughing a bunch while playing it there
are certain downsides to this game
mainly in terms of just the amount of
content has to offer and its core
gameplay the game only has four levels
overall and all of them can be completed
in a single sitting
level objectives don't scale with party
size and it's possible to do the whole
thing solo so with two players it
becomes
and at three or four players it gets the
point of being so simple that you're
mainly playing it just to see which of
you can get the highest score amongst
the group with little to no difficulty
from the game itself a single
playthrough might feel like enough to
just get through the game's challenges
but as I said earlier the main appeal of
this game is its nostalgia and silly
factors so there's a very good chance
that if you get into what the game has
to offer
you'll probably end up doing two to
three full playthroughs at the least so
you can unlock all the different
costumes you can which thankfully bumps
up the game's playtime value there's
really only so much that can be said
about a game whose core mechanic and
goal is so simple and straightforward
but what's really great about this DLC
is that it's so transparent you
basically get exactly what you think
you're paying for and for being such a
very specific niche type of DLC it's
just amazing
I do wish it was standalone I really
feel like a lot more people would be
willing to check this out that don't
already own Dead Rising 3 and it always
saddens me to see an arcade-style co-op
game like this not offer local couch
co-op but still at $10 anyone who's a
longtime fan of Capcom titles or just a
fan of doing really silly shit in a game
will find this really easily worth
purchasing if you already own the base
game and if you don't this might just be
the final straw to push you towards it
or make it a future purchase to keep in
mind once it's price starts to drop so
that was just a quick look at super
ultra Dead Rising 3 arcade remix hyper
edition ax + alpha if you guys enjoyed
