owners have had is the lack of a d-pad
on the left joy con and we've gone over
a couple different ways you can address
this problem if you'd like to first off
there is of course a separately sold
cheaper joy con made by Horry which
features a d-pad but is missing a lot of
functions of a traditional joy con and
then there is of course the option of
doing your own shell exchange which runs
a lot of risks but does give you a fully
functioning joy con plus d-pad well
today we've got a third option that runs
the cheapest and possibly even the most
convenient option out of the mall and
that's a gel case for the joy con which
adds a little d-pad overlay on top of
the button so we're gonna talk about how
this method compares to the other
options and whether or not this is the
way to go first let's do a brief recap
on the two methods we've covered before
starting with the hoary deep edge
Wakanda these are sold separately for
twenty-five dollars there's only the
left show come by itself they don't come
in and kind of pair anything and the
main thing this does is well give you a
d-pad now this is not a fully functional
joy con you cannot use it wirelessly it
has no battery it is only usable in the
handheld mode for the switch once
directly connected the option will not
work now when it comes to just giving
you a d-pad in handheld mode I think it
does a pretty good job the d-pad is a
slightly more old-school style where it
has this kind of softness to it it's not
clicky like the buttons on a regular joi
con which is kind of a matter of
personal preference I do kind of like
the click enos a little more but the
still works really well aside from the
obvious fact this has to be plugged in
at all times there are a couple of there
downsides that it has compared to a
regular joi con it does not have motion
controls it doesn't have vibration and
its shape is just a little different
compared to regular drug cons it has a
little up raised area on the back where
the release button is and because of
that certain grip cases for handheld
mode are actually not going to fit while
you're using this droidcon which is a
big problem on the upside though I do
really like the designs at Hori has done
for these controllers I think they're
really good looking I love the zelda one
the Mauryan one's a little more hit and
miss for me though I love the color red
on it and they do have a Pokemon one
coming out really soon - that looks
really nice now as for the other option
that we've done before there's also of
course the shell exchanger I think
results in the best feeling d-pad out of
these two options because it still uses
the internal switches on the joique on
it just replaces it with this deep
so it feels like those buttons but gives
you that d-pad feeling which I really
like basically you've never seen this
done before you have to take apart the
joy con remove the shells and then
disassemble the insides by undoing some
cables and then rebuild it together with
the new shell
which has a lot of problems because you
could accidentally shock something you
could destroy a cable and thus making
the joy con completely unusable it's
also technically the most expensive
option because while the shell exchange
itself is fairly cheap you do have to
use up a regular joi con at the same
time so either you're buying enjoy con
separately or using the one that came
with your switch and if you end up
accidentally breaking that well name to
buy a whole nother joy con so it's a
little dangerous that being said if you
are successful unlike the hoary joke on
this is still a fully functional joy con
you can use it wirelessly you have
vibration you have motion controls
overall a much better control as for our
third option the gel covers these come
from a company called a collective minds
and they actually reached out to me
after seeing the other D pad videos and
sent these out for me to try out and
we're gonna have these link down below
in the description along with the other
two options if you guys want to check
them out first off this is the cheapest
choice out of the whole group it's 10
bucks for a pair of covers like this as
opposed to the $15 the shell exchange
will get you plus not to mention the
droidcon itself and $25 for the Hori
joint con they also come in three
different colors we have the red ones
right here they also have a black and
blue and the idea behind how these work
is actually really simple it's just a
gel cover that goes over the joy con if
it's nice and tight super easy to apply
easy to take off and it adds this little
d-pad cover onto the left joy con that
it covers the four directional buttons
so in theory this is actually very
similar to the shell exchange where it
puts the d-pad over the four switches
but in this case it's the d-pad hitting
the buttons which is then hitting the
switches as a result it kind of has a
feeling that's like the midpoint between
the other two options it's not soft like
the Hori one you still get a little bit
of click enos but it's not the same
degree that you get with the shell
exchange by the way if you like the look
at these grips but like I recommended
you don't want to use the right one a
really great way to get a matching
droidcon is to actually use a skin made
by today's sponsor D brand they've made
a whole line of skins that are totally
safe to use on joy cons on the switch
itself is on the dock and they come in a
wide variety of colors from matching
with this guy there's some really great
choices for red blue and a carbon fiber
black that looks great if you want to
check them out and getting more info
check out the link down below something
that's unique about this design versus
the other two is that it's the only
d-pad that uses the webbing design
instead of the traditional just straight
cross the upside of this is that if
there's ever a game that has rolling
inputs using a d-pad it's a lot easier
to perform with this as
the gel design itself it's very
comfortable I think it works well over a
long period of time gaming the only
thing that's kind of a downside to it is
that the softness on the capture button
and minus button feels a little awkward
but since these aren't usually super
important buttons for mid B gameplay
it's not that big of a deal and it still
leaves the shoulder buttons and coverage
those works just like normal where you
start to run into problems with this
design though is the right joint con
like the left row con it has a little
bit of the softness on the Plus and home
screen buttons but the real issue with
this is that while the left joi con gets
that d-pad cover the right Detroit con
just leaves the ABXY buttons exposed
which you would think is a good thing
but because the padding on this is
pretty thick it ends up causing the
buttons to be flush with the rest of the
body which doesn't feel very comfortable
to me now thankfully this is a very easy
problem to avoid you just don't use this
cover which might sound a little silly
because you're buying this paired thing
for ten dollars but honestly just to get
the benefit of this d-pad alone at that
price I think it's still worth picking
up even if you're not actually going to
use this one it might cause a little
visual mismatching but I think it ends
up working out a lot better just
sticking to the one side there really
big benefit to this design versus the
other options is the convenience and the
lack of permanency with the Hori d-pad
joy con you bought a whole other joke on
you're holding on to with the shell
exchange droidcon you're doing this
whole heavy process that might cause
something to break and even then if it
works you're down one right joy con with
traditional buttons in this case it's
just a cover that you can add and remove
whenever you want at your leisure for
only ten bucks at the end of the day I
do think that the shell exchange does
result in a more comfortable better
d-pad design but for something that's
cheaper and less risky and is something
you can undo and redo as you wish this
is a great option</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
