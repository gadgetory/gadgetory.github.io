again where some of you
are gonna be enjoying a fine meal shared
with your significant
other, and the rest of you
can enjoy the satisfaction of having
a whole pizza to yourself.
That's right, it's Valentine's Day,
and some gaming companies
have found an interesting
way to celebrate it, like Scuf.
To celebrate Valentine's,
Scuf is releasing different
special colored controllers in chocolate,
teal, or magenta, like this guy right here
for their PS4 line.
And you may be wondering,
is it worth picking up
one of these controllers for myself?
Should I grab one for my partner?
Let's dive in and see what you get out of
the Scuf Impact Controller.
(electronic beeps)
Now we've covered
Scuf controllers before on
this channel, but back then,
the only option they had available for PS4
was this guy right
here, the Scuf Infinity,
which is basically a heavily
modified PS4 controller,
and in the time since
then, they've released
a more updated option where
you can still grab this,
but instead, you can
also opt for the Impact.
The biggest change obviously
is the shell design,
this is still a modified PS4 controller,
keep in mind, but they've actually added
a new exterior shell,
which changes the grip
and shaping and also
increases the number of
back paddles from two to four.
But otherwise, you're still getting a lot
of the same core benefits that's offered
by going with Scuf.
If you're unfamiliar with
the benefits of Scuf,
there's actually quite a few,
I mean the big point of the company
is that you're able to sort
of customize each controller,
fit to order, so you can pick and choose
which features you want.
For instance, as far as sticks go,
there are five different designs,
one of which is just the
standard PS4 controller,
but then you can go for
ones that have different
stick heads, different stick lengths,
and you even have the
ability to easily swap
them out using a tool
that comes with every
Scuf controller you pick up.
Triggers have a very
similar story going on,
you can hit two different
kind of trigger heads,
either these ones, which are
the more standard length,
or a longer one.
You can also change the
sensitivity on the triggers,
using a handy little
tool, as well as changing
how quickly they'll stop
if you want just a nice,
little quick pull feeling going on.
The most significant thing though,
that's offered by Scuf is what's going on
on the back right here with these paddles.
These four back paddles here
act as programmable buttons
that can copy any of the other
buttons on the controller.
Whether you wanna use the face buttons,
the shoulder buttons, or
even clicking in the sticks.
The idea being, in some
games, you might run into
a situation where say,
you wanna look around
with the left stick, right stick,
directions.
Say you wanna look around
with the right stick,
but you also wanna jump at the same time,
which isn't really feasible
with only one thumb.
So these back paddles
are gonna give you a way
to change that command
to going there as well,
so you just have to click back here,
and you're still able to use your thumb
where you need it.
And what's a really neat feature too
about the way Scuf handles
this is that they actually
have this little magnetic tool
that attaches to the
back of the controller,
and that's how you activate
reprogrammable mode.
So as long as you don't have that tool
anywhere near the controller,
there's no chance you're
gonna accidentally
reprogram something in
the middle of game play,
and instead, you're just able to set it up
before each game to
make sure it's tailored
just for that experience.
So really easy to change out,
but not something where
you're gonna accidentally
do it in the middle of a match.
Aside from that, there are a few other
customizable features you
can get on this controller,
for instance, you can
see on the back here,
there's this different grip,
which offers less slippage,
so if you're playing game a long time,
and you're maybe prone to sweaty palms,
this is gonna make sure
that you don't slip
while holding the controller,
and something that we
didn't get on this design
is you can get a special circle pad
that goes on top of the D pad,
which aids in doing different
certain circle motions
and can be beneficial in
situations like fighting games.
So both controllers are gonna
get you all these benefits,
but I wanna go back to how
the Impact is an improvement
over the Infinity.
I mean, the obvious thing is the fact
that it has four paddles on the back,
so you're getting twice as
many customizable options,
but I really don't wanna
understate how important
the change in shape is.
I really think this redesigned grip,
which let's be honest, is clearly inspired
by an Xbox One controller,
is a lot more comfortable,
not just in terms of how
it affects how you're
holding the controller,
but I think it also
kind of just makes your
fingers naturally gravitate
closer to the back paddles,
so it feels a lot less
unnatural when you're hitting them,
as opposed to with the Infinity,
where you kinda have to reach over
every now and then.
I also think that just visually,
it's a big upgrade too,
because, especially when you
have this redesigned grip
going on on the back, on the Infinity,
since it uses the PS4
design, it wraps around
to the front, which creates
this kinda odd look to me
that I've just never been a fan of.
With the Impact however,
the entire front has its own
shell design, which'll look great,
and keeps the grip on the back.
Now compared to other pro controllers
that we've talked about on the PS4,
one of the big benefits
of Scuf is the sheer
amount of physical
modular options you have
right on the controller,
changing out the triggers,
the sticks, having
different D pad options,
being able to remap these right here
without having to use
any kind of software,
but on the other hand,
compared to some options,
you are losing out on things
like software customization,
like changing stick sensitivity,
you're not gonna be able to
have any onboard audio controls,
but one huge upside to this is the fact
that since this is
basically just a heavily
modified PS4 controller,
you're still getting
a lot of the benefits of
an official PS4 controller,
like having a built in headphone jack,
and being able to play both wirelessly,
and wired, as opposed to being stuck
with just a wired setup
where you're always afraid
you're gonna rip the cable out mid game.
So if you or your partner wanna celebrate
with somethin' a little different from
the standard roses and chocolates,
this is a really cool way to go.
Or honestly, if you just
like magenta or teal,
have at it.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
