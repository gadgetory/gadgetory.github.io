after having waited a bit thanks to
import time I finally got these in
splatoon joy Khan's for the switch now
these are released in Europe and Japan
to celebrate the release of splatoon -
but sadly there is no sign of them
coming to the US just yet but clearly
you can import them now the way these
are tied into splatoon is pretty obvious
they are the colors of the two sort of
default themes that you see on the cover
of the game green and pink and like all
the switch toy cons they have that
signature neon tint to them making them
really bright now an interesting
decision with these is the fact that
unlike the neon red and blue which come
in a separate pack and you can buy
double blue or double red these are only
available with having a left green and a
right pink no option otherwise
whatsoever so you can't double up on
these just yet so with the release of
these we now have five different sets of
joy Khan's leading to a total of 25
different combinations before we get to
a full montage of what all 25 would look
like let's do a brief overview of the
different colors so far to begin with
the basic gray ones
not my favorite not the one I hate the
most either but it's just very plain and
simple this is probably going to be the
color that's kind of remembered as the
default switch look which is kind of a
shame really because I love all the
different bright colors they've gone
with for all the other designs now after
that we have double blue now as far as
just a single color goes this one's
actually probably my favorite I think
it's just the right balance of being
that kind of bright vibrant color that
we're getting with all these neon
designs but it's not too much which is
exactly the problem I have with the
double red now personally the kind of
travesty for me because I love the color
red but these things are just super
bright it doesn't always come across
that well in pictures or video but trust
me these things assault your eyeballs
it's kind of almost a more same in color
than straight-up red but as bright as
these ones are they aren't nearly as
close to being as bright as the double
yellow now these ones released alongside
arms and within that context actually
makes a lot of sense these things look
great when you're playing arms you have
that menu screen in the same color
yellow out front of that so these are
honestly probably my least favorite I
mean they don't look absolutely terrible
but it's just a bit too much for me
personally and after these
that brings us to the brand-new splatoon
ones now these ones I really like I mean
the entire neon aesthetic with all these
controllers I think is a really cool
vibrant look but the color is green and
pink I think just really evoke that
classic 80s neon color more than any of
the others and if it weren't for certain
other two color combination this one
would be my absolute favorite it's a
very close second and alluded to the red
and blue combination which to me it just
is there's this classic feeling of
player 1 player 2 red versus blue I just
I love it now this is my go-to but let's
take a look at what some other people's
favorite combinations are
he's telling I've seen not seen most of
these joy Khan okay so think if I want
to go like that with blue but that's for
anything I feel like I immediately know
what I'm going to pick I always go for a
good cut and can be affected my doing
pink and blue I kind of like like a
little awesome the original like it's a
little more like oh that is my choice
just because it's kind of close to like
that tail deep blue although I felt like
we're creeping into day 2d territory on
if I like the yellow therapy gel is
alive I kind of like this one because
it's a little bit obnoxious and that's
kind of my style and and I like this one
it's like a brilliant peach kind of so
I'm going to go with these two because
bright colors make me happy even though
I'm actually a pretty big fan of the joy
conscious and gray that's a pretty good
combo
anyone else take a tumble yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
