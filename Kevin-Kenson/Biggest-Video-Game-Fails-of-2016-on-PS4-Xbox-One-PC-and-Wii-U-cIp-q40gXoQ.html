out but it also had its fair share of
games that just flat-out fell on their
faces I'm not talking about simply bad
games I'm talking about games that
promise so much or it's such a strong
name to carry on that completely and
totally failed hard kicking things off
is battleborn now unlike the rest of the
games coming up on this list battle
points problem wasn't really itself it
didn't make any particularly outlandish
promises it's a new IP and the final
game while not incredible isn't bad
really it's only problem is a simple one
it isn't overwatch while not really the
same kind of game both of them came out
of the storm of titles looking to
capitalize on the success of MOBAs like
League of Legends and dota 2 by making
games focused on playable heroes with
big personalities and minimal actual
backstory battleborn accomplished this
with Gearbox's sense of humor that many
may recognize from the borderlands
series and really in a void that may
have sold perfectly fine but the sheer
marketing and name power of Blizzard was
enough to make anyone completely forget
battleborn was even a thing the game's
initial sales while not bad were still
below what 2k games was hoping to see
and the moment overwatch went live the
game's player base and viewership on
Twitch plummeted to near nothing the
lesson the moment Blizzard announces a
game competing with your own title you
better make something pretty damn
amazing if you want it to keep living
next up is a fail that's much closer to
my heart Mirror's Edge catalyst now
while this game did an entirely bomb it
is one of the many games that came out
in 2016 that completely failed to
recapture and in my opinion even
understand what made its cult classic
predecessor well good
the original Mirror's Edge was simple
and straightforward run as fast as you
can through every stage once to complete
the game's story and then several times
more to do your best to rank on the
games online scoreboards well after
forever of not hearing anything about a
new one ea dragged us along for a couple
years with bits and pieces of info about
a new impending Mirror's Edge only to
finally deliver a game that was anything
but like the original sure the core
mechanics are the same you run from
place to place and there's a time trial
element but catalyst took things in a
new unknown
Cerie direction with the addition of a
small and constrained open world you had
a run back and forth back and forth
across along with new RPG and leveling
mechanics that didn't really need to
exist and added nothing to the game's
fun factor
not to mention whole parts of the game
referring you to fight enemies
toe-to-toe when really the whole point
should be just keep running
throw in copious amounts of bugs and a
bland story with a handful of
underdeveloped characters and you get a
perfectly blast sequel that completely
missed what made the original great now
speaking of weird not sequels slash
reboots that failed to recapture
classical gems this was also the year
that we were graced with Star Fox zero
twenty sixteen was not a great year for
the Wii U the system officially saw the
end of production way sooner than any
previous Nintendo system and the number
of great games to come out on it were a
grand total of two pokken and Tokyo
Mirage sessions whose a mileage may vary
based on your taste Star Fox zero was
hoped to be the other good game to come
out in the system this year a sort of
last hurrah for it and its last breaths
but instead of a nostalgic returned one
of the best n64 games we got an
uncontrollable mess that while featuring
levels that were basically remixes of
classic favorites back to any of the
charm they once had it tried to be a
remake while doing something new at the
same time yet nothing of what was added
was really very good so instead of a
faithful pretty remake or a brand new
game and similar spirit
we got a bizarre hybrid of the two ideas
that gets muddled further by it's
painful controls admittedly there is a
decent game underneath all the problems
but the time spent playing it would be
better spent just playing the original
game on n64 or even the remake on 3ds
now while all these games have had their
problems the next two really stood out
this year the first of which breaks my
heart the most on this list mighty
number nine
growing up the Mega Man franchise was
one of my favorites and to this day
Megaman X stands out as one of my
top-five personal favorite games so when
its creator Keiji Inafune a promised a
spiritual successor on Kickstarter of
course I was excited sadly the resulting
game has become one of the landmark
examples of what not to do when
kick-starting a video game the core
gameplay and direction of the game did
show some promise of being a
mr. paste Megaman but it pretty much
suffered in every category terrible
visuals an uninspiring soundtrack awful
voiceovers weak level design and a bland
story that made the whole package
unappealing this game was in serious
need of polishing in all core aspects
with time instead spent on implementing
all kinds of bonus features and added
content promised by stretch goals like
challenge levels and online co-op
missions which were just as bland as the
rest of the game doing nothing to
elevate it there were some good ideas
buried somewhere in here but it all just
gets lost and how lacking the game is in
every way and then we come to a game
that should be no surprise a title that
promised to be so much and met pretty
much none of those promises at least at
launch and that's no man's sky this was
one of the most anticipated games of
2016 and boy did everyone's tone change
about this game the moment it was
released during its whole hype build up
people were treated to visions of
beautifully generated planets filled
with plant and animal life that looked
absolutely bizarre yet gorgeous what we
got instead were procedurally generated
worlds that more often than not followed
five or six general patterns that you
recognized more and more while playing
the game that were often actually kind
of sparse all animal life spread out in
a way that made every world feel more
barren than trailers and screenshots led
many to believe the real breaking point
for a lot of people though was the lack
of clarity regarding whether or not the
game supported some form of multiplayer
all kinds of big things were said before
about how the universe was so large
you'd never encounter another player and
while the exact phrase multiplayer was
never used a lot of things were said
that made people assume that was a
feature all these differences between
the game we were promised and the game
we got led to a lot of anger including
things like lawsuits for false
advertising or just good old fashioned
death threats and amid all this anger
hello games did of course the worst
thing you could do nothing remaining
completely silent regarding all the
problems for quite some time until
eventually revealing some post-launch
DLC and updates that while still not
making the game what people were hoping
for did add some cool new stuff to at
least make the game we got
whatever your personal feelings are
about no man's sky there is no denying
that it is easily the biggest video game
fail of 2016 if only improving how
dangerous pre-ordering is and how dumb
hype can be</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
