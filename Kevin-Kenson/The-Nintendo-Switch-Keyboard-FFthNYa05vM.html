switch is just the large number of durin
accessories you can design for it's so
adaptable that allows for a huge range
of different weird things and I
especially love any of them that allow
you to actually connect and use joy cons
which brings us to today's piece the
switch keyboard now you might be
wondering why does this exist for the
switch I mean there's not exactly a lot
of games out there that use a keyboard
right true at least in the u.s. I mean
as far as using keyboard most games go
there's only very specific situations
you have to use one and it most
something like naming your character in
Skyrim otherwise uses for a keyboard are
pretty limited right now especially it's
been really have any kind of full online
system for chat or anything which is why
this actually isn't available in the US
at all it's currently exclusive to Japan
but it was pretty easy to import and the
reasons available in Japan is because
there's a single mo available on the
switch only in Japan which is Dragon
Quest 10 and for a game like that it
makes a lot of sense to have a keyboard
available because yeah you can adapt it
to being able to play comfortably and do
things like combat and that'll make
sense but as soon as you want a chatty
in game not having a keyboard is
basically garbage and then I started and
this is even the first ones I actually
made for add rehnquist has been out for
some time in Japan now and they had
another one from Horry release that was
just a regular keyboard that would hook
into the switch but what's interesting
on this one is it comes for his company
called cyber gadget and as you can see
it actually attaches the joy counts onto
it as well it is still a wired keyboard
setup but it creates something that fits
a little more I think with the overall
theme of how the switch is designed and
in fact for Nintendo this isn't even an
idea that is unique to the switch this
is something that Nintendo has done and
licensed before back in 2002 on the
GameCube back when fantasy star 1 &amp;amp; 2
came out once again and most situation
keyboards are her little handy they
released an ascii controller that was
kind of ridiculous looking because here
you know it's a standalone keyboard that
has slots for the droid constituent a
ch2 back then it was just a gamecube
controller with a full keyboard to put
in the middle of it and it was stretched
out and just this insane looking piece
of tech now as I said this is something
that we can't actually fully make use of
in the US yet because there's not any
games that really require it but that
doesn't mean you
can't use it at all this will hook up to
a u.s. switch and work just fine for the
few and very limited applications where
will come up so let's check it out
by the way if you're wondering what joy
Kahn's we have attached to the keyboard
these are actually skin joy Kahn's made
by today's sponsor Dee brand they have a
whole bunch of in switch skins that are
safe to use on the dock on the switch
itself and of course joy cause you can
get them in seven different colors or in
white or a couple different black
options the one we're using right now is
my personal favorite the carbon fibers
if you're interested checking them out
and wanna grab some check out the link
down below so obviously this isn't gonna
be the most in-depth test in the world
I'm just going to find a place where I
need to enter text and try using the
keyboard instead of the pop-up one on
the switch so I'm just gonna go to my
user settings and miss with my name and
yeah that's a working keyboard that was
easy but having it in this configuration
actually set up the switch does kind of
just give me some ideas right away about
well this is not exactly something
useful just yet for any games in the US
down the line once this is useful
there's a lot of thoughts I have just
using this keyboard first off I really
wish it had a longer cable because right
now we're actually using a USB extension
this is everything you have right now
which if you're using your switch in
some kind of dock to desk setup that can
make sense but for any kind of living
room design this is just not nearly
enough for use which is really annoying
the other thing too that really jumps
out of me is that look using a
controller like this is obviously not
the most comfortable thing in the world
but because it is so similar in design
as to just using the switch in portable
mode you're kind of already trained to
use it rather comfortably like it feels
pretty natural just to use this
controller this way and hold it in fact
it's so close I really wish the keyboard
was just a little bit smaller which
might make the keys a little too
knowingly small but if it was just the
same dimensions of the switch you could
also then make use of things like
different grips or protective cases so
you could get that better grip design
giving you the balance of having access
to the keyboard and having a more
comfortable grip on the Joye cons as
opposed to using this whole flat design
so yeah I mean it looks kind of
ridiculous but to be honest this isn't
that bad of a setup and really has me
thinking more about you know what the
switch needs to do to really start
making something like this a really
viable option for everyone to pick
now the obvious answer is of course why
does got even exists in the first place
mmo's if there's any genre a video game
that absolutely needs a keyboard it's
animos once again chat is very important
but there's a lot more that could apply
to the switch where a keyboard could
come in handy one of the things we
talked about before is the fact that the
switch while a great little handheld
gaming system is still lacking a lot as
far as a multimedia device now normally
we're talking about that we're talking
about things like movie or music
streaming but one of the big things that
the switch is also currently lacking on
is a proper internet browser now people
have found some ways to kind of cheat a
little bit and gain access to one that
kind of works just not very well but if
Nintendo were to eventually actually
have a proper browser on the switch
access to keyboard would be great
because using the onboard screen
apartment mode might be okay but as soon
as you're in any kind of situation where
you're saying you're docked that's not
gonna work very well at all and really
if you want to go full crazy there's
also the idea of what you could do with
the interaction between the keyboard and
joy' cons as well imagine having games
that embrace not only using the joint
console controls and using the sticks as
an easy way to move and look around but
actually embracing the number of options
that open up by having keyboard made
available and Moe's are an obvious
option here but you can even start
opening up other crazier genres normally
not available on consoles especially
handhelds like this like RTS something
like let it happen no probably not
that's actually really insane I don't
think it'll ever happen but it's the
kind of thing that I really want in hit
it'll look more more into the part of
the thing that's really cool about the
switch is the wrist it's been taking and
I want to see more crazy ideas of how
you can incorporate accessories like
this into more games</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
