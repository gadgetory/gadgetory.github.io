and it is amazing making a very strong
argument for Game of the Year 2018 and
as it usually happens when we get really
excited about a game we decided to make
a little something special special Xbox
special setup and some might say we
might have gone a little overboard
first let's take a look at the Xbox one
X we've designed for this release so we
wanted to do another special division
design and we had a couple ideas going
in I mean with something like Red Dead a
really honestly simpler option would
have been just making a red X box which
maybe some just little graphics or
anything but we've done colorful X boxes
in the past we want do something a
little more different special this time
so one for a wood panel and look really
focusing on the idea of a western-themed
X Box now if you've watched me unbox
special editions system of the past you
know I have kind of a main rhetoric I
have when it comes to things I like in
special edition systems I don't like
having the title of the game on the
thing I usually don't like having any
words unless it's something very
thematic and you should want something
that's relatively midlist I want there
to be some kind of main symbol or logo
that references the system so that
people who are fans of the game that
we're referencing are going to get it
but it's not necessarily this thing it's
just like shoved down your throat so we
decided this design of a burned in
cowboy riding a horse to be honest this
is not actually a graphic taken from any
kind of official Red Dead to heart but I
think it fits in perfectly I mean if
you've seen any of the promote for they
always have loved having those
silhouettes of riders on the horizon and
I think this fits that perfectly now as
for how we actually made this Xbox it's
really simple we found this company
called toast and they make skin designs
for game systems phones all kinds of
different stuff but their main focus is
that the skins to use are made out of
actual real wood and they'll even handle
things like burning symbols onto them
for you just submit whatever image you
want burned in and they will do it and
handle it for this setup we want with
using an xbox one X instead of using a
regular 1s or any PlayStation system
because as far as pure performance goes
red dead ready to do does currently run
the best on the 1x the SOL runs fine if
you're playing on Playstation like that
but if you want the absolute best
looking experience possible the 1x is
the way to go as for the set up behind
me now clearly this is not any kind of
practical gaming setup we're not putting
a TV or an Xbox on this right here but
we just want to make a set that would
give some ideas for cool stuff you could
do for a western-themed set up and
really set the mood for Red Dead
Redemption 2 so the main wall behind me
all this wood is here that's just lumber
we picked up from Lowe's you can also go
to Home Depot or something like that and
then all the little different western
knickknacks we have we just went to our
local craft stores a couple of them and
you ever want to find cool weirdly
specific stuff to do for a gaming setup
craft store is the place to go because
we've done a Zelda set up but we've done
a pirate set up for Co thieves
and now a Western set up all from crap
stores because it's stuff that for our
weirdly specific circumstance it works
out really well but most the time why
would you ever need to buy something
like this as for the rest of what's
going on around here we of course have
both Xbox MIDI controllers set up the
black and white design so I would just
came out and then a poster of a Red Dead
Redemption 2 that I'm sure is making its
rounds at a lot of Everett stores we
actually picked it up at our local comic
book shop now well I think we made a
really cool setup here the main point of
this though once again is to just
celebrate what an awesome game Red Dead
2 is I've been spending a lot of time
with it and I've been loving every
moment of it I've been playing on a 4k
Samsung TV right here which gives us a
really good balance of getting all the
best visual effects you want while still
maintaining a low input lag so gameplay
isn't affected and I've actually also
been using the campaign app they
released on phones which has been really
handy because it kind of cuts down my
time having to enter menus and stuff
because it allows you just to view the
map like you'd see right here you can
also enter things like the manual of
your journal it just takes a lot of time
out of sifting through menus so you can
focus on just the raw gameplay and
that's where the game itself I mean it's
just been a fantastic experience I mean
there's a whole lot of stuff I could
rant about this is not a review video
though but I think the main thing I
really want to get across to anyone that
hasn't played it yet is that this is a
game that is not afraid to take its time
and focus on small moments and it does
it in such a good way there are so many
games that are focused on really
fast-paced instant gratification you
know fast traveling everywhere getting
stuff back-to-back just done this is a
game that's really cool it just letting
you take your time going from place to
place experiencing it adding all kinds
of little fiddly bits like needing to
eat food or rest which is done at a good
enough pace where it's never annoying
but it still comes up enough that you
really do need to think about it and
it's just it handles of bounds of all
these things so well like I said earlier
I think this is a strong contender for
the game of the year 2018 and the only
reason I'm not saying that perfect yet
is because I haven't beaten the game yet
and I don't want to make a claim like
that until I've really given it its
proper full playthrough but honestly if
it maintains the rate it's going at
right now it's pretty likely</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
