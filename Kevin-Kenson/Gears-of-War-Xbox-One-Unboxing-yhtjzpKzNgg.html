here celebrating the launch of Gears of
War 4 and it's pretty frickin cool to
start with we have a few bonus goodies
that come with this 2 terabyte system
the first is a download code for the
Ultimate Edition of Gears of War 4 that
will also allow you to play the game
right now instead of having to wait for
this Tuesday and the vertical stand that
matches the special editions red
coloring which is a nice little touch
after that is all the little extra bits
we'll just speed on by like the power
cable an HDMI cable and cut straight to
the first of two things we really care
about the Gears of War 4 Edition
controller sporting that deep crimson
red look with scratches and blood
splatter with the Series emblem on the
left side and to go along with this is
of course the star of this unboxing the
limited edition Gears of War for Xbox 1s
this thing is so much cooler than just
sharing the color scheme and patterns of
the controller not only does it have
that same awesome crimson red look with
the gear symbol right on top but the
claw marks on it our actual engravings
in the system like something really
scratched this thing in a way that just
happened to look freaking awesome one
thing I really appreciate too is unlike
some past Gears of War systems this one
leaves off any wording or titling of the
game letting the system look just
awesome without having overt super
obvious advertising and to top all this
off the system even has its own unique
power on and off set
overall to sum up this limited-edition
system in two words badass honestly this
dark shade of red is my favorite color
part of me kind of wishes there was a
solid color version of it but the actual
engraved claw marks make a pretty strong
case for this to be one of the coolest
limited-edition systems I've ever
unboxed</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
