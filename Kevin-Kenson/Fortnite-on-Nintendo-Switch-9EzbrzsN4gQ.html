and a lot of them that some people do
have a bit of a love-hate relationship
with is the massive number of ports to
the system and personally I love them I
think there are a lot of games that are
now flourishing on the switch that did
not do as well in other systems and the
thing is I think there's even more that
could benefit from the change so let's
talk about five games that need to be on
the switch first let's get one big guy
out of the way and actually one that
from this list has a pretty decent
chance of really happening and that's
for tonight if there's one John ran into
no hasn't been particularly well known
for the past few years its shooters with
the exception of splatoon and if there's
any major game out there right now that
I think would make a great move it's for
tonight I mean never mind that it's
already this huge gigantic success and
some of the most-watched games on Twitch
just look at the art style look at the
kind of fun and playfulness behind it
that really fits the switch's dynamic
now truth be told if you want to be some
kind of pro player at it yeah playing it
portable probably isn't the most optimal
experience but the idea that you could
just play it on the go when you want as
long as you've access to Wi-Fi it's
super freakin awesome to me now the
reason why this is one of the ones more
likely to happen on this list is that
while there is no official announcement
just yet people from Epic Games have
been asked before whether or not they'd
be interested in switch and the answer
was yes
so interviews not solid answers but it's
a good sign next up let's talk fighting
games now there's a couple arty that
have made their way to the switch and
there is one particular Nintendo one
that we've probably raved enough about
needing a new one we'll move on but one
game I think would make a great move as
well is the recent success of Dragon
Ball fighters Dragon Ball fighters is a
great example of something where you
take a much beloved franchise and figure
out the right game mechanics that fit
the feel of it perfectly and I think
it's something it would make a really
great fit on switch I mean in general I
think the switch is actually just a
great choice for fighting games in
general because the ability to use you
know separate joy calls to share with a
friend and all of a sudden you're doing
two players on this little - anything on
a tabletop now the reason why there is
some hope for this one is that we do
have other Dragon Ball fighting games on
the switch already's universe 2 did get
released so while it didn't get a same
time launch as Xbox and Playstation I
don't think it's entirely out of the
question so Bandai Namco make it happen
next up let's take a little bit of break
from some of the heavy hitter big titles
actually
about something that's a little more of
an indie success that really would make
a great fit on the switch and that's a
hat in time now if you haven't seen this
game before ahead in time was a
kick-started game that the entire goal
was to kind of bring back the 3d
platformer elements that came from the
n64 in GameCube era and it's really
bizarre that a game that is based on
this styling and honestly did it better
than ukelele did hasn't made its way to
the switch yet now unlike the first two
on the list where there is some hope
this one's looking a little more dreary
since it was a Kickstarter game they
only had plans for certain systems they
did talk about maybe doing something
with Wii U but then obviously the Wii U
crashed and burned
so there's hopes that maybe it could
come to switch but the devs have been
pretty against the ideas they've even
tested out doing it themselves and don't
really want to do it so well let's have
anyone else steps in to offer doing the
pork chop or Nintendo wants to give a
little assistance this one's looking
like it's not gonna happen which is
really sad next we've talked shooters
fighters platformers but now it's time
for my favorite genre RPGs and one that
I think really should go to the switch
is persona 5 now yes the persona series
has been for the most part basically
entirely on Sony systems they've had a
couple spin-off games that have made
their way to Nintendo but the overall
franchise Shin Megami Tensei is actually
on a lot in jindo systems in fact the
next mainline one SMT 5 is a switch
exclusive so while there hasn't really
been any precedents for this series to
exist on in tendo series it is by no
means out of the question now on the
other hand this is a question that I am
not the first one to ask there are a lot
of people to demand this so much so that
actual executives from Sega and Atlas
have made the announcement no we're not
doing it please stop asking which I say
please keep asking let's make it happen
guys and then we have a game who's
serious has recently been mostly just a
Nintendo exclusive but its latest entry
moved back to an older platform and
that's Monster Hunter World the monster
terror franchise is one that did find
its origins on the Sony system but for
almost the last decade they've really
been dedicated to Nintendo with releases
on the Wii the 3ds and even the switch
at least in Japan with Monster Hunter
double cross but the latest entry
Monster Hunter world is right now at
least exclusive to Xbox one ps4 and
Slater this year PC now part of the
reason for this is that Monster World is
a considerably better looking game so
much so that it'd be a bit tougher for
the switch to properly
run and that's been the main worry on
Capcom side that well the switch does
draw did an audience in the Xbox one and
ps4 and world wasn't really designed for
that but there are cries for people that
want this on the switch because having
this available as a handheld would be
great
in fact demand for this idea has been so
high that a third-party company in iron
galaxy Studios the company that actually
handled the porting first Skyrim to the
switch tweeted out to Capcom hey we'd be
willing to try and do this for you which
isn't any kind of official news that
that's something that's going to happen
but it would be really cool if it did</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
