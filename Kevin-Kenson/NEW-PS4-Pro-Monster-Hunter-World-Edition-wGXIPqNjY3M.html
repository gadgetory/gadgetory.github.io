for new special edition systems
and today we've got this big
ole one, for the PlayStation 4.
This is a PS4 Pro that is the Rathalos
edition for Monster Hunter.
Now if you don't know who
Rathalos is, that's Rathalos.
He's one of the big recurring monsters
of the Monster Hunter franchise.
He's been around since, I'm
pretty sure the first one.
(playful music)
And has been kinda the big poster child
for Monster Hunter world
and is gonna be right here
on this PlayStation 4 Pro.
So let's open it up and check it out.
As per usual, we've got
a box inside the box,
take out our little side box with
some of our additional pieces.
And then, controller.
Now this is a really intricate,
special edition PS4
Pro and that's extended
not just from the system itself
but also to the controller.
You know, oftentimes these things
are just a different color.
They might have one small
design somewhere on here
but this is actually got a
lot going on as you can see.
I gotta say right away, I love the color
of this controller.
I'm always a big fan of
red and I really like it
when it has that more kina muddier tone
like we're seeing right here.
It's got these extra designs going on
on the handles and then
there's this golden symbol
right here that you can see.
This is for the research commission,
which is basically the type of guild
you're a member of in
Monster Hunter World.
So this is a really fancy controller.
Along with the red body you've also got
gold accents everywhere
for the directionals,
the Sony label up top.
Really nice lookin'
special edition controller.
So let's put that aside and
actually get to the system.
And here we are.
Let's get this thing out.
Oh yeah, that is fancy.
Alright so this is something that Sony's
been doing a lot with their
special edition systems.
You've seen this on the PS4 Slim they did
that was Final Fantasy themed.
But it's this kinda design
where instead of just going
with a straight illustration on top,
instead they're going with a PS4 Pro
that has a combination of
gloss and non-gloss features
which are used to contrast and create
the design you see up top.
Although, this one does
add a little extra flair
with this bit of red right here.
So the design is Rathalos
with a nice little
like fire coming outta his mouth.
We do have the title of
the game in the corner,
which I kinda feel like
we coulda done without,
but at least it's off and just in there
instead of big letters in the middle.
I definitely like that better.
And that's not actually the only stuff
goin' on with this special edition.
Oh, there's actually even
a little gold mark on him.
I don't know if you can see that.
And then on the front of the system,
we also have these five
symbols right here.
Like I said on the controller there was
that one symbol was the
research commission,
these are the five fleets
that are the different
subsections of that group.
So, I believe in this
one you're actually part
of the fifth fleet which
is this one right here.
So these four symbols in the front.
We got anything else goin' on?
Anything on the back, bottom?
Nope.
Yeah, so the entire
design is this right here
which I gotta say definitely one
of the cooler things they've done.
I still kinda wish they went with just
more straight prints rather than
this whole gloss, non-gloss mixture,
like they did on Final Fantasy,
but this is definitely one of the cooler
things that they have done with it.
Now of course, this is not the only thing
we got with this bundle.
This of course includes a copy
of Monster Hunter World as well.
Now because this is the
Playstation 4 version
it does have some bonus DLC, specifically
that you can actually play as
Aloy from Horizon Zero Dawn,
and you get some bonus DLC
for the special edition
which is this armor and
that charm right there.
Now, this actually is
a collector's edition
that did come out in Japan in December
despite the fact that
the game did not have
its world release until well, today.
But in the U.S. we didn't
think we were gonna
get this originally and
instead at the very last second
it was announced that
we were gonna be able
to grab it as an exclusive from Game Stop.
In fact, I think this is
only on their website.
You can't actually go into
a store and find these
as far as I know, you
have to order from there.
So if you're tryin' to
track one of these down
in the U.S. your only
option is to do that,
or import from Japan.</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
