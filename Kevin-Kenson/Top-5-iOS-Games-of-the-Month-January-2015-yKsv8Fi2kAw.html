many of you know January is a really
damn slow month when it comes to games
but it did give me time to get back to
my iPad and bring you guys my favorite
iOS titles of January 2015 now this
month there were a lot of puzzle titles
that I really loved some are really
simple and minimalistic while we've got
another one it's a little more complex
with some RPG elements thrown in I've
also got an action game for you guys
called space marshals but before I get
to any of those we're gonna start with
the one free to play game on this month
list and that's the twitch base time
killer skyward now at first glance this
probably looks like one of those games
where all it boils down to is just
tapping the screen again and again and
again and to be perfectly honest that
really is all it is basically a flappy
bird clones but there are some other
things they do from a game design
standpoint that does make it a lot more
interesting in the long run first off
there's the game's aesthetic which is
absolutely gorgeous the whole thing has
this very assure painting style vibe
which makes it a lot more unique from
other twitch based games but second off
is its mechanics where every time you
reach certain high scores the game adds
new templates to its random level
generator which changes up the
experience each time you do better and
better so as a result called still boils
down you're just staring and tapping at
the screen it still changes things up a
little bit every now and then as
compared to other twitch based games
that are just the same experience again
and again and again plus not to mention
as I said it's free and all the ads are
just simple banner ads they never pop up
or interrupt gameplay keeping it one
continuous experience now second up on
the list is hook which is only a dollar
and is the first of three puzzle games I
have for you guys this month and out of
the group this one is by far the
simplest and most minimalist now the
idea behind hook is that you have to
retract a bunch of lines by pushing
buttons without having any of those
lines actually intersect or touch each
other in other words it boils down to
just pushing buttons in just the right
order now the problem with this is that
it can really just come down to doing
trial and error over and over again but
things do get a lot more complex in the
later levels when a lot more mechanics
are added and it takes a much greater
amount of time trying to figure out just
how to solve each puzzle what starts off
is just a few simple lines you can
easily discern from one another
eventually becomes an absolute mess of
lines everywhere forcing you to really
take time to figure out which exact
button effects which lines it's a pretty
simple idea and as I said earlier you
could solve the whole thing
with enough time and patience using just
trial and error but even then at only a
dollar the game has a great amount of
content that you can sink into for the
occasional time killer or if you just
want to lose an entire day solving every
single puzzle cluttered up at three
dollars is my favorite game on this
month's list shadow Matic shadow Matic
is a beautifully realized puzzle game
whose core gameplay stems from the idea
of shadow puppets you have a number of
objects that you have to rotate and move
around drew and create a familiar image
and its shadow like a dog or a racecar
what makes this complex though is that
oftentimes you'll have to deal with two
objects the same time and not only have
to move both of them but also move where
they are relative to one another it is
possible to accidentally solve some of
the single object puzzles really easily
by just turning it just the right way
but in parts where you have to deal with
two objects the game can get really
really difficult the only thing I have
to complain about is that in some
puzzles with dual objects it does get a
little nitpicky about how perfect lines
have to be you might find yourself
sharing it an image that looks like a
dog to you but the game still thinks you
haven't solved it quite right so you
spend a minute and half just trying to
align them perfectly that one hiccup
aside though the rest of the game easily
makes up for this by being intuitive
creative and beautiful well worth the
three dollar investment now of course
the top 5 list from me wouldn't be
complete without having at least one RPG
title and that's what brings us to the
fourth game on this list at four dollars
the puzzle RPG hybrid hero emblems in
the vein of other popular puzzle RPG
hybrids like puzzle quest here envelopes
has you playing a tile matching game
which gets translated into combat
whenever you line up certain symbols it
has the equivalent hero do something for
instance witches and warriors attack
your healer heals up the party and the
defender has a shield which reduces
damage from enemies the mechanics are
simply fun and addictive but what really
helps it out too is that they're
accompanied by cute visuals a great
soundtrack and the difficulty pacing is
handled really well for the game story
missions requiring only a little bit of
grinding here and there now the game's
English could use a little help and the
writing in general really isn't anything
special but this is more than made up by
everything else the game has to offer
now if you're not a fan of puzzle games
I do have one action title for you guys
it is the priciest game on this month's
list coming in at five dollars but it's
got more than enough content to make it
worth the price
eggs and good news if you hate and have
purchases it's completely in-app
purchase free so don't worry Francis you
can just buy the game five dollars and
you're done basic story here is a space
prison blows up a bunch of convicts
escaped including you but you're also a
former space marshal who is then on the
spot three instated to go hunt down all
those other convicts or shoot them dead
while the main character is pre-designed
you can customize them a little bit with
different hats and outfits then you
unlock along the way and the gear you
choose to bring along on each mission
does change up to play style quite a bit
because each gun works differently
whether you want to go long range with a
sniper rifle you're up close and
personal with a shotgun the game also
throws in some light stealth elements to
really round out the gameplay and it has
done a fantastic job with touch controls
making it a really smooth experience and
don't forget to mention that it's a
completely in-app purchase free
something that a lot of other mobile
action games can't say well those are my
favorite iOS games to come out in
January i'm sure you guys had some
favorites that i forgot to mention so
make sure to let me know what those were
down in the comments if you guys enjoyed
the video hit that thumbs up button to
let me know and if you haven't
subscribed yet hit that too because i've
got a lot more great content planned for
februari until then though guys I'm
Kevin Henson and I'll see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
