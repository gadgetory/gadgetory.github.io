into their gaming hardware with Xbox all
access the basic idea being that instead
of going to a store and spending three
or five hundred dollars to get a brand
new system and then have to buy all your
games and everything instead they're
going to have a service where for two
years you spent a monthly fee to get a
brand new Xbox one S or 1x that'll also
be included with Xbox Live Gold and Xbox
game paths now the way the service would
work is that it would be a contract does
require a credit check and all that kind
of stuff but as a result it allows you
to spend only twenty two dollars a month
to get an Xbox one S or $35 a month to
get an Xbox one X now after hearing the
prices if you're wondering whether or
not this is worth it well it actually
kind of is especially for the Xbox one s
let's run some quick math and MSRP
grabbing a brand new Xbox one ass is
$300 Xbox Live Gold cost sixty bucks a
year so for two years that's another 120
bucks and Xbox game pass being at ten
bucks a month normally comes out to
another two hundred forty bucks for two
years in total six hundred and sixty
dollars compared to spending the twenty
two dollars a month that comes out to
five hundred and forty eight dollars
over a hundred dollars less so even if
you assume things like grabbing an Xbox
one S on sale for 250 or maybe finding
years of gold memberships a little
cheaper that's a pretty tough deal to
beat now the other ends of the Xbox one
X it's not as much savings but it is
still a pretty solid deal if you're
spending 235 dollars a month for two
years that comes out to 840 840 right
sorry wait don't check my math
yeah 8:40 assuming you're paying that
$35 a month for the Xbox one X that
comes up to 840 dollars whereas buying
it all outright normally is 860 so it's
20 bucks less but not quite the same
kind of crazy deal you're seeing all the
1s with Microsoft when it comes to the
Xbox it's always been a system that is
really kind of trying to drag the gaming
community a little more into the future
whether it's been in a successful
attempt like how the original Xbox and
Xbox 360 really added an integrated
online experience and turning the home
gaming console more into a multimedia
device or with the less successful
attempts of the Xbox 360 and early on
Xbox one of having to connect and do
some things like motion gaming and hand
controls and speaking to your system and
just stuff that people generally didn't
react well to and I think we're coming
up on one of those moments again soon
with either the end of the Xbox one or
whenever the next Xbox system is
announced where I think Microsoft wants
to move gaming into a more post
ownership situation where the system
itself really isn't what you're buying
or paying for anymore it's the service
of what Xbox is as a platform this is
something I've been thinking about a lot
lately especially after our Xbox is last
III press conference where one of the
closing remarks they had that was kind
of really short almost to the point
where they want to really acknowledge
it's something they're working on but
they don't want to draw too much
attention to it just yet was the idea of
offering a better service for streaming
games to other devices like phones where
you could do something like have a full
Xbox console experience with a game like
Gears of War but in a small portable
device our cloud engineers are building
a game streaming network to unlock
console quality gaming on any device not
only that we are dedicated to perfecting
your experience everywhere you want to
play on your Xbox your PC or your phone
and it's something that Microsoft has
talked about before to where when the
Xbox one was first launching there was
this heavy emphasis on the idea of cloud
gaming technology which they've kind of
dropped off and not talked about as much
anymore at least for the Xbox one I
think Microsoft is very
heavily interested in the idea that in
the future you can spend whatever
monthly fee to be a part of the service
and you'll get just a little stream box
not even an actual proper gaming system
with a graphics card or anything just a
stream box with a controller that's
gonna let you play all these different
games that are released from different
companies that are all done through
cloud-based gaming and maybe that's not
the only option maybe that's just the
cheaper choice and along with that you
can still have the choice of paying a
little extra money to get an actual
high-powered 4k gaming console but the
main idea is that it's tied into this
service like Xbox game pass where
instead of going out and buying
individual games physically or even just
digitally online yours paying one
monthly fee that's all rolled into the
Xbox Service to gives you access to one
very large library of games</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
