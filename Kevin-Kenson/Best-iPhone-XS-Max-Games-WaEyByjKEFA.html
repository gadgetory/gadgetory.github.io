today and you might be wondering hey I
love playing games my phone's which one
is the better one to grab and the answer
is honestly pretty easy and
straightforward the 10s max for two very
simple but very important reasons first
off battery life games can be very
draining on your phone's battery you
want to make sure they're able to get a
lot of playtime in at the same time have
remote available just in case and better
battery is gonna make sure that isn't a
problem reason number two screen size
staying true to its name the tennis max
is increased screen size relative to its
already larger body has created one of
the largest film screens ever made and
actually contends with actual gaming
systems I mean the switch screen is
actually a smaller diagonal there's more
screen real estate but this gets very
very very close which is really
important for a lot of games to make
sure they're able to see everything nice
and clearly anything that uses touch
controls your fingers aren't getting in
the way of the action it's gonna give
you the best gameplay experience now of
course the next important question is
what games should I get because I don't
know if you've been on the App Store
lately there's a lot of them a lot and
there's a lot of good stuff juice room
but we're gonna go over five of the best
games you can play today first off let's
talk about a game that uses a feature
that's exclusive to newer iPhones they
are there are a lot of air games in the
market right now most of them are kind
of just tests and theories ideas of how
games can develop but there's a few that
are starting to get really really good
and a personal favorite of mine is the
birdcage I am a huge sucker for a lot of
escape room style games puzzle games
things that are very interactive that
you can do on your phone with the touch
screen interface and the birdcage is a
very interesting idea in that it creates
an actual like birdcage in augmented
reality that you can interact and mess
with having to solve puzzles all you
have to do is scan a tabletop surface
and you'll see a birdcage emerge MERP
Bert birds emerge is the word I'm trying
to say not immerse emerge all you have
to do is scan a tabletop and watch an
actual birdcage emerge out of the
surface of it that you can then freely
walk around inspect and mess with and
this is something I think there's a lot
of kind of interactive escape room
puzzle games on iphone but AR is taking
it to a whole new level that I cannot
wait to see where it goes next up is one
of my personal favorite iPhone games I
think it's something that has been
developed perfectly with phone
interfaces in mind and that is rain's
reigns's game that if you haven't heard
of is basically imagine tinder meets
some kind of chooser an adventure story
you're constantly make decisions we're
already doing a swiping left or right
and seeing how events play out
constantly having to balance all these
aspects of daily living and pretty much
no matter what you do you're gonna
eventually die and play as a hold
another king or queen all over again now
this is actually a series that has a
couple entries going on right now the
original one is a king most recent one
is a queen and soon we will have a third
entry that is actually a crossover with
Game of Thrones this might sound a
little too simple at first but actually
the game is much more complex than you'd
ever realized once you start playing it
it actually has a really kind of
interesting backstory built into it as
well that you fully discover as you play
more and more and while it is very
simple and straightforward with just the
swiping mechanic this also makes it the
perfect game to just pick up and play in
short bursts whenever you want
now speaking games that are suited
really well to the iPhone there's one
your honor I've always loved which is
Metroidvania and it's not something
that's usually very easy to pull off
with a touch screen interface but
there's one game that has proven that
idea wrong and that's dendara dinara
takes the idea of a Metroidvania we're
exploring a large dungeon re-examining
rooms backtracking dealing with enemies
but changes its gameplay style instead
of being a traditional side-scrolling
platformer into a game that relies on
touch controls where you're leaping from
wall to wall and using ranged attacks on
enemies and all plays wonderfully smooth
on a touchscreen interface and it's so
much fun and something I really
appreciate about too is that I think a
lot of times when people think about
mobile games they think about games that
are very specifically designed for phone
and mine it doesn't have the same grand
scale of stuff you might see on like the
PlayStation or the switch den version of
those games where it actually blends the
kind of scope scale and quality gameplay
of a console game but brings it home to
a phone in a way that makes it a fairly
unique experience and blends the two
mediums perfectly fourth on the list
we're gonna get a little less serious
with one of the funniest games to come
out recently on mobile donut county in
donut county is a very simple game in
which you're a hole as a whole you eat
things up and the more stuff you eats
the bigger the hole gets and thus you
can eat even bigger things and that's
the way the whole thing goes kind of
imagine almost like a reverse
tomorrow we're instead of rolling stuff
up and making a ball you're just
destroying everything now at first that
might sound really really easy but
energy gets fairly complex the farther
you get adding a lot of puzzle elements
that you might not think about when you
first learn of how the mechanics work
and more importantly the game is just
ridiculously funny at the same time both
the storyline it has itself and more
importantly the trash o pedia basically
as you eat items up in the game bill
strop in the trash Opie do where you can
look at images of them and then read
short little descriptions that are
oftentimes
not at all accurate but hilarious then
we have a game that when it was first
announced honestly I never would have
seen myself recommending it to people
but once I actually played it it really
grew on me really fast and that's final
fantasy 15 Pocket Edition now I know if
you've just seen gameplay of it the art
style is a little off-putting at first
at least it was for me but it really
grew me as time went on and it really is
interesting how this game has taken such
a massively scoped title like Final
Fantasy 15 and scale it down into a fun
little portable game
well the gameplay and visuals are of
course entirely different it actually
uses a lot of the same music audio files
and recreates whole scenes from the game
while making it a more condensed shorter
adventure that can be easily enjoyed on
the go as someone who played the
original game before jumping into this
one yeah it's a little weird at first
but if you give it a shot it really is a
lot of fun to play and if you haven't
had the chance to play in 15 this is an
awesome way to experience the storyline
without quite the same investment</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
