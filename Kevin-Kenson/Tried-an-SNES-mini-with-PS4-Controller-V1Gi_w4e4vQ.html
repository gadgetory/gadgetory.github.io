new Super Nintendo Entertainment System
good about it they say it has 16-bit
technology whatever that means
yes Tania's Classic is finally here and
thankfully unlike the NES that appears
that this one's actually got a decent
amount of quantity that's going around
it's still saying out really fast but we
were able to get our hands on one so
let's open up and check it out now one
thing that's cool about this one
compared to the NES classic is that we
actually get two controllers yeah that
is pretty much a perfect recreation it
was actually playing on SNES the other
night so I could try to remember what it
feels like and this is actually really
close to sight from obviously being
really friend knew and not know how old
that was that thing 20 years over 20 oh
that's pretty look a little guy so all
the buttons get used to but instill work
eject does nothing there's nothing to
eject obviously the flap doesn't work on
the back HDMI out along with the power
cable which is the micro USB or mini USB
actually yeah my girl my girl and then
unlike the NES classic something I
thought was interesting different on
this one is they actually did little
like fake ports that are like what the
SNES actually had now well the basic
idea here is still the same thing as the
NES classic because it's a newer model
engine no add a little more time to add
some new upgrades to the SNES classic in
comparison now first off if you look at
the main screen same basic idea the UI
is very similar but it's a lot flashier
which I really like as far as an actual
functional upgrade to go to display
settings just like with the NES classic
gave the option of playing in four by
three a CRT filter or using pixel
perfect but in addition to that since
all of these modes are still gonna give
you some annoying black lines on the
side which you might get used to
ignoring but if not you can fill them up
with different frame options so you can
give you a nice little border around it
or you keep in fake having a CRT setup
on your monitor which is actually pretty
cool now one last upgrade that Nintendo
did is the fact that like I said earlier
the cable is longer now that I've
actually had time to kind of measure
compare the one on the NES classic was
under three feet this one is now four
and a half
which is still pretty much useless for
most actual real setups this is shorter
than the SNES is real cables so that's a
little knowing which got me to thinking
of a way to fix this problem a company
I've talked about before on this channel
and covered a lot of accessories from is
8-bit Doan what I they've done in
particular is this retro receiver right
here now there's a couple different
models of this thing they don't one for
the actual NES the actual SNES and this
one here is for the NES classic and the
idea here is that just lets you use a
Bluetooth controller wirelessly with
your system thus saving you having to
deal with cables and the idea they have
is that they want you to use that with
their line of retro controllers that are
bluetooth allowing you to have the
experience of using an SNES style
controller but without the hassle of
having the cable of the classic comes
with because like I said bit too short
but honestly not always the best choice
I mean these things are super nostalgic
I'm used to the feeling but it's not
actually the most comfortable controller
in the world sometimes so in the past on
the NES classic I've used a ps4
controller works perfectly fine with the
receiver but honestly for something like
this that kind of feels boring to me
there is something about using an actual
styled controller for the SNES so I did
old searching I stumbled upon this on
Etsy from accel team an SNES ps4
controller there's some really cool
detail on this thing obviously all the
colors match I really liked how they
took the extra step though of putting
the Super Nintendo logo on the touch bar
so I was super excited to use this with
the SNES classic which we tested a bit
ago and it didn't exactly go as planned
all right
yeah so far so good I think it's working
let's do Street Fighter I know what all
the buttons do and then we'll just yeah
cuz then wait no no no okay so it works
every button is kick and by that I mean
I think every but like it's it's the B
and the a button i think is what kick
should be so it's reading everything is
b an a like an nes actually it's not x
and y do not x and y just do the same
thing that's it
every button is kick this is not every
button is kick okay so the problem here
wasn't the controller itself i've used
it on the NES classic and it works fine
the issue is the fact that that retro
receiver i talked about actually needs
to be patch to work with the SNES
classic which i didn't really think of
that firmware isn't up yet but 8-bit doe
has mentioned they are planning to do an
update soon so it'll work so really
excited when i can do that but for now i
would like to have access to more
buttons than just kick just like the NES
classic i think this thing is an awesome
little collectible for anyone who's a
fan of old-school retro gaming and
hopefully unlike the NES it's gonna be a
little easier to get a hold of it
already looks like stocks are a bit
better so in a few weeks it's not gonna
be a situation where we're gonna see
them being scalped for $300 a piece
either way i'm gonna link it down below
and amazon hopefully some more pop up
for you guys to grab and if you really
like this design of this SNES ps4
controller make sure to check out XL
team on etsy they've got a whole lot of
other custom paint jobs like this that
are just so awesome looking make sure to
give them a look</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
