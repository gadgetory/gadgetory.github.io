special edition systems and conveniently
enough you're looking at the ones that
came out in the US there's ten so let's
rank them all kicking things off at
number 10 is the Call of Duty World War
2 ps4 slim now if you saw my unbox thing
you'll know that I wasn't really its
biggest fan mainly because it's just not
really for me I know there's gonna be
some people out there that love camo
designs but for me just doesn't do
anything and even then honestly I think
it does a couple things that sends some
mixed messages like the fact that it's a
camo design that's also a gloss top
something that's gonna make light shine
off of it and kind of defeats the
purpose of the camo but it does have one
saving grace and that I really do love
the idea that I think is really cute
they put little Dual Shock prints as
part of the camo which is a neat little
idea that being said though it still
loses out to the rest of the systems on
this list coming in at number nine is
the Legend of Zelda link addition to DS
now this was released on Black Friday
and it was a limited run meant to
celebrate that there was no kind of
special discount or anything on it but
it did come pre-installed with ocarina
of time for the 3ds and it's a fine
system it's just very plain you know
it's just got a green design based on
length with some yellow accents gold
trim which actually do really like the
gold trim but other than that there's
not a whole lot going on especially for
a Legend of Zelda themed system it's
just very plain so decent looking design
especially if you want something as link
themed but otherwise there's cooler
stuff out there next up is the Star Wars
PlayStation 4 proto this was released as
a tie-in with Star Wars Battlefront 2
and actually came out a couple days
before the game and included a copy of
it so there's a way to get a little
early access going on and I have very
mixed feelings about this system because
there's a lot I like about it but a few
things that I just think could have made
it even better begin with I think the
gloss finish actually plays really well
with this there's a couple other
Playstations where I think it's a weird
choice but for this I think it's a great
fit I like the use of the rebel and
imperial symbols using Inferno squad I
get ties it directly to the game but
I kind of wish this was more of just a
system that celebrated Star Wars in
general and didn't tie it specifically
to Battlefront 2 especially with how
everyone's come to love that game also
love the thing that just always bothers
me with anything branded why'd they put
the name on it
I know it's Star Wars what a book so
much cooler without it stepping up next
at number 7 is the gold ps4 slim now
this is one of two different metallic
designs that Sony released during the e3
time of year but it's actually the only
one we got in the u.s. there was also a
silver design which only came out in
Europe and honestly I actually kind of
liked that one better personally but the
gold design is great too and honestly
its biggest issue is the fact that it is
such a flashy system you really need to
kind of design a setup that it'll fit
perfectly into and once you do it is a
great design and in fact while the gold
is very flashy I think it does an
excellent job of actually accenting that
black trim going through the middle
creating a really great looking system
coming in at number 6 is the SNES
edition 3d SX ona I like this system a
lot I just think it's another one of
those ones where it could have gone that
extra little mile to be something even
more special you know I like the theme
of the old-school SNES I like gray they
used I like the purple trim especially
in the inside the one place where really
thinks something a little extra could
have happened though it's on the front
lid you know so many other special
edition DSS make use of special moldings
or shaping's or different kind of
textures that make for these really cool
designs and this one just didn't really
go for any of that you know solid design
I just think could've done even better
entering the second half of our list at
number 5 is the white PlayStation 4 Pro
now this was released as part of a
special edition limited bundle with
destiny 2 and just like it's slim
variant I think it does an excellent job
of improving the look of the base
PlayStation 4 I have said many times
before that I am NOT a fan of total
blackout system designs they just look
falling to me I want to have a little
color I wanna have a little trim I want
some kind of clashing color design and
so the white mixed with the black lines
in the middle I think does an excellent
job of that not only does it even look
better I also think it just makes the
system look slimmer you know when we
first saw the kind of triple stack
decker design of the ps4 Pro it just
looked
way too massive and while this is still
certainly not a small system I think the
white has trimmed it down a lot next up
at number four is the project Scorpio
Xbox one X now this is part of a limited
run of special edition systems released
to celebrate the launch of the one X
very similar to what Microsoft did
before with day one edition original
Xbox one except in this case the system
itself actually has a special design
going on and to be honest at first
glance I didn't really care for it I
thought it was just a standard Xbox one
X with the board projects corporate on
the front which it does have but there's
actually a little more going on that
makes this a really cool design the
biggest thing is that instead of just
being a pure black finish like the 1x
this instead has this gradient of this
light gray going to the same black which
looks really good and also features a
cool little secret code that celebrates
the release year of every single Xbox
model on top of that it also has a
specially designed controller that also
says project Scorpio but as a complete
blackout design with black buttons
rather than the traditional colorful
ABXY and now it's time for our top three
and to kick things off in third place
the bronze medal winner is the Metroid
Edition 3ds XL Metroid is one of the
best franchises that Nintendo has and
sadly it was getting a bit forgotten
over the past decade but it made its
triumphant return earlier this year with
Samus Returns and as part of celebrating
its release is this special edition
system right here which I absolutely
love I like the use of colors with the
orange on front yellow on back Metroid
symbol on the back and most of all Samus
right here on the front and this is one
of the few systems that I think actually
does a great job of pulling off this
gloss finish it's just a wonderful
system and is a great way to celebrate
the series return coming in at second
place our runner-up for the best special
edition system of this year is the
Minecraft Xbox one s now I have said it
before I am not personally a huge fan of
Minecraft but even with that in mind I
cannot deny how objectively cool this
system is there is just so much thought
and care that went into design so many
details little secret messages and
design choices that just make it this
awesome system that celebrates Minecraft
while at the same time not insulting the
fan by pasting the big awards Minecraft
on it somewhere to let you know oh right
in case you didn't know this is the kind
of system you bought
extends not only to the system itself
but even the controller has a unique
special design which I still love little
detail of the TNT there's just so much
cool little stuff that went on the
system I can't deny it and put it any
lower than second place and then at
number one the best special edition of
2017 is the pokeball 2d s XL
I absolutely freakin love this system
this is one of the coolest designs I
love the fact that it's not just a
graphic or a color but actually this
shape design that makes use of a gloss
black trim and even a working button on
the top not to mention I just really
love Pokemon and the color red so it
just fits even better
there is another Pokemon to TS excel
that came out at the same time but not
in the US which is Pikachu themed that
thing is really cool too but honestly
between the two of them I am so happy we
got this one because definitely my
favorite system this year</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
