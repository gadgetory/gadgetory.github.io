wireless headset to platinum a premium
alternative to their gold wireless
headset and meant to be their new
top-of-the-line first party option now
these run right now for 60 bucks more
than the gold headset so the question is
is it worth spending more to get the
platinum or if you already own a gold is
it worth upgrading to so to begin with
let's take a look at what comes with
both of these headsets you have a USB
dongle which is take connect the headset
to your ps4 wirelessly and that's the
only thing you can connect to wirelessly
to you get this one micro USB cable
which is how you charge the headset a
3.5 millimeter cable which is how you
can use it with a computer or your phone
or if you ever lose the dongle you can
use with your ps4 as well and last a
little carrying bag now taking on a post
look at both headsets you'll find that
all the same buttons and ports are here
just rearrange the little the golda
headset has power switch and chat game
audio balance on the front while the
platinum headset has moved these options
to the back where you'll also find
volume control mic mute button and a
switch for turning on and off virtual
surround sound personally I think the
Platinum has the advantage here I like
having all the buttons on the back it
just feels more comfortable to control
all those with my thumb now you'll also
notice that the platinum has a pair of
built-in mics located near the top and
bottom of the ear cup which does result
in more clear mic audio compared to the
gold headset which only has a single one
located just under where the headband
meets head Cup now buttons are not where
the similarities and between these two
you'll also notice right away looking at
them that the Platinum has the same ear
cups as the gold which is a good thing
because in my opinion one of the biggest
selling points of the gold is that it
was really really comfortable to wear
for long periods of time but this is
really where the similarities end I mean
when you look at them side by side
you'll see that the gold is a more
plastic finish that honestly feels kind
of limiting a week especially the hinges
they always feel like they're going to
snap off the Platinum though you'll see
they have these metallic bits it's a
harder plastic it just feels like a much
more solid headset which is a great
thing the only thing I don't like about
it as much is the headband where it's
this kind of rubbery thing that it's not
uncomfortable but it's not great while
the gold has this nice little cushion is
that I do find a lot more comfortable
now as for actual performance as you
might expect the Platinum does beat out
the
Gold the biggest difference easily is
the battery life the gold usually lasted
me between six and seven hours on a full
charge while the Platinum has lasted me
over ten hours
hitting as high as twelve the gold
headset does a good job of clarity but
loses out when it comes to the low end
which is really important for any games
that are heavy on explosion and this is
something the Platinum has definitely
improved upon with both headsets you're
also able to take advantage of the
PlayStation headset app which allows you
to customize two different sound
profiles you can switch between with a
few pre-done options choose from based
on game genre or even a specific game
for instance either on the horror
settings while running through resonable
7 which definitely made a lot of the
ambient creepy noise well prettier so
for six dollars more you're getting
higher build quality a bit better sound
and much better battery life pretty much
the basics you'd be hoping for if you're
paying 60 bucks more but the biggest
thing that Sony wants to push as the
selling point of these is 3d audio
basically more advanced virtual surround
sound where you not only hear things to
the left and right forward and back but
also above and below you which sounds
really cool in concept
the downside is right now only one game
supports this feature and that's
uncharted 4 now I will say 3d audio
worked a lot better than I expected to
once I tried it out especially the super
mode off and on you can really hear the
difference between audio just being
pumped out and the actual sense of
locational sound you get with 3d there
are a few games listed as getting
support in the future like MLB the show
17 and days gone basically signaling
that the main games that will update for
this feature are going to be Sony own
one as it stands the Platinum is for
sure a better headset than the gold and
worth paying the different bomb if
you're in the market for a new headset
if you're just thinking about upgrading
though there really aren't enough
benefits aside from the battery life to
justify it unless we do start seeing a
lot more game support 3d audio that or
if you need an excuse to break your
headset and then buy a shiny new toy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
