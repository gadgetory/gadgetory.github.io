still have yet to do one of the most
important top five lists any gamer
should have and that's my top 5 horror
games and I want to start off with a
game that I think anyone who's played
will definitely agree it is one of the
best horror games ever made and yet it's
somehow never got the same amount of
exposure has other horror games of its
time and that's Fatal Frame 2 crimson
butterfly now what sets Fatal Frame
apart from so many other horror games is
its focus on the immaterial a lot of
other horror games tend to focus on
monsters demons undead things that are
physical while final frame puts you up
against spirits and ghosts things that
can literally appear anywhere at any
time and this is greatly accented by the
games use of camera angles music sound
effects and the Japanese mythos that
weaves the entire story what makes the
game even scarier though is its form of
combat you can't fight these things
head-on but instead need to use a
special camera the thing is in order to
the best damage you can you need to be
right up close and time it for right
before and amee's attack you meaning
you're always putting yourself in the
center of danger if you want to get the
best scores possible admittedly most of
the games in this list I do like more
than fatal frame but I do think fatal
frame is by far one of the most unique
games in genre and definitely one that
everyone should experience now like I
said when it came out there were a
couple other franchises that ended up
stealing a lot of spotlight from fatal
frame and it was for good reason and one
of those is the Silent Hill franchise
and my personal favorite being Silent
Hill 3 now it seems to me like the
majority people when they talk about
their favorite in Silent Hill game they
always bring up Silent Hill 2 which is
an excellent game as well but personally
I think there's a lot of things that
three did better it's not just a matter
of mechanics to begin with the
protagonist Heather is by far the best
protagonist out of any of the characters
in the original trilogy and there's just
so many different little pieces of
attention to detail in this game rooms
that serve no purpose for advancing the
story other than to mess with your head
all kinds different symbolism and
imagery that just sucks you in
the game has this constant sense of
claustrophobia that I think is missing
some the other games because a lot of
them have you wandering throughout the
town of Silent Hill and entering other
areas the vast majority of Sandhill 3 is
spent indoors or underground making you
feel like you never really have a chance
to escape all the horror that surrounds
it also has a sense of connectedness
with the rest of the series that isn't
really present in any of the other games
now admittedly this franchise definitely
has some of the worst combat but when it
comes to ambience and story writing it's
really tough one to beat and give the
opportunity you should definitely play
through the whole trilogy if you can
with three serving as a strong final
note next up is the first entry in the
main competitor Silent Hill one of the
biggest horror games of its time
Resident Evil now honestly I don't think
the original Resident Evil actually aged
all that well it was an awkward time for
graphics and had terrible voice acting
it had a lot of problems but thankfully
it did get remade on the Gamecube and
got remade again in HD on PC and modern
consoles and it is excellent this is the
game that set the standard of resource
management in horror games you could
never carry everything you wanted and
you always had to decide what was best
to bring with you what items might solve
nearby puzzles how much ammunition to
bring what kind of guns you should carry
and of course how many healing herbs are
you bringing if any well I do think some
of the other games on this list did a
better job of instilling horror through
their storytelling or environments resin
evil had it locked down for mechanics
later games in the series ditched these
aspects and exchanged for making a more
action focused game which are so good in
their own right but they don't capture
the same feeling and magic that was
present in the first four games of the
series
now while the later action focused
Resident Evil games failed to deliver on
the horror that the original games had
there was another newer franchise that
had similar mechanics that ended up
making the fear all the more alive and
breathing
and that's Dead's
deadspace proves that you can still have
a game focused on action and having all
kinds of weapons and options for dealing
with enemies and still be scared
shitless when they show up the original
game knew how to build up tension before
throwing waves of enemy monsters at you
sometimes making you feel safe for just
a moment before being swarmed by some of
the most well designed monsters because
they have this great semblance of being
right between some kind of horrific
disgusting creature but still showing
enough human aspects to make it truly
terrifying not to mention one of my most
favorite design decisions about the
entire series is the UI where everything
keeps you all in the action you're not
going through different menus you're not
having to pause the game constantly to
look at your inventory or a map instead
everything's right there present on the
screen you can see your health on your
back your ammo on your weapons and if
you do pull up in the menu it's just an
overlay where enemies and things are
still happening in the background never
really giving you a chance to escape the
tension well I do think the franchise
overall lost steam pretty quickly it
doesn't take away from the fact that the
first and original game is amazing and
should be played by any fan of horror or
sci-fi games now last on the list is the
relatively most recent game out of the
ones I picked and arguably it's the game
responsible for reinventing the horror
game genre and that's my age while it
wasn't the first game to do it Anisha is
the game responsible for popularizing
the idea of a powerless hero against
unstoppable evil while most games give
you some kind of option like using guns
melee weapons having a guardian or even
a magical camera and Nisha just gives
you one option run the game relied less
on throwing enemies at you left and
right but instead terrorized you with a
single powerful enemy that you could do
nothing against while also dealing with
a lot of weird freaky shit happening
left and right it also made excellent
use of resource management by making you
rely on any source of light you could
find otherwise you'll just go insane in
the darkness and make the game all the
harder for yourself since it's released
we've seen a huge influx of more horror
games focusing on powerless protagonists
but none of them quite live up to what I
think amnesia
achieved now while these are my favorite
horror games to have come out there is
one honorable mention I want to make
because it's not exactly a game but it's
a very unique experience and one that
sadly a lot of people can't experience
anymore because it's been removed from
downloadable stores and that is P team
released originally as just a teaser for
the now canceled silent hill's PT was a
game that wasn't even a demo where we
were going to experience in silent
hill's but was instead its own isolated
experience that was short but
extraordinarily sweet what I think this
game did best is that it realized the
popularity of jump scares but instead of
capitalizing on that fact by throwing
the menu left and right instead it just
gives you the promise of jump scares
only really giving you one or two and
constantly keeping you on edge waiting
for the next one while having almost no
mechanics outside of simply walking and
looking and taking place entirely in one
endless hallway PT proves that you can
create an incredible horror experience
with ambience alone that is unique to
interactive media sadly though if you
didn't download this playable teaser
back when it was available on the
PlayStation Store it is now gone if you
can't track down a friend that does have
it you're gonna have to arrest with just
watching other people play it online
which just doesn't quite capture the
same experience as playing it firsthand
so those were my personal favorite
horror games ever to be released I know
there are a whole lot more amazing
titles out there that I didn't talk
about that just didn't quite make the
cut for me personally so let me know
down below in the comments what your
favorite horror games are as always if
