been a really heavy obsession in the
gaming industry with zombies we've seen
zombie games cover a large variety of
different genres we've had single-player
games that focus on storytelling and
overcoming adversity we've had co-op
games where players just take on hordes
of never-ending zombies and we've even
had full-blown mmo's which are basically
just the same thing as the co-op games
on a grander scale but also having
players dick each other over the problem
is we've just had so many of these on
the games that getting to the point
where once you've played one or two of
them you've basically played them all
because there's so many common shared
mechanics that they all like to use
because they're familiar and trophy now
despite this fact there are still quite
a few of them getting released and on
occasion there is still gonna be those
one or two titles that look really
promising either because they do
something different or because they do
the fam you love that much better that's
what brings us to dying light what's up
internet Kevin here and as I said zombie
games have a really bad habit of having
very very similar mechanics and Dynalite
is no exception to that but what it does
do to help itself stand out a little
more is by mixing a few other genres and
doing the basic formula that much better
now if you played a lot of other zombie
titles there's gonna be one game in
particular that comes to mind when
you're looking at dying life and that's
Dead Island which in my opinion dying
light is basically just a better version
of that same kind of game mostly thanks
to its poor car mechanics and way
smoother comment as well as a couple
other little changes that we're gonna
talk about in a bit here so before we
get into the multiplayer aspects of the
game let's talk about the core mechanics
now the main game is done through a
campaign mode we have two complete
number of storyline missions but more
importantly most your time is gonna be
spent in the game's free roam which can
be really summed up in two different
ways
parkour and beat me Pat viola zombies
now one thing dying like does
interesting is that there are skill
trees that are associated with all your
different agility tricks or combat
abilities but they all grow individually
and separately you don't just level up
and put a point whenever you want to
specialize in instead you get better at
parkour by doing parkour and you get
more comment by just beating up zombies
as up as you can unlocking different
useful combat techniques like the
all-powerful drop cake which is honestly
where 90% of the fun in this game comes
from just watching zombies go flying by
drop kicking them into spikes traps or
other players to beat the crap out of
now there are two other parts of the
gameplay behind dying light that I
really ride the day of night cycles and
the crafting system day and light cycles
aren't anything new - zombie games have
seen them a lot but usually the main
idea is that at night time zombies just
get more aggressive and that's about it
dying light does something a little
different there are unique super-powered
zombies that only show up at nighttime
that are not only really hard to kill
they're also really fast and are really
good at tracking which makes nighttime a
much more dangerous time to play but the
game also entices you to wanna play at
the time by giving you double experience
during it so while you could play it
safe by just playing during daytime and
sleeping throughout the night you're
gonna level up a lot faster by taking
those risks and playing at nighttime as
for the crafting system the one thing I
really like is the fact that no item is
permanent all weapons can be repaired
but only so many times before they
permanently break so as a result you're
gonna constantly have to switch what
weapons you're using and constantly
craft more of them and upgrade them to
get the most use out of them see in
other games you might have that
situation where you can make one
ultimate weapon and just keep using it
until you can make an even better one in
this though you're gonna make one
awesome weapon use it a few times and
then have to make another one
all over again so it makes resource
management and switching between weapons
more often more important there is one
awkward side of the crafting though and
that's scrap metal which is the main
resource in the game it shows up
literally everywhere every other zombie
you search every trashcan pie you look
through you're going to find scrap metal
at the very start of the game you might
be worried about it and go oh hey maybe
I should switch between more weapons or
try to conserve it know after an hour
you're gonna end up with 60 pieces of
scrap metal you have no idea what to do
which as a mechanic just makes it seem
really unimportant they either should
have made scrap metal a lot more harder
to come by or they should have just
removed it entirely so you could focus
on the other resources for crafting new
weapons or upgrades so overall I really
like the core gameplay behind dying I
think they did an excellent job of
balancing how character creation and
customization works switching between
items and most importantly I really like
the way zombies were handle
this game a lot of more recent zombie
games tend to have an emphasis where
there's a ton of zombies but
individually they're super weak and your
biggest obstacle is just getting tired
from fighting so many in older horror
games there'd be the situation where
there should one or two zombies but
they're really freaking tough and take
forever to die dying light on the other
hand hits a really nice sweet spot for
me there's just enough zombies toward
that are a threat in a group and while
one by itself can get beaten down it
still takes a little bit of time there
are of course also special zombies like
ones that explode spit acid or just
really big heavy tanks but as far as the
regular zombies go I think they just did
a great job of capturing that right
balance between either not a threat at
all by just walking and stumbling around
or a major threat if you piss them off
and fight too many at once now all that
being said there are some other parts of
the core gameplay that I'm not as big of
a fan of mostly in the storytelling in
the missions Department it's all just
very dry very trophy and all stuff that
we've seen a million times before the
main story missions do have some
interesting climactic moments during the
middle segment of the game but for the
most part it's really uninteresting it
really got to the point where I had a
lot more fun just doing random free roam
rather than trying to complete the
game's story and the only reason I even
tried to was because I wanted to get
more experience to develop the survivor
tree so if you're looking for plot this
isn't gonna be one of the better zombie
games to look for but thankfully if you
just want to focus on a game that lets
you beat up zombies with friends well
this fact is gonna be a little less
important and that is once again where
the game starts get its strengths again
is through its co-op mode and
multiplayer options co-op in this game
is really simple you can just join other
players games or invite them to yours to
go together to complete the story
missions or just run around in free roam
one thing they did to spice up cop
though that I really appreciate is the
co-op competitions basically while
you're playing the game in the
cooperative mode every now and then the
game will give you the option to start a
competition with your friends most of
which will normally revolve around where
you are currently in the world or what
missions you're currently trying to
complete for instance one of the early
on missions is to try and grab a Supply
Drop well once you get within range of
it you can start a competition to see
which player reaches the Supply Drop
first the one that wins gets free bonus
X
either for agility or comment what's
great about this is that it mixes of
cooperative mode will never actually
interrupt in the main gameplay all these
competitions are gonna tie into things
you are already doing anyways but now
throws in a way to compete with your
friends and get a little bonus xp to top
it off which by the way reminds me if
you grab this game on PC make sure to
change the default controls a little bit
because it was clearly designed for
console in the first place and there's a
few key bindings that are redundant and
really annoying the main one being the
button for starting or joining a
competition is the same button for using
a medkit so if your friend challenges
you do a competition and you're missing
just a little bit of help you'll end up
wasting a medkit which is really really
annoying but thankfully you can't change
that just going to the options make sure
you do that right away now there's one
last gameplay mode of dying light I
haven't talked about yet and it's the
one that I think really does the best
job of making it stand out as a little
more unique than other zombie games and
that's the be the zombie mode which is a
multiplayer competitive mode which
entails two of my favorite things
asymmetric multiplayer and invasions all
the Dark Souls now if you don't know
what it means
asymmetric multiplayer is when you have
a multiplayer mode where the two sides
aren't playing by the same set of rules
in this case you have up to four human
players working together to try and
destroy nests while you have a zombie
player trying to hunt down and kill them
all a certain number of times what's
great about this is that if you've been
playing the campaign a lot and you're
getting bored of just being a regular
old human you can take a break and turn
into a super-powered zombie giving the
ability to do things like fly through
the air with web-slinging
or instantly kill humans by sneaking up
on them with a long-range grappled the
reason why I like the invasion aspect
though is because while playing as a
human the multiplayer mode is all
wrapped together in one nice package you
never have to try and go into a side
lobby you never have to try and take a
break
the game and do something else you can
just keep playing campaign have evasions
turned on and enter that mode whenever
someone wants to try and fight you and
if you're on interested in invasions if
you just want to play it as a
cooperative or just a single-player game
there is the option to just turn it off
and never have to deal with it
now honestly I'm not a huge fan of
zombie games I'm personally just really
tired of the genre there's been a lot of
games that have come out back-to-back
but Don Light is one of the few titles
I've actually really enjoyed mainly
because I really like the way the game
tied to the campaign co-op and
competitive multiplayer all into one
nice little package as I said the story
itself is nothing special and honestly
if you're looking for a more plot heavy
game this isn't gonna be the other one's
for you but if you just want the chance
to beat up a bunch of zombies with
friends this is one of the best options
out there especially with the
competitive aspects added in with that
be the zombie mode now the game does
have a couple other little flaws worth
mentioning first off I really don't like
the fact that there's no stamina meter
for running you just have to go off of
whether or not your character is
breathing really heavily and the game
does have its share of bugs nothing that
absolutely breaks the game but on
occasion some really weird shit can
happen now is it worth paying a full 60
bucks for will that depends if you can
grab friends the plate right now in the
coop then it's worth it but if you're
just gonna end up doing it by yourself
and just dabble them to be the zombie
mode on occasion it's much more worth
waiting than for a little while for a
price drop or two well that was my
review of dying light if you guys want
to grab a copy of the game for
