years of Nintendo totally dominating the
gaming market there's finally some new
life being breathed into computer games
arcades and Nintendo's biggest
competitor at the time Sega as they
released the Sega Genesis in the United
States but Nintendo has their own
response by releasing their first
handheld console the Gameboy during this
year we saw some incredible games on all
of these platforms and here are the five
best first off is Castlevania three now
let's be honest for a second
Castlevania to Simon's quest was
terrible it was part of Konami's attempt
to try and take the original game and
make something that was going to last a
lot longer and the way they did that was
by giving you a lot of unclear
directions about what exactly you're
supposed to do and force you to grind
out killing enemies non-stop in a very
nonlinear and honestly not very fun game
and thankfully Konami realized that a
mistake and fixed that by going back to
their roots with Castlevania 3 and found
a better way to increase the game's
playtime replayability now while at
first this game might look like a carbon
copy of the original game but with new
levels there's two very important
additions they made to Castlevania 3
first off
branching levels in between certain
levels you'll be able to choose where
you go next which allows you to complete
the game in different orders you can
play the whole game and still have
levels that you haven't played through
giving you a reason to play it all over
again and second off the game added
sidekick characters depending on which
roots you choose to take through the
game you'll get one of three different
sidekicks who offer new mechanics that
handle differently from the main
character Trevor Belmont giving you
abilities like climbing walls using
magic or even being able to turn into a
bat for a limited period of time and fly
around the screen it was one of the
first games to really give you a reason
to want to play it over and over again
for a reason outside of the fact that
it's just that fun which by the way this
game is still really freaking fun but
you're gonna want to play it over again
to see how all the different paths play
out second off let's take a look at some
of the computer games that came out this
year starting with Prince of Persia
now Prince of Persia is a game where you
have to rescue a princess within an hour
literally the game times you for an hour
to try and save her and one of the most
engaging things about this game right
away is just how visually stunning it
was for its time most games back then
had very simple character sprites where
you just see their legs move left right
left right and maybe they strike a pose
when they jump in this one you have full
interesting looking fluid body motions
including how you run how you jump how
it looks differently between a regular
jump and a running jump and how you
climb up the side of things
creating a cinematic style that no other
game of its time really had which was
especially important in the game sword
fights which created a visually striking
form a combat that no other games had it
was also important was that this game
differentiated itself from most other
platformers of the time most platformers
are very fast-paced and simple games of
just don't fall down pits or quickly get
through the level in this though there
are traps there are switches you have to
be careful not to step on so you
actually have to take your time figuring
out where is safe to walk and where is
not while still having to deal with the
game's time limit which is forcing you
to rush things giving players the need
to have to restart over and over again
as they learn the nuances of each games
level and complete them as quickly as
they can the combination of this game's
new take on the platforming genre and
its focus on cinematics was
revolutionary for its time now during
1989 there was another revolutionary PC
game that came out but for very
different reasons and that Sim City now
for a long time games were mostly
focused on trying to recreate things
that people found to be fun and regular
life trying to recreate sports recreate
fighting games things you would see in
movies or just puzzles or breathing new
life into old school games of originally
pen and paper
what Sim City chose to do instead was
create a game that was focused on
resource management timing and planning
and watching a city that you build grow
over time which ended up being way more
entertaining than anyone would have
thought before this game was released it
won all kinds of awards for its time and
started an entire new genre of games and
I'm not even talking about simulation
style games
it started the sandbox in the first
place all games up until that point had
an objective they had a purpose get to
the end of the level do this collect
this many items whereas Sim City was
just here's a bunch of tools do what you
want see where it leads whether that's
building the largest city you can or
just building a small village and then
having you get destroyed by a monster
this games wild success led to a ton of
direct sequels as well as a lot of
interesting sounding spin-offs like Sim
earth or even Sim ants and eventually
led to another huge sandbox game that is
of course the sims forth upon the list
let's take a look at one of the best
arcade games to come out at this time
final fight now final fight is an
interesting story because it was
originally planned to be a fighting game
and in fact was meant to be the original
Street Fighter 2 but after the wild
success that beat him ups like Double
Dragon were having Capcom saw that
wanted to make their own money and
turned it into a side-scrolling
beat-em-up
and ended up becoming one of the best
final fight was a huge visual upgrade
from other side-scrolling beat'em ups of
the time and was a huge technical
upgrade as well having a much more
interesting combat system and playable
characters that actually had important
differences other than simply how they
looked it also doesn't hurt that this
game had a fantastic soundtrack great
sound effects to accent it and some of
the most memorable character designs for
both the player characters and the
bosses it did so well that the original
game got ported and redesigned a few
times on different consoles and got two
direct sequels as well as an eventual
revival on the ps2 that well wasn't very
good and while we haven't gotten a new
final fight in quite some time the
characters still live on by making
appearances in various Capcom crossover
fighters or even in their main Street
Fighter series now last upon the list is
one of the most well known games ever
made with one of the most well known
main themes ever made and that's Tetris
now some of you might be thinking hold
on
Tetris has been around a whole lot
longer than 1989 which is true it was
available on home computers and even on
home consoles like the NES but the
version of Tetris that really spread
like wildfire and is the most well known
version is the gameboy version and
really Tetris is the game that made the
Gameboy sell as well as it did this is
the puzzle game that everyone knew
everyone fell in love with and inspired
the entire genre of
competitive puzzle games not to mention
as a case study this game really proves
how mobile gaming really benefits from
games that are easy to pick up play and
put down at any moment you want rather
than something involves sweeping large
levels now for those of you that are a
little salty that Tetris is on this list
when it didn't really originally come
out in 1989 well good news for you
there's a bonus game the fact is Sega
hasn't been getting a lot of love on
these lists mainly because Nintendo was
kicking their butt really hard the past
couple years but there's one title that
came out this year for the Genesis
that's close to my heart and I just
can't leave off the list and that's
golden axe that golden axe was another
side-scrolling beat-em-up that came out
this year but whereas most of those
games were focused on street brawls or
something in an urban setting this game
took it full-blown swords and sorcery
giving you heroes that were wielding
swords and axes and using powerful magic
to blow their enemies up sure final
fight had more technical fighting and
was a better looking game but golden axe
let you ride a freaking fire-breathing
lizard to attack your enemies with what
this game lacked in Polish it more than
made up with style and really we have it
to thank for the existence of future
fantasy style side-scrolling beat'em ups
that started incorporating RPG elements
as time went on this may not have been
the iconic Sega Genesis game which we
wouldn't get for a couple more years and
91 when Sonic the Hedgehog comes out but
it was the first really huge title that
made the system feel like a must-buy so
those are the best games of 1989 as
always there were a whole lot more
incredible games that came out that just
didn't make the list so if you've got a
favorite that I didn't talk about make
sure to let me know down in the comments
