of the original Harvest Moon on SNES
sold on eBay for three thousand seven
hundred and eighty three dollars which
is kind of insane it was put up for sale
by the company responsible for producing
the game Natsume and even they clearly
had no idea what was going to happen
because they only put it up for ninety
bucks probably figuring that yeah it's
an old game and popular and collectible
see it happens it hit a thousand in one
day in the last closing minutes jumped
all the way to just under 4k now yeah
sure there are other games out there
that sell for way more but that's when
you're talking about stuff like an Atari
game that only had a single copy of or
some game that had a messed up label and
it was a limited run this is a game that
was in regular circulation and sure it
is one of the more rare SNES games to
begin with but even then the cartridge
by itself goes for about 180 bucks
and a full set used is about 350 and to
top all this off if all you want to do
is play the game and not have some kind
of collector piece you can grab it on
the Wii U eShop right now for eight
bucks which is exactly what I did so I
could force someone to play it that's
never even heard of the series and see
what they think about someone dropping
$4,000 on it so you have no idea what
harvestman is no but according to this
game I was born when this came out
that's a subject is this like farmville
like on Facebook better 4x3 yeah
what's your name yeah especially cuz you
only have four characters what the hell
do drunk Oh dick have you seen mine
there are five women in this town that
you can seduce wait what yep you can get
married oh where you can consummate the
marriage oh you could have two kids Oh
what am i doing you're nodding yes I'm
going to bed no I who are you talking to
he's breaking the floor in the wall no
you have to hit it six times of that
movie
minecraft don't cut the dog
so this is where sex was like in the
nineties I'm gonna bust these nuts no
don't do it oh no God no you're gonna
keep working do it
oh potatoes are growing Oh full day
fools if I was a lot younger and had the
patience in time to dedicate myself I
think this would be a cool game how much
would you pay for like the game normally
five bucks
so what you thought since someone paying
four thousand for a sealed copy of this
whoever buys a four thousand dollar game
probably needs to pay rent
now obviously the person that dropped
four thousand dollars on this wasn't
doing it just they could rip the Box
open and play it it's of course a matter
of having it as a collector's item but
that still says something that you have
that much nostalgia and that much love
for that game that you think having a
mint-condition copy just to show off on
a shelf or put away in a hidden hoard is
worth dropping four thousand dollars on
so let me know what you guys think down
in the comments below how much would you
be willing to spend on one of your
favorite video games in mint condition
or do you think just collecting stuff
like that in the first place is
absolutely crazy as always if you
enjoyed the video hit the thumbs up
button let me know as well as subscribe
