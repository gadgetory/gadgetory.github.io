mail today we got this sent over to us
from the guys at analog and let's take a
look what's inside she's going to take a
second doughnut it's just going to going
to get there
almost not quite get it up close this is
awesome this is the analog and team mini
this is their new premium NES machine
and just really heavy by the way like a
lot more than I would expect it to be it
just feels really solid so this is a
device that plays old Nintendo games but
you can hook it up via HDMI and it's
going to put out an actual 1080p signal
and look really good at least that's the
plan you can even see on the back here
there's your HDMI out but it also
supports RGB composite component as
video all those other options if you do
want to use it with like an old CRT
you'll also see at the top here there's
actually two slots four cartridges
that's because this thing supports not
only NES games but also famicom games
which are the Japanese equivalent the
reason they're different is because
Famicom games have a 60 pin connector
while NES games have a 72 look let's see
what else we got in the box before we
set it up and try stuff out and then it
also comes with I've messed with these
before these are Wireless NES
controllers from 8-bit no it's designed
to work with the actual NES that Orca
the system as well obviously so just
plug this in and get a wireless
controller so let's go ahead and hook
this thing up and try it out so like I
said the NT mini is a premium way to
play actual old NES carts on new TVs
with zero issues the in--he mini uses
actual hardware designs based off of the
original NES not emulation and has its
own built in high quality upscaling that
pushes out a 1080p signal that is
ridiculously crisp taking a closer look
at the back of the system like I said
earlier you can see we have an HDMI port
along with ports for older video and
audio signals after that you've got a
mic port which supports an old handful
of Famicom games that featured audio
interactions
for instance the Famicom version of
Legend of Zelda featured enemies you
could kill by screaming into the mic
that does not work for the NES version
that I own then you've got a Famicom
expansion port which among other things
will also allow the NT mini to support
the Famicom disk system if you happen to
have one of those long around
hooking it up is as straightforward as
it gets and aside from a little opening
menu to adjust settings before launching
a game diving into classics is easy
whether you want to play a childhood
favorite from the NES or pop in a
Famicom import aside from being able to
just play old games the system comes
with a gargantuan number of little ways
you can tweak things you can display in
multiple resolutions choose from
different color palettes add scan lines
reposition the screen and you can even
crop to get rid of annoying glitchy
edges that some games get since old TV
is used to just over scan them out of
sight a neat little design option two is
that the NT Mini recognizes special
button combinations for system controls
for instance you can power the system on
and off by holding select and B or you
can open up the options menu by hitting
select and down the included wireless
controller gets the job done but if you
prefer the antes ports are just regular
NES controller ports so you can use
official Nintendo ones instead all in
all this thing is an incredible way to
re-experience Nintendo classics with all
the bells and whistles for hardcore
enthusiasts to appreciate that said at a
price point of 450 bucks for the
traditional gray one and 500 bucks to
grab it in black like you see here the
analog is definitely aimed at just that
hardcore old-school enthusiasts that
collect a bunch of games whereas regular
consumers might just get an easier kick
out of the NES classic edition instead</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
