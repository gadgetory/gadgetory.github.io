2d SXL special editions in the form of
this pokeball right here but at the same
time in Japan they got not only this
design but a special Pikachu design as
well that we did not get until now which
you can actually see right away with the
box is a super awesome design that just
immediate tells you well what you're
getting let's open this thing up and
check it out in person now because this
is a 2d s Excel we do get an AC adapter
thankfully oh yeah look at this cute
little guy look at that you know that
there have been plenty of Pikachu themed
things before I mean basically any
Pokemon thing always says Pikachu
plastered somewhere on it but I gotta
say that the approach with this design
were it's just his face is the whole DS
is pretty ridiculously cute like I
actually really like this something
about this one and the pokeball that's
really cool is how Nintendo kind of want
the extra step and it's not just a
design but they actually did different
molding like I don't know if this would
very comfortably fit like a case for a
2d s but you actually have like wow
actually both the cheeks and the kind of
nose area are uplifted a little little
poster you can you can nose that's come
on that is ridiculously adorable that's
stupid I really like this let's check
out how it looks so you've got a brown
border around here along with the face
brown buttons up top let's check out the
inside it's really weird because I know
this is Pikachu obviously it's Pikachu
but when you look at the inside without
any other context it's almost more
Donkey Kong
because it's brown with yellow for like
bananas there's not really a whole lot
of Pokemon feeling on the inside but
obviously I mean that's yeah still
that's ridiculously cube yeah I gotta
say personally I do think I like the
pokeball one a little more like I've
said before there have been so many
different Pikachu things before that the
pokeballs just a nice more neutral note
especially if Pikachu's not your
favorite Pokemon but if he is this is a
pretty undeniably cool design now real
quick something that we did find what
kind of getting prepped for this video
like I said Nintendo has done a ton of
Pikachu themed stuff and if you love
Pikachu but you don't feel like spending
all your money on buying a whole nother
2d as excel all over again they have
made lots of cool cases for the regular
2d SXL I think it works really well with
this white one in particular let's go
ahead and get this snap dong look at
that
you even get a little full body Pikachu
just hanging out sitting down that's
actually really nice looking so yeah if
you like Pikachu and you don't want to
spend money on a whole nother system
this is actually a really cool
alternative way to go that I'll link
down below for you guys to check out as
well I think it works really well with
the white but since it has this kind of
metallic sheen to it totally work on the
black and blue as well now if you're
wondering why we suddenly got this
Pikachu edition now instead of back when
the pokeball came out there's actually
not that great of a reason just yet but
Nintendo did kind of tie this together
with a couple announcements of things
all at once this has been released on
the same day that pokemon crystal has
now come to the Nintendo eShop and when
they announced that this was finally
coming to the US it was announced
alongside the fact that we're also
getting detective Pikachu your mother is
a dirty dirty later this year in March
along with that ridiculous slightly
oversized amiibo of him so yeah not like
super high synergy for its release date
but there is some cinematic reasons why
we're getting it now it is a little
uncredible or how he stares at you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
