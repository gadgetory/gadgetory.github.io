heading over to Nintendo rumor?
Well, considering that this morning
they just announced that
Cuphead is coming to the Switch,
it's happening.
(upbeat music)
In all seriousness, though,
it's really cool that Cuphead
is coming to the Switch
and that confirms at least some degree of
Nintendo and Microsoft hand shaking.
Whether or not this means that
we're gonna get the full rumor
that I was talking about before is true.
For those of you that don't know,
the rumor going around is that
Microsoft is gonna bring a lot
of their stuff to the Switch,
not just games, but also
services like Game Pass.
And that's a really interesting concept
that I'm personally excited
for, I hope that happens.
I think Microsoft is
slowly moving away from
focusing on their hardware,
instead being like,
&quot;Yeah, we make an X-box,
&quot;but we also just make all
this other cool stuff too
&quot;and we make it available
wherever people wanna play it.&quot;
So hopefully this is the
first step and evidence
that it's actually going to happen.
Personally, Cuphead is my favorite
Microsoft exclusive right now
they've release in the past few years.
There's other great
games, don't get me wrong,
but just Cuphead is such
a relatively unique idea,
especially with the art style,
and I love the challenge it presents,
that I am so excited to
have it available on the go
and not just on a console.
And I really hope that this is gonna see
just a little extra new
content come in as well.
I don't think they've confirmed anything
for the Switch version specifically,
but I do know we have
an expansion on the way
that'll hopefully be soon,
because I need more of it.
With Project XCloud on the horizon,
can we expect an Xbox
handheld in the future,
or Switch style smartphone controller?
Honestly, I don't think
Microsoft plans to make
any kind of hardware for Project XCloud.
I think the whole point is
to bring it to other devices
and just let stuff that
already works, work.
After all, you can already
use an Xbox One controller
with an Android style phone,
that's the exact setup
they've been showing
every time they've demonstrated
how XCloud can work.
They have an Xbox One controller
with a little phone clip,
and they have an Android
phone attached to that.
So I really think that's the
only route they're gonna go,
and instead of doing a
Switch type controller,
they could just bring XCloud to Switch,
like we were talking about.
There is a lot of rumor and kind of
evidence trying to pile up that
Xbox is willing to work with Nintendo,
and that could be one
of the forms it takes.
So yeah, short version,
I don't think they're
gonna make any hardware,
I think they're just gonna bring it to
as much preexisting stuff as possible,
and focus on the service.
Okay, guys, I know I should
be answering questions,
but I was just on Twitter
and had the thought,
what if Cuphead in Smash Brothers?
Maybe that'll be another video later.
That'd be cool.
What do you think the next
big hit on Switch will be?
Okay, let me just be straight,
objective, honest here,
probably Pokemon.
I mean, it just makes sense.
Pokemon Let's Go already did pretty well,
and that was kind of a
remake, reboot, re-imagining,
whatever, of the original games.
So having an actual new
mainline Pokemon entry come
and be the actual first main series one
to be on a bigger high quality console
than just the little handhelds,
that's probably gonna be it.
I also think Fire Emblem
has a decent chance,
because Fire Emblem Awakening is really
what kind of jump started the 3DS
and saved it from its
initial lackluster launch.
But I don't know if necessarily
the next one's gonna be big enough
to follow that same momentum.
It's probably gonna be
Pokemon, who are we kidding?
Which starter Pokemon are you gonna choose
for Pokemon Sword and Shield?
Alright, so I'm really
sorry to fans of Sobble,
but right now I'm between
Grookey and Scorbunny.
I'm not 100% for either one just yet.
I'm leaning towards Scorbunny
because I traditionally
always really like fire types,
and so that's big plus for me.
But I have to admit,
there's something appealing
to me about Grookey
that he's just a monkey with a stick
and he hits things with a stick.
That's hilarious, I love that.
But I'm not for sure sold
neither one just yet.
I'm gonna wait for the final evolutions,
and that's when I'm
gonna make my decision,
because yeah, come on,
it depends on how cool they
look in the end, right?
What are you most excited to see from E3?
First off, what do we even
have left to see right now?
So Sony left, they're
just not there at all.
EA is going to be there
with their own separate EA plaything,
but they're not doing a press conference,
which might mean
we're not actually getting
any real game announcements,
which, honestly, I am kind of okay
missing their press conference.
That's usually the most painful.
So from the people left, we have Nintendo,
which I think I would really like to see
more in from Pokemon.
Last year they did a whole direct,
basically focused on just Smash Brothers.
I would not mind if that was
the approach they took
this time for Pokemon,
cause I wanna know more about that game.
From other companies,
I'm actually really curious
to see out of anyone,
they're not gonna have
their own press conference,
but Capcom.
I wanna see what else Capcom's working on
because they've had an
amazing start of this year.
Resident Evil 2 Remake was amazing.
Devil May Cry 5 is amazing.
They've brought back Anemuja.
I wanna see what else
they have in the works.
Because if they're maintaining
this same kind of momentum
of just bringing old stuff
back, I'm super excited.
I would love to see a
Mega Man X announcement.
(upbeat music)
♪ We're fighting robots ♪
♪ Mega Man ♪
because they already kind of hinted that
they're gonna maybe give
it the same treatment
they gave Mega Man with Mega Man 11,
so that would be cool.
There's a lot of unknowns
and a lot of stuff I could be excited for,
but Capcom, I think, is
the top right now for me.
When do you think we'll see
Wonderful 101 on Switch,
and if it turns out to be a sequel,
what would you name it?
Honestly, I want both of those to be true.
Wonderful 101 is one of the
few games from the Wii U
that hasn't been ported yet
that I would love to just
have available on the Switch,
especially handheld on the go.
As for what I would call it,
they would have to call
it Wonderful 102, right?
There's no other way to name that.
Wonderful 102.
That's what it is.
That's what it's gonna be if it happens.
What classic remakes do you
think could be on the table
since Link's Awakening was
announced at the latest Direct?
This is actually really
interesting to think about
because while Link's Awakening
is getting a lot of attention right now,
Nintendo's actually been doing
a lot of remakes recently.
Really think about it,
we have Link's Awakening
coming out later this year.
Last year we got Pokemon Let's Go,
which was basically a re-imagining
of Red, Blue, and Yellow.
And the year before we got
Metroid 2 Remake on the 3DS.
So I think Nintendo's actually been
really on this heavy kick
of at least once a year,
bringing out some kind of re-imagining
or remake of a classic game.
So what's next?
Well, we have Metroid, Pokemon,
and Zelda out of the way.
Something from Mario is possible,
but I feel like Nintendo has done
so much Mario stuff all
the time every year,
that I'm not really
thinking it's super likely.
If they did, maybe something
for Mario Brothers 3
or Super Mario World.
Or they could even do something
with the Mario Land games on Gameboy,
that would certainly be an outside choice.
Other franchises they could maybe revive,
I think a lot of people would
love to see F-Zero come back.
I think that would be a
big, awesome, cool idea.
But honestly, they have such
a huge library to choose from,
I can't pick just one specific game.
Do you think FromSoft's
Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice
will be as successful as
Dark Souls or Bloodborne?
Kind of.
I think it's gonna sell really well,
I think there's just a lot of people
that are excited of the concept of just
another game from FromSoft,
but at the same time,
I think a lot of people
aren't exactly gonna get
what they're expecting.
There's no early reviews of Sekiro yet,
but there are hands on impressions
and more gameplay that's been shown,
and while there is some of that DNA
clearly from Dark Souls and
Bloodborne that's in there,
it looks to be a pretty
different style kind of game.
It's really more focused on
being like an old school Tenchu
where it's a more stealth-action
hybrid kind of deal.
So I think it's gonna do well,
I think it's probably gonna get
some good critical praise, I hope,
but I think everyone who buys it
isn't necessarily gonna get
the game they were expecting.
Thoughts on PS5 backwards compatibility.
So for those of you who have not been
paying attention to the news,
one rumor that's been going around is that
while Sony is working on
their next generation system,
the PS5, probably,
they are supposedly interested in
actually bringing back
backwards compatibility.
And not just backwards
compatibility with PS4, no, no, no,
supposedly they're working
on going all the way back
to work with PS4, PS3, PS2, and PS1,
which would be insane.
I would love that so much
if they actually did it,
because I would love a convenient way
to actually be able to play my
PS2 games, hooked up to HDMI.
Yes, I could hunt down a
first generation model PS3,
but I don't wanna do that, I like my Slim.
So if I could have a new system that plays
that entire library on the disks,
not just with some downloadable
game content or whatever,
no, I wanna be able to use
my old disks on the system,
that would be so cool.
Why should you buy a
Nintendo Switch in 2019?
(upbeat music)
Why not?
It's fun, it's got some good games.
Play them.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
