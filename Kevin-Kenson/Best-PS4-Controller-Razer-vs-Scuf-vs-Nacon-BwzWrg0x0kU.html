channel you'll know I've done a review
of two officially licensed pro
controllers for the ps4 that are right
now only out in Europe the Nikon
revolution and the razor rise you now
the question is is it worth grabbing one
of these right away importing one or
waiting to have to come out stateside or
is it better to instead just right now
gel free fully kitted out scuf
controller so to start let's just talk
about form factor and the overall
comfort of each controllers design now
it's pretty clear that both the rising
revolution are much more closely based
on Xbox one controller rather than I ps4
personally I do think this is a more
comfortable option the rise you is
pretty much the same while the
revolution is closed but a little block
your little thicker in the grips
while the scuf controller is basically
just a modified ps4 built on so that's
actually one benefit if you're used to a
ps4 controller and you don't want to use
something that's like an Xbox controller
this is going to feel a lot more
familiar to you it also has the benefit
of being an actual wireless controller
whereas both the revolution and ride you
are going to use a wire
now of course comfort is only so
important what's more important for your
performance is button and stick quality
so let's start by looking at the Ryu now
the one thing about this controller I
don't like that I want to get out of the
way is a stick design it's not exactly
concave and it does have this rubber
grip design but it still feels really
slippery to me now you might be thinking
oh I'll just buy a control freak to add
on top of that will be fine that won't
work either because these stick heads
are a little larger in diameter than a
ps4 so that's not going to fit aside
from that though I like pretty much
everything else on this controller the
d-pad is okay but the triggers are
amazing I like all the different
customized buttons that are easy to
access and all the front-facing buttons
are mechanical which is really cool
actually once you start using it now
moving on to the revolution well I
didn't like the sticks on the right hue
I really like the sticks on this one it
has my favorite layout of a concave
stick on the left hand and a convex
stick on the right this is going to keep
your thumb placed here and give you a
nice precise controlled movements for
FPS games on this one everything else is
a little more hidden miss I don't really
care for the shoulder buttons they
remind me a lot of the ps3 words it's
very kind of soft not satisfying
trickable feels weird to me the buttons
are a little larger which makes them
easier to hit especially if you're very
frantic one thing that's hidden is
definitely are the customizable buttons
I love you
here I hate these ones here this is
comfortable this is not then we have the
scuf controller now it is worth
mentioning that with scuff everything
you do is made to order so you pick what
options you want for the purpose of this
video I fully kitted it out and did
everything other than a paint job but if
there's something you don't like you
don't have to do that you can just order
everything else so looking at all these
add-ons I mean you can see we have these
trigger extenders you have the circle
pad design the d-pad which does make it
easier for rolling but if you want to
use traditional designs you can just
lift it off you can also pick whatever
sticks you want there are four options
so I'm with my favorite concave on the
Left convex and taller on the right and
you can remove them and put other sticks
in if you want to change for different
games you also have these panels on the
back which act as two additional buttons
that you can customize
speaking of customization this is
something that each of the controllers
handles very very differently let's
start by looking at the revolution
because it's the only one of these
controllers that uses software for its
customization that means you actually
have to hook it up to your PC and launch
an app for doing any of the little
tweaks and customization options you
want for things like trigger sensitivity
or unique to this controller stick
acceleration and even creating
full-blown macros to use on the
customizable buttons now the ratio on
the other hand is actually very light on
customization options compared to the
other two it's mostly pure quality
without options what you can do though
is activate trigger stops with these
little switches on the back you can
remove these customizable buttons back
here if you don't like them by just
using a screwdriver that comes with it
and you can customize the buttons using
an onboard control deck right here along
with having audio controls and then this
brings us back to the scuf controller
which like I said earlier you can order
these however you like and so it's
designed to be very modular and all the
different physical bits can be changed
in and out you can change the different
d-pad designs change out sticks do
different button mappings on the back
paddles change out the triggers and one
of the more interesting things to or how
you do trigger controls by activating
subs by using a little screw attachment
to move this down here you also can
remap these buttons using an electric
tool used to attach it to the back hit
the panel you want to change hit a
button and then release so in the end
which of these controllers is best to go
with well honestly this is actually a
really tough decision because they each
have such different individual strengths
and you
approaches that really comes down to
what you personally prefer now in my
case I'm leaning a bit more towards the
razer ryu while i don't care for the
sticks that much i like everything else
about it as the most comfortable grip
and I never knew how badly I wanted
mechanical buttons on a controller until
I started using it after that the make
on revolution and coming in last place
for me the Frankenstein that is a fully
kitted out scuf controller</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
