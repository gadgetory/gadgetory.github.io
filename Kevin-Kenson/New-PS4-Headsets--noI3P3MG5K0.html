newest set of top-of-the-line gaming
headsets called the arctas pros offers
better audio quality fantastic
positional sound and a whole bunch of
features and we just happen to have both
of them right here so let's talk about
what these things have to offer and
whether or not it's really worth
spending the extra money on now at first
glance these might look like the same
headset which to be honest they almost
are they're both artists pros the only
difference is that this is the wireless
design and this is the wired I just
don't have it plugged in right now and
there are some very important
differences between the two based on
design decisions they made for wired
versus Wireless but otherwise as far as
just the physical design go they are
pretty much the same thing so let's just
talk about the overall design of them
now obviously this thing has some of the
same core design aspects of the other
arctas headsets but there have been some
changes for the pro that do make it a
bit nicer than all the other ones
they've done so far and for comparison
we actually have an ArcGIS 3 Bluetooth
right here so one of the things you're
gonna feel right away when you use one
of these headsets versus one of these is
that the ear cut padding is
significantly thicker so it's gonna be a
lot more comfortable your head for long
term gaming sessions I mean I always
thought this one was really good this
just topped it for me even more there's
also some slight changes to the headband
design whereas this one just has the
kind of stretchy one right here that's a
little adjustable this has one that runs
through the whole part of the headset so
you can change the headband distancing a
lot more also the actual headband itself
incorporates a actual metal piece
instead of being all plastic so it's
gonna be a little sturdier and have a
little more resistance than the other
ones would end of the day really
comfortable as I said earlier there are
two different versions of the arctas pro
a wireless and a wired and there's
actually some pretty significant
differences between the two aside from
the fact that one of them uses a cable
so let's talk about what each one's
going to get you starting with the wired
one now of the two Pro versions the
wired one is the more affordable choice
but it's actually also the better
sounding one as well now this isn't to
say that the wireless one sounds
terrible the wired one sounds good no
they both have a really solid bass line
in fact while they may not compare to
like actual dedicated audio headsets as
far as gaming headsets go these things
sound incredible and they have a great
sense of separation and locational
placing so when you're playing games
you're able to very easily separate all
the different sounds that are going on
and be able to tell where they're
happening relative
position now the reason why the wired
one is better for audio than the
Wireless isn't just the fact that it's a
cabled setup but else because it comes
with this little guy right here a
dedicated gaming deck now if you don't
know what a DAC is that's a digital to
analog converter now all different
systems stuff already have one of these
built in your ps4 has one even your
controller where you plug in a headset
they have them but those ones are
normally cheaper and just kind of get
the job done this one is a dedicated one
that is much higher quality it's not
only gonna make sure that you have a
really good sound for your headset but
you have a lot more fine-tuned control
over being able to balance the EQ
however you want exactly for the game
you're playing another benefit to to
this being a wired setup is that power
isn't really an issue you're always
plugged into battery all the time so
they also threw in RGB lights forward
both headphones that you can customize a
little bit through the interface you can
have whatever color you want being
showing off now what is it downsides to
this headset and admittedly this is just
something inherent with most wired
designs is that a lot of the cables
comes with aren't particularly long both
the optical and USB to micro-usb so
while this is designed for both ps4 and
PC this one really leans much more in
the territory of PC rear desk setup or
if you happen to use a ps4 in a desk
setup now you could get longer cables to
hook it up and make it work but that's
still kind of an awkward situation we
have cables run across the entire floor
of your room not optimal but if you
really want that audio quality and in
the living room setup that's pretty much
the only option you have now on the
other hand with the wireless headset yes
you're losing out on RGB lights and the
auto quality doesn't give you as much
fine-tuned control but the baseline is
honestly still really good and for me
the convenience factor of Wireless is a
big win for that now I thought just that
this is a wireless headset there are
some other really cool design decisions
that were made that incorporate that
idea now so far most SteelSeries
headsets when they're wireless are
either bluetooth or make use of a
dedicated 2.4 signal using a transmitter
this one does both and there's really
two main different benefits to that
first off the versatility the fact that
yes when you're using your ps4 PC to get
the best audio possible you want to use
the dedicated transmitter but at the
same time if you just want to hook it up
to your phone or a tablet or just
something really quick or simple so you
can use it as just a regular headset
you can do that with the Bluetooth no
problem the other benefit is that you're
able to use both these signals at the
same time so for a gaming situation the
idea would be
let's say it's hooked up to your ps4
your running game audio into this from
your ps4 but you're also using a chat
service on your phone or a computer so
you can use that for talking with your
friends at the same time another feature
I really love about this wireless
headset that's it's not a feature unique
to just this particular one
SteelSeries is used it before but it's
the first time that it's in an Arctic
headset and that's its battery solution
there is nothing more annoying to me
than having a wireless accessory that I
lost track of when I last plugged it in
all the sudden the heated moment I got
to plug it into something in BAM it's no
longer a wireless accessory super
annoying the solution that this one uses
though is having two separate batteries
now the way this works is super simple
let's say the headsets getting a low on
battery and you need to replace it ASAP
well instead having to plug it in or
anything as soon as you have a moment
all you gotta do is just pop off this
backplate for a super accessible battery
take that guy out go over to your
transmitter your transmitter has the
other battery slotted in here and it's
not powering the transmitter the
transmitter is actually charging it so
you just pop that one out switch it with
the one from your headset and bam the
dead battery is now charging and your
headset is fully charged its
conveniences like this that really make
the wireless one really cool in my
opinion you are getting better audio and
age more affordable price with the wired
design but the convenience of this thing
is so great that honestly between the
two this is my personal favorite</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
