we're living in a time right now where a
lot of amazing retro classics are
getting a second chance to be made
easily accessible for lots of people to
experience whether it's people wanting
to play old school favorites of theirs
that they've just al-jabbar or for
younger gamers to get a first-time
experience with now Sunday's games are
being made available digitally across a
number different platforms but another
really popular method right now is
releasing games on singular consoles
that usually have kind of a best of list
now a popular example this is of course
the Nintendo classic edition but if you
want to go even further back there's a
collection even for the Atari 2600 for
50 bucks you get a cool little system
that looks like the old-school one that
comes with Wireless sticks that lets you
play 120 different Atari classics now
that may sound like a good deal but
there's one way to go just a little more
fancy a little more extravagant and play
a whopping four games for $50,000 the
Tesla
Thanks your recent update test learners
can now access a really simple Atari
emulator through the Easter Egg drawer
which allows them to play for different
Atari classics specifically the arcade
versions which in all LC 10 times out of
10 the arcade versions are better than
the 2600 at home ports now if you want
to play these you do have to be parked
in the car you cannot play and drive at
the same time for reasons I personally
cannot comprehend but once you're set up
you're able to play these games either
using a touchscreen interface where
there's actually like a little picture
of an arcade cabinet you're playing on
or you can even go fullscreen on the
tablet and control using the little
knobs on the steering wheel before
moving on I want to take a second to
think LastPass for sponsoring today's
video LastPass is a super easy way to
manage access and protect all of your
passwords something that personally I
have always really needed help with I
cannot tell you how many times I have
forgotten passwords for things that I've
used for different sides because I used
different ones different laces I've had
to reset them I've lost notes and
LastPass completely removes all that
worried especially in today's rules how
many different accounts everyone needs
to juggle it's really important that you
don't use a single password across
multiple accounts because as soon as one
of those is compromised they're all
compromised and that's a really easy
mistake to make for people they don't
want to have to memorize a hundred
different passwords at all the same time
LastPass removes that burden it makes it
really easy to manage so you can make
sure you have a unique password for
every single one of your accounts and
with multi-factor authentication you can
rest easy that all that information is
going to be safe and sound it even makes
using passwords on mobile a lot easier
by Auto filling your information on
mobile websites or on any apps that
you're using make sure to check out the
link down below to learn more about
LastPass so what are these games what
doesn't actually play them on a Tesla
well let's break it down game by game
based on when they were originally
released starting all the way back in
1979 with lunar lander lunar lander is
significant and that it is the first
game Atari made that used vector
graphics it wasn't the first game to use
that graphic technology but it was
Ataris first foray into it it's based on
this entire genre that's actually named
the same thing lunar landers based on
the entire idea of landing a lunar
module safely on the moon and this is
actually one of the first ones to use a
graphic interface versus being a
text-based adventure or any other kind
of simple form of gameplay it was also
an excellent way to get people to spend
a lot of quarters on a single game
because instead of using quarters just
as a way to start a new playthrough or
gain
for life you actually able to spend
quarters directly in a single
playthrough to add more fuel to your
lunar module hopefully giving you a
better chance of safely securing a
landing a que great way to make a lot of
money
also one of the first games to actually
make use of multiple perspectives in
which you have a large landscape shot of
the moon when you're first trying to
land your lunar module and once you get
close to the ground it zooms in
significantly next up also from 1979 is
asteroids Ataris much more successful
vector graphics based game and honestly
one of the most significant games in
gaming history asteroids took a familiar
formula of flying a ship to shoot down
different objects but changed it instead
of being something like space invaders
you're just shooting at things
descending on you you actually a free
roam of the map and can wrap around it
while using physics based controls that
are honestly a nightmare to play
nowadays this game benefited big-time
from the decision to go with
vector-based graphics instead of pixel
ones because it gave players a lot more
minut control and fine aim versus the
limitations they would have with
something that used pixels especially
for back then during its time and this
is very easily provable by just playing
the arcade version and then comparing it
to the atari port which is a lot more
rough yeah this definitely does have the
same kind of satisfaction that the
vector one gives you because you have
such more control over like where you
can shoot exactly where's this one you
just kind of see every frame you turn
this almost doesn't even feel like the
same game with the way the asteroids
move around they're all a lot faster and
they're just kind of going in a much
more predictable straight pattern I mean
I guess they were in the other one too
but there was more sense of momentum
with everything it'd be really great we
got another Atari classic system like
this but one that actually focused all
in the arcade versions of ones because
there's really no reason that you
couldn't emulate those at this point I
mean sure vector graphics were awesome
for their time but you can basically
simulate that same experience with how
many more pixels you can support on an
image then we get to Missile Command
from the 1980s a game that honestly I
have always been terrible at no matter
how many times I've tried to play it
across my entire life now if you're not
familiar with the game the entire object
is you have these three missile
batteries we can shoot down various
missiles that are slowly falling from
the sky you have a limited ammunition
and you're doing your best to protect
these six different cities as well as
your missile batteries from getting
blown up and fun notes something that I
didn't really realize until replaying it
most recently now it is a very dark game
when you think about it considering the
fact that there's not really a way to
ever win you just get as far as you can
and
when you lose the game doesn't use the
traditional interface of just saying hey
game over you lost it says the end as in
this was inevitable
everything gets destroyed perfectly
fitting that theme this was by far the
most annoying game to play on the Tesla
so with the touchscreen interfaces if
you're using the full screen it had you
actually hitting the basis you want to
have fire at the same time as trying to
aim using another finger on this trip ad
which got really confusing sometimes
figuring out which one I want to fire
when and just quickly moving around the
entire screen using the arcade cabinet
controls still not great honestly if you
have a Tesla and you're able to play
these games just just you're clear that
one that's that's good call and then we
come to my personal favorite game on
this list one of my all-time favorites
that I used to play in arcades way back
when centipede centipede is very
reminiscent of some other classic
shooter games from arcades like space
invaders but it's much much much more
hectic where you're constantly trying to
shoot down these bugs when you killed
them to create more mushrooms blockage
they change paths there's all kinds of
other insects you'd be wary of as you
get further in the game it's really
hectic and later levels and so much fun
that being said once again not the
smoothest experience on the Tesla still
better than Missile Command but a little
rough going the full-screen command
controls actually worked pretty well
it's just trying to get the rapid fire
to go as well as you can the touchscreen
controls bring you actually using the
Atari cabinet design it was actually I
could play it I placed pretty far better
than I did in some of the other games
but still little rough historically
significant fact for this game centipede
was actually one of the few games from
Atari that was co-developed by one of
the few women that worked in the games
industry at the time Donna Bailey so is
a Tesla the most cost effective way to
experience some awesome arcade classics
not really but it's really cool to see
the impact of these games had that to
this day when they're almost 40 years
old they're still showing up this way it
really makes you think you know I mean
how many games today are gonna have that
kind of lasting influence where 40 50
100 years from now they're still gonna
be referenced in this kind of way I mean
are we gonna have awesome far future
space cars let you play bubsy the woolie
strike back I hope so</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
