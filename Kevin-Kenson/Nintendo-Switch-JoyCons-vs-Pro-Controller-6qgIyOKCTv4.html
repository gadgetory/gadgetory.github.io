switch opened it up and then discovered
joy Kahn's are really really tiny and
now we're at the out a little bit
controller for ants like a center for
ants but you do know that Nintendo is
making a pro controller for 70 bucks so
the question is is worth running out and
buying one of these let's take a look at
all the different ways you can play
switch games and which way is the best
to begin with let's cover all different
ways you can use joy Khan there's
basically three main methods aside from
using them in handheld mode you can use
a pair of joy Khan's
one in each hand freely you can put them
together to have in a grip like this or
for really simple games or local
multiplayer situations you can use a
single joy Khan sideways now like I said
back in my review I really personally
like using one in each hand it's not
that it's the most precise controls or
the highest performance but just how
comfortable it really is I mean if you
ever used a Wii back in the day imagine
having two emotes one each hand is that
were smaller more comfortable and most
importantly didn't have a cable running
between them you never realize how
annoying it is to actually have both
hands together all the time all gaming
with this you can just kind of leave
them at your side and play really
relaxed it's also good to note that if
they are so small that it actually
bothers the ability of larger hands
Nintendo does sell grip attachments that
will go over them to make them larger
now the other option straight out of the
box is you can slide two controllers
into the grip which personally I really
really don't like it's supposed to be
closer to using a traditional controller
which is accurate but you're basically
getting the worst aspects of the joy
columns with none of the benefits and
it's just this weird freakish monster
that doesn't feel good at all the grips
are very tiny they're not grip very well
to the hand and you realize how stiffly
positioned all the buttons are and here
that you also notice some of the
problems for instance a lot of these
buttons are very close together I find
myself in some games where for instance
let's say I have to hit be a jump and
why to attack I'll accidentally brush a
or X which is a really big problem in
some games now the last method is of
course using a single joique on sideways
now really interesting thing about this
that not a lot of people notice is that
the left
right joke on don't have the same
spacing the stick is further to the left
or right depending on which one you use
so it's kind of designed so that you can
figure out which one feels a little more
comfortable for your particular hands
for me I like the right one now with
that in mind there is something I bought
on a whim just to try it out and I am so
glad I did there's this little
third-party accessory that acts as a
handle for each joy con it's really easy
to use it's just this little fold here
they place it inside they are shaped
specifically for the left and right and
it latches in all the buttons including
the shoulder ones work really well with
it it makes it actually feel like a
little controller it's still not going
to beat out using some of the other
control methods but in a local
multiplayer situation these things are
amazing for how much you pay so the joy
con is really versatile but how do all
of these options stack up against using
an actual traditional controller like
the pro one well honestly this is better
the switch pro controller is an
evolution of what Nintendo tried doing
with the Wii U pro controller that was
basically just an Xbox 360 controller
but they decided to try and be different
and switched the buns of the sticks that
honestly didn't actually feel that great
with the switch pro controller you'll
see if they're using the exact same
setup but overall it just feels a lot
better now there is an exception to this
and that's the fact that when it comes
to really intensive gaming I prefer this
for sure but if I'm doing anything
that's much slower and pace if it's a
turn-based game where it's just a very
easy games I don't have to be super
focused on I actually do end up using
the joi cons instead because it's just
so easy to lay back and relax when using
them if I'm not really in a dedicated
gaming mode these are just more fun to
use so should you rush out and buy a pro
controller right away
not really it's cool it's worth having
and worth upgrading to eventually but
it's not the kind of thing that's an
absolute necessity the joi cons are
comfortable and they get the job done
also come on pretty R colors</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
