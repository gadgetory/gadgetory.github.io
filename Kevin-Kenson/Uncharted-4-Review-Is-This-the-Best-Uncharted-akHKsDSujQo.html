Dog's fantastic adventure franchise
finally released for the ps4 after
numerous pushbacks and thankfully it's
one of those games that made the weight
worth it now to be honest the Uncharted
franchise is one that I've always had a
bit of mixed feelings about on the one
hand I've enjoyed the stories they tell
they have some of the best in-game
camerawork of any game series ever and
they do an excellent job of capturing
the feel of pulpy adventure they're
trying to recapture from films like
Indiana Jones on the other hand I've
always felt that the actual gameplay
aspect of the games was a bit lacking
gunplay has always been very loose
feeling stealth was never that effective
and while the platforming is very pretty
the vast majority of it in past games
boiled down to a very pretty but
handheld hallway and I gotta say
uncharted 4 has done an excellent job of
relieving a lot of those frustrations
and has been a big upgrade in pretty
much every major category now obviously
being the first game in the series to be
on ps4 thief's end is a noticeable
graphical upgrade over the past games
the distant backgrounds the ruins you'll
explore character facial movements all
of it is excellently detailed and it
helps that not only is the graphical
quality good but the game set design in
general is fantastic with the story
encompassing various countries and
Forgotten ruins each with their own
strong aesthetic look and feel helping
to keep the players sense of adventure
piqued now of course visuals alone do
not make a great game but thankfully
uncharted 4 continues to excel the
things that made the previous game so
great in particular the writing the
overall story of thief's end is okay it
accomplishes the main objective of being
a fun adventure with some dramatic
moments but what really carries the
whole thing is character banter and
dialogue Naughty Dog continues to prove
their mastery over realistic feeling
conversations that draw in players
making characters feel like real people
rather than just forced movie cliches
despite the ridiculous situations they
find themselves in the Ascend also
features the addition of a few
occasional dialogue option moments
though they have little to no impact and
are overall pretty rare feeling as
though this was a feature they
originally meant to expand on more and
simply left unfinished it doesn't
detract from the game at all but they do
feel oddly out of place considering how
little they pop up now as I said earlier
a lot of my gripe
with the older games mostly come from
the mediocre gameplay not that it was
bad just not particularly great and
while four still has its weak points
overall it's a major upgrade over what
we last saw in three platforming has
gotten a lot better while a lot of it is
still very linear more parts of the game
embraced multiple pathways and options
making locales feel a lot more realistic
and immersive though of course there's
still tons of conveniently falling
pillars or random boxes on wheels but
hey that adds to the game's fun tone
gunplay itself is still kinda weak and
is definitely one of the game's lesser
aspects but the cover controls are on
point and the option of an auto aim mode
basically turns Nate into a god of death
if you'd rather get through the action
as fast as possible and focus on the
story and exploration bits it also helps
that this time around all of drake's and
PC allies are way smarter actually
contributing to combat taking down
enemies providing cover fire and can
help save Drake from grappling enemies
stealth elements also make their return
and overall are a lot more viable than
before past games it was kind of silly
easy to awkwardly get caught turning
every encounter into a shootout but
fours level design and tightened up
controls make it a lot more possible to
take down whole groups of enemies
without getting caught for is also the
first game in the franchise to feature
fully controllable vehicle segments the
driving controls aren't the tightest but
compared to other games that tack on
vehicles it gets the job done without
being a massive pain and despite the
fact the game manages to have one of my
favorite car chases I've ever played in
a video game now all of this put
together makes your first playthrough of
uncharted 4 one of if not the best
experiences in the franchise but what
makes this even better is the postgame
content for brings back the postgame
bonuses we had in - that were sorely
missed in three rewarding players who
took their time exploring and collecting
the game's various treasures by letting
them unlock various cheats and gameplay
mods
these range from purely useful powers
like summoning a gun you'd like to have
or having infinite ammo - stranger or
just plain fun abilities like adding
bullet time to the game turning down
gravity or throwing a filter over the
whole game that makes everything
cel-shaded 8-bit or have it look like a
rainbow vomited everywhere while of
course you could still do a second
playthrough just for the sake of
tackling a higher difficulty all these
goodies make playing through the game
more than
a lot more appealing oh yeah and there's
also a multiplayer mode that is way more
fun than I ever would have expected it
to be it's not exactly Pro competitive
type stuff but it's a fun much more
laid-back feeling multiplayer experience
giving players powers like summoning and
PC allies or even using mystical powers
like any multiplayer mode added onto a
game that people mostly grab for
single-player the online community will
probably be dead within four or five
months but if you grab the game before
that happens
it's definitely worth killing some time
on overall uncharted form makes for a
fantastic conclusion of the franchise
definitely a better one than three was
and as easily one of the best games that
is exclusive to the ps4 right now if you
enjoy the past games then you'll love
this one and if you had a lukewarm
response to the older ones this one just
might change your mind</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
