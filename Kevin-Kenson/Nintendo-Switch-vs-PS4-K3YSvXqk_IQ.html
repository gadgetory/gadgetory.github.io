is should I get a PS4 or a Switch?
And this is a really
intriguing question to me
because when you think back to the more
kind of traditional, older question
of PlayStation versus
Xbox, we're talking about
two things that offer
roughly the same experience.
Yes, there's arguments about
which one has better exclusives
or better graphics or
better special services,
but ultimately, they offer
very similar libraries of games
with a very similar overall experience.
But when it comes to The
Switch versus the PS4
or even The Switch versus the Xbox One,
these are two very different things.
When I think about Sony's
approach to their system,
I view them as being the
very hardcore traditionalists
out of the three major
companies right now.
They make a gaming system that has
a good amount of power behind it.
It will play games, you
plug in controllers,
and the focus is just
making fun, cool games
for that system that are
gonna look really pretty.
This isn't to say they
don't take any risks
or don't experiment at all.
There's been plenty of other hardware that
they've worked on aside
from their main system.
They've done their handhelds
with the PSP and the PS Vita.
They've messed with motion controls on PS3
and now PS VR on PlayStation 4
and they've done different side services
like being able to stream play PS3 games
so there's those other things out there,
I just think they always take a backseat
to the main focus of having
strong first party games
and what the hardware
of the main system is.
And if any of these ideas don't work out,
well they get dropped or
moved pass pretty quickly.
When I think about Nintendo
on the other hand though,
despite them being the
older company of the two,
at least when it comes to
being in the gaming industry,
I think of them being the
more risk-taking innovators.
'Cause again, while Sony
has messed with some ideas,
it's always kind of a side project,
whereas Nintendo, if they're
going to do something different
that's the main focus.
If they make a new handheld,
hey, let's give it two screens
or the Wii with having motion controls,
the Wii U with the
tablet and now The Switch
with its ability to switch
between the two different modes.
And this is a tactic
that has both worked out
really great for Nintendo and not so much.
I mean, the DS was a big success
but the 3DS had a really rough lunch
until the right games
came out 'cause surprise,
no one was really that
excited about the 3D visuals.
The Wii sold really well,
but it also pushed away
a lot of the different
third parties' support
because it didn't have
the graphical power of its competitors.
And the Wii U did not sell well at all
because a lot of people weren't
really sure what exactly was
the difference between
getting a Wii or Wii U.
And now with The Switch, well,
that's definitely the idea
that's worked out the
best in quite some time.
When it comes to games,
I think PlayStation
also has this very singular
focus in what exactly
they're looking for in
their first party titles.
Obviously if you look at the whole library
of what's in the PlayStation,
there's a wide variety
of different things but when it comes
to first party stuff
that's been emphasized
over the last few years
from Sony directly,
they're all these very, single player,
cinematic, adventure style stories.
That isn't to say that there's no variety
amongst their style of games,
it's just that those are
the major check boxes
they all wanna hit at all times.
Whether it's an open
world game like Spider-Man
or Horizon Zero Dawn or
a more traditionally,
linear adventure like from Uncharted.
Even with concepts like
horror or survival games,
you end up with stuff like The Last of Us,
which again, is very
focused on this cinematic
single-player story to tell.
There's different game playing candidates
between all of these, but
they're all tied together
by this focus that something's very much
a move-like experience when
it comes to the cut scenes
and what kind of story is being told.
On the other hand with Nintendo,
I think it again comes back to this idea
of what can be fun,
innovative and different.
Even when relying on big name franchises
they've had forever which
certainly doesn't hurt
like Mario, Legend of Zelda, Pokemon.
Even with those, the
way they approach them
on The Switch and on other systems,
is how can we do things a little
bit differently this time?
Whether that's taking Legend of Zelda
and making it a free roam game
that relies less on
traditional dungeon-delving
like the last so many games had done.
A Mario game that revisits
the idea of Mario 64
or a Pokemon game that does
the first game all over again
but completely changes the gameplay style.
There's also this heavy
emphasis on the idea
of fun for the whole family though.
Multi-player games that aren't focused on
competitive online but instead something
that you can do in-house
together as a group.
There might be that
competitive online option
for things like Smash
Brothers or Mario Kart,
but there's also games that just focus on
being able to do stupid stuff
with your friends in person
like Mario Party or Mario Tennis.
I think this all plays into a heavy,
underlying theme about how Nintendo
approaches the gaming industry
which is how can we make this fun?
It's not just a matter of
what's worked in the past
and what can we keep
doing to keep making money
although there is some layer of that still
'cause they rely on all
other big name franchises,
but there's always this level of
how can we do things differently?
What can we change about
the way this game works
or how people even control
the game in the first place?
I mean, only with that kind of logic
could you end up having a new game
on their current successful system
where you build a cardboard
robot suit to wear
in order to control a robot in game.
And then there's how well these
companies play with each other,
which in Sony's case, they don't.
At least, not entirely.
Look, the PS4 has been
very successful for Sony.
It was a huge upgrade over the
kind of middling experience
of the PS3 and they had a
very large opening momentum
against both Nintendo and Xbox,
at least until Nintendo
released The Switch
and Xbox off the One X model.
And because of that huge opening momentum,
they don't really care as hard
for playing nice with some of them.
One of the most noticeable
ways this has happened
is the idea of cross platform play
where very few games allow you
to play with other consoles
and even then, we weren't
allowed to do that for a while
until late last year where
they finally relented
on very specific games like
Rocket League and Fortnite.
The idea of cross platform play
is not something that is
considered an automatic anymore.
It's just more of a well, if
the game gets large enough
and enough people complain about it,
yes, we'll try to make that happen.
But otherwise, no.
Of course when it comes to the
idea of third party companies
that are not in direct competition,
there's a lot of playing nice.
There's some awesome
exclusives that come to
the PlayStation that are
from third party companies,
there are games that are only
available on PlayStation or PC
and it's become the console home for them
because again, it has been
the most successful platform
so of course people are excited
to work with them on it.
Cooperation on Nintendo's side though
is something that's
honestly really interesting
to talk about and look at these days
'cause it's a bit of a change in tune.
For a while, a lot of third parties
started leaving Nintendo
either because of the very
controlling sense of wanting
control for their systems
or because their systems
just stopped being
as graphically powerful
as the competition.
And this was a very big problem during
the Wii and Wii U days
of not really having
big name third party support.
The Switch however, was able to close
that performance gap just enough
and introduce this really fun idea
of taking games on the go
but still play them at home,
that a lot of third party
companies started going back.
We're seeing a lot of
multi-platform releases
that never would have made sense years ago
during the Wii or Wii U years.
I mean, if you told me that a Doom game
was gonna be on PlayStation
4, Xbox One and Wii U,
I'd call you crazy but here we are now
with it on The Switch.
And this inclusion goes beyond
just major third party companies.
There's also the early
seeds of something right now
that might be really
an interesting future,
Xbox and Nintendo working together.
We're already seeing a major originally
Xbox inclusive title Cuphead
make its way to The Switch
and there are a lot of rumors,
that it's not gonna be
the last game to do that.
With other games like Ori or maybe
even a Forza game making their way.
Even crazier dreams to
come out of these theories
include the idea that Microsoft's xCloud
could make its way to
The Switch in the future.
A service that would allow you
to stream play major Xbox One titles
but in this case, on
your Switch on the go.
I mean imagine that.
A situation where you
can play Sea of Thieves,
or the new Gears game or the new Halo game
all in handheld.
It's a level of cooperation that was born
out of the initial competitiveness
between these three companies but now,
it's kind of like they're working together
to really overcome the
current lead that Sony has.
Something that makes
this modern competition
between Sony and Nintendo
really interesting as well
is the fact that they have shared history.
Specifically, that Sony created
the original PlayStation
basically out of spite after Nintendo
more or less betrayed them.
Back in the late 80's when
Nintendo was working on
the Super Nintendo, one
of the deals they had
was with Sony to develop a CD attachment
for the system called the Super CD.
This was based on some
of the same concepts
Nintendo would use for the
original Famicom system,
like the Famicom disk attachment.
As part of this deal,
Sony would get certain
licensing rights to the games
available on the systems
and would also release their own hardware
called the PlayStation,
which was the system
that would play both super Famicom games
and the CD games all
in one instead of being
two separate components.
Again, tracing a very similar
lineage from what happened
with the Famicom, where
they was the Twin Fami.
Well, Nintendo ended up deciding
that they didn't really like the terms
of this deal with Sony,
so instead on the side,
they sought out a better deal
in their favor with Philips.
Fast forward to E3 1991
where Sony unveiled
and showed off their Nintendo PlayStation
and the very next day Nintendo announced
their deal with Philips surprising
everyone, Sony included.
Now this right here
wasn't the absolute end
of the possible deal
between these two companies.
Nintendo and Sony did try
working things out over time
but it never really healed up.
So instead, Sony began
taking the technology
they had worked on for the Super CD
and started working on
their own dedicated system
named after the hardware
they were going to release,
the PlayStation.
Now as a reminder, this
was happening at a time
when Nintendo was the big system to be.
Sure, they had some good
competition for a little bit
from SEGA with the Genesis,
(SEGA commercial playing)
but that didn't end up
working out in the long run
and so Sony had a lot of
stuff to go up against
but it ended working out in their favor
thanks to one very big factor,
the move and focus to a CD focused system
instead of using cartridges.
See, at the time, cartridges
still had some advantages
against CDs, namely the fact that
they had much faster loading
times, but at the same time,
they were a lot more expensive to produce.
Something that wouldn't bother
the owner of the console,
like Nintendo, but was really annoying
for any third party companies
that wanted to work with them.
CDs on the other hand allowed
for a lot more data to be
stored on a given game and
was a lot cheaper to produce.
This, combined with the Nintendo's
very micro-managy approach
to quality control
caused a lot of third party companies
to make the move from
Nintendo to PlayStation
taking a lot of big named games
that were usually
associated with the Nintendo
or Super Nintendo to now find
a new home on Sony's platform.
One of the most historically
significant examples of this
is the Final Fantasy series from Square
where the first six games
and a number of spinoffs,
at least in title, were
all on Nintendo systems.
The original Nintendo, the
Super Nintendo and Game Boy.
But, with the PlayStation, they released
what is probably one of the most
important works in the
series and was a massive
game changer, Final Fantasy VII.
And this isn't the only major
franchise to make that move.
Series like Street Fighter,
Mega Man, Catlevania
all started making the move to PlayStation
forcing Nintendo to lose
one of their big edges
and instead have to focus on the strength
of their first party titles.
While a lot of these
bridges had now been mended,
it's very clear to see how
these major events from the 90's
really impacted the current
landscape of the gaming market.
Also, by the way, that deal
that Nintendo had with Philips,
yeah they never actually
got a CD attachment
for the Super Nintendo, but Philips still
got their end of the bargain
by getting them to release
some really nightmarish
Zelda and Mario games
on their own system, the CD-i.
(Zelda game playing)
The past is important
but it's also the future
of these systems that I really care about
and I think something
that is very interesting
about this current landscape is that
all three major companies are kind of
going in different directions.
Just looking at all these rumors
and concepts and theories that have been
going around lately, it seems like
this next generation of gaming
is gonna be one of the
ones to find the most
by having each of the three companies
cling to their own unique philosophies.
I mean, we've had that
a little bit in the past
with the Nintendo
splintering off with the Wii,
focusing less on graphics and more on
how you actually interact with the game,
but now even PlayStation and Xbox
are going their separate
ways with different
emphases on hardware versus software.
With the way technology's
been progressing,
these companies are
now focusing a lot more
on actual concepts and not just redoing
what has been happening over
and over again each cycle
and there's no better set-up for that
than what we're seeing right
now with the question of
should you get a Switch
or should you get a PS4
or which one is better, because
it's not a simple answer.
It's not just a, oh well this
one's got the better graphics
and this one's at the better price.
No, they're different things,
entirely different things
and whether you want
one more than the other
comes down to well, you.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
