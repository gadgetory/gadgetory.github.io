today's prime date and there are a ton
of awesome deals right now on Amazon for
all stuff gaming they've got a few that
are cycling through there or going up
really quick but for some all-day ones
here's the best you can grab first let's
talk systems with the SNES edition 3dsxl
this is one of my favorite designs for
the 3ds XL into running for only 150
bucks basically the same price as a 2d
SXL right now but you're still getting
the 3d support it's also gonna include a
digital copy of Mario Kart from the SNES
now for another system there's also a
starter pack going on for the Xbox 1s
you're going to get a one terabyte hard
drive three months of both Xbox gamer
pass and Xbox Live Gold obviously all
the stuff that comes with controller
cables all that good stuff for only 230
bucks now some of the best stuff that's
going on sale all day are accessories
for the Nintendo switch some of the
biggest deals you can grab the dock dock
this guy is awesome this basically look
I'm gonna be honest it does nothing
functional for your switch except to
give it an awesome cool front plate to
show off your dock design I love it this
is well design of Pacific is cool now on
a little more functional side if you
want to keep all your joy Kahn's charge
especially between collecting a whole
bunch of different colors you need to
get a charging stand like this guy right
here it's one of the best ones on sale
you can grab charging up to four
controllers at once and it just makes a
nice little display alongside your dog
next another big necessity for the
switch is a micro SD card have you been
buying a lot of digital games or just a
ton of DLC you're quickly realizing that
the internal storage on the switch is
not enough and you can get a whole range
of these on sale for prime day right now
now you can get just the kind of
standard designs like 64 gig 128 but if
you want to go all out for 140 bucks
you can get a 400 gigabyte microSD card
necessary no overkill yes but awesome
now to top all that off there are a
whole bunch of games going on sale as
well some of them are flash deals some
