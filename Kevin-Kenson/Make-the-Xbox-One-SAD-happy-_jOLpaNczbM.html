Let's do it.
(drill whirring)
The Xbox One S All Digital
is on its way to stores soon
and if you're interested in grabbing one,
there's a lot of stuff you can catch up on
in terms of accessories to really get
the most out of your system.
So, everyone who's planning
getting an All Digital soon
or just any Xbox, here's
some stuff you should grab.
One of the all-time most
important accessories
to grab for any system is a headset,
and there are a lot of options out there
for the Xbox and one particular brand
that I've always been a
fan of is Steel Series.
Now, for a long time, the
Steel Series mainline headsets
weren't available on Xbox, there were ways
to kinda make something
work in a roundabout way
but you'd still be missing
out on certain features.
Until now.
Soon, they will be releasing
their own Xbox One designed
Arctis 9X headset.
Like the rest of the Arctis line,
this offers a really comfortable design.
I love the ear cushions,
little head band that gives
just a little bit of support
on the top of your head.
Overall, super comfortable design.
But there's a lot of things that because
this one's designed for
Xbox One in particular,
gives it a couple of strengths.
For instance, this particular headset uses
the same dedicated Xbox One
connection as controllers,
not the Bluetooth ones.
That's gonna give you a much faster
and easy to set up connection.
One of the things that's really cool
about a lot of the Arctis headsets
that is included in this one, is that
while it does use the Xbox
One proprietary connection
for going to the system,
it does still have built in Bluetooth
so you can use it with
other devices if you like,
but on top of that, you can also use
both connections simultaneously.
So, if you'd like, you can play games
while hearing audio from the gameplay
as well as talk to people, but also
have it connected to
your phone via Bluetooth
to listen to music at the same time.
Like many other big name headsets,
this does give you the option
to have a couple different
EQ profiles to work with.
It comes preloaded with
four different designs,
but you can hook it up to a PC
and use Steel Series software to customize
them further if you want
a very specific design
for a game in mind.
Another cool thing about the fact
that this uses the proprietary
Xbox One connection
is that if you own one of the
Xbox One wireless adaptor's
for PC, that'll let you use
a controller wirelessly,
that's gonna work with one
of these headsets as well,
giving you that stronger connection.
And because this isn't designed
for wireless use specifically,
it's got a pretty strong
battery life at 20 hours
and that's using both the Xbox connection
and Bluetooth at the same time.
One minor drawback worth
mentioning, however,
is that because this is focused
on the wireless approach,
if you wanna use it wired,
your options are a little more limited.
You can use the AUX port to
have audio play towards it
but that will not allow you
to use any chat functions
or any kind of the
special stuff with Xbox.
It's just gonna be audio, that's it.
One of the longest debates
that's always gone on
with controller design in modern systems
is how to approach batteries.
And for the Xbox One, instead of going
with the rechargeable batteries,
they've gone with replaceable double AA's
which I get, I understand
the major merits of,
but that's not for everyone
and so a really nice
way to upgrade from this,
is this rechargeable battery pack set.
Now, there's a couple reasons why I like
this option in particular.
It gives you a dock to charge
the batteries individually,
connected to the Xbox
itself drawing power from it
so it's a nice little place to remember
where they're stored.
And it's not the style where
it replaces the back plate
of the controller, where you actually have
this little exposed area, a little bit.
I hate that, it annoys me so much.
So with these ones, it
just keeps it lookin'
like a regular controller
with nothing changed out
and gives you a way to
recharge the batteries
instead of having to rely on
buying separate double AA's.
There's just one problem.
You would think that any product designed
for the One S would work
on the One SL Digital
and for the most part,
that's usually true.
The problem in this case, though, is that
the little charger for this is designed
to lock into the little
crevice that's on the side
of the One S where the disc tray is
that the L Digital doesn't have.
Thankfully, though, this is something
that you can fix with some light
and very easy customization.
Don't do this at home.
(drill buzzing)
Moral of the story, don't assume
that something designed
for the original One S
is going to always work
for the One S Digital.
(drill buzzing)
Fits like a glove.
With the newest version of the Xbox One S
going completely digital,
it is more important
than ever to take care of storage space.
Now, by default the L Digital comes
with a one terabyte hard drive
which for a lot of people
is fine but it's not always enough.
Look, games are getting bigger and bigger
and bigger with some major titles
like Red Dead Redemption easily hitting
basically 100 gigabytes, taking up over
a tenth of the hard drive.
Now, of course one way you could deal with
the issue of limited space
is constantly delete things
whenever you get something new,
trying to figure out what
you actually still care about
and wanna keep on the hard
drive at the same time.
But that's obviously really,
really annoying to put up with.
Especially if you do install
a particularly large game.
And it's really easy to happen
too thanks to Xbox Game Pass
which will just blow up
your hard drive right away.
So the better solution is to
use an external hard drive.
Obviously there are a lot
of different hard drives
on the market that you can use,
but something that's really
cool for Xbox specifically
is there are a lot of branded designs
so you can get a design by Seagate
there are a lot that are just
a simple white or green aesthetic,
focused on the colors that are
usually associated with Xbox.
Or if you're lucky, you can
track down some special
limited edition designs they've done,
like this Sea of Thieves one right here.
Using these could not be any easier,
you just have to plug into the back,
or the front I guess, if you
want to use that usb port,
but I'd rather hide it.
You just plug it in, and bam,
you have extra space to
work with on your system.
And it adds a lot more room,
as an example, this one right
here is a 2 terabyte design,
twice as much as what
comes on the One S itself,
and it isn't bogged down
by having the actual system software
filling it up to begin with.
And again, this is just
talking about branded ones,
I always enjoy having stuff
that just has matching designs and logo's,
I just think it's always like, I mean,
I sort of I always like to
have it as a nice package,
but you can also just get
any external hard drive and hook it up,
and that's going to work.
You know, some day it might be really cool
that Xbox is gonna get their
Cloud streaming software
up and running and you can just play
any game you want without having
to worry about install size.
But until that glorious future
is actually something that works,
this is a great way to go.
Something that I consider to be
one of Xbox's biggest strengths,
is their controllers.
Not just the design of it physically,
I do think it is the most
comfortable controller
out of all the mainline
options out right now.
But the other thing I think
they do really, really well,
better than any of the
other companies right now,
is the visual look of them.
There are a lot of different
Xbox One controller designs
in a variety of different
colors and patterns
and special designs,
and a lot of them are super cool looking.
(electronic music)
On top of that though,
if there's no controller design out
that really resonates
with you just quite right,
or you can't find the exact color
or design you're looking for,
you can do it yourself,
thanks to Xbox Design Lab.
As an example, I love Cuphead,
it's one of my favorite games on the Xbox,
and I really wanted a controller
that had that style to it,
because they just didn't make one.
So, I made my own, with this
red, black and white design.
And honestly, this is a
pretty straightforward standard design,
just going with a single
color for the main body,
triggers and back and the
little sticks and D-pad,
there's a lot more you can do,
and even pick different shading designs
for the main body, if you like,
and adding gradings to it.
This give a sense of
personalization and customization
on an Xbox I don't
really feel like you get
as strongly on the other systems.
I'm always a big fan of
having that controller
that feels like your controller,
because it's your favorite color,
or a design that you think
is particularly cool,
or it celebrates a game you really love.
Xbox give you the best ground to do that.
Of course, if you don't
care about visuals at all,
and you just want strictly performance,
you could always spend a bit more money
and upgrade to an Xbox
One Elite Controller
which does have two color options now,
there is the old school
original black one,
and this white design which I really like,
with the gray offsets.
We did customize this
one a little more though,
adding the gold on the D-pad,
which looks super nice.
With this, you're gonna get the
comfortable shape and design
of the standard Xbox One controller,
but also getting paddles on the back,
additional button options,
adjustable trigger stops,
replaceable stick heads and
even a changeable D-pad.
Giving you just a little more control
to fine tune what's the
most comfortable design
for whatever game you're playing.
Either way, whether you're
focused on looks or performance,
I think it's great to be able to pick up
an additional Xbox controller,
just to get that one that
fits your style a bit more.
I'm a big fan of being able to use
whatever controller I
like for a specific game,
and something that Microsoft has opened up
for the Xbox One that I really appreciate,
is the option to use keyboard
and mouse for specific games,
up to the developers whether or not
they want to have that option available.
Now with this, you can just
use any keyboard and mouse
that you have lying around that has a usb
you can plug into your system,
but there's actually one specifically
Xbox One branded and designed option
from Razor that I really like.
The Razor Turret.
There's a couple of things
about how this combo
is designed that makes it more appropriate
for an Xbox console versus
a tradition PC setup.
One of the biggest is the
fact that it is designed
to fit comfortably on your
lap as an actual lap setup,
instead of something
that you used on a desk.
'Cause, let's face it,
most people playing on an Xbox One
are using an entertainment
setup, not a desk.
This is accomplished by
having a built in wrist rest,
as well as comfortable pads
on the bottom of the keyboard
for when it's resting on your lap,
and it even has a little pullout
tray to put the mouse on,
that is lightly magnetic,
sort of keeps the mouse sticking to it,
instead of, it's just
gonna slide and fall off.
One minor feature that I
actually think is really cool,
for this specific example of
using it on an Xbox though,
is that both the keyboard and mouse
are tied to the same wireless dongle.
You're not taking up two
usb ports on your Xbox,
You just have one little dongle plugged in
that's going to connect
both of those wirelessly,
and give you a great, clean connection.
And of course it would
not be a Razor product
without having built in RGB lights
that you can customize using an app
that is not only on the PC,
but also available on the Xbox One itself,
so if you don't want to deal with
plugging it into another device,
you can do it right there on your Xbox
and customize the lights however you like.
Another thing that is really
important when dealing
with a purely digital
focused approach to consoles,
is making sure that you have the strongest
internet connection possible,
that way, data links are
going as fast as they can,
and it's also helpful
for playing stuff online,
because you want to have
best connection possible
to not freak out mid-match.
So, what might be one of the
most interesting branded items
I've ever seen, is an
Xbox One Linksys router.
Now, to be clear, when I say branded,
it's on the box there's actually nothing
physically different,
visually on the system,
but what's interesting about this,
it's actually designed so
that right out of the box,
it's designed to prioritize the Xbox One
over anything else running on the network.
What this means is that
no matter what's going on in your house,
if other people are just
trying to watch Netflix,
or do other things, if you're on the Xbox,
and you're just trying to download a game,
you're playing something online,
and it is making sure you get
the strongest connection that you need
to get that kind of stuff done.
And I can't, I'm just
gonna set this thing down,
'cause this ridiculous,
I'm like holding a, yeah.
And I can't really stress enough
how surprisingly important this is,
because there's nothing more frustrating
than setting up a brand new system,
getting ready to play some games,
and then realize, I need to wait
for every single one to install.
It's one of the kinda downsides
of the digitally focused future,
but kinda an inevitable aspect of it.
I find where this
especially become noticeable
is with Xbox Game Pass,
because when you're in
the situation where, hey,
here's this entire, gigantic list
of games you have never played,
or maybe not even heard of,
and you want to try them out,
well it's hard to keep
the excitement up when
you select a game that
you think sounds cool,
and now you need to wait three hours.
So, make sure that you have
the fastest download speed possible,
to make sure that that gap
is as small as possible,
so you can jump right into the gameplay,
just really changes the experience.
Now we actually compared
using this against
the mesh networks that we
normally use in our offices,
and for a little under half
the price in comparison,
it was giving us better performance
as far as download speeds goes,
and about the same ping.
So if you want to make sure
that nothing else in your house
is fighting your Xbox for bandwidth,
pretty cool way to go.
Now while I think all
these products are awesome
and worth picking up,
I realize that not everyone
wants to throw down
on all this stuff right away,
as soon as they get a new system
So in terms of prioritizing,
I think there's really
two main ones to focus on,
depending on your personal needs.
If you're planning on playing just
a lot of different single player stuff,
or you just wanna play as
many games as possible,
an external hard drive is
definitely a great way to go.
On the other hand, if you're
planning on just focusing
on multi player games and a
very small subset of them,
I would instead go for the headset,
it is so, so important to
have high quality audio,
and a way to of course,
chat with other people.
Again, all this stuff is worth grabbing,
but if it's something first,
I'd go with one of those.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
