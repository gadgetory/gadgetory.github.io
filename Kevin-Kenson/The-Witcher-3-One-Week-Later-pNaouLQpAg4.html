week now and I've been playing with
every moment I've had available and to
put it bluntly I love this game
what's up Internet Kevin here now I've
logged about 40 hours in the game so far
I've done most of the main quest and a
lot of side quests and there is still so
much more I need to do the amount of
content this game has to offer is
absolutely staggering and while I still
want to finish the main story before I
give you guys my final thoughts I
thought I'd let you guys know what I
think of it after this past week so far
first off a quick primer for those of
you that are not familiar with The
Witcher series the whole thing revolves
around the character Geralt of Rivia
someone who underwent a number of
mutations and intense training in order
to become an expert monster slayer also
known as a Witcher the games follow your
exploits through hunting monsters and
tinkerer brew and personal problems
while navigating a lot of politics that
you necessarily don't care about and
having to live through a number of wards
now the first game in the series had its
strengths but was a little rough around
the edges and the second one was pretty
much a major upgrade in most areas but
the two things that made both games
stand out was their emphasis on monster
hunting and interesting but also
difficult choices monster hunting
because it's just a little more complex
than simply hit it with your sword till
it dies that might work on lower
difficulties but higher up you're going
to want to do a little more prep work so
the games have given you ways to prep
and figure out how to best approach an
enemy by figuring out how to make a
certain oil that deals more damage
against them or figure out what kind of
bombs or spells they're weak against it
creates this feeling that monsters are
more interesting than just another enemy
you have to hit with a weapon and helps
to make them stand out a lot more as for
complex choices well the games have
never really been about simple good or
bad mentalities it's not something like
do you want to take the good guy route
or the badass route instead it's gonna
be situations where you have to weigh
what you think is the better option
something might give you a short-term
good over a long-term one one might save
many people at the expense of
sacrificing one other person that is
more important to you so it actually
gives you interesting moral dilemmas and
very few of them ever have straight-up
good outcomes usually no matter what
choice you make there's going to be some
kind of downside and consequence you're
going to have to live with and
oftentimes these consequences won't even
be immediately obvious you'll make one
decision and after several hours of
gameplay find out the consequences of
your
now both of these aspects make a return
in The Witcher 3 but a whole lot else
has changed some of it for the better
and some of it is just simply different
but still good in its own way and a lot
of this is due to two major changes they
want to make for this game first off
making it just a little more accessible
for other players and second opening the
world up the first two games were
extremely linear with a few side quests
here and there whereas The Witcher 3
consists of large open areas that you
can freely explore aside from pursuing
the main quest now as I said monster
hunting and hard choices are both really
important mechanics to this series and
they did a great job of bringing them
over to three but everywhere else that
has seen a change I really personally
like for the better first off I think
the game has done a much better job with
its pacing you could argue that witcher
2 had a much stronger start anymore kind
of epic feeling opening but it was also
extremely overwhelming for someone that
wasn't familiar with the witcher lore
already they're throwing a lot of hard
terms that you left and right
Witcher 3 on the other hand chooses to
take a slower approach it's not as
urgent feeling but it gives you time to
learn about the setting who the other
characters are what gerelds backstory is
and there are several moments in the
game where clearly some time has taken
in dialogue to help explain events from
past games and books and how they're
relevant to the witcher 3 storyline now
this is of course one of the
consequences of trying to move a very
linear game style over to one that's
free roam you lose a lot of the sense of
urgency when players have the ability to
choose to just run around to do whatever
they want and oftentimes it can make the
story feel a little slow but I think
they did a really good job pacing in
which or three with how the main quests
relate to what you're doing a lot of it
just has to do with investigation and it
helps that a lot of the side quests are
extremely flavorful most of which are
divided either into secondary quests
that explore other aspects of story or
have their own little mini plot arc or
witching quests which focus on hunting
down specific monsters figuring out what
you're dealing with and prepping to take
them down
CD Projekt RED did an immensely great
job with side quest in this game there
are a handful that are still just simply
busy work but a lot of them each have
their own little flavor and stand out as
having their own interesting plot rather
than just being a random fetch quest to
get a little extra money or more
experience
now one thing in particular about
secondary quests I really want to note
that I think was a really nice touch for
a role-playing perspective in this game
is that
the main quest you're gonna get involved
in a whole lot of side plots they're
gonna meet new characters find out their
problems and end up helping them out a
little bit along the way before moving
on and doing what you need to do next to
the main quest the thing is you don't
always fully resolve their problems and
so once you're done with their part of
the main quest it becomes a secondary
option to actually resolve their issues
or just stop dealing with them entirely
and move on to the next segment of the
main story or just simply witching
quests basically choosing to not involve
yourself with anyone outside of what's
absolutely necessary so while the move
to an open world does certainly slow the
pacing down a little bit and can make
the game not feel as epic in context as
past games did I think they did an
excellent job of balancing out an
important feeling main quest but still
having a lot of interesting stuff to do
during side quests or free roam now the
other big change as I said earlier is
the fact that this game aims to
streamline a lot of the mechanics from
past games most notably the way alchemy
is handled in previous games whenever
you wanted to make a potion that was
useful or a bomb you had to find all the
ingredients and craft it every single
time which was really cool and great for
immersion and it probably is mechanic
that some people are going to prefer but
at the same time it was also really
tedious especially when you're up
against certain monster types again and
again what Witcher 3 does instead is you
have to initially craft an object in the
first place which can sometimes require
you to find really hard to find
ingredients but once you craft it once
it just gets restocked to every time you
take a rest as long as you have some
kind of special item in your inventory
usually really strong alcohol this makes
it so that while you do have to go out
of your way sometimes to find the right
ingredients to craft something you
haven't used before or make an improved
version of it once you've done it the
one time you're set for any other
situation where you have to run into
that kind of enemy you just have to rest
beforehand if you've run out of supplies
the game has also reworked the skill
system in an interesting way where you
have to equip so many skills at once and
you're limited based on your level so
you can unlock a lot of different
abilities quickly if you get ability
points fast but you're not gonna be able
to use them simultaneously not only that
but they're paired off into separate
little groups we're grouping together
the same types of skills can lead to
special benefits when you equip mutagens
it's a nice spin I think on the whole
idea of prep work because especially
later in the game once you start getting
more skills or you getting more than you
can possibly out
all at once well you can choose which
ones you think are most relevant when
you're going up against a certain type
of enemy now of course all of these
mechanics are simply background for the
game's combat system which is about as
fast as witcher two's but a hell of a
lot smoother now first glance it's going
to be very much the same thing you have
fast and strong attacks with two
different sword types you can parry
enemy attacks do counter attacks dodge
roll and access to a few spells to help
you out but what makes things a little
different in this one is that you now
also have a long ranged option with a
hand crossbow to take on flying enemies
and all of the game spells now have an
alternate casting form you can unlock
they give you a lot more options
especially if you're a magic focused
character one aspect that has changed
them a little more on the fence about I
think it's still works but I kind of
like the other idea better is that in
past games potions were sort of a before
combat prep kind of thing they all
lasted for a long amount of time but you
can only have so many active at once
this time around all potions really only
lasts for about 30 seconds maybe to a
minute some of them last longer but the
utility effect like seeing in the dark
but they just give you a temporary boost
in your toxic meter which slowly
constantly replenishes so you can drink
multiple potions back-to-back rather
than just drinking a couple that last
you several minutes at a time
it makes the pacing of the game a lot
faster but it also makes using potions a
little more annoying because you can
only equip two at a time so if you want
to use two effects but then switch over
to a third one well then you need to
pause open up your inventory menu and
equip one somewhere else outside of that
one problem though needing to juggle
potions everything else is pretty easily
accessible you can quickly switch
between what active items are bombs you
want to use spells are easy to switch
between and combat as a whole tends to
be really fast and very fluid as long as
you don't find yourself having to use
more than two different potion types at
a time now all these mechanics
separately make for a really strong core
experience but the real icing on the
cake is that there is just so much
content to go through in this game as I
said earlier I'm through most of the
main plot and I'm a little over leveled
for it because I've done so many side
quests but there are so many more that
I've just outright ignored because I
just didn't need to do them if all you
want to do is tackle the main quest you
really only have to do a few here and
there but if you're a completionist
there is a huge amount of content this
game has to offer and the great thing is
a lot of it is still really interesting
very few of them are bland and the ones
that kind of seem bland at first after
times have really interesting backstory
tidbits as long as you're paying
attention and reading all the different
notes and things that you find now I
have to admit I was a little skeptical
at first when CD Projekt RED was saying
that this game could take as long as 200
hours for some people and I still think
that is a little on the high end but
something that some people could
definitely experience but on average it
could easily take most people at least a
hundred to 120 hours for a single
playthrough and the fact the matter is
that even with that much content and how
long it can take
I already feel willing to do a second
playthrough at some point just to try
different choices and see how thing is
the game pan out differently which is a
great sign considering how much content
there is usually there's some kind of
worry about oh I don't want to have to
go through all this over again it's
gonna take so long
no not feeling that worried at all with
this because for me at least the
experience has been nothing but constant
joy now of course the game does have a
few rough edges worth noting as a lot of
people have pointed out it doesn't look
quite as beautiful as it was shown a
couple III s ago but it's still really
damn pretty and it runs extremely well
and stable especially after the latest
patch other than that one other issue is
the game does have the occasional odd
choicefor AI enemies occasionally have
weird tactics they'll walk up to you at
a certain distance and then just stand
there not doing anything also when you
summon your horse occasionally it'll
spawn in a place that's really not smart
and look at stuck in some trees where
you can't mount it you end up having to
run in a different direction for a
little while and then spawn it again
hoping that it'll be in a better place
that you can actually reach those gripes
though in comparison to everything else
this game has to offer
do pretty much nothing to sour the rest
of the experience because for me at
least this game has been nothing but
fantastic now to be fair like I said
earlier I haven't actually finished the
main story just yet so it is possible
that I could do that and then get pissed
off at the ending and have a whole lot
of other things ruined for me as a
result but at this rate and this pacing
and after 40 hours of playing it that
seems pretty unlikely I'd say it's
pretty safe to say that at worst I could
go from absolutely loving this game -
loving it not quite as much so those are
my thoughts in The Witcher 3 Wild Hunt
after having played it for the past week
I will be doing another video just kind
of update you guys after I finish the
game to let you know if any of this
stuff has changed or by final thoughts
on the store
other than that though if you already
want to grab the game I do have it
linked down below if you enjoyed this
video make sure hit that thumbs up
button to let me know as well as
subscribe and follow me on Twitter I'll
be seeing you guys soon with more
content but until then I'm Kevin Kenson
