tomorrow is the release of the order
1886 from ready at dawn one of the most
advertised games from Sony
to be exclusive for the ps4 before
picking it up tomorrow I wanted to go
over five things with you guys that make
me either excited or really worried
about how it's gonna turn out and things
you should know before picking it up
yourself
number one setting the order 1886 takes
place in the Victorian era which is
something that we've seen a lot of in
books graphic novels film TV but not
really in games especially not at the
triple-a level so fans of that genre
including myself are really excited to
finally see a game we can play
that lets us explore the genre and
Tropes the good news is - it's not the
last game to come out this year we also
have to look forward to blood-borne in
March another ps4 exclusive and
presumably sometime near the end of the
year Assassin's Creed victory number 2
immersion now just looking at previews
and gameplay demos it's pretty easy to
tell that the game is really pretty but
more importantly is the fact that it
uses really smooth transitions in and
out of gameplay and cutscenes which
keeps the action moving and keeps you
engrossed in the story to add on to this
the developers have shown a clear
obsession over my new details in the
game having a lot of attention paid to
character facial and object animations
which helps to make the whole thing look
a lot more realistic now number three is
either a good thing or a bad thing
depending on who you are that's the fact
that this is clearly Gears of werewolves
or moustaches of war whatever you want
to call it the point is it's pretty
clear the game draws a lot of heavy
influence from the core mechanics of the
Gears of War series which I'm personally
a big fan of the earlier ones I really
like that approach to cover based
third-person shooting the problem is as
shown by the later Gears of War games
the whole thing can become a lot more
stale and repetitive if the game doesn't
make use of constantly changing weapons
enemies or just interesting level design
it can all get just a little too boring
after a time so which way this game goes
we just don't know yet
now getting onto the more negative
points number 4 it looks really railroad
II now if you've watched any gameplay
demos or seen any reactions from people
that have played the demos it's very
clear that the game makes extensive use
of QuickTime events and a lot of the
mission objectives are very heavily
guided for you now of course some degree
of linearity is to be expected in a
third-person shooter that's focused on
storytelling but there's still certain
degrees you can get away with like
giving players some options or
letting them handle combat the way they
want to if the game tries to hold your
hand too much is gonna feel less like
you're playing the game and more like
it's just telling you what to do and
it's playing it for you now
appropriately at point number five is
the fact that this game is apparently
five freaking hours long based on a
leaked playthrough that was posted on
YouTube it looks as though a player was
able to get through the whole game start
to finish in just five hours which for a
$60 game is bordering on ridiculous
especially considering the fact that it
doesn't offer any form of multiplayer
option co-op or competitive now ready at
dawn has tried to defend the stance by
saying that that was a very
straightforward playthrough focused on
just beelining through the stories
missions and that if you actually take
your time exploring the lore and taking
your time with levels it should be more
like 10 to 15 hours which very well
could be true but as a gamer hearing
that on a first playthrough you can get
through the whole game with cutscenes in
just five hours isn't exactly something
to make you excited now whether or not
all this holds true with my actual
experience with the game I don't know
yet I'm picking it up tomorrow and I'll
bring you guys my full review sometime
early next week now until then if you
guys enjoyed this video and you want to
see more content like this let me know I
think that thumbs up button and if
you're not a subscriber yet hit that -
if you guys want to talk gaming make
sure to hit me up on Twitter at Kevin
Kenton and I'll see you guys next week
