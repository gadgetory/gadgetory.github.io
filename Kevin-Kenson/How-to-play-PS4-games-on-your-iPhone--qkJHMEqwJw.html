an amazing feature for Apple owners,
something that PS Vita
and Son Xperia owners
have been able to use for a few years,
but now coming to IOS, has
opened up to way more people,
the ability to use PS4 Remote Play.
(upbeat motivational music)
Now what Remote Play is,
is it gives you the ability
to use your phone as a way to
connect to your PS4 over WiFi,
it does not have to be over
the local WiFi at your house,
you could be just anywhere
connected to a WiFi signal,
as long as your PS4 is also connected
and use that to play PS4
games remotely on your phone.
Now if you've ever heard
about this feature before,
you're thinking, Oh
wow, that sounds insane,
it must be really hard to setup,
no, not at all, it's actually
extremely simple and easy.
All you have to do is make
sure your PS4 is updated
to the latest firmware of 6.5
and download an app on your phone,
which is called the PS4 Remote Play app.
Once you've done that,
you just have to log
into your PlayStation
account on your phone,
make sure it's logged
in on your PlayStation,
make sure both are connected to WiFi
and you're ready to play.
So once you're all setup and connected,
if you're using your
phone in landscape mode,
what it's gonna do is
actually put an overlay
of a PS4 controller on your screen,
it's gonna show up, as long
as you're making contact,
you have the sticks in the middle,
all the buttons on the sides
and there's a little popup menu
for things like the Share button,
Options or PlayStation Home button.
Now of course, a large
part of how this performs
is based on how good the
internet connection is,
both where you're playing
and where your PlayStation's hooked up,
but assuming both are strong enough,
you can get a really smooth experience,
like while I'm playing right now,
not really experiencing any drops.
Every now and then, with
any kind of streaming play,
you might see just a little bit
of messing up here and there, but so far,
this has been a really smooth experience.
Now depending on the kind
of games your playing,
the controller layout of
having all the buttons
on the screen may not
be the best way to go.
There is an alternative method,
if you switch over to Portrait mode,
it'll actually make it to where
it just squishes the entire
16x9 image up to the top
and it has all the buttons beneath,
so that way you're not
covering the screen,
it's just all a lot smaller.
And if that's still not
quite right for you,
for instance, a game that requires you
to hit a lot of buttons at the same time,
shoulder buttons, that kind of thing,
which isn't super-convenient
on this kind of layout,
you can also use a controller
that I don't have next to me.
- [Man] If someone can
find the controller.
- We're totally keeping that cut though.
A controller like this, this
is the Steel Series Nimbus,
it is a controller they've made
that is designed
specifically for iOS devices.
iPhones and iPads can be very fickle
about what kind of controllers
they'll connect to,
there are certain roundabout backdoor ways
you can use other controllers
that you'd like to,
but that takes a lot more work.
If you just wanna keep things simple,
you just have to find a few
specific ones like this.
Now what's really cool about this one,
they've actually just released
this clip attachment as well,
so you can create a whole
setup, where you can play games
and it leads to a much
more natural experience.
Instead of having to deal
with onscreen touch controls
and having a really hard time
doing certain button combos,
this is just a much more real,
natural gaming experience
where you have all the buttons you need.
Now there are a couple buttons
missing here and there,
like the PlayStation Home button or Share,
but you still have access to those
on the touchscreen interface,
so if you ever need to use those,
you just have to click
right here, not a big deal.
Now this makes for an amazing
mobile setup with your phone,
but if you want something
that's a little more
of a bigger screen and still portable,
iPhones aren't your only option for this.
The Remote Play app is
also available on iPads,
so if you own one, you
can connect it this way,
still use a controller like
this or onscreen controls,
I just died 'cause I
wasn't paying attention,
we're just gonna go ahead and reload that.
The Remote Play app is
also available on iPads,
so if you own one, you
can setup the entire app
the same way we did on the
phone, use a controller like this
and you have a portable tabletop setup
with a much larger screen
and better speakers
to get a much better experience.
I will say that with the iPad one,
because this is a whole thing
where it's playing over WiFi,
you notice the compression
a little more, but still,
having a larger image is great
and if you're worried about performance,
as far as things like input lag go,
it's actually really, really nice.
Again, this will vary a little bit
based on your internet connection,
but assuming it's strong enough,
it's an experience that's nearly seamless,
there's definitely a
tiny bit of input lag,
but it's so minor that
as long as you're not
trying to do some kind of
insanely competitive game,
where you need to be at your
absolute peak performance,
it's totally fine.
It's honestly really amazing
to have a function like this
come to iPhone and now that it's here,
I'm even surprised that it took this long
for Sony to bring it out,
because PS Vita owners
and Sony Xperia users
have been able to use it
for years, I think almost four years now
and there were kind of roundabout ways
you could do this before, but
it wasn't really efficient
or something Sony wanted you to do
and now that it's officially supported
and works so smoothly, it's a great idea.
And this is something we've talked about
a few times on the channel,
the idea of games reaching
this streaming future.
Now a lot of times when
we talk about that,
it's this concept of the companies
having their own servers
that are connecting to,
it's not your own system
necessarily doing it,
but this is a great
example of how it works,
where as long as you're connected to WiFi,
you're able to play your
games anywhere, really,
as long as the setup's available
and then it gives you
this kind of flexibility,
not too dissimilar to
what Nintendo's been doing
with the Switch, except
you don't have to rely
on the power of it itself,
it's just streaming the
gameplay to something.
In summation, this is cool.
If you own an iPhone and
a PS4, try it right now
and hopefully it makes its
way to Android users too.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
