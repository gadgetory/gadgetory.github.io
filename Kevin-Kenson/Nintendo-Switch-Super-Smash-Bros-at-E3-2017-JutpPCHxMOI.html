talked Sony we've talked Microsoft now
it's time to talk about the granddaddy
of them all
Nintendo you just see the latest
Nintendo newsletter whoa nice graphics
I'd like to get my hands on that game
Nintendo is a bit of an oddball when it
comes to e3 lately because they don't do
traditional press conferences instead
this year is going to be a let class to
year where they have a digital event
that focuses on all the little
announcements and trailers and after
that they're just going to do a live
stream throughout the days that will
focus on what's happening on the show
floor now in Tendo has already said the
big focus this year is going to be on
Super Mario Odyssey but they're also
going to talk about other games planned
for 2017 which should include a couple
3ds titles we're still waiting on hey
Pikmin and ever Oasis but most of it
should be focused on the switch now
there are still a number of games
planned for 2017 on the switch we don't
have a lot of info on yet arms is coming
out and you're the very end of a3 so we
probably won't see a lot on that plus
it's already getting its own dedicated
Nintendo Direct we might see a little
bit of splatoon too but that's already
has the Nintendo Direct and is only a
month after e3 what we're probably going
to see hopefully it's tough on Xenoblade
Chronicles 2 the much-anticipated sequel
to the Wii RPG and Fire Emblem warriors
Nintendo's mashup of their Fire Emblem
franchise and dynasty Warriors Nintendo
has announced a lot more games for the
switch back at the initial switch press
conference including stuff like SMT 5 an
octave path traveler which I really want
a lot more info on but Nintendo has said
that this III they'll be focusing more
on games coming out in 2017 so the
chances on any more info for those games
is pretty slim now that's all well and
good but what about new games you could
expect to maybe see it this year's e3
well thanks to Mario Kart 8 deluxe
edition a big question a lot of people
have is what other major Wii U titles
could get ported over to the switch and
of course the biggest of these is Super
Smash Brothers where maybe we'll see
some new characters added maybe it'll
include all the DLC characters under way
we will get new DLC characters it's
definitely the number one favorite for a
lot of people and hopefully is the one
that is true but that's not the only
game there's also people asking for
stuff like Bayonetta 2 Mario maker which
would actually give us a good portable
version of the game where you could
share stuff online and not just with
friends like on the 3d
version which kind of defeated the
purpose and personally I would mind even
seeing a port of pokken that actually
included all of the characters of the
arcade version has and not just the few
of the Wii U version now as for
completely new games one of most
interesting rumors to be circulating
lately for Nintendo is that there is not
one but two brand new Metroid games in
development
hopefully neither of which is a new
Federation Force now of these two one is
supposedly being developed by retro
studios the same guys that did the
original Metroid Prime so this is all
accurate
it's safe to say that one of those games
will be an FPS style like Metroid Prime
and the other might be a more
traditional side-scrolling Metroid game
now one of the games that people are
really hoping to see if this year's e3
but the evidence for is kind of if
you're right now unless you're really
into conspiracy theory level stuff is a
new pokemon game for the switch in the
style of Pokemon Sun and Moon called
Pokemon stars which would be really cool
just not really sure we're going to see
that just yet now aside from games there
is one other rumor people's been talking
about that we might actually see a
reveal of the new SNES classic edition
at this year's e3 which honestly I kind
of doubt I mean the original NES classic
edition didn't get shown off at e3
I think Nintendo kite reads it as a side
novelty and not part of their core
business but after all after how well
the NES classic did maybe they changed
their minds we'll find out in just
another month</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
