i'm talking about middle-earth shadow of
Mordor which is available on the xbox
one ps4 and PC and eventually the xbox
360 and ps3 all the game player seen
here is based on the ps4 and today we're
going to talk about my experiences with
it for the past 24 hours now this is a
new original game taking place in the
Lord of the Rings universe that draws
heavily upon the series mythos to create
an original new side story taking place
between the Hobbit and The Lord of the
Rings players take on the role of talion
one of the last Rangers of Gondor who's
now a sort of undead abomination fused
with an ancient elven Wraith granting
him some superhuman abilities and a
small case of immortality now if you're
looking at the gameplay you've seen so
far in a thinking man that looks all
like Assassin's Creed well that's
because it draws really heavily on that
fusion of action and stealth mechanics
that Assassin's Creed made popular and
was refined by the batman arkham game
series but of course it has a few of its
own little twists and spins on it to
make it its own now to begin with though
let's talk about the presentation which
this game has done an excellent job of
so far graphically the game is beautiful
great weather effects and the music very
much brings to life that cinematic Lord
of the Rings feel one thing I've really
appreciated so far is just the attention
to detail going on in this game enemy
banter is consistently up to date based
on things you've been doing in game and
any captain's that you cross swords with
a number of times remember you and
remark on that fact especially if
they've dealt you a finishing blow in
the past and the game's writing has done
an excellent job lining up with the
series lore while not laying on the
obvious reference is too thick with only
one particularly big name character
making repeat appearances so far
mechanics wise if you've played the
batman arkham games then you'll feel
right at home here combat is focused on
rewarding timing players build up a
combo score for repeated attacks which
can then be periodically cashed in for a
powerful finishing move or AoE stun and
precise timing is needed to pair your
dodge enemy sword blows to keep the
chain going the game also implements an
interesting last stand mechanic whereas
whenever you're about to die and an
enemy attempts to finish you off a small
and surprisingly difficult at times
QuickTime animation occurs giving you
the chance to fight back and stand back
up though this can only be done a few
times back to back with each new attempt
getting harder than the last
usually leading to an auto fail it's
also worth noting that the fluidity of
common animations in this game are just
perfect the camera is always right where
it needs to be to where you never feel
like there's some off-screen enemies
ruining your day and the way the game
shifts between actual gameplay and
finishing move animations or last stands
is fantastic even interrupting your own
actions for a parry or ground execute
never looks that awkward there seems to
be a transitional animation for any
situation which really helps make the
combat look consistently beautiful novel
the combat system has been excellent so
far the stealth mechanics on the other
hand have been just a tad bit wonky err
enemy awareness is absolutely terrible
having enemies not notice you even when
you're crouched walking directly in
front of them while they're staring at
you and while they may notice you at the
last second you still get rewarded with
a stealth kill though thankfully this
isn't always the case when groups of
enemies are involved orcs tend to travel
in large enough packs that it's never
too easy to just assassinate every
single one of them methodically but you
can definitely thin out their archers
and stragglers with ease considering how
blind they are to someone lightly
hugging the ground now of course this
game does include some RPG mechanics as
well in two major forms one you can
level up your character and two you get
ruins that you can equip to your weapons
as you kill enemies and complete quests
you'll gain experience power and
currency which all goes towards
unlocking and purchasing various
upgrades some fairly standard passive
stuff like more health or ammo capacity
and more specific new activatable
abilities like being able to do drop
assassinations or ride while animals as
mounts as for the runes you collect
these from killing powerful enemies
which can then be equipped to your sword
dagger or bow to grant you different
combat bonuses like certain actions or
gaining health or bonus damage under the
right conditions now all of these
mechanics so far are all well and good
but the one mechanic that seems to be
the real focal point of this game is the
orc chain of command basically the orc
army is an ever-shifting mixture of
leaders that changes due to internal
power struggles or from you murdering
them one by one and your actions in the
game helped a shift who gets power where
for instance killing one captain will
open up a vacancy for another captain to
get promoted into or getting killed by a
random orc will net them a name and a
promotion turning them into one of the
various captains captains are much
tougher to kill than regular orcs and
intel gathering from certain enemies is
essential to make your
job easier allowing you to track down a
particular captain's whereabouts and
knowing what kind of attacks are
vulnerable to in some cases even dying
in a single hit using the correct
methods such as sniping or a sneak
attack it's actually a really
interesting spin on the way Assassin's
Creed has done things in the past where
everything is usually very much spoon
fed to you you know you're given a very
specific mission to find this specific
man and kill him the way the mission
tells you to whereas in this game it's
forcing you to do your own legwork you
have to collect Intel and find out how
you can best and most easily kill a
certain captain of course you can't
choose just to attack whatever captain
you randomly see but that is almost
always a recipe for destruction because
you're probably gonna end up running in
to one or two more of them at once and
then just find yourself getting Boromir
it does get a little on the annoying
side at times if you focus on trying to
kill one guy at a time only to end up
running into one or two others and they
all gang up on you but I have yet to
decide if this is just terrible luck and
location generating or if it's an
intentional decision to force players to
have to choose their battles wisely be
quick and never try to handle 50 orcs by
yourself so so far after playing it for
a full day my current feelings are a bit
of a mixture between love and
frustration the lower accuracy attention
to detail combat mechanics individuals
all make me really love the overall
experience of this game but there's
several moments where I found myself
just getting really frustrated with how
many captains the game throws at you one
after another after another my biggest
concern as of right now is how
monotonous the rest of this game ends up
getting if every mission boils down to
just the captain system of getting Intel
and killed this specific work it might
just start to wear a little thin but if
more interesting mechanics get added
with time and the game's story continues
to be engaging this game could
definitely be a real big winner for this
year especially for Tolkien and
Assassin's Creed fans so I'm just going
to go ahead and keep pouring some more
time into this game and hopefully have a
full review ready for you guys sometime
early next week until then though thank
you so much for checking out today's
video if you enjoyed it please hit that
thumbs up button to let me know as well
