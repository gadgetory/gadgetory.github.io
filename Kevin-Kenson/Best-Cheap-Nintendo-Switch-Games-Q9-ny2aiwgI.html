the switch has been getting a growing
library of awesome titles now of course
there's been big-name stuff like
splatoon to Arms and of course Legend of
Zelda but there's a lot more out there
that's worth people playing now at the
twenty to thirty dollar mark there's a
lot of great stuff but let's go even
cheaper let's talk about games that are
twelve bucks
eight bucks even as low as five let's
talk about the best cheap games on the
switch kicking things off with the
cheapest of the cheap at just five
dollars is comic oh now this is a very
simple retro style game think of like an
old-school Zelda game but on
fast-forward at all times the basic idea
is they have to get through each level
killing enemies to build up energy and
then spend the energy to open up chests
or activate special shrines and make
your way out of the level the gameplay
is just simple enough to make it really
easy to learn and very easy to invest a
little bit of time into here and there
but just complex enough to make it a ton
of fun to play and why isn't necessarily
the longest game out there one of the
things that helps give it a lot more
game time is that there are three
different characters to play it each of
which has just an interestingly
different enough style to make playing
through this title at least three times
completely worth it and honestly don't
take my word for it it's five bucks just
try it you'll love it next up let's talk
about one of the port's that made its
way to the switch and if you've ever
gone through the switch library you'll
notice that one thing there's a lot of
right now our ports of old-school Neo
Geo games and if there's one Neo Geo
game that has held its age perfectly
well that's worth digging up for just
eight bucks its Metal Slug Metal Slug is
one of the original old-school arcade
running guns offering one or two player
co-op that is fast simple tons of fun
with beautiful animations and unlike
some of the later games which are also
on the switch it doesn't suffer from any
of the major slowdown issues in some
levels now one thing about this version
is the fact that it is just an emulation
of the old-school arcade game so it does
end up being a little on the easy side
thanks to the fact that you have
infinite fake virtual money but if
you're the kind of person that likes to
get high scores or just have simple fun
and call up of friends this will fit the
bill perfectly next let's slow down the
pace a little bit with a very different
kind of running gun shooter mighty gun
volt burst now this is the newest game
that they cross over between inti
creations asher striker gunvolt series
and mighty number 9 now if you haven't
heard of them before inky creates is
actually the team responsible for some
of the later Mega Man games before
Capcom basically gave up on the
franchise like Mega Man Zero
and Mega Man ZX and while the mighty
number 9 part might scare you a little
bit after how that game went don't let
it because this crossover game is really
a true successor the Mega Man franchise
needed all the old-school Mega Man
tropes that you love are still here but
with the addition of extra unique twists
and changes that make the gameplay more
difficult and really interesting to
people that have played all the older
games it's a little shorter than old
school games but thanks to the fact
there are two different playable
characters you can get through the game
as it's totally worth picking up for
just 10 bucks then we have another game
from empty creates but instead of being
an original title or a sequel to
anything they've worked on before this
is actually a remake of an old-school
NES game Master Blaster zero as the head
of this I realized that I apparently
died back from the brain the game is
called blaster master zero not master
blaster master blaster run spot time now
if you've never played it before Master
Blaster zero with this sort of
metroidlike game featuring the use of a
vehicle to travel around the world but
also entering small areas in a top-down
shooter platformer this game includes
all those gameplay details but has fix
things up a little bit as well as adding
a changed up plot one of the most
impressive things about this game to me
though is how much support it's gotten
since launch type of like these are very
easy to forget about once they've hit
the eShop but this game has been getting
continual DLC including more difficult
modes and features multiple playable
characters from other franchises like
shantae or even shovel knight at just 10
bucks for the base game and $2.00 more
for every DLC character you want try out
this game's definitely worth giving a
shot next if it's a game I never thought
I would have actually seen on the switch
and that's implosion the reason being is
that implosion was originally an ios and
android specific game and actually
covered it a couple years ago when i was
still doing top 5 mobile games lists and
I loved it back then and I loved it now
the porc job for bringing this to the
switch was done excellently all the
controls have been redone for the switch
and they are perfect the combat is
fast-paced and flashy the only complaint
I really have is the visuals leave a
little something to be desired but
that's really no surprise considering
this was a game on phone two years ago
the story is nothing to write home about
but the gameplay is paced perfectly and
if you just want some simple fun action
blowing stuff up as a robot just just go
grab it then we have a game that
honestly I would argue is probably the
best towards dollar on this list but at
the same time I actually want to warn
you not to buy
it and that's shovelknight spectre of
torment now this is worth every penny
but the reason why I warn against
getting it is because for 15 bucks more
you can get shovelknight treasure trove
which allows you to play a shovel Knight
plague Knight Spectre Knight and the
upcoming DLC for k9 basically a lot more
gameplay for way less money total and
honestly even if you've already played
shovel and on other platforms it's
totally worth picking up again for the
switch to get easy multiplayer co-op
gameplay on the go or at home it's just
honestly the definitive version of the
game as far as I'm concerned so those
are my favorite games on the switch that
go for less than 20 bucks if there's
anything you love that I did not talk
about put it down below in the comments
and I will see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
