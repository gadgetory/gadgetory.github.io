you exactly who's to blame for it
Nintendo that's right Nintendo back in
1998 they released this little gem the
Gameboy this is a peripheral slash game
that came out in both Japan and the u.s.
back in 98 Japan did get it a few months
earlier and back when it came out you
can get it in a couple different colors
we have the blue one right here but they
also released it in a red yellow and
green in Japan specifically got an
exclusive clear purple kind of in the
style of the atomic purple gameboy color
there was also a limited edition gold
when they did that was Legend of Zelda
now the idea here is pretty simple
although it's actually a lot weirder
once you start using it but you could
use it to take photos and then they
would show up on your gameboy screen and
you could even actually buy another
attachment that was the Gameboy printer
which could print out those images using
just basic heat paper so let's set this
up and actually check out how it works
and then maybe also do something a
little unnecessarily cool with it so
setting this up is really simple all you
have to do is put it in the Gameboy and
you're done
let's turn this guy on okay so once you
start it up you have three main options
which are shoot view and play now shoot
obviously is sort of the main goal with
this guy because it's more we used to
take photos let's check that out and
it's this weird little screen it's
almost like a command selection for
Pokemon or something I can use magic
okay first let's just go to shoot and oh
that looks weird let's take a selfie
like it's 1998 okay so this is gonna
give you the ability to do other kind of
special shots including things like
panorama
so after shoot we also have the option
to view which is mainly just going over
all the photos you've taken you can go
to your album and take a look at the
photos we've got like
I don't think we took this photo what is
this it looks like a close-up of an owl
or something that's weird but here's my
face and there's Rich's face rich it's
you now those first two options are
pretty straightforward but it's the
third option play where things get
weirder I'm it's already been a little
weird so far but it gets weirder
so there's four games but you start off
by just playing one of them called space
fever - which is a sequel to a Nintendo
game it's basically space invaders now
when it starts there's other ships that
show up with letters on them and if you
shoot those you play a different game
but if you don't shoot those then you
play space fever which is awkward and
the other games you can play are not
exactly games so the other games you can
choose to play are DJ ball and question
mark now DJ isn't so much a game as it
is just picking different settings to
make beats and sounds ball you just kind
of move your arms around trying to
juggle but it looks really bizarre and
for some reason Solid Snake is the guy
introducing you to the game and you just
move your arms around trying to catch
these balls that are very very slowly
moving through the air with someone's
face plastered on the body it's it's
weird
I think question mark kind of follows in
the same thing it's a running game where
it's just this face plaster I'm a stick
figure body and you're constantly
tapping a trying to run and jump over
obstacles it's it's all really really
weird and this is just all plays into
what's really bizarre but the Game Boy
camera because you buy it thinking it's
just a camera you would expect that you
just take photos and you know the
private thing is cool and then you get
it and then there's all these weird
faces plastered in places mini games
that don't really make sense you know
you go to view and there's just a head
eating a head or something and then
there's like these error screens that
just pop up with kind of disturbing
faces like I think they were meant to be
kind of fun or like you know just like
doodles but with how it looks on the
Game Boy camera it's honestly kind of
disturbing
so yeah this thing is weird so weird in
fact that when it was being made there
was actually a lot of internal
resistance at Nintendo about even
releasing it but I'm glad they did cuz
it's gonna let us do some crazy stupid
fun stuff today now there's actually a
whole online community of Game Boy
camera enthusiasts who have come up with
all kinds of crazy things they can use
it for whether it's using filters to
create color images running images
through neural networks to recreate like
better versions of the photos and even
attaching them to telescopes to get
really crazy images but suddenly we're
actually inspired by was someone who had
post it on reddit the idea of actually
adapting the Game Boy camera to be used
with high quality camera lenses now in
that case they were using a little 3d
printed adapter they made we took the
easier but more expensive route of
actually finding a rigging we can use
now if we're gonna do something like
this a really important consideration is
which Game Boy is gonna be best to use
because since it works with the original
Game Boy it works on basically every
Game Boy all the way through the Game
Boy Advance so there's a lot of choices
here and there's actually a recent video
from another channel Wolf Den which is a
really awesome
in-depth approach of taking a look at
all different Game Boys and which works
best with the camera I really recommend
checking out it's an awesome video and
after watching it we realized we don't
actually have the right kind of Game Boy
on hand right now so I ended up going to
my local game store to pick up a backlit
game boy we got a pocket and that didn't
actually work out that well for us
either so in the end I ended up
borrowing a modded front-lit chibi color
from a friend of mine so this is the
actual rig setup we have going on right
now with the original Game Boy and we're
using here is actually an adapter that's
designed for smartphones from B script
the idea is that this will adjust to any
size of phone you just plug it in and
you can use it with professional lenses
but in our case we're using it with the
Game Boy camera and realize that with as
impressive as this setup looks right
here ultimately we're still taking
photos that are only 128 by 112 pixels
which is really tiny I mean this video
is in 4k and that's how big that would
be by comparison but you know for back
in 1998 that's still pretty impressive
in fact back in 99 this camera was
actually listed by the Guinness Book of
World Records as the smallest two
digital camera now with the set up
there are some problems we're gonna run
into and have to kind of deal with to be
honest guys I'm not really a camera
expert I just talked to them so to
explain these issues we're gonna bring
on our local camera expert Richard hub
hi I'm Richard so reason why we can't
use any lens oh yeah I'm Richard so I'm
gonna explain blind focus distance no
I'm not because I totally forgot so what
we have here is it okay okay hi I'm
Richard the reason why we can't hold the
lens up to the Game Boy camera is
because of fund focus distance and
that's the distance between the lens and
the sensor and so what we need is an
adapter that would allow us to kind of
space it out and to be able to compress
the image that's coming out of back of
lens onto the Game Boy camera that's my
assistant
you may be wondering why the images are
upside-down that is beautiful and
flipping it you can solve this by using
a Game Boy SP so with the set of all
good and ready to go in the wild it's a
little absurd looking and a bit awkward
I mean to be honest it's a bit of Wiggly
it's not very comfortable get a lot of
shots with but with it we are able to
get photos
I mean look we're still using the Game
Boy camera so it's not gonna make ultra
pretty images out of nowhere but with
this lens adapter we are able to get a
photos that normally would not be
possible with the camera by itself and
that by itself is actually pretty cool I
mean I've said many times before I'm
always a huge fan of anytime we're able
to mix old-school retro tech with modern
technology and that is definitely
something we've accomplished today</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
