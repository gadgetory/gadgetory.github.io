recently about the possibility of a
hardware revision coming soon for the
switch and I'm not talking about a
switch XL or a switch slim something we
normally see midway through the
development cycle but an actual
performance boost that for now let's
call the switch Pro recently we got the
5.0 update for the switch which along
with all the other little add-ons and
changes it made like her a more profile
images something that data miners
discovered is that along with all that
information was support for a new PCB
and a new chipset for the switch now in
the chipsets case this is natural people
are thinking there's an argument for a
more powerful switch it looks as though
the chipset talked about which is the
t21 floor from Nvidia it's just an
offshoot of the current Tegra chip
that's in the switch it's not more
powerful instead it's just well more
secure the idea being that it would be
part of a quiet Hardware refresh for the
switch
that'll make it harder to homebrew or
mod so relevant to those of you that
want to do hacking on your switch but
not for most other people where we're
getting the rumors of increased
performance is the new PCB that's
supposedly supported by the 5.0 software
which was supports up to 8 gigabytes of
RAM instead of the current four gigs
that are in switches in all likelihood
this increase in RAM support is not
actually a sign of a new switch coming
out sometime this year but rather it's
just opening up more power for dev kits
so that if there is some kind of pro
model coming out in the future down the
line this is gonna let people to start
preparing for that right now but what
would it look like if we were to get a
switch Pro sometime soon the switch as
we have it right now is a perfectly
solid and fun system I mean evidenced by
the fact that it is been selling really
really well obviously no one hates it
but even when it first released there's
a lot of comments people had right away
about the design of it that could have
been done better and I'm not just
talking about the performance of a I
mean yes we can always ask for more
performance more power better graphics
more RAM whatever but there's a lot of
stuff but the physical design system
that could have been done better we
could have a stronger physical design so
that it's not warping when it's sitting
on the dock for too long we could have
kickstands that actually properly
support the system when it's in tabletop
mode maybe having two of them so it's
actually stable and not gonna fall off
after you used it more than four times
and if we want to learn more about
performance there's other stuff we could
do than just the graphical power of the
system a big thing that I think the
system could really benefit from is
battery life I love using the switch as
a dedicated handheld and really sucks
when I'm playing a big-name game on it
and I'm only getting two and a half
maybe three hours of handheld time to
arrive to sit down and plug it into
something which gets really annoying I
would rather take that over getting
better graphics in handheld mode there's
also the idea of internal storage yes
you can buy a microSD card to store more
stuff on the switch but it'd be great if
the internal storage on it actually
allows you to carry a larger number of
games before having to buy any kind of
add-on or accessory especially with how
many games are now going pure digital
and when we talk about the idea of a
switch pro or some kind of revised
switch something I think we should look
at is not just the switch itself but
also the dock I mean let's take a look
back at some of those old patents we
were all speculating on back when the
switch was still kind of an enigma and
mystery the idea that back then the
switch dock wasn't just something that
you put the switch into and it would
allow it to play games in the TV but the
dock was actually an external power
source that would give more graphical
power to the system the one we have
right now is basically just a glorified
USB see two HDMI connector the switch
isn't getting more power from it it's
just not caring about its own
performance because battery isn't an
issue anymore so if we've got some kind
of new revised switch we could have one
still has great battery life in portable
because it's using the same graphics but
then it's still getting even more
performance when in TV mode because the
dog is actually giving it that extra
little oomph it needs now is any of this
something that Nintendo might actually
do maybe look the likelihood of Nintendo
doing something like a switch pro as
soon as this year is just not very high
I mean yes there have been system
refreshes in the past where you always
do things like make something a little
slimmer or maybe a little more power
efficient but doing an actual more
powerful system only a year and a half
two years later just doesn't make sense
especially when the switch is doing so
well now does this mean that Nintendo
would never do a more powerful version
no not at all actually think that's very
likely at some time the next few years
we will get some kind of more powerful
switch because what may not be you know
traditional for most companies to do
this with a system like this that's a
tradition that's been broken a lot with
this latest generation I mean we've seen
Xbox do this with the one expert
supports 4k PlayStation with the ps4 Pro
even Nintendo did this with the 3ds we
had the three
yes in 2011 and three years later in
2014 we get the new 3ds which is more
powerful and there are some games that
can only work on that version of the
system so it's not outlandish to think
that Nintendo could carry that same kind
of process over to the switch and I
think another really interesting idea to
consider is whether or not Nintendo is
toying with the idea of doing something
like we've seen with phones and tablets
where yeah we have the switch but every
three years there's a hardware revision
of it that's more powerful and while
they make sure the same library across
modes of the system's eventually there's
a cut-off point where there is new more
powerful and just better-looking games
than the newest version will support now
honestly I don't think this is some good
Nintendo will do but they've clearly
toyed to the notion before because
that's what they did with the 3ds so
it's not impossible</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
