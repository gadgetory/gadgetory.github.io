finally here and one thing that Blizzard
is known for is littering their games
with all kinds of references to pop
culture history mythology and even their
own games so I thought it'd be fun to
see just how many of these I could catch
to start let's talk fun stuff at
pop-culture references the character
McCree is a walking embodiment of all
things Western especially TV and film
his gambler skin is based off of Val
Kilmer's depiction of Doc Holliday in
the movie tombstone as well as one of
his lines coming from the movie omnia
huckleberry another of his lines
directly references the spaghetti
western film of the good the bad and the
ugly and his mystery man skin may be a
reference to the radio TV and terrible
movie character The Lone Ranger there's
also a lot of love for the 80s in this
game saria's line in Russia gameplays U
is a reference to the joke stylings of
80s Russian comedian Yakov Smirnoff
ferry's line fly like an Egyptian is
based on the 80's song walk like an
Egyptian by the bangles which was
accompanied by a dance that is just as
terrible as it sounds and zenyatta ston
emot-- uses the crane stance which is
best known in pop culture as that
awkward stance Ralph Macchio keeps using
in the original Karate Kid there's also
a little bit of love for the 60s and 70s
soldier 76 is appropriately named
daredevil skin is based on the
motorcycle daredevil Evel Knievel and
Winston's line don't get me angry is
probably a slightly rewarded reference
to one of the most popular lines to come
from the 70s Hulk TV show don't make me
angry
you wouldn't like me when I'm angry
Blizzard of course also managed to cram
in some references to their own games
the characters Widowmaker and Reaper
bears some similarities to the Starcraft
unit's ghost and Reaper
Reinhardt's line Crusader online is a
reference to a similar line spoken by
Starcraft goliaths and his Lion Heart
skin bears similarities to Alliance
Armour from Warcraft meanwhile the
character Torbjorn is a walking Warcraft
reference bearing a striking resemblance
to Warcraft dwarves despite being
Swedish not Scottish though he could
also be based on blizzards order
property The Lost Vikings and as
ultimate is named after one of the
original endgame raids of World of
Warcraft multicore there's also multiple
references to gaming culture outside of
specifically just Blizzard games the
character diva is a walking talking meta
reference to eSports and video game
culture with most of her lines being
references to common gaming chat terms
like gg afk and lol Hans O's line I
choose you spirit dragon is clearly a
Pokemon reference Farrah's line
rocketjump references the popular gaming
move of performing a super jump in FPS
games by using a rocket launcher which
dates back as far as quake 3 and Lucio's
line you gotta believe might be a
reference to parappa the rapper who
would start each song with the line I
gotta believe one video game reference
that's probably just me reaching too far
is that mercy's Valkyrie skin which is
obviously a reference to the Norse
mythological figure may more
specifically be a reference to the
character Samaria from valkyrie profile
sporting the same color palette and very
similar armor motifs but that just might
be coincidence of same origin other
cultural references include Reapers
never more skin calling back to the
Edgar Allen Poe poem The Raven
while his mariachi's skin may be a
reference to the movie series of the
same name
Winston's thinker pose is based on the
same titled statue Zenyatta is line I
think therefore I am is one of the most
famous quotes from the philosopher
Descartes junk rats epoch skins might be
a reference to the more unhinged Batman
villains Joker and scarecrow and maze
line you have to let it go is clearly
referencing the Disney film frozen who
plagued all of our minds with the phrase
let it go for years after its release
now if we want to get real scholarly
several the game's epic skins reference
mythological creatures and gods most
notably zenyatta jinn skin based on the
Arabian mythological spirit his raw skin
based on the Egyptian God and some
metros Devi and goddess skins bear
resemblance to the Hindu goddess Kali
and to go really in-depth
Bastian's highlight intro titled
Ganymede is a reference to a Greek
figure and hero known for being one of
the most beautiful humans and was at one
point kidnapped by Zeus using an eagle
though clearly that's not happening in
bastions case so that's pretty much all
the ones I could find
knowing blizzard there are a ton more
that I missed because I just have no
idea what they're referencing so let me
know down in the comments what ones you
guys have caught as always guys thank
you so much for watching and I will see
you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
