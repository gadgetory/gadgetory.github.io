thought they did the best job of having
a lot of new games announced building up
alot hype for those games and just got
people really freaking excited and I
thought that they honestly weren't gonna
be able to do it again this year you
know I thought they got a lot of stuff
out of the system and this year was just
gonna be a lot of retreading over those
games we saw last time but no they
completely blew it out of the park again
with a ton of new games and for the
games we already knew about we got a lot
of new gameplay that looked incredible
Sony did something that not really
anyone does with press conferences at e3
which is completely hands-off I mean the
entire hour hour and ten minutes only
had about four minutes of onstage
talking and the rest was just trailer
demo trailer demo trailer demo reveal
just ridiculously back to back for stuff
we already knew last guardian looked
fantastic and finally got an official
release date of October 25th 2016 this
year horizon zero dawn we saw more
gameplay of which looks incredible and
we got to see new gameplay from Quantic
Dream's new game Detroit which showed
off a new protagonist we got a closer
look at called duty infinite warfare
which actually looked really good and
way better than that terrible trailer we
got a month back we had closer looks at
Lego Star Wars Force awakens we got VR
announcements for final fantasy 15 in
Star Wars Battlefront it was just news
news and news and then did you want new
games this e3 because they had them lots
of them they kicked things off with a
gameplay demo of God of War 4 which I
have slightly mixed feelings about
Kratos being the main character still
but the movement to ignore setting looks
fantastic the insomniac spiderman game
was confirmed we got a new Skylanders
game with Crash Bandicoot in it and more
importantly a remaster of the first
three crash games we got new VR games
including a sci-fi shooter called
Farpoint and a Batman game where you are
Batman coming from Rocksteady and to top
all of these off at least for me
personally were
of games the first of which was a
trailer for a game that legitimately
spooked me and then was all of a sudden
revealed to be Resident Evil 7 which I
never thought would happen I thought
every Resident Evil from now on was just
going to be an action game but no we're
going back to our roots and we're
getting a proper dark and creepy
resident evil and then after that we
have Kojima come on stage and already
show off the new game he's working on
where he's working with Norman Reedus
again and yeah sure wasn't any actual
gameplay was just a teaser trailer but
it just looked so intriguing this entire
press conference was literally just
trailers and demos and it was better
than anything the other companies did at
this e3 I mean they all had their high
points here and there but Sony didn't
have to say shit and it was incredible
oh right they announced a new zombie
game which looks pretty cool I guess
hashtag so anyone</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
