there are two very important accessories.
One, the controller,
which we've talked about
a lot of options out
there, and two, headsets.
Now when it comes to headsets,
a lot of times the major comparisons
come down to fairly
traditional basic ideas.
Clarity of the sound, how loud it can be,
how well it does bass, highs and lows,
positional tracking, all
that kinda good stuff.
But there hasn't been a ton recently
in terms of major innovations.
But recently there's a
new headset from Razer
that has a very interesting new feature,
and that's the Nari Ultimate Headset.
It rumbles.
- Rumble!
(audience cheering)
- The Ultimate is the newest edition
in Razer's new line of Nari headsets
where the main selling
point of them as a group
is that they are wireless PC headsets
that can work on systems as well
and offer THX spatial audio.
Basically, it gives you sense of things
that are not only in front, behind,
left, or right of you,
but also a sense of above and below.
The idea behind this
is really interesting,
because if you think about
traditional rumble motors
like in game controllers,
oftentimes it just has one setting.
Some pro controllers give the option
to modify and change the intensity,
but with a standard controller,
it usually just rumbles like a madman
anytime something happens on the screen.
Well the haptic ones in these
actually have a range of motion
depending on sounds that
are being played through it
and is tied directly to the sounds.
So if certain things are just
a little louder than normal,
you'll get a very light shake,
or if really loud explosions
are happening nearby,
it can rumble really heavily.
You can adjust the
overall intensity as well
using different settings on PC.
What's amazing about this though
is that it's not really tied
to any kind of software update.
It's not like you have
to play specific games
that support this feature.
You don't have to make sure
that your console's patched a certain way
or it's only on certain platforms.
It's all tied to just the sound
coming through the headset.
So you can use it on your PC, your Xbox,
your Playstation, your Switch.
You can even just listen to music on it
and those haptic engines
are gonna do stuff
when the right sounds come through.
And the idea behind this is
upping the immersion factor
of audio in gameplay where, yeah,
you might have gotten a slight rumble
or sense of rumble in the past
when there were certain bass
heavy notes being played,
but now with this, if
there's something happening
like an explosion to
your left during an FPS
or something flying overhead above you,
you're gonna get a rumble
tied into those sounds
that just really pulls you
into the whole experience.
I've been trying this headset out
across a couple of different devices
and I think one game
that's an interesting way
of showcasing what it does
is Red Dead Redemption.
It also gives me an excuse
to just Red Dead more,
which is always good.
So while playing Red Dead though,
you get the usual vibrations from sounds
like explosions or if there's
gun shots firing at me,
but one place it also comes up a lot
is where you're riding your horse.
So I have the intensity set
to max on these right now.
I've also got the volume up
'cause that also contributes
to whether or not the vibration goes off,
and yeah, while you're riding your horse,
I mean, you feel every single time,
every gallop, you know,
just every contact,
that just constant thumping,
you're feeling it in the headset,
which is simultaneously a little weird,
but really cool at the same time.
Something else that
this game showcases too
that is interesting,
and might be one of the
slightly more issues
is because it is all sound based,
depending on how the game audio is mixed,
sometimes you get vibrations
for unrelated stuff to gameplay.
For instance, during combat in Red Dead,
sometimes you get really heavy bass
from some of the instruments
and that sets it off too.
Sometimes louder than actual
gun shots, stuff going on.
So once again, the direct tied audio
makes it really immersive,
but could interfere with some
of the more actual game play benefits,
which if you're playing
something multiplayer,
is normally not as big of an issue.
In a single player
experience like this though,
it will cause it to
vibrate a lot more often.
More in this setup too,
something worth mentioning
is that while this is really cool
and I love the haptics and everything,
using them definitely hurts
the battery life on these.
It's still gonna be good enough to last
for most major gaming sessions,
but you wanna make sure you
have it fully charged up
before you use because if you're using
the HyperSense and the haptics
and everything all at once,
it only lasts for about eight hours.
It'll last a lot longer
if you turn them off,
but then where's the fun?
There is one very important
question to consider
about all of this, though,
and that's the fact that is this something
that's actually really cool
and you wanna use all the time
or is this just kind of a fun little idea
that you try out for a week
and get tired of very quickly?
Well I've been using it for the past week,
I've been trying it on different systems,
on different games, having
it at different intensities,
and honestly, I really like it.
This is something that I wanna see happen
in a lot more headsets
and I think it's a really nifty feature.
Now with that being said,
I will give a warning
that when I first tried it out,
I may have set the intensity to max
just to really see what it
can do, and not the best idea.
(scary music)
Not that it's something
that was painful or weird
or was too much.
It was just a little
distracting over time.
It was something that when you really got
that rumble going on all the time,
especially with certain
games like Red Dead,
it just started to wear a
little too thin too quickly.
But once I took a step back though,
and set it back to its
original initial settings
of the 50% mark, like
the medium intensity,
it's really nice.
It's subtle compared to the maximum.
It's not something that's gonna
be going off all the time,
but instead, you're really
gonna feel that motor kick in
the few times where it really matters,
like if there's an explosion
or a gun shot really nearby.
You're really gonna feel the times
that it deserves it for loud noises,
and that's where I think it really shines.
It's honestly kinda hard to describe
how much it changes the
immersion factor of a game
because it really does pull
you in just a little more.
It gives that sense of positional sound
an extra layer of realness
that isn't normally there
because yeah, you might have
gotten a tinge of rumble
from just the bass being really deep
for an explosion or something,
but now the headset itself
is actually going with that
and resonating, just
shaking a little bit extra,
it's so cool.
I truly think this is a feature
that more headsets need to have.
It's obviously not something
that's gonna be in every
single headset on the market.
It's a little more expensive
and it's gonna be in more
kinda higher end pro options,
but it really does up
that immersion factor,
whether you're playing
a single player game,
something online that's multiplayer,
or I think especially for VR situations,
getting that extra little
sense of interactivity
is just amazing.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
