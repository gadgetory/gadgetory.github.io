unit known as military assistance
command Vietnam studies and observations
group or Mac V sod carries a unique
combat knife into the jungle on covert
missions years later in 1986 that knife
inspires a young designer to bounce on
paying tribute to that special ops unit
with its very first knife what begins as
a single commemorative model soon
becomes a full line of innovative tools
filled proven by US Special Forces and
after rigorous testing honored as the
Navy SEAL knife of choice and today
there's a sock for anyone who demands
the best so whether you're protecting
others guiding a job to completion
leading an epic expedition tackling one
of life's everyday challenges or facing
their most extreme conditions yet no
matter what your task or where you go
lead the way with SAW forged out of
tradition hardened in the field honed
for you Bruce aww take point
you
you
you
the foresight is a heavy-duty tactical
knife designed by Ken Onion a deep
bellied recurve blade features aus-8
steel and is designed to take on any
task that he may encounter in the field
or on duty the knife features a 3.5 inch
modified drop point style blade and a
non-selective black titanium nitride
finish the ikbs ball bearing pivot
system with a side clipper makes
deploying the blade smooth and fast the
handle is cold forged aluminum with
well-defined finger grooves that are
comfortable during hard use the
foresight has a stainless steel locking
liner for safety a unique deep carry
pocket clip keeps the knife discreet in
the pocket or gear bag CRKT knives and
tools are fully backed by our limited
lifetime warranty
the CRKT foresight a tactical knife
that's big heavy duty and built for
professional use
today at CRKT we are taking a look at
the Lukas Burnley design squid this is a
beautiful little knife designed as an
EDC folder it is smaller compact Lukas
designed it as kind of like the knife
version of a compact pistol you can see
some of those lines and different feel
there it is a smaller knife but I've
been carrying one for two weeks and I
really enjoy it really love it here are
some of the specs on it the overall
length on it is 5.7 inches the blade
length is 2.1 inches so it's under that
3 magic number there so you can carry it
in places where three inch blades over
three inch blades are illegal sea squid
Burnley design on the one side it's got
an ambidextrous thumb stud for easy left
or right-handed opening I like the
jimping on the spine there the closing
on this knife it is a frame lock you can
see just push over there and pull the
blade down to close it I love the black
stone wash so basically we put a black
coating on there and then tumble it with
a bunch of stones to give it that look
and feel the pocket clip is deep carry
tip up carry only here's a shot of it in
my pocket to give an idea of how it
rides here's a shot of it in my hand now
some people might complain this is a
small knife it's gonna be good for
smaller hands at the same time though
there is a lanyard hole there so you can
attach your own lanyard put a skull bead
or whatever bead on there it's gonna
give you a lot more real estate there in
the hand comes in a satin version as
well
satin stone wash I should say they're
fun to flick and just play with again a
smaller knife the weight on it is 3.4
ounces the handles are stainless steel
designed by Lukas Burnley in New Mexico
let me show you one shot of it
against this ruler right here to give an
idea of how big it is very great knife
for EDC everyday carry and just a great
little pocket knife designed by Lukas
Burnley thanks for watching and thanks
for carrying CRKT
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
