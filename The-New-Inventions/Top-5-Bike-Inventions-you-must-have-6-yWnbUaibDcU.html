bike travel for 250 miles on a single
charge at all when you want said back
when you don't he'll no sweat it's 500
watts of power available at the press of
a lever easy to install and intuitive to
operate designed in Cambridge
Massachusetts and built a New England 2
years ago I was watching Tron
thinking about all that empty space
inside the orbital wheel really kept me
up at night why do we put a motor when
we put a battery in that space I managed
to make a mini prototype but I basically
have two left thumb and a limited
knowledge of engineering 18 months ago I
was working as a propulsion development
engineer at SpaceX when I met Mike and
saw the Geo orbital wheel prototype I
loved the concept and one of the helped
make it a reality
since then we've created five
generations of prototypes given hundreds
of test rides and logged thousands of
miles from all that user feedback we've
integrated all sorts of features into
the wheel installation takes only 60
seconds and requires no tools the
battery is easily removable even the
tires are made of high-density foam they
ride just like a normal tire but they'll
never go flat the motor will take you
zero to 20 miles an hour in six seconds
the feature set goes on and on we've
only just got rolling how many years I
work driven and rode at ridiculous first
it forward and then provide story
involved and I first saw the gerbil
wheel I was hooked we've got this
advanced design sleek an iminium frame
and simple operation
you should pop on the wheel clip on the
throttle and go it's very brilliant
wouldn't it be great if you could use
your bike whenever you want it to
without sweating all the engineering is
done you've got a great product we've
got a great team but we need your help
we really want to keep these built in
the United States but we need to order a
batch large enough to keep the cosna
please support our project in any way
conventional spokes reflectors heavy
bulky plastic they let you down when
they get dirty and look like this if
you're looking for something better meat
flexor flexor is a foil based spokes
reflector of a new generation we combine
zero weight design with aerodynamic
efficiency and high grade reflection
flector will literally start to glow
when hit by headlights
we are passionate cyclists we simply
love our bikes it was our goal to create
a brand new type of reflector that we
would be thrilled to use on our own
bikes now after a year of material
sourcing evaluation 3d modeling and
testing under real conditions flector
has become the ultimate component for
your bike
it's almost weightless compared to all
other reflectors it's aerodynamic
efficiency is unmatched
and due to the high resilience of its
composition reflector is nearly
indestructible
hi everyone this is Jack and this is
Arthur together we're starting a brand
called John we designed bags that make
you feel like super young our design
approach is pretty simple we rethink
each bag from the ground up for very
specific purpose
my first bag is called la w1 it's
designed for life by school community
nidia started because I was commuting to
work every day on my bike and didn't
like many options out there the backpack
you get a major case is sweaty back plus
the high center of gravity
led to an unstable riding experience
messenger bags someone tend to slide
around and always look to you technical
gear bags are interesting but L clunky
hardware and none really look nice
enough to bring instability so Arthur
and I got together and decided we can
make something better something aimed at
light bike commuters like me we're going
about five miles each way and when we
talk to friends it turned out a lot for
looking for something similar so we knew
we wanted to design a bag that would sit
on the bike to allow for off body riding
experience and also use classical ET
riyals like leather and relaxed cannons
we went through a lot of prototypes and
came up with a completely new design
this is the bag you want to grab for
your daily sentence we use 18 ounce wax
canvas vegetable tan leather and
aircraft grade wool felt also tuning us
we do our designing a sample making
in-house and have the bag so locally in
LA but even if you don't ride a bike
we've got lots more data to choose from
like this minimalist wallet this sexy
