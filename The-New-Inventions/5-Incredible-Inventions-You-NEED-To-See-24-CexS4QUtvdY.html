optimize the design of this product so
we can best deliver pain relief to the
millions of people with chronic pain
imagine a future in which the
capabilities of the human body can be
enhanced so mobility is always enabled
and never left impaired that spark of
imagination lit the fuse that triggered

energy when you bend your knees and
releases it as you straighten them
enabling you to play longer work harder
and do more for nearly 80 years other
braces of attempted this but they use
traditional Springs and were too heavy
too big or just not powerful enough
levitations unique bionic design changes
the game it's remarkably powerful it's
comfortable because it's lightweight and
compact and it's affordable we designed
a brace with ease of use in mind
levitation only weighs two pounds and it
has quick-release trapping to go on and
come off fast our final spring
technology was inspired by the hydraulic
systems and high-performance aircraft
our shells are carbon fiber the same
ultralight material used in Formula One
race cars along the way we made over 50
different prototypes each time getting
feedback and making small adjustments
and we tailor the Bionic response of
your brace to your specific need whether
that's unleashing the star athlete
inside you or simply keeping up with
your grandkids so here's where we need
your help spring loaded is set to
produce levitation right here in our
manufacturing facility we want to spread
the word about levitation and now it's
different than every brace that's come

life changing technology you can order
levitation right now and help us bring
this amazing product to the world you
can donate and for every eight hundred
dollars raised will give a brace to a
person in need or by simply sharing this
project you'll be helping us change the
way the world moves
levitation play longer work harder and
do more
as most parents would agree monitoring a
child's fever using a traditional
thermometer can be a very laborious
process check my temp a wearable
thermometer is an entirely new way to
monitor fever check my temp is simply
worn as an armband it records
temperature accurately and continuously
and sends the data directly to your
smartphone or tablet it uses our
patent-pending multi temp technology
sensors embedded in the device read not
only body temperature but also the
outside temperature in addition it has
an accelerometer to track body movements
so check my temp can tell you when your
child is awake or if they've fallen out
of bed your child can get a full night
of much-needed sleep when sick and you
can monitor their symptoms wherever you
are whether in the next room or from
your desk at work the free app allows
you to set thresholds so you can be
alerted when the body temperature runs
too high or too low you can securely
share the data collected with your
pediatrician and family members you can
also create or join local groups to
connect with others and receive local
health alerts with its embedded sensors
collecting over 30 data points every 30
seconds check my temp is simply the
world's most advanced thermometer
this is a story about life about all our
lives everything began with just an idea
the idea to convert cemeteries into
forests then that idea became the BIOS
earn a biodegradable urn designed to
convert you into a tree afterlife and
now we want to present a new product
that will help us bring the BIOS earn
two more people creating a meaningful
experience for us and the environment
biles in cube is the world's first
incubator designed for the afterlife the
bios in cube lets you plant your bios
earn while also tracking and watering
your tree using a custom sensor the bios
in cube watches for moisture ground
temperature electrical conductivity and
more then the algorithm combines all the
data it receives to understand the
specific needs of your tree when
watering is needed the built-in
irrigation system conducts water from
the tank to the seed distributing the
water homogeneously around the seed
while also preventing over watering and
under watering the sensor also checks
for environmental humidity temperature
and solar irradiance with this
information the BIOS in cube will notify
you if the temperature of your place is
not appropriate or if your tree needs
more sunlight during the entire process
your tree will be growing close to you
somewhere where you'll be able to see it
touch it and enjoy the real experience

connects you to our in cube centers
incubator spaces where if you want to we
will incubate your tree for you here at
BIOS earn we've been heads down for
quite a while now building this product
we're a team of designers engineers and
operation experts who've been working on
the BIOS in cube for a whole year when
designing the BIOS in cube we wanted to
create something that would fit in any
space an object with a seamless and
adaptable design that serves any
environment it is placed in
since the beginning we've asked
ourselves who's going to use the bios in
cube what kind of emotions do we want to
create so the experience is driving the
product the technology just enables it
everything in the bios in cube has been
designed to work by itself over the past
few years we've been lucky enough to
connect with a community of people who
have used the bios earn we spent over a
year designing and developing the bios
in cube and now we need your support to
cover tooling and manufacturing costs so
we can bring bios in cube to the market
we think death is a transformation and a
return to life through nature with bios
in cube we can move a step forward in
our quest to prove that there's life
