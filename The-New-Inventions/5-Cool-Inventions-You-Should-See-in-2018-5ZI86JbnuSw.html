15 different accounts security experts
agree that for a password to be truly
secure it must contain a random
combination of letters numbers and
symbols remembering such a secure
password is not a job meant for us
humans in the past few years hackers
have proven over and over again just how
vulnerable our computer systems can be
major companies like eBay Dropbox and
LinkedIn have reported cyber attacks
that have compromised users information

and having to remember any of them ever
again should it fall into the wrong
