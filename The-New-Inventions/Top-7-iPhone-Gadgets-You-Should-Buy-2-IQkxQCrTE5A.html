imagine a world where you do not have to
worry about dead batteries for the
devices that are so important to you a
world where the way we power these
devices matches the mobility they give
us a world where these are no longer
relevant hi my name is Wil Zell and I'm
the CEO of Nikola labs and we are
building a system of products that will
radically change the way mobile devices
are powered the first solution we're
launching on Kickstarter now is a case
for the iPhone 6 and galaxy s6 that
allows you to download power from the
air and extends the battery life of your
phone there is no need for an external
battery pack or some bulky battery case
we significantly extend your battery
life between charges by simply using
energy wasted from your phone remember
when you broke your phone so do we I'm
Jeff I'm Matt and that's why we created
bumpers
bumpers are bear bold beautiful and best
of all breakthrough pumpers 2.0 they're
better they're slimmer have a stronger
adhesive a tighter fit and have
perfectly smooth edges to complement
your phone we've redesigned the smallest
case for the iPhone 6 family it's really
strikingly beautiful it's minimal and
this is gonna protect your screen funded
great that was really cool I actually
might have just brushed it off huh a
little bit of brick there I don't know
how macro that gets in and that's the
screen left oh I mean you know it's just
broken like normal how's the back of it
you're reading my stuff is it come on
out the back well you know the back can
get dinged up and falls on the back
bumpers are amazing they're bold
beautiful beautiful and as we just see
I'm very break their leg food Frankfurt
so next time your phone drops turn sad
and glad with bumpers 2.0
in today's world people have access to
numerous digital services through the
use of various devices if you do the
math a person may easily have more than
15 different accounts security experts
agree that for a password to be truly
secure it must contain a random
combination of letters numbers and
symbols remembering such a secure
password is not a job meant for us
humans in the past few years hackers
have proven over and over again just how
vulnerable our computer systems can be
major companies like eBay Dropbox and
LinkedIn have reported cyber attacks
that have compromised users information
and passwords this is why we created
passport it's a security device that
allows you to generate store and use
unique and secure passwords for all the
services apps and devices you use
passport is small enough that you can
comfortably carry it in your pocket or
purse along with your keys passport is
easy to set up and simple to use it can
connect to your devices via a USB or
bluetooth and it's recognized
automatically on all major platforms
here's how you use your passport first
access your passport by entering your
master key the only password you'll ever
have to remember then access the login
screen of the service you'd like to use
on your preferred device finally browse
your passport for the appropriate
account and select it passport will
automatically log in to your account
say goodbye to using unsecure passwords
and having to remember any of them ever
again should it fall into the wrong
hands house 4 incorporates several
security mechanisms to protect your
privacy it encrypts your data using the
same encryption algorithm the US
government uses to protect top-secret
information our free synchronization app
also allows you to create and store an
encrypted copy of your accounts for easy
recovery in case of loss or theft
what does your smartphone look like
sophisticated stylish slim with a
minimalistic design
all on your smartphone case
your smartphone is an essential part of
your everyday life and its case should
protect him while preserving its design
oh so cool neighbor comes from purchased
product as a simple design or complex
functions depending on the temperature
the color of the case changes
accordingly the color changes depending
on the atmosphere and even light
because into deep power-saving mode when
it is bright and light so when it is
done
this is we become second upper case top
circle
