the carbon flyer the world's first super
tough superfast Bluetooth controlled

the ultimate tech toy we've created a
revolutionary plane using actual carbon
fiber we've equipped the carbon flyer
with twin high output modes 'as a
long-range bluetooth control module LED
running lights and an onboard camera
carbon fibers ten times stronger than
aluminum it has 100 times the strength
to weight ratio of steel and it is more
than a thousand times stronger than the
toughest phone this prototype right here
impacted the side of buildings and
concrete surfaces over a dozen times at
high speed the carbon flyer can be
controlled up to 240 feet away using
either an android or apple smartphone
bluetooth allows for a two-way
communication with the plane providing
real-time battery and connectivity steps
our interactive app allows the pilot to
control the planes airspeed altitude and
steering using only one hand
we are pushing the boundaries with this
nearly unbreakable flying toy the carbon
flyer is perfect for RC hobbyists flight
enthusiasts and gadget lovers everywhere
and we need your help to get it off the
ground we've already produced the molds
for our carbon fiber planes and we have
begun developing the smartphone
application we need your vacuum to fund
the tooling for the lightweight polymer
components that make this plane fly
