the more fun you have introducing carve
the world's first real-time ski wearable
carve is your digital ski coach that
puts world-class key instruction in your
ears
we've all had skiing lessons before and
they're great but you can't have a coach
with you every time you ski carve fits
into any ski boot and is always with you
analyzing your every move by seamlessly
integrating a thin pressure and motion
sensing insert powered by a tracker with
lessons you have to wait until the end
of the run to hear how you did carve
speaks to you as you ski to correct your
form in real time welcome to your
advanced ski training lesson 5
keep your weight forward good job
skiing drills can be repetitive and
boring carve transforms drills into
exciting and rewarding games
Karp has trick recognition to track your
time in the park get detailed stuff from
your session with takeoff and landing
analysis to check if you are balanced
when you should be and aren't lending
too hard
if you're a racing scare you can get a
complete data record to take the
guesswork out of training know what
makes you faster and set targets to
improve
and for all levels of skier carve tracks
your staffs over time so you'll really
be able to see the difference carve is
made to your skiing it then lets you
share your progress of friends and see
how you compare
how's it going everyone I'm Ken from
Hanson's handcrafted led Sabres and
welcome to the set of the phantom
workshop a while back I was their very
first guest on their very first show so
I thought it only appropriate to come
back here to let you know a little bit
more about what I do now for those of
you who don't know me I build custom
light sabers and I have for several
years now the problem is when you
commissioned a custom light saber you
typically have to end up waiting in line
behind a lot of people to the point to
where I have a really long wait list
right now well it occurred to me that
not everyone can wait or what's to wait
for a custom light saber so that's why
we're here what we're doing with this
Kickstarter campaign is offering you a
new way to have a custom lightsaber the
OTS line comes with six different
chassis options that include with or
without sounds with or without crystal
chambers and even a chassis with no
electronics in it whatsoever that you
can wire yourself using parts from the
custom saber shop in addition to that we
have 40 different hilt pieces that you
can choose from that you can mix and
match and make your saber look however
you want with these 40 pieces and with
our different hilt options that gives
you well over 800 thousand different
possibilities but that's not what you're
limited to because these hilt pieces are
not tied to the electronics you can do
some customization on your own to
include some really cool things like
edging adding a rubberized grip powder
coating baking on enamel or even adding
leather and I've actually got videos for
a lot of that stuff on my youtube
channel that can show you how to do
those customizations yourself but
there's more in addition to that our
sabers come with our patent pending for
racks and blade which is bright
consistent and very very durable but
you may not want a standard blade for
your saver you may want to check out our
other business partner Gary Ripper of
Ripper blades who makes some of the most
beautiful and most detailed acrylic
blades on the market now of course with
the Ripper blade you have to be able to
use a hilt LED module that's why our
chassis are made so that you can quickly
and easily change the hilt LED module
for the power connector for the cracks
and blade
we're also partnered with the custom
saber shop who's not only making our
hilt LED modules for us but they have
accessories and parts that are
compatible with the OTS line of sabers
so how does this OTS system work we
already know it starts off with the
chassis and from there you simply select
your hilt pieces and the hilt pieces
come in different sections we have the
pommel the rear grip the fore grip and
the emitter shroud all of these pieces
screw together easily because they're
threaded so you simply choose the pieces
you want and thread them together and if
you want a little bit more accent you
can also choose some of our brass trim
pieces that slide over the smooth pieces
of our line each section has their own
brass piece that you can use to give you
even more customization options with
your support this is happening the
Kickstarter campaign is going to allow
us to get all of these parts
mass-produced so that we can bring them
to you at the best possible prices it's
also going to allow us to do things like
that the parts anodized chrome plated
and even played it in black chrome we
are so excited about the OTS line of
sabers so check out all the different
package deals and don't miss those early
bird specials and thank you for becoming
a part of the hhcl S family

SmartWatch whether it's counting steps
changing songs or alerting you to
notifications the pebble time is a great
everyday companion here till we're
product people who've developed a full
line of wireless charging products since
you helped us launch the view back in
2013 but we're particularly excited to
bring two great new features heart rate
