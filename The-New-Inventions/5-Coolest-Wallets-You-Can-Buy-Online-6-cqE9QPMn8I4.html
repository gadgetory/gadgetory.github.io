at oaken designs we believe size does
matter when it comes to wallets that's
why we wanted to create the world's
smallest wallet but not only it also has
to be economic functional and protect
you let me introduce you to the carbon
card clip 3c regular bulky leather
wallets are not comfortable they damage
your clothes and they really don't look
so good they're even bad for health any
doctor will tell you sitting on a big
wallet causes sciatica the 3c is only 8
millimeters no matter if it's empty or
full so you can wear it in any pocket
without even feeling it 3c is even more
ergonomic than any money clip which have
sharp angles that pop out giving a bad
feeling in the pocket 3c always remains
super flat with 15 grams it's as light
as a bird and one of the lightest
wallets ever built there are hundreds of
models of minimalist wallets on the
market but we still couldn't find the
perfect one we refuse to use multiple
pieces rubber bands elastic straps and
velcro or ugly fasteners that's why the
3c is made from a single piece of carbon
fiber our unique unibody carbon fiber
design gives a lifetime very strong
holding to the cards and even if you
carry only one most minimalist wallets
are not very convenient and easy to use
the cards are complicated to take out
and to sort that's why we think 3c is
the most functional thanks to its window
the cards are very easy to take out and
to sort it holds one to seven cards and
cash and anything with a different size
from a credit card will also go inside
like banknotes receipts or business
cards the carbon-fiber conception is so
strong you can sit on it without
damaging your cards the inside of the 3c
is covered with anti-static microfiber
velvet so you won't scratch or
demagnetize your cards it also includes
an aluminum foil that makes it RFID safe
so your personal data and
are protected from thieves I cannot
reveal fabrication secrets but I can
tell you we produce in France our
partner uses top-quality a grade carbon
fiber which is cooked with high pressure
high temperature and very long cycles
then it is precision cut using CNC
milling machines to get perfect edges
thanks to our specific production
process this carbon fiber is scratch
proof which is almost impossible to
achieve with this material the slimmest
most ergonomic and functional minimalist
wallet ever made now we need your help
to start volume production and to bring
our costs down and as usual we will
offer our backers special deals and
prices because size does matter take up
the challenge to slim your wallet thanks
for watching
honestly I feel like a wallet is a
person's most basic tool
it carries a person's identity money
business and for an object that carries
such precious things I want someone to
take pride in what they're carrying we
sorted dango to take everyday products
and breathe new life in it but we want
to really do it through materials
different manufacturing processes taking
it and really kind of pushing it over
the top
along with quality I wanted to offer
some functionality to the wallet so we
wanted to offer a multi-tool that has
more than ten functions
you
Arabian we get frustrated with stuff
that we use every day that isn't
designed well Walter one of those
devices we use every day but most of all
it's we've tried are too complicated too
bulky or just plain ugly they also lack
the features of the other modern devices
we carry in our pockets so stepping out
of our normal product focus of apparel
we decided to design our own wallet
first we wanted something that was
trackable we are freaking tired of
losing our wallets we solved this by
teaming up with our buddies at Tractor
to create a simple way to attach their
device to our wallets we wanted our
wallet to be respectably minimal small
and strong we wanted it to be simple
light and durable it needed to be sexy
and smart with RFID blocking to keep
those pesky crooks from stealing your
dinero we added a detachable money clip
making it convenient to carry money when
you need it it also had to be flexible
to fit our lifestyle and literally
flexible
we played with different materials like
metal plastic and wood but landed on
carbon-fiber it answered all our needs
and then some
you can order our Arabian money clip you
can order just our wallet you can order
our wallet plus the tracker devices or
you can order the wallet plus the money
clip and the tracker device you decide
how you accessorize your wallet
we know you'll like our wallet it's
trackable secure simple and clean design
please help us bring it to life by
backing us now gravy now
