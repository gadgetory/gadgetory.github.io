pass through to get from your apartment
to work there is no end to the
adventures we can have if only we seek
them with our eyes wide open we weren't
meant to live and work in a world of
cramped spaces so crew is here to help
me wherever
Hey
they need
Oh
when you want to get outdoors planning
and searching ruin the moment so well
don't just grab your crew the hybrid is
a tent and a hammock plus we have
engineered and built in an insulated air
mattress and a customized sleeping bag
all in one meet the world's coolest and
most versatile shelter
we haven't sacrifice performance in any
way to incorporate these unique features
quite the opposite the crew a hybrid
boasts high quality design and
craftsmanship throughout and it has been
tested by the experts we listen to you
and we have developed your crew a hybrid
accordingly whether it's for a hike in
the backcountry or a lounge in the
backyard the hybrid will exceed your
expectations
experiencing the outdoors through
backpacking and camping is fun and
rewarding but it can be equipment
intensive especially on longer
excursions among backpacking essentials
are water and food and equipment for
food preparation which can add bulk and
weight to an already loaded pack the
worst offenders are propane and liquid
fuel so we've designed a camping stove
that uses a fuel source readily
available in forests wood burning
camping stoves exist but they can be
bulky because of the nature of a
combustion chamber our products started
with a simple idea inspired by a camping
car by making a collapsible combustion
chamber we could create a compact and
effective system that uses readily
available wood from the forest we
explored prototype and refine developing
a new product to enable the enjoyment of
the great outdoors the end camp stove is
an effective tool for cooking and it is
compact for storage just unpack and
unfold the stove expand the combustion
chamber fill the chamber with
combustible material and light within
minutes you will have a fire hot enough
to cook or boil water
the end camp stove burns wood from the
forest eliminating bulk from your pack
but it can also use liquid or solid fuel
it is compact it has a useful work
surface it is made of aluminum and
stainless steel and is durable stable
and lightweight I love going outdoors
staying connected with great mother
nature and staying connected with family
and friends I love sharing my adventures
but I've realized that it's really hard
to get access to electricity to stay
connected outdoors the thing is today's
mobile devices use significantly less
power than traditional consumer
electronics so one day I came up with
the idea what if we could convert every
energy resource into personal power I
want to introduce you to e stream it's a
portable water power generator it
converts any type of running water into
stored energy you can get personal
on-demand power with nothing but water
energy this is how it works
remove the cover unfold the turbines and
lock them hook and release
eastream into running water let it spin
freely to generate electricity and it
charges the built in battery it takes
approximately 4.5 hours to fully charge
one e string which can charge up to
three smartphones GoPros or tablet PCs
two times faster than charging through
an outlet
you can also use it as a lantern with
four different modes even underwater
eastream works well even in we current
for behind a kayak and regardless of the
weather or time of day
it fits perfectly into any size backpack
it's ideal for use while you enjoy
camping fishing kayaking biking or any
other outdoor activities hi I'm Andrew
let me show an approach do love the
slides and you want to introduce this
something interesting there's that first
two really powerful flashlight was
better back up and functional discipline
it's called a really amazing you can use
it any way
learning walk rather bite you know on
creeps and it make for that of universal
this is was fun and then night
also you can change your smartphone or
anything else that have a big promotion
hi Kickstarter I'm Jake and I'm the
founder of singe two years ago Yelp has
been an ultimate pop-up tent to over 30
countries worldwide and the response was
phenomenal the approval kicks down as a
world's best focus group of your
feedback we've made even more
improvements I came to you with a vision
for exceptional camping without
compromising you brought my dream to
life all the benefits of regular temples
tons more with none of the hassle I've
designed every singe 10 so you can
attach a solar power pack this captures
solar energy on the roof of the 10
channels it inside through a web
approved for into a pocket-sized power
bank which we've upgraded this year to
have three times the capacity of the
previous model the solar pack is so
versatile you pal all of the USB powered
gadgets and there were two USB ports so
you can power two devices at the same
time you can take the power bank with
you on the move just unplug it and slip
it into your pocket the two entrances
each with the Ron port banning loads of
functionality you can tailor to your own
needs you need to cinch each entrance
that it's all kind of detachable poles
and new 2016 it's a super extended
canopy which lets you extend your living
space by Anik four square meters
all the kid that's nearly away into the
bag this year usage has to kill safety
mirrors attached the inside of the tent
cinch comes in three sizes two three
four person each one is a largest in its
class a format with over six and square
meters of looking to bears the biggest
pop-up tent in the world every ten is
double skin to stuck on desertion music
fans waterproof memory which is three
times the industry standard give you
extra protection really wet conditions
you don't want to get to a campsite
master spend ages assembling your ten
one to be able to enjoy yourself
straight away and make the most of being
outdoors I came up with cinch after
years ago into music festivals on
camping trips and never find an attempt
to suit my needs I went through dozens
attempts the big manufacturers always
let me down the adventure doesn't a -
Sun Goes Down nighttime it just as
important as day cinch is fully equipped
for the dark every singe is packed with
LED Tampax to cool torches the turn into
lanterns
well now made alive effective guylines
glow-in-the-dark we design a blackout
canopy that also regulates Andy it's
super easy to pour in a matter of
seconds in the morning if you're
sleeping attack as long as you want
still stare cool comfortable
temperatures instantly takes less than a
minute I found two
pop-ups are great
you still want space comfort good
quality materials the sort of stuff you
get when you spend the time in putting
up a regular tent
how can I found my ideal tent anywhere
so we decided to make it myself the
criteria was non-negotiable light and
easy to carry with everything packed
together Lords of cool features some
really serious kit underneath easy and
fun but making the highest quality
materials and built to last that jump
taught me loads about the large-scale
manufacturing process and made it clear
that we can go even further the next
generation cities we're ready to go
testing is complete and our
manufacturers fully briefed we just need
your help to finish buying materials and
get production underway you have
confirmed my belief that centers that
ultimate problem 10 let's make the
hassle camping thing of the past and
give people an experience let's fit the
great outdoors</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
