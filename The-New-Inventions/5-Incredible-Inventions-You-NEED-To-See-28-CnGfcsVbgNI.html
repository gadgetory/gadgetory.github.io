and we're Pacquiao
the four of us have been working on this
project for two and a half years
the idea for Paki AK was born out of a
desire for a packable performance pack
we wanted to build a rigid boat that was
portable light and easy to store yet
long sleek and fast making his
performance indistinguishable from the
traditional high end high
packy AG is the ultimate packable kayak
it's a boat without the limitations of
other portable kayaks
like the folding models or the
inflatables while it's designed for
serious adventures hardcore travellers
and touring enthusiasts beginners will
also enjoy its stability and comfort too
here's how it works the whole design
retains the paddling characteristics of
a traditional kayak while allowing it
six sections to disconnect easily and
then pack inside one another to create
an easily managed three and a half foot
bundle our boat can be assembled in
under five minutes anywhere with no
tools and no loose parts making it the
fastest assembly on market
back out uses a resin specifically
formulated for use in the kayak industry
it's lighter and stronger and more UV
resistant than other residents the
clamps and seals are constructed from
materials and techniques used in scuba
underwater photography and the aerospace
industries the inter connecting sections
are not just watertight but they act as
reinforcing bulkheads
making the hole stronger in even more
rigid than a conventional kayak in
addition to the quality and
craftsmanship of the construction our
mission is to help preserve the waters
we paddle in our first model the bluefin
a 14-foot touring kayak is named after
the endangered bluefin tuna a portion of
the revenue will go to programs to
sustain our marine ecosystems every
aspect of our company from manufacturing
to shipping is designed to have minimal
impact on the environment all
manufacturing assembly and distribution
occurs in one facility to minimize our
carbon footprint our shipping materials
are minimalistic and use recycled
products imagine a 14-foot rigid hull
high-performance kayak that you can take
anywhere this kayak can fit in your
apartment in a closet in the elevator in
the trunk of your car and even go to the
airport and all handles solo
we have tested our prototypes and we are
currently making improvements to our
molds our manufacturing processes and
our supply chains are in place we are
prepared to start manufacturing and with
your help make PAC act the best kayak on
the market
our goal is to raise the additional
funds we need to launch pakya by
contributing to this campaign you will
not only be supporting an american-made
brand but you also be helping to protect
the environment thank you for your love
and support from the entire team
hello everybody I'm Stefan I work for
Amarillo and today I'm going to

scientifically proven as highly
effective ways to release stress and
have many other positive effects such as
better sleep higher productivity and
even better aging

the before and after and we can see how
your stress level is being reduced and
then we can recommend those meditations
that are likely to have the best effect
on you you can set the world the app to
notify you when stress level is too high
so these are like a friendly reminder it
also offers you a mutation you can take
a five-minute break and go back to your
busy life much calmer our goal was to
create the most environmentally friendly
product this high-quality design is made
of cork cork is the skin of an oak tree
and it's actually pretty good for the
oak tree to take off the skins once in a
while it supports its wellness and
growth so by using cork you are
basically supporting oak trees we have
spent over 12 months in preparations
engineering designing selecting
different providers all to bring about
the very best solution for stress
reduction and we need your help help us
to bring the well be the best stress
relieving device to market and you'll

work together to be creative and to not
be afraid of mistakes finally we have an
educational tool that can be used almost
anywhere and the best part is kids love

hi I'm Nicole I'm an arts teacher I'm
happy to introduce mini toy
it's the world's first cake friendly 3d
printer it's cute it's safe and it's
excellent for the learning experience of
children and it's very affordable the
mini toy app has hundreds of different
3d models so it's easy for your kids to
find the object they want to print
creating and learning has never been
this fun I love the design of the 3d
printer the fact that the mechanical
part the hidden makes it really
kid-friendly the different materials
like soft PLA and a flexi plate offers a
variety of textures making the learning
experience a lot more dynamic we also
made sure that printing is easy with
OneTouch printing we've been developing
the prototype for more than one year
with our team of dedicated engineers we
were able to accumulate two registered
patents and 10 patent-pending technology
to build the safest and first ever
kid-friendly desktop 3d printer it's
pretty cool because you can make many
things by money I mean almost
parents everywhere can feel better
knowing that their child can understand
and use this technology that's already
changing the world we are launching
minute while here at Kickstarter in hope
that you can help support our campaign
by backing us we can expand the stream
community platform widely supply the
minute oil and create more and more open
libraries of 3d models for you and your
family and your kids can learn explore
and play for fun</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
