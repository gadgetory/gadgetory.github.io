together now for several years we
discovered that the one thing that's
really holding back the next generation
of mobile robots in the consumer market
is an affordable and powerful scanning
lidar sensor lighter tensions are
crucial to the success of autonomous
vehicles like self-driving cars and
smart drones they use laser light to
detect how far away surfaces are in
order to do things like avoid hazards
and make maps at new environments we saw
that most scanners were pricing the
several thousands of dollars and
oftentimes are the single most expensive
item at a robot even the ones that were
more affordable just didn't perform well
enough and refreshing to use so we set
out to make one ourselves with sweep we
created the world's first long-range
scanner that's purpose-built for
consumer applications when we designed
sweep we had three main goals make it
powerful and get easy to use and make it
affordable we wanted even the most
novice users to get up and running
quickly but we still wanted to provide
the depth of information that the more
seasoned users would expect we went
through almost a dozen iterations over
the last two years until we found the
perfect balance of simplicity and
capability we also developed a
visualization application that allows
for quick viewing of the data with
options like signal strength feedback
that allows for a deep understanding of
the information we provide easy mounting
holes and dual communication ports for
easy mounting and integration on aerial
vehicles so you can be used to avoid
crashes and unpredictable environments
remote control signal loss and
first-time pilot errors can be dealt
with gracefully
on ground robots it can help avoid
obstacles and map out environments it
will be especially useful for education
programs like FIRST Robotics we've been
developing the mouse for years what we
are looking for is a useful comfortable
cute and funny Mouse we are pretty sure
that they use the mouse a lot in your
office if you are a gamer or if you just
often browser the mouse you really will
be interesting in certain are the spoons
with this mouse we provide two different
types of room this is the ordinary group
no different from a typical common mouse
high-efficiency is its merit in
particular when you are using some
special software and need to click the
left middle and right keys shift between
them and use the wheel frequently you'll
be impressed by its high efficiency
problem is at this very moment part of
your hand muscles are straining even
though you're not using them since they
are not in the natural position after
we've been using the mouse for a long
time we experienced hand fatigue such
being the case why don't we design a
special madness that enables people to
use in the gripping
transformation our mouse provides an
alternative method of grip
this is the alternative grip provided by
our mats it is the most natural hema
system that's what we've taken into
account when designing we place the
wheel here so that you can use the
touching bar easily unlike the ordinary
way don't need to raise up your fingers
to operate it anymore
all around gripping makes it Swift and
moving and precise position
high precision performing tasks
if you're a gamer you'd also experience
clicking the left key is just like
pulling a gun trigger which is awesome
we all know that in regular grip the
left key can only be pushed downward
which is far less realistic to the
feeling of using a gun our digital age
is full of screens and I stimulation
from the moment we wake up to the time
we fall asleep we're constantly using
our eyes causing fatigue and strain your
eyes are working restlessly for every
activity you do allergies are a common
cause of I irritation
even while you're relaxing at home your
eyes are still moving and working
contact lenses make your eyes dry and
irritate it
hi I'm Eric after my father-in-law began
suffering from I fatigue showing signs
of I strand migrants irritation and
puffiness I began searching for various
kinds of eye care products on the market
but couldn't find the right solution for
him I was determined to create a product
that would be reliable easy and fast way
to make him feel better this was hell
arrived was born
the key to our eye is liquid water we've
tried different transmission materials
from non woven cloth copper foil gel
pearls to finally water along with our
massage technology our unique water
circulation design stimulates blood flow
around the eyes using thermoelectric
cooler we're able to create both cool
and warm compress feature with aura a
warm compress can increase oily
substance drainage and bring in natural
healing substances and is ideal for dry
and tired eyes a cold compress is ideal
in treating allergic irritation and can
reduce swelling dark circles and crows
feet around the eyes the challenge we
faced was how to deliver a quick
temperature change
we tried different materials and shapes
of the thermal module as well as various
pumps
in the end we found the best combination
the waterbag design of our i features
hypoallergenic soft silicon that forms
to the face ensuring a comfortable and
relaxing fit for every face shape
with the launch of the oculus rift and
the HTC vive virtual reality has finally
become reality but there's something
that has been bugging us it's comfort it
can be really hard to stay comfy when
you're wearing a VR headset and it can
repeatedly take you right out of the
moment it's a problem that stayed on our
minds so we decided to develop not only
hygiene solutions like our your covers
that are used by thousands of VR into
yesterday but also work towards greatly
improving the variability of VR handsets
ticket uses a more fully immersive
experience right now if users don't wear
contact lenses with a VR headset they
are expected to somehow squeezed a
glasses inside the unit this can become
uncomfortable when your temples come
under sustained pressure from headset
straps or the nose heads of your glasses
are pressed down heavily against your
face some glasses can even touch the
headset lenses calling scratches on both
lancets not good at all
that's why we teamed up with Pitt from
girls I wear to create a hassle-free
experience for everyone who wants
protection for their lenses or needs
prescription eyewear with vr lens left
we're building glasses for your VR
headset in your VR headset without
glasses for watch reality headsets you
can finally enjoy a full field of vision
within your VR headset and protect your
headsets lenses from dust and scratches
forget about wearing regular glasses or
contact lenses to enjoy virtual reality
experiences with razor sharp and super
crisp graphics we are happy to bring
your glasses for your HTC vive or your
local script today both of them are easy
to put on and take off depending on your
prescription and thickness of the lenses
you can be even much closer to action
than if you would wear regular glasses
we cannot offer prescription lenses your
Kickstarter but after a campaign is over
you can order them directly from us or
local opticians we can provide every
prescription from plus six 2-6 and
correct for things like astigmatism to
give you whatever your eyes need higher
prescriptions are possible to that this
needs to be done on a case-by-case basis
if you do not need prescription lenses
you can also simply get our glasses with
plan o lenses to protect the lenses of
your VR headset from dust and scratches
now we're asking for your help we need a
minimum amount to offer the glasses and
lenses at this great price point we've
developed and prototypes with pits 3d
printer and they've already set
everything up for production with high
quality moles please join us on our
journey to nagar to reality even more
comfortable and enjoyable for everyone
