years ago other University now in our
little technologies go working very hard
to bring to all of you
glove one has an array of temperate
actual actuators placing cotton with
your hand controlled by a PCB with USB
and bluetooth capability the whole
system has been optimized to reduce
latency and to provide accurate tactile
sensation with super8 remains in the
tracking system available amok in the
real cell and Limoge with your sensor
fusion to combine this data with an
embedded i'm you to improve the tracking
accuracy the wonderful plasticity of the
human brain along with our refine our
organs are the key to create the
illusion that with our blood can
actually push and fill the ignition
button for spaceship or the weight of a
basketball
as a doctor neuroscience I have almost
20 years of experience in neurological
rehabilitation I can state that block 1
is a definitive tool to enhance the
presence of feelings in before knee
rehabilitation environments that is the
way to tell the most efficient result
when treating brain impaired people this
is the most human phase of technology
nowadays we are collaborating different
research projects along with outstanding
medical centers and universities for the
development of treatment strategies in
brain damage Alzheimer and visual
impairment
it is important to remark that even if
we provide intel realsense and leap
motion integration developers are
entitled to the technologist well our
API and SDK are completely unified ready
and we are working to include Unreal
Engine to the batch but still we are
eager to get feedback from developers to
continue improving our SDK and to meet
all the requirements they ask when
phasing approach with flow one
would you like to try
you
the start of 2014 we got contacted by
III they have this initial idea about
turning a dancers booty shaking the
music and asked us if we could build a
project around it it just became
interesting how it would be cool to
develop something that's based around
how to shake your ass is to music and
like how you can also revert things and
make music with with your body as well
the booty drum is the devisor records
movements through accelerometers
attached to the dancers booty so these
movements translated the unique
velocities and triggers so in this way
the dancer triggers a musician samples
and together they are creating a beat or
the structure so to speak becomes a
collaborative track between the dancer
and the musician
I Bobby
you
we are on a mission to unlock the
essence of reality in virtual worlds to
enable human integration with technology
that is so seamless all it takes is a
glance for your digital environment to
react at the speed of thought
we are phob the world's first eye
tracking virtual reality headset both is
pushing the boundaries of what is
possible with watch reality and helping
to realize its true potential we wanted
to create the next generation of VR so
we developed the world's most advanced
eye tracking technology and are
complementing it with a high resolution
screen and low latency tracking as the
user perceives the digital environment
phones infrared cameras track their
pupils and register the slightest
movements with each expression plants
and blink the users intentions manifest
in the virtual world because phone knows
exactly where the user is looking with
imperceptible delay we can enable a
technique called fovea - rendering this
allows us to focus the fidelity in the
part of the vision that matters most
leading to better performance on lower
end hardware and is currently possible
by calculating suffer parallax between
pupils fove enable software to present
virtual environments with realistic
depth of field improving immersion and
allowing the eyes to relax when viewing
objects of varying depths and by
enabling fine control with the eyes Cove
significantly reduces simulation
sickness through the elimination of
unnecessary move
with food artificial intelligence
becomes more responsive and nuanced
reacting to the players most subtle
intentions and providing more realistic
interaction with eye tracking we can
create a truly natural user interface
that is intuitive and nearly
subconscious in action what is truly
interesting with eye tracking technology
is that enables users to deeply interact
with a virtual reality world by
translating subtle iron movements into
emotional expressions which can be read
and reacted to just like in real life
but that's just the beginning for
technology enables entirely new forms of
expression communication and movement
fove has a profound future our
technology will not only react to and
emulate complex human emotions conveyed
through the eyes but also through facial
expressions at last with fove we can
fully integrate human expressions into
everyday be our foe is not just a dream
the technology is already working our
team has been demoing the first
prototype around the world and the power
of our technology is clear people
everywhere are really excited about this
folks amazing we at high fidelity are
working on letting people interact as
avatars while they're in head mounted
displays this is a solid hmd even
without the eye tracking I'm really
excited to see that combined with eye
tracking and see what we can do with it
this is a huge step forward it's a
incredibly complex technological problem
to track eyes in real-time and have it
interact in the environment there is a
company who has solved this problem and
that's both and we're very excited for
their product to come to market i
trekking
very well I support these guys on
percents
let's go vote the future of storytelling
plasmid game interactivity and I ask you
our buckets to support us in building
the most expressive content that our
technology can enable by being an early
backer
you will receive an h md dev kit early
access to our sdk and technical support
fo will empower you to create
unprecedented kinds of expressions and
interactions we invite everyone to share
our vision and support our project join
us in creating the future of virtual
reality
you
interacting with technology in your home
should be seamless we a group of friends
come in from backgrounds in electrical
engineering computer science and
industrial design and we've been working
for the last year to build a better way
to use our connected devices we've gone
through dozens of prototypes and are now
ready to manufacture right here in
Germany we've taken Remo this far but
for final certifications and materials
we need support from you this is only
the beginning with your help we can
reinvest interact with technology back
our campaign and join our community
together let's get away from screens and
closer to each other</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
