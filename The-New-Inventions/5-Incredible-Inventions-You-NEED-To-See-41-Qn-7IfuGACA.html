virtual reality is transporting you into
a digital environment where you can look
all around and interact with things as
if you were there whether it's a game a
movie or a 360-degree photo it's a fully
immersive experience and a very
different feeling than simply viewing
digital content on a screen opto is a
new kind of virtual reality headset it
uses your smartphone it was born after
months of user research when we realized
that mostly our devices aren't made for
everyday use opto is the first portable
headset with integrated audio sound is
not just an afterthought but an integral
part of the design we have designed opto
as a wearable it is lightweight sits
perfectly balanced on your head and is
made of closed cell foam a material
comfortable to wear and easy to clean we
will no longer feel like you're just
strapping a piece of hardware to your
face the process of inserting and
removing your phone is quick and easy
you simply connect the audio place the
phone inside and then pop the front
cover back on you can jump in and out of
VR whenever you want in watch your
favorite TV series on your couch or on
the train opto is your portable
entertainment headset
Tom and I have been working together for
over three years we are based from
Somerset House in London and a part of
makeover city it's a community of
creatives designers engineers and
software developers optos body is made
almost entirely of a patented closed
cell foam and is made in the same
factory that produces the famous crop
shoes this material is not only tough
but it's very light and comfortable to
wear we've built opto with large optics
to give you an excellent field of view
after many months of development and
testing we now have a working prototype
and we're ready to start moving into
production we really think that this
thing is going to change virtual reality
yeah by supporting our campaign you'll
help us produce the first 1,000 units
and we can make opto a reality
imagine a future in which the
capabilities of the human body can be
enhanced so mobility is always enabled
and never left impaired that spark of
imagination lit the fuse that triggered
the launch three and a half years later
of the world's first Bionic knee brace
introducing levitation levitation stores
energy when you bend your knees and
releases it as you straighten them
enabling you to play longer work harder
and do more for nearly 80 years other
braces of a tenth of this but they use
traditional Springs and were too heavy
too big or just not powerful enough
levitations unique Bionic design changes
the game it's remarkably powerful it's
comfortable because it's lightweight and
compact and it's affordable
we designed a brace with ease of use in
mind levitation only weighs two pounds
and it has quick release strapping to go
on and come off fast
our final spring technology was inspired
by the hydraulic systems and high
performance aircraft our shells are
carbon fiber the same ultralight
material used in Formula One race cars
along the way we made over fifty
different prototypes each time getting
feedback in making small adjustments and
we tailor the Bionic response of your
brace to your specific need whether
that's unleashing the star athlete
inside you or simply keeping up with
your grandkids so here's where we need
your help
spring loaded is set to produce
levitation right here in our
manufacturing facility we want to spread
the word about levitation and how it's
different than every brace that's come
before it this is game changing even
life-changing technology you can order
levitation right now and help us bring
this amazing product to the world
you can donate and for every eight
hundred dollars raised we'll give a
brace to a person in need or by simply
sharing this project you'll be helping
us change the way the world moves
levitation play longer work harder and
do more
you
hey we are talk talk we design and we
create furniture but let us tell you
about our table it's an acoustic
amplifier for smart phones made of wood
the table is easy to use no buttons and
the batteries and no electronics it's
small so you can carry it around
anywhere you go
the table is available for iPhone and
other smartphones and it doesn't matter
if you get a new phone you can keep your
table and just change the detachable
piece we want to achieve the best
amplifying sound possible we have been
consulting the experts and testing
multiple prototypes the table increases
the volume by one and enhances the
quality of sound through the special
compartment and cones
of course amid the trauma nature
friendly its 100% recyclable and made
with locally sourced foods and you don't
need an app for it but for the turbo to
become a reality we need your support to
buy would better truths and set up a
production line so thank you for backing
up</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
