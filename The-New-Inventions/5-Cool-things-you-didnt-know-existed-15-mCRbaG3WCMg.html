end of the day you expect to get a break
from all the noise but sometimes there
are just some things you can't turn off
like the neighbors next door we're a
snoring partner or maybe even that
snoring partners alarm clock luckily
that's where hush comes in hush combined
sound eliminating foam with noise
masking so you can completely isolate
yourself from the noise around you but
in order for you to still hear the
notifications you need hush connects
wirelessly with your smartphone so you
can still let the important things in
now you can forget about the world
around you while still having a peace of
mind knowing you'll be brought right
back when the world needs you most plus
when the alarm sounds only you can hear
it that way when you wake up you don't
have to wake up anyone else sharing life
with those around you should
be so difficult hush gives people a way
to live in
in the context of the world around them
enjoy a good night's sleep regardless of
the environment one of the biggest
problems we face on the internet is the
need to remember and use complicated
passwords to access secure websites such
as our online banking various membership
sites and many other sites just about
everybody requires a sign in cyber
criminals in an attempt to steal our
personal information currently use
software that can generate millions of
possible passwords in a second
consequently we need much stronger
passwords in order to protect ourselves
of course generating passwords is not
that difficult but remembering them is
because of that many people make up one
good password and use that for many
different sites but if the hacker hacks
just one of your accounts he has access
to all of them enter enigma is the total
secure password manager for the 21st
century enigmas gives you all the tools
you need to create and store totally
random passwords that are almost
impossible to crack enigmas pages are
arranged in an alphabetical directory to
store passwords for easy access do you
want your google hangout password just
go to G there are hundreds of different
ways to create and store passwords in
the enigmas password manager the nig
maze is the 21st century solution to
create and store passwords that even the
most determined criminal can find
virtually impossible to crack we're
ready to go into production with the
Nick page but we can't move forward
without you thank you so much for your
support
that is so important to all the devices
daily basis and we're always tracking
the energy on these devices to make sure
that they have enough juice enough fuel
to do what we need them to do but what
tracks our own energy in this 24-7 world
where we're always on the go and our
brains are always processing what can we
use to make sure we have enough energy
enough fuel to be our best meet Vigo the
very first energy gauge for you Vigo
identifies patterns in your blinks and
in your motion to quantify how alert you
are in real time the idea is simple your
body can't hide when you're tired Vigo
tracks the physiological signs your body
gives off when you're losing fuel to
know you're drowsy before you do our
motivation to build Vigo started at the
University of Pennsylvania we realize
you're experiencing a very similar
problem whether in the library in the
classroom or at our jobs we're getting
drowsy when we didn't want to be we
imagined a device that could quantify on
business visualize the start of the
useful way and do something cool with it
like give us recommendations on how to
change our routine well not just when we
needed a break so we built veto one of
egos coolest features is that you can
customize when and how the device nudges
you you can choose whether Vigo alerts
you when you've been idle for too long
or when you started to doze off by
controlling the sensitivity of the
algorithm and how does Vigo nudge you
well that's up to you maybe the
notification LED is enough to help you
refocus or maybe a soft pulsing
vibration is what you need
or maybe you want something a little
more inspiring to help you get back in
the day hi mom yeah I'll be home in a
little and since Vigo connects to your
phone through bluetooth you'll never
miss a call or text whenever you wear
Vigo is up to you you can wear v go to
build smarter more efficient routines at
work you could wear Vigo so you don't
doze off on long drives or on a complete
strangers shoulder in the metro you can
wear v go to keep you awake for an
important presentation or on that date
with the super boring girl who loves you
to sleep we've spent the last four
months in Shenzhen China the electronics
capital of the world as part of the
accelerator hardware incubator program
and perfecting our technology but to
bring video to life you need your help
we're already looking ahead and exciting
ways to implement videos technology in
the future not only for people like us
who want to be more alert and productive
in their daily life but for people whose
profession requires them to the
attendant and learn all the time back
our project and help make digo reality
life's too short not to be your best and
not to be in the zone when you need to
be
join us and wherever you go we're back
our original design was good but we've
taken your suggestions and feedback and
created not one but two irresistible
styles made for everyday feet to the
athlete in you
completely water submersible incredibly
lightweight improve functionality better
design a superior alternative in foam
composite footwear and of course our
patent-pending strategically placed air
and water drains
excellent for obstacle course races
crossgates stands up to the rigors of
any obstacle course race but without the
water logging and because of the
construction design and materials cross
cakes outperforms any standard sneaker
in the market
both the 2 point 0 and apx are
comfortable enough for daily activities
but also makes a great running shoe
durable an innovative design
super easy to maintain
where your kicks for everyday activities

the aps uses a special elastic lacing
system with a cord lock insert your feet
and remove your shoes without ever
having to tie your shoelaces again the
apx is not a slip-on and is designed
with a fully adjustable time our new
proprietary material is twisted softer
than a previous design and allows the
footbed to mold to the shape of your
feet

hi I'm keyvan Mirza CEO of opt invent
we'd like to present the revolutionary
aura smart glasses the aura is all about
an improved user experience it has the
patented flip view feature which allows
to display modes one is the augmented
reality mode and one is the glans mode
it's got a bigger brighter see-through
display and it's more energy efficient
therefore improving battery life it also
doesn't need to be tethered to a
smartphone and can run apps
independently the aura is the most
complete and powerful mobile computing
platform available today it has the full
suite of sensors as a camera as position
sensors Wi-Fi Bluetooth and GPS hello
I'm Kelly sorry Dean obtainment CTO we
have been developing the technology at
the heart of the aura glasses since 2008
the core technology is protected by nine
international patents these patents and
our extensive know-how constitute a very
high barrier to entry for see-through
smart glasses we have worked hard to
make the most complete and powerful
hardware platform available today but we
need the landed application developer
like you to make it a great product
the technology at the heart of the aura
is a patented retinal projection engine
it is the most power-efficient see
through technology in its class
providing a clear bright and sharp
display experience this display engine
is lightweight and shatterproof it is
also the most scalable in terms of
manufacturing as the key optical
components are based on molded plastic
elements often vents extensive know-how
in near to I display technologies
ergonomics design and manufacturing
expertise is what is needed to deliver
this disruptive technology protected by
several international patents
our team of engineers and their
experience dedication and passion is
what makes the aura the best
cutting-edge they are smart glasses
available
the aura is capable of true augmented
reality it includes the pioneering
wikitude AR browser hi my name is Andy
stop wikitude CMO we've been
collaborating with Upton vent for a
while now and are very impressed with
the RS prototypes in his flip view which
allows for a true see-through augmented
reality mode because of this very unique
feature we've been partnering with
keyvan and his team to create an
optimized version of all augmented
reality SDK for the aura smart glasses
if you're a developer looking for an all
optimized augmented reality hardware and
software package the RS smart glasses
and the wicked SDK might just be the
perfect combo for you
