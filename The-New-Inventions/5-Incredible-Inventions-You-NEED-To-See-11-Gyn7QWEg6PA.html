boat were based off of size and
portability the fact that you can take
it home and it doesn't take up a whole
garage space you could just put it on
the shelf when you're not using it the
fact that when you're ready to go to the
lake you just throw it in the back of
your Honda Civic back of your little
pickup any car the hatchback it'll fit
right in
one guy can pick it up walk down to the
water and slate the inner tube and
you're off the go boat has the green
light and it's made in the u.s.a the
infrastructure is in place to meet the
high production demand and by ordering a
go boat right now
you will be one of the coolest parents
and or one of the most admired
outdoorsmen on the water the patent is
approved it's finalized the design is
finalized we are ready to go and by
supporting this Kickstarter campaign you
will be one of the first people in the
world that can just pick up your boat
and go Lily used to climb the highest
mountains in search of the freshest air
with wind
she doesn't have to anymore wind is the
world's first personal air quality
system that generates fresh and clean
air that's portable and is simple to use
it's built-in sensor monitors the air
quality around Lily and adjusts its
power to filter more or less wind helps
Lily keep the air around her clean and
fresh even when she's traveling wind
works by creating a bubble of healthy
air around it dirty air is drawn in by
vents pulled through a medical-grade
air filter and clean air is propelled
out of the top wind can filter things
like allergens dust pet dander smoke
pretty much anything except that Lily
can adjust the amount of clean air wind
releases by simply twisting
the wind app allows Lily to check the
quality of the air around her gain
insight about the air she's filtered and
check the air quality of her friends and
family Wynne knows when Lily's filter is
used up and can automatically ship a
replacement filter to her home and the
air quality tracker can even detach to
keep Lily aware of the air she's
breathing while she's on the go wind
blends seamlessly into Lily's life
allowing her to breathe easy no matter
where life takes her our life without
music is incomplete it's our passion
Drive and a faithful companion that
helps us undertake any struggle but
music isn't just a playlist it's a
powerful experience of sound that
changes the way we perceive reality
music has the ability to synchronize
with our emotions and it demands much
more than just another speaker system so
what if we could bring our daily audio
experience to a whole new level
I wanted a device that would enhance my
experience of listening to music that is
why I created sounds to totally
redefined the notion of home speakers
sounds is the first device that offers
you a real 360 degrees sound experience
in magic quality thanks to the
revolutionary connection of a completely
new engineered woofer with flat panel
membrane speakers plus its unique shape
which comes from applying the best
acoustic principles when I listen to
music for work or pleasure focus on the
dynamics of the speaker's my house has
that excellent bass also love the 360
degree sound feature that allows me to
move and dance freely and focus only on
my music my goal was to create a device
that would add something to the way you
experience music by addressing the other
senses music and light have such a
strong connection take for instance a
summer storm or a music festival or a
beautiful sunset at the seaside we
delivered sounds with a warm light LED
ball but you can also integrate it with
other lighting like you or lifx and
create any mood your soundtrack demands
you can also synchronize several sounds
devices to create an outstanding light
and music event with optional power
banks you can bring them anywhere you
want
I love sounds mobility you don't need to
keep them plugged in and their ability
to interconnect it's fantastic
each of us is unique so are the places
we live in where we like to spend our
time that's why each sounds has to be
just as unique as you are we let you
customize the look of your unit simply
by sending us your design or you can
just choose one of our beautiful ready
to order style covers what I love about
sounds is its mobility and the way I can
adjust it design to my different modes
the meditation to dancing to the funky
music finally I can replace my heart'll
steer this is a bit dark monster with
cables you can hide now the sounds in my
life are so incredibly real spacious and
a new present
another great thing is the freedom of
control you can connect your accounts
with various wireless devices and new
technologies this is lock stone crafted
for a meticulous study of nature to
capture and enhance the life of your
fragrance inspired by nature developed
through science design will focus upon
minimalist streamlined aesthetics
a piece that can be teamed with any
style as suited to men as they are to
women and is wearable for the farm
location as they are for the everyday
for you
this means your favorite fragrance lasts
in the entire day
the most effective designs are based
upon the most simplistic of principles
which is why we've crafted arranged to
be free from all mechanical components
drawing upon only nature his inspiration
from material that releases fragrance
and de fruit without fail by tapping
into CNC turning we were then able to
achieve perfect geometry ultimately
creating the timer's design that you see
before you today a design that goes on
to also deliver rigidity and
practicality for easy stylish everyday
use
the specific science that we draw upon
is capillary action where the water
molecules are drawn deep into the
material and migrate slowly back up to
the surface for osmosis it is then that
the water evaporates releasing the
center for you this means longer-lasting
and better performing fragrances
for a single fragrance this range is
perfect for you
very variety of fragrances are
interchangeable range features multiple
removable stones so you can smell the
way you want when you want
through combining machine turned
stainless steel and brass with classic
style we found perfect pumps creating a
design that is as practical as it is
elegant
whatever your fragrance capture and
enhances life if you think this is a
lantern think again we've designed a
brighter diffuser and a more compact
versatile light that can charge your
phone mount to your bike as a headlight
and light up any space lantern makes the
fuse light simple and easy with up to
1,000 lumens and a 700-foot beam Lantern
comes with a unique 360 degree bike
mount shock-resistant you can drop
lantern from six feet and it's IPX six
water-resistant lantern started out as a
simple idea a paper cone cut out and
founder Corey's home workshop he was
amazed at the result and it was quickly
off to the 3d printer
then finally into the beautiful handmade
prototype so how could you use lanterns
for backpacking and camping perfect for
roadside emergencies lighting up a photo
or video shoot in the glove box when you
really need it awesome for family time
around the campfire and staying up past
your bedtime
Lantern can charge things on the go for
longer rides and is the perfect
hands-free light for around the house
you can clip Lantern to anything
anywhere and it's rugged enough for
industrial settings
don't get caught unprepared in a
blackout always keep a lantern nearby in
under a month we've received over 1500
followers on Instagram and here's what
they've been saying about lanterns
so what's in the box
Lantern comes with a simple wrist strap
360-degree bike mount carabiner charging
cable beautiful Lantern diffuser and the
powerful Lantern flashlights here's the
