I'm also biking Susie as well why do a
long test ride I don't want to get
myself by Scottie I will need to check
the math record tons of cycling dating
in real time which means like a barrel
dreaming fans people like we will need
extra from holder help our banks and a
beta line to solve that problem of them
will be put on your handlebars and add a
lot unnecessary weight besides you're
also need a flashlight ask them ends as
solving the charging issue when you're
writing it talks about half year to make
s them instead a girl looking super easy
to use and tough it now the special
designers leather LED light and battery
all be put together to the stand you
only need to open this letter into the
phone clack pop three steps to complete
the charging operation on the phone the
battery is in the back you just remove
it like that and take it home to charge
just like the normal part bags till now
we're still optimizing the design and
make sure every detail of ask them will
be perfect and the every part will be
easy to use we really want to create
something different and which are never
exist in a campaign before so right now
we're in this post from you guys to
achoo our very original girl do more
in most corners of the world drinking
alcohol is a common social activity
breathalyzers gave us the power to
physically measure just how much we've
had to drink with personal access to
this technology we can better monitor
our drinking and prevent poor decisions
just as wearable fitness devices help us
exercise breathalyzers help us be more
responsible drinkers where smith is your
personal drinking wingman it won't take
your keys but will help you know when to
put them away
we all have different tolerances and
react differently to alcohol
test your breath would wear Smith 20
minutes after your last drink it's
accurate sensors analyze your blood
alcohol content and display results
directly on a built-in screen an
optional app provides expanded
information statistics and features
where Smith makes you a smarter drinker
making smarter decisions hi this is the
oco-2 a simple home monitoring camera
when you're away from your pooch or your
baby or the grand piece how can you
check up on them me taco too it's gonna
make the world a better place and all
that kind of stuff oco-2 your hunch is
right while co one exists and is already
on sale the wheels of progress never
stopped turning the oco-2 is a
self-learning bull HD camera with hybrid
story one-of-a-kind an SD card will be
useful in case your internet connection
gets lost and cloud storage in case
thieves want to steal your code too and
they will want self-learning is always
good but with the oco-2 it's amazing
amazing and i feel a bit sorry about the
two-hundred-dollar cameras that you buy
and after three days you're a sick of
all the fake notifications every time a
car passes by or Sri swaying every light
blinking self-learning is always good RA
I understand that you don't want to be
inundated through its endless
notifications only smart push
notifications by the way what's that guy
doing in your kitchen 60 second set up a
magic magnetic face that you can fix to
your Hall and point in any direction you
want yeah even there why this viewing
angle night vision and of course to a
talk I love you know the fact is these
days big corporations know more about
you than your own mother does you know
all your search history and habit do you
really need a camera that's finding out
even more about you we're just as
concerned about security as you are
amazing monthly payments be aware as a
hundred dollars a year
no monthly payments require ever that's
how we roll the oco-2 is powered by the
incredible I videon which has outdone
all other video surveillance services
for the last six years to bestow the o2
on the wall we have an experienced and
diverse team from five countries the
u.s. fraud China Russia okay for I can
feel pretty good right the camera is
ready to be manufactured help us to
crowdfund the first bunch of Akko to
production unit you'll be the first to
get a camera and for half price our
dream is to bring fully featured an
affordable security devices to every
home
jump in together we can let's do it what
are you waiting for kid let's do it come
on come on guys one day you'll tell your
grandchildren that you helped these
great guys launch this really cool thing
we all enjoy great food but have you
ever thought about the waste that's been
created you have no idea do you not at
all let's assume that one third of food
ingredients prepared for cooking cannot
be used and with three meals a day 21
meals a week you will have wasted 100
kilograms in one year when this raw food
waste is taking the landfills along with
the rest of your garbage it sits there
to rot and produces methane a greenhouse
gas with 21 times the global warming
potential compared to carbon dioxide and
all of this waste comes from just one
family oh my gosh but wait you shouldn't
be so how does mother nature deal with
this issue in the natural environment
organic matter decays gradually over
time timers would take to decompose and
nature's one to two months but the same
things in the landfill to take up to a
year or more in this natural process
there's another particular life-form
that plays a crucial part that's right
I'm talking about Earth buns earthworms
are called ecosystem engineers for
changing the structure of the soil
environment they play an important role
in breaking down dead organic matter and
are also responsible for mixing soil
layers now what if we could bring this
ecosystem into your home
so it's a micro eco system the raw food
waste you produce each day from
processing food ingredients for cooking
should be disposed here and back to
those earthworks they will start doing
their work in this ecosystem eating
organic matter and breaking it down into
smaller pieces the earthworms then
cuddle and burrow in the moist soil and
leave their castings there this mixing
allows the nutrients to be dispersed
throughout the soil and becomes
available to bacteria and fungi aiding
to accelerate decomposition all of this
happens naturally and you will smell
nothing but the slight scent of fresh
soil after rain the rich soil created
from this process nourishes new life and
can also be removed as fertilizer for
your other plants the main purpose of
this project is to raise awareness for
the issue of food waste and its disposal
process we have tried to come up with a
system that can be managing urban homes
and create a self-sustainable closer
ecosystem be inspired by nature we
conduct biological research on the
process of food West decomposition of a
year and the information document from
our observation and the experiment will
translate into qualitative data this
data is fed into algorithms to create a
form of bio vessel being defined by
nature the film creator is most suitable
for his inhabitants and most effective
and
meaningful users so remember to think
twice about the food you are wasting and
if this can be done in every single home
then we would be able to save the planet
one step at a time starting from your
kitchen bio vessel an ecosystem powered
by your waist</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
