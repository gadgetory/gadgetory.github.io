doesn't matter if I'm in the park next
door on the boat trip with my friends or
at the peak of the mountain on the other
side of the world in the end I think
it's all about chasing these rare
moments when you're totally at ease with
yourself I find these moments in nature
and quite frequently it might be loved
hammock honestly is there a way not to
be laid-back while floating between two
palm trees as a matter of fact there is
mosquitoes for example experts in mood
turn even worse falling coconuts and of
course rain the ark enemy of hammock
lovers around the globe
sad but true Pema glava sometimes do
live an uncomfortable and dangerous life
in order to change that we have created
the flying tent it's a complete redesign
of what a hammock can be you can use it
with the mosquito net if it starts
raining zip up the rain cover and you
will find yourself relaxing in a
waterproof floating tent you can also
set it up on the ground as a BB tent or
in case you really decide to walk on in
the rain you can easily convert the
hammock into a fancy rain poncho with
this gear on your backpack
there's simply no more excuses for not
enjoying the outdoors without its
functionality we actually had to invent
a completely new mechanism that didn't
exist before it even allowed us to apply
for a patent and it allows you to set up
the tent in just around seven seconds at
the same time unlike most other tents
the flight end fits into this tiny
little bag and only weighs about one
kilogram this makes it one of the
smartest and lightest outdoor gears that
you can possibly get
it consists of high-quality waterproof
materials and it comes with all kinds of
useful features that make your outdoor
adventures even more enjoyable it's been
an amazing journey since the idea of the
flying tent was born our passion and
team was able to come up with a truly
unique product that exceeds all our
initial expectations for the last step
of this journey we need your help to
produce the first batch of flying tents
and establish them on the market
join our campaign and receive your
flying tents in time for this year's
summer adventures till then thanks for
watching and see you out there the
campfire can came out of my wife and I
traveling per year a few years in our
motorcoach part of the adventure was
having campfires in the evening and the
campfires that we bought didn't work so
I decided that I have to create
something myself that does work and I
started to study how fireworks and the
net result was campfire again the great
part is that it's all in the can it's
there ready when you want to use it what
happens quite often is people camping
and they say did did you bring this and
the answer is oh it's in the garage and
I wanted to design something that
everything fit inside so when you open
it up it had everything in there it had
the cooking grill it had the tongs for
moving the logs around etc it had the
propane attachment in it
yeah you can cook over this campfire
it's designed so that you can cook over
it and then once you finish cooking with
your charcoal a very simple operation
you take your cooking grill off lift the
bottom off they have a charcoal is the
charcoal falls to the bottom of your
campfire drop some wood in there
probably in a minute and a half will
have your fire you'll be learning it's a
system of burning the wood in the
upright position in the campfire which
gives you lots of flame and lots of fire
and the heat radiates out from it very
nicely it's off the ground so you don't
get any burn on the ground or anything
like that
you can use it pretty much anywhere you
want other campfires will radiate the
heat up and away from you other ones it
goes sideways and it doesn't come out to
you the heat can't get to you if you go
to a place where you don't want to have
a wood fire or the fire bans come in
less than a minute you can convert and
turn it into a propane campfire and have
a great fire and continue on having a
great summer well there's only one
campfire that really works efficiently
and effectively and that's the campfire
in a can because of the way that it's
designed you're gonna save a lot of
money on you would because when we burn
our wood we burn it very efficiently by
cutting our wood up a little smaller
when we put it in the campfire can is
bright because it's been designed to
work and built for last and puts out a
lot of heat and it's all in one can and
then when you want to put your wood fire
out instead of trying to find water and
everything else you just put the
canister top over and it extinguishes
the fire so it's an all-in-one campfire
everything's there when you need it when
you want it helped make campfire in a
can a reality pre-order yards today
and thank you very much for your help
it started with man's most primal
ambition the desire to harness the Sun
alternative power has come from humble
beginnings but we never settled and
we've never stopped innovating progress
is our passion and it has led us here
introducing the Lycan power box the
solar electric generator designed for
everyday family needs and ready-made for
power outages and natural disasters when
the unexpected hits the lichen power box
has you covered with 900 watt hours of
power but can we look at the brighter
side of life instead thank you the
lichen power box is a perfect companion
for your next camping trip tailgate
party or DIY outdoor project this
portable power house is the first of its
kind a true innovation that makes clean
energy easily accessible to everyone
it's as intuitive as it is innovative
keep the comfort and security of having
power in two convenient ways directly
from the grid or directly from the
source that gives life to this planet
the Sun
it's stated the up with the amount
phosphate battery is not only a higher
grade battery than the ones found in
Tesla vehicles but it also provides
clean efficient true wattage power
whenever and wherever you need it the
most simply plug your electrical device
into the like'm and power it up
since the likened power box delivers up
to 1,200 watts of squeaky-clean
electricity this rugged little lifesaver
won't leave you feeling stranded even if
everyone around you is equipped with a
high-performance interchangeable
maintenance-free 75 amp hour leather my
own phosphate battery that means you can
store a library of fully charged
batteries to run a device it for days on
end with its integrated intuitive LCD
screen the lichen allows you to monitor
your poems clearly and accurately and
with three additional AC outlet to 12
volt DC outlets and the 12 volt car
charger socket the Lycan power box won't
make you choose between your device's
the lichen gives you the freedom to plan
your adventure without compromise and
the peace of mind to know that you and
your family are safe and comfortable
should emergencies arise be the first to
tap into the simple power of the lichen
power box experience the future of clean
energy with renergie
camping gives us amazing opportunities
to explore remote destinations climb new
heights make new friends and experience
epic festivals but there's always been a
catch
after sunrise tents are often too hot or
too bright so many of us don't get
enough sleep now imagine the
possibilities if we had all the rest we
needed we have more energy to explore
further be more adventurous and have
even more fun that's why we created the
siesta for a revolutionary new tent
engineered from the ground up to give
you the best possible sleep outdoors
even in blazing sunshine when the Sun
comes up our game-changing ultra
reflective fly fabric blocks infrared
visible and ultraviolet light
dramatically reducing the temperature
and brightness inside the tent
for extra comfort you can add our ultra
quiet 8-inch USB fans that zip right
into the custom vents drawing in fresh
air from outside the full-length fly
provides maximum protection from wind
and rain while the breathable inner tent
prevents condensation and closable mesh
keeps out dirt and cold drafts this
gives you incredible all-weather
versatility inspired by the cold nights
and sweltering early mornings when
camping in the Australian outback we set
out to solve the problem of bright
overheating tents once and for all
and so the siesta was born we spent the
past year designing developing and
testing from fabrics to fans every
aspect of the tent has been meticulously
thought-out to ensure the highest
possible standards we've selected only
premium quality materials and partnered
with one of the world's leading tent
manufacturers now with the prototypes
finished we're ready to launch but we
need your help to meet the factory
minimums so if you like what you've seen
please tell your friends and if you'd
like a seriously badass tent just back
