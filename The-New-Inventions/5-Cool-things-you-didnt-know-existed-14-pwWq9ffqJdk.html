we love our smartphones and laptops we
take them everywhere we go they help us
plan our day keep in touch with friends
and family and for most of us they even
support our work what would we do
without them cell phones and laptops are
no longer just our phones and computers
they are our cameras camcorders game
consoles books heart rate monitors and
much more but all of these functions
come at a cost storage and connectivity
for example recording one minute of 4k
video requires 375 mb of storage more
storage means more money the iphone 6
plus 64gb model costs 100 dollars more
than the 16gb the surface pro I size 512
GB model costs four hundred dollars more
than the i-5 256 GB model that's
expensive introducing kratos wireless
flash drive that will save your time and
money you can create owes it to extend
storage space for your electronic
devices best of all its storage is not
reserved to just one device you can use
it with several devices with kratos you
can increase storage space on all of
your devices at the same time you can
share your pictures videos and other
data easily with your friends move files
easily between devices and even access
your entire music library you will be
able to wirelessly stream data anywhere
on several devices concurrently kratos
as the name indicates is the most
powerful and efficient wireless flash
drive ever produced the main advantage
of the creatives is storage space it
comes in two models 256 GB and 512gb
with the 256 GB model you can save
64,000 songs seventy six thousand eight
hundred images 12 hours of 4k video 34
hours of 1080 HD video and share them
between any devices it supports iOS Mac
OS Android and Windows you can do any
work with high quality without worrying
about space another important advantage
is that it supports dual band Wi-Fi it
means it provides 5 GHz and 2.4 GHz both
so it provides good connection higher
reliability
a nice environment for transferring and
streaming data kratos provides fast
speeds easy-to-use software and
streaming to multiple devices
concurrently lastly it provides alarm
functionality despite all of these
top-of-the-line functions the kratos is
sold at a low price it only costs
eighty-nine dollars for 256 GB model and
129 dollars for the 512 GB model the
price is about half of sandisk creatives
will be the best wireless drive ever
invented let's bring it to the world
interruption is still our time or focus
maybe it's just a small part or tool but
we searched frantically for a solution
to make it right well now there's n go n
go is a handy pocket size barmaid a
moldable non-toxic polymer that when
heated can be molded into practically
any shape 33 minutes and hot water to
make an NGO pliable too you'll have two
minutes to mold it into whatever shape
you need just let it cool down to room
temperature which only takes around five
to ten minutes then it's completely
cured and ready to work an envelope is
reusable with hot water or even a hair
dryer you can reheat the part as many
times as you like to modify or create
whatever shape you need
ingo is strong enough to be used to fix
and modify the world around you
and it's easy as three two and done
ingo comes in five colors but what's
cool is that you can mix these colors to
produce nine additional harmonious
colors just follow the color mixing
instructions on the chart provided in
each box for example take a pip of red
and a pickle yellow mix them and you get
an orange color dingo recently we gave
out samples of n go to try and even
we're surprised at the variety of ideas
where indigo has made people's lives
easier I accidentally broke my kitchen
spatula I love the cook I'm always in
the kitchen and when that broke I
thought I might need to buy a new one
but then I got out in go and I put it on
the spatula and it's just like new I use
it I actually have this thing that I use
you know to do my eyebrow makeup and my
I use the pencil sharpener so it gets
really short swear I can hardly get you
know get it to do it so what I did is I
used ego to just make it longer takes
thinking you know kind of make like the
hand before really help me fix a kitchen
door hinge which my wife complained
about I have an endo card in my bag and
I fixed the broken pieces for her she
was amazed now we'd love to be able to
offer the benefits of Ingo to a lot more
people but in order to do that we need
additional capital in order to produce
and go for a larger market that's where
you come in to help us fix the little
things your support will make Ingo a big
thing make your contribution today
at poof animal health and safety is our
top priority we wanted to fight against
the problems that face our pets at the
forefront of this were two major
concerns the first was lost pets one and
three will go missing during their
lifetime the other was held over fifty
percent of pets do not get enough
exercise but after two years we proudly
present the solution the beam and the
key they are the most versatile activity
and pet tracking devices on the market
first is the beam it is tiny about the
size of a pill in fact it's the world's
smallest activity tracker meaning it can
fit on any pet even puppies and kittens
and even though it's tiny we didn't
compromise on performance most pet
trackers have a battery life seven to
ten days well the beam lasts up to 60
days and then there's the pee it's a
size of a quarter and it uses a
replaceable coin cell battery which
provides an even more amazing 6-month
battery life keeping you worry free our
devices connect with the poofs app to
track daily activity and rest times it's
a great way to develop an exercise
routine and you can track progress over
time they'll love it too you can also
use the activity monitor as a
preventative measure extended rest
patterns can be an early sign of an
illness our devices can also help find
missing pets it's scruffy wanders off
the proof app can instantly generate a
poster that you can print share on
social media or message to your contacts
you'll also instantly receive the
contact information of nearby shelters
so you can see if he is there once
scruffy is reported missing any phone
with the proof app will be able to
receive a signal from his collar it's
like having thousands of people looking
for your pet without them even knowing
you can also reach out to the person who
accidentally found scruffy to see if
they can keep an eye on him while you
make your way to the destination it's a
technology we call social GPS we've also
made some great friends along the way
and we are proud to announce our
national nonprofit partnership with
greater good org hi I'm Liz Baker
