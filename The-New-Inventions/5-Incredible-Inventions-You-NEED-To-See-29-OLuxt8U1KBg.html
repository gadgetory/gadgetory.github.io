our awesome backers the first version
the time dog was successfully funded on
Kickstarter last year thousands of
peddlers worldwide are now enjoying what
has been named the best charging dock
for the pebble time time steel and time
round we're upgrading the time box
aluminum body the plinth and the
charging module in time for the release

there's something about being in the
natural world it's like magic it has a
certain feeling to it we all love
technology but what was life like before
it it was an era where people had time
to enjoy the outdoors and soak up
Earth's natural goodness today we live
in a world overflowing with technology
that benefits mankind but what about its
dangers from pollution to radiation to
electromagnetic waves technology affects
the way we think feel and even sleep but
what if there's a way to enjoy your cell
phones tablets and televisions without
the harmful effects hit your to see zen
cube
the healthiest lab ever inspired by the
purest places on earth we used our
expertise to create and build something
pure that we would be proud of bring the
benefits of the outdoors into where we
spend the most time our homes and
offices being in a waterfall or the
beach or the countryside give us off
lots of negative ions which is what the
body needs to feel great technology does
the opposite gives off lots of positive
ions which make us feel tired stressed
agitated himalayan salt is one of the
Earth's riches substances Zen Q
harnesses less to bring the benefits of
the outdoors to you it chemically and
physically transforms a room of his
unique healing effects Zen cube is
designed to admit negative ions which
cleans and deodorizes the air reducing
allergies coughing reduces radiation and
neutralizes electromagnetic waves
emitted by technology it's also reduces
static in the air increases in energy
levels improves mood and concentration
creases blood and oxygen supply to the
brain resulting in better sleep patterns
Himalayan salt lamps are not new they
traditionally come with their own
problems it often melt your hot to the
touch usable on electricity it can be
messy not to mention they don't always
look the best Zen cube stays cool does
not melt his long lasting not to mention
its style we wanted it to look stunning
the head you've inspired relaxation a
sense of Zen the shape had to be
original I had to be big enough to exude
the right amount of goodness remind a
single block of pink salt crystal all
the way from the Himalayan mountains
wien case it no robust and sleek outer
shell we fitted it with an RGB LED light
source to have the perfect glow with
amazing efficiency the RGB bulb is
controlled by a nap turn it on or off
change the color or intensity while
setting comfortably on your couch nature
isn't just about the way it looks but
how it feels and smells we also fit it
in an essential oil compartment so you
can smell a pleasant fragrance every day
looks and functionality weren't enough
materials had to be top notch as well
the plastic is made of premium
polycarbonate and robust buta thing so
it'll last an even the toughest
conditions
the salt exposed on each side is made
from the best and pure Himalayan crystal
we wanted everyone to have the ability
to add a personal touch so starting from
day one you can choose the color to
match your room we've put our heart and
soul into bringing you the Zen cube to
be able to produce it and make it
available we need your support together
we can make this happen make this your
next lamp the meathead is an open source
khwaja pad robot kit that allows almost
anyone to get started in mobile robotics
and reasonable price we have designed
the meathead from the ground up to be as
affordable and easy as simple as
possible the meathead project was
started in early 2015 as a way to give
back to the open-source Hardware
community after more than a year of
building and selling partial kits that
include only the wood pieces servos and
fasteners needed to assemble the main
structure than ebay the next logical
step was to create a complete kit that
included everything needed to build a
fully functioning walking robot this kit
includes the high quality laser-cut
parts and arduino compatible controller
furloughs and infrared remote ultrasonic
range sensor and the necessary fasteners
to assemble your very own head robot we
have completed the necessary design
revisions created our own custom printed
circuit board and partnered with a
number of suppliers to source they
required components to build the
kits when most walking robots on the
market easily costs upwards of two
hundred dollars or more our goal is to
bring a complete high quality meat head
kit to market for less than one hundred
dollars we need your help to raise
enough funds in order to source parts in
large enough quantities to achieve our
goal of a truly low-cost walking robot
please help us by backing the meathead
kickstarter project today thank you
but what if there is a safer way what if
we can help change this for you and your
loved one introducing shark a wireless
charger that puts road safety first
shark is a new breed of car charger
designed to minimize distractions and to
encourage safe driving habits every
feature that exists is for the purpose
of keeping drivers focused on the road
hi I'm ray I spent the past 10 years
inventing and creating car accessories
every year millions of car accident
happened because of distracted driver
using mobile phone this has become a
serious problem around the world I want
to feel a product that can change that
wireless charging works when the
charging station creates a magnetic
field the magnetic field charges the
battery by induction it is simple and
there is no need to connect any cable
but shark is more than that shark comes
with a patented pocket phone holder that
grips the phone tightly under any
driving English inside the pocket we put
three large charging coils enough to
cover the charging surface of any
smartphone even the big ones this
ensures we can charge any phone in any
car anywhere simply put the phone in the
pocket the phone is secured and charging
the whole process takes less than two
seconds this allows you to keep your
full attention on the road nothing is
more distracting to the human eyes than
a mobile phone placed right in your face
as a crime safety feature shark is
purposely designed to be placed out of
sight from drivers a goal is to remove
distractions from cellphones while
discouraging the temptation to actively
use them
when your phone is placed out of sight
you are less likely to be affected by
any audio visual or manual distractions
while driving distracted driving for
mobile phones is a paramount issue
affecting all of us we took on a
responsibility a responsibility to
encourage safe driving together we can
make a role saver Kickstarter's please
support us be part of the team today
