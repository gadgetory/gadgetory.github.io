the first scanner came into the world in
1984 since then the scanning technology
updates very slowly in a highly
developed smart office today people
still have to use the traditional
scanner which is not user friendly or
efficient enough we want to make a
change this is the Caesar scanner a
redefined smart office equipment latest
ask able to store data in the cloud and
it can easily scan books to improve the
scanning speed to less than 1.5 seconds
per page Caesar innovatively uses the
CMOS scanning technology and equipped
with 32-bit mi PS CPU to transfer the
information easily and omit the
complicated procedures of installing
driver Caesar cloud enables automatic
cloud processing and storage to achieve
the goal of scanning bounded books
teaser is equipped with the advanced
smart algorithms which can flatten curve
remove fingerprints purify background
and split pages automatically in
addition with sony HD camera Cesar can
guarantee the high quality of scanning
with embedded OCR function Cesar can

sleep it's one of the most important
things to our lives a lot of wearables
track sleep but tracking sleep doesn't
necessarily mean improved sleep but what
if we could change that what if we could
create a wearable which not only track
your sleep but improved you asleep at
the same time at them we're doing just
that and we want to work with you the
Kickstarter community to bring this
project to life we sleep for one third
of our lives but it affects us around
the clock the benefit of falling asleep
faster is that you can get more out of
every day I think the most exciting
thing is that we can change people's
lives them helps you to fall asleep
quicker and this will ultimately to more
sleep across the knife the development
of film is really based on a lot of
excellent university research that has
shown a better way of improving sleep
but for the first time now them allows
this to be translated into the home
environment start by placing stem on any
of your fingers before you go to bed
phim will then accurately determine when
you fall asleep to the nearest minute
the algorithm then implements a
retraining program to allow people to
fall asleep more quickly that has been
used by researchers for the last 10
years this is a simple behavioral
approach to improve your sleep but for
the first time then allows this to be
carried out in your own home this is a
way to teach people to sleep better and
from our own research we know that it
works them is about more than helping
you to get played cricket Tim can also
help you take the pathetic power nap
research from NASA down the bay
astronauts from thirty-four percent
better having taken power nap
the secret to a perfect power nap
sleeping for exactly 10 minutes five
minutes won't do much for you and
sleeping for 20 minutes will leave you
feeling groggy once you wake up the
incredible accuracy of thim of knowing
when you fall asleep to the minute
allows you to take the perfect hour nap
for the first time them also collects
your sleep data and provide you're
asleep school so that over time you can
see how your sleep is improving garrett
dammit we've been heads down building
for some time we're a team of
researchers designers and engineers we
collectively have built products that
people around the world use and love our
most recent invention was the retailer
which received worldwide acclaim at them
we've reinvented the wearable for fleet
our research is based on a peer-review
evidence-based this is more than a step
forward this is a quantum leap for how
we use sleep technologies we wanted our
design to represent the ability to
disconnect and dream we wanted to
engineer something that you forgot
you're wearing we've done just that
fitting the components into such a small
and light package has been a challenge
we've gone through hundreds of iteration
we've given our 3d printer a serious
workout with every iteration we've
learned something new and it's
definitely improved our design the
journey so far has been thoroughly
rewarding I'm really looking forward to
seeing ones become
