so we don't map so we made this
the Micra wallet was conceived as a
joint appreciation of minimalist design
as we grew frustrated with traditional
leather wallets only lasting several
months instead of several years as
designers we knew we could do better we
set ourselves a pretty challenging brief
to design a minimalist wallet that was
not only aesthetically beautiful but
functionally superior to anything else
on the market our years of industry
experience enabled us to quickly
evaluate our designs taking them from
initial concept through to sourcing
manufacturing partners mass production
our use of PVD coating would rival most
high-end watches this provides an
extremely high scratch resistant finish
we had concerns about our product
strengths so we decided to test it ready
we fitted our wallet with a low-friction
TPU strap this prevents it from sticking
to your clothes
holding audio cards securely you no
longer have to remove them to make a
payment one of our proudest achievements
is full functionality of a regular
wallet without the bulk believe it or
not we've even managed to find space for
your change
Oh
I'm Ju and I launched the slimming
wallet in 2003 as a slim wallet
alternative and this was well before the
advent of smartphones and apps that
could otherwise store those things that
you would carry in your wallet but I
just never could understand why people
would carry a big fat billfold or trifle
starts with a well-intentioned wallet
that is designed slim but I also think
that it's a bit of a philosophy Park is
is long work expanse was to fill the
time available for its completion in a
wallet is a lot like your life give it
an inch it'll take a mile before you
know it the clutter is so great you
can't imagine the hassle of cleaning it
out so what does that say about your
life the great philosopher Seneca was
right it's not that we have a short time
to live but that we waste a lot of it
well it all has to do with what we feel
that timely and with more of our work
being done on screen it's easy to get
distracted and to squander what would
otherwise be precious free time so if
we're not careful life like a wallet
will fill up with things that are not
all that rewarding or pleasurable slim
wallets are supposed to be simple in
form and function and we only make one
kind of wallet slim slim II is available
in two different carry options the first
is the original slimming design which
has three pockets the second is the
excellent which is one pocket and two
slots slimming is also available in two
different sizes the slow a1 and the
salami - the salami one is made for
people who like to carry a little less
cash and want a smaller footprint in the
front pocket the second is a little bit
larger to accommodate more cash and
larger banknotes like the euro and the
Japanese yen the slimming one is also
available with a window for fast ID
access and enjoy RFID shielding and the
slimmest most minimal front pocket carry
on earth we don't offer any bans or
straps that go around our wallets but we
do offer something called the Bansal so
the band slimmy is for people who hate
wallets it's a thin piece of leather
with a nylon lining and RFID shielding
it's a slim and minimal as it gets I
think that the wallet that you carry is
mirror of your life both will get very
cluttered if you're not careful and
choose wisely so beware of big bullets
that have a lot of extra room because
you'll be setting yourself up it's one
consciously cramming it for digitize as
much as possible in smartphone apps so
you don't have to overstuff your wallet
and take a precious front pocket cargo
space start slim and compact and slim
and compact so the semi isn't the
slimmest way to carry things in your
front pocket I mean you could use a
rubber bag oh my god there's more room
for that huh so for over a decade now
we've worked with a fourth-generation
manufacturer who's been in business
since 1970 and we look forward to
partnering with this manufacturer who
has a high expectation of quality and
craftsmanship to redesign the slimmy
from ground up so Kickstarter helped me
bring this project to life thank you hey
man I found your carry-on luggage I
think you need wheels on your wallet bro
didn't your mom tell you not to trust
any wallet maker that does not provide a
thickness for your wallets so fat</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
