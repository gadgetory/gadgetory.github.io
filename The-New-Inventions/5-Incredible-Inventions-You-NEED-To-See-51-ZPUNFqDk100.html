we have to measure the contours of an
organic surface turns out that's a very
hard problem the only available solution
cost twenty thousand dollars and that
that's ridiculous so we set out to build
our own we looked at what was available
out there at the intersection of
computer vision and surface measurement
and we couldn't find a single solution
that was compelling the 3d scanners ever
precise cost tens of thousands of
dollars and the ones that are affordable
one precise well today that changes
we're only just beginning to explore the
possibilities of capturing the world in
3d 3d printing is an amazing tool it
converts a digital file into a physical
object some call it and industrial
revolution the ER 3d scanner does the
exact opposite of 3d print it lets
artists makers and designers capture
objects and surfaces and turn them into
high quality 3d models and use them as
part of the creative process we knew we
had to use a smartphone mobile phones
are simply amazing we use them to take
pictures edit videos update social media
even for gaming the Euro 3d scanner is
powered entirely by your smartphone
using it as easy just open the app and
press again it'll automatically adjust
focus and exposure and drive a green
laser to scan your object as it sweeps
we take over 1,000 photos and analyze
them in real time to give you a 3d model
a typical scan takes three to five
minutes and gives you a full color mesh
with up to 8 million points with a range
of one meter you can capture objects big
as well accurate to less than 100
microns that's the thickness of a single
sheet of paper when engineering the
scanner we had one objective in mind
precision all that's possible thanks to
a design that's both beautiful and
machined from a solid block of aluminium
with over 35 million operations we've
decided to be both robust and precise
the light ring gives you quick visual
feedback and the adjustable knob lets
you secure any model smartphone the
green laser let's just scan in any
lighting conditions as most cameras are
twice as sensitive to green than any
other color for water type models we
also design a Bluetooth turntable it
will sync to your scanner and rotate
your object to make sure you get every
angle we meticulously design every
aspect of the hardware and they've
tested seven different prototypes we've
put together a great team and we've
lined up several manufacturers now we
need you to help us put this together
