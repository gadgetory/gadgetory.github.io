car chargers the x5 charges up to five
devices twice as fast as regular
chargers the two front ports use
something called intelligent recognition
to read your devices in charge
accordingly sending out up to 2.4 amps
they power devices almost twice as fast
as your average wall charger with a 5
foot cable the x5 easily extends to the
back seat providing a steady stream of 2
amps to each of the three back ports
that's enough power to charge a phone
tablet and handheld gaming device all at
the same time with the x5 charger
everyone can claim a port and get a full
battery fast if you're more of a solo
driver Rapid X also makes the x1 with a
single lightning connector that charges
an Apple device at twice the speed
whether you need to charge a single
device or a whole group Rapid X gets the
job done fast this is Beatrice Beatrix

have you ever wished your toothbrush
could double as a facial massage of
course you haven't
but this toothbrush does that and more
but before we tell you about our
world-class features and the health
benefits of our three deep toothbrush
we'd love to share our story in the
words of our Creator who has 20 years of
experience in product design and
manufacturing six years ago and my kid
got a tooth problem the dentist asked my
kid to use a better toothbrush so I
searched the electric toothbrush market
after I tried a few high-end new
products I still knew none of them were
good enough for my kid
it took five years of dental research
user studies and product designing
finally I invented more effective
technology in oscillating rotating and
sonic for our electric toothbrush and
the users loved it then my wife had to
ask you love our kid enough to make her
a new product how about me it was a news
flash to me I could add two options for
women's facial care the three deep
toothbrush uses sonic circular
vibrations to thoroughly buff your teeth
it's far more effective than any other
toothbrush on the market at removing
plaque and it even forces toothpaste
between your teeth in a world where the
majority of cavities are caused by poor
brushing you need this kind of precision
in a toothbrush and as a bonus the two
additional heads for the three deep are
great for facial cleansing and massage
this multifaceted tool comes with three
toothbrush heads so it's a perfect gift
for the whole family and there's no need
for batteries you can recharge it over
and over now of course three deep can't
happen without your support we need you
to back our campaign today so we can
better spread the work and produce the
first run of our product so take control
