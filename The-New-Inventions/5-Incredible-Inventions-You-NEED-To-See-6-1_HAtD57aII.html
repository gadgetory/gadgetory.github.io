made was to build a platform that could
carry more gear over more challenging
terrain while maintaining a lightweight
and sturdy frame now this platform has
space for a huge 140 litre travel bag or
for your expedition backpack while only
requiring your body to bear half the
weight of the load so just for
comparison most large expedition packs
are around 70 liters that's almost twice
the amount of space of a standard 70
liter expedition pack the specially
designed pack belt latch is made of
stainless steel can be placed on six
different positions this opens up a
world of possibility for you to use it
as a flat deck or with a rigid box for
example for first aid equipment or
disaster aid services due to the smart Z
shaped geometry the trailer is well
balanced your hands can actually rest on
the handles or on flat terrain you can
even get away with not using the handles
at all the handlebars are made of an
aircraft grade aluminum that are wrapped
with a fabric bar tape to provide a nice
good grip and a comfortable feeling high
quality quick-release snap hooks connect
you to the mono Walker platform from
your hip belt this provides ample range
of motion so that your movement is not
restricted when pulling the mono Walker
the great thing about the mono Walker is
that you can traverse both uphill and
downhill routes with relative ease
thanks to the disc brake system I've
traversed with the fat mate uphill
almost 1,700 meters in elevation in one
trip and I can tell you that there is
nothing quite like being able to take a
break simply walking uphill by
activating the dispray system and
resting on the fat mate this is
something you can't do if you're wearing
a large expedition pack where you're
required to constantly take it off and
put it back on as you slowly meander up
the hill and then same way when you're
going downhill you can use the disc
brake to add resistance to slow your
descent with the 20 by 4 inch fat tires
you can pretty much cross any terrain
and it will roll over any obstacle the
width of this tire adds great traction
and will increase the flotation over mud
and snow now although I've never had to
convert the mono Walker into a pack
frame even though I've taken on some
pretty treacherous terrain
it can actually be converted into a pack
frame if you were going up some really
steep slopes or if you encountered a
major obstacle that you just couldn't
roll
with minimal effort you can attach the
model Walker harness in the mainframe in
just a couple minutes in this
configuration the majority of the load
is still supported by the hip belt and
this will allow you to carry large loads
over difficult terrain so who is the
model Walker made for well it's made for
hikers who appreciate adventures in
nature and don't want to hike with that
heavy weight on their shoulders climbers
who want to bring large amounts of
equipment to a base camp before an
expedition may be photographers who want
to carry heavy gear and outdoor
equipment over challenging terrain
perhaps parents who want to camp with
their kids in the back country but have
too much to carry for 2 to 4 people also
people with handicaps that can't carry
much weight on their back
youth group leaders of the like who need
to carry personal items plus group
equipment disaster control personnel who
need to carry heavy equipment or
first-aid supplies on trails where
vehicles are of no practical use trail
maintenance groups that carry heavy
construction gear scientists who need to
go deep into nature and carry heavy
equipment on narrow trails hunters who
need to pull animals out of the woods
bush walkers who just want to do an
unsupported long-distance walk carrying
water and food for many days on end
survivalist Preppers anybody who is
interested in bugging out into the
backcountry fishermen who are going
fishing in remote areas the list goes on
so to kick off the production of the
brand-new mono Walker that made we're
asking for your support with your
pre-order and support we can produce 120
of these trailers within 10 weeks and
our suppliers are ready to go it would
be a pleasure for us to help you enjoy
your next hike in adventure with more
comfort and more gear so we truly hope
that the mono Walker fad mate will
become an indispensable tool for your
future adventures thank you for watching
and supporting our campaign that's Neal
Carter James and that's Neal Parmenter
they're the founders of our ridging
paddle boards
they started origin because they knew
they could make a better inflatable
paperboard one that was much lighter
stronger more beautiful and more
environmentally sound than every other
inflatable board coming out of the same
hand for the factories in asia their
goal was to make the best inflatable
paddle board in the world regardless of
caste and then making a pricing work and
they did they built boards in the UK
using cutting-edge technology they
tested them to the extreme in situations
you'd never imagine an inflatable paddle
board will be useful in places you would
hope you'd never find yourself paddling
and on adventures only crazy people
would go on like a seven-day
circumnavigation in Martinique a feat
that had never been achieved before they
even exploded their boards just to find
out how much pressure they take if
you're wondering the answer was a lot
but driven by a passion for perfection
exacting standards and an eye for
classic design they knew they could do
better make the best inflatable paddle
board in the world even better so not
being guys who are happy to rest on
their laurels
they've taken production in-house by
doing this they can work on concepts
design R&amp;amp;D and production all in under
one month when every other paddle board
company out there has a 12 to 18 months
developing production lead time their
ideas today can be in your hands
tomorrow they've added a natural court
deck pad just one of the tech
advancements developed in-house in
lab which is rollable comfortable to
stand on sit on lie on and perfect for
yoga not to mention stunningly ascetic
and with every board they sell they make
a donation that provides clean water for
a child in Mozambique a product this
beautiful takes time to make especially
as every board is lovingly handcrafted
in their manufacturing facility it's
wizard as the world around us becomes
more connected and convenient it's time

that our timing is right and that the
market is ready for the next generation
real estate lockbox a tour we know
everyone has a role to play in this
process and our job is not to change the
people but to change the process
we at speedmaster want to present to you
the first affordable racing seat with
motion technology speed master s motion
receives the signal of the game directly
from the pc and forwards it
realistically through a box to two
high-performance screens while the seat
is moved in every possible direction due
to the movement we simulate with s
motion all feedback effects happening
directly in the car can be adopted
accelerating braking I realize that the
car drives through a curve because I
feel g-forces pulling me to the side in
the same way I realize I am having a
collision because it makes the whole
seat shake of course due to motion
simulation stronger forces have an
effect on the seat and therefore we
designed and enhance steel pipe
construction which is to resist these
forces in order to guarantee long
lasting gaming fun
even most simulators could not convince
us and were at the same time
unaffordable a certain minimum number
has to be ordered in order for us to be
able to offer this optically and
ergonomically optimised model
additionally with integrated motion unit
only through this we are able to realize
the especially interesting prize to all
those for whom speed master s motion is
too expensive or who do not have a PC we
offer speed master s or speed master
flight
