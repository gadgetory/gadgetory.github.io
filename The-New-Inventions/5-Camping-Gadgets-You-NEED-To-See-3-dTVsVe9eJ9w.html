energy lies around you in a forest in
the woods and all the waste you can find
do you ever wish you could use the
energy instead of carrying uncomfortable
gas tanks or find ignite a bonfire
there's definitely charming but there's
also smoky and dangerous now you can
stop dreaming about it because we made
it real in Keystone wild is a
revolutionary camp stove which could run
with any kind of dry biomass all you
need is some branches small battery or
even a solar panel what makes all the
magic possible is a well-known
technology named pyrolysis but unlike
traditional pyrolytic stoves we found a
way to make the process simple stable
smoke-free and totally also take a
traditional fire it burns strongly but
it wastes a lot of energy and smoke
while smoke itself has a lot of energy
what we do is transform all the biomass
into energy this way you get a clean and
reliable flame wherever you want and for
free yes free energy I'm talking about a
powerful and professional flame you can
use to cook for real and grill as a pro
do you know which is the best part of
all this
using your stove you're not only saving
the environment all the waste produced
by the gas tanks or the production of
charcoal you're also avoiding the
production of any pollution responsible
for the greenhouse effect the wait
there's more
what remains inside your stove when the
fire is gone is a wonderful biochar an
incredible active charcoal that makes
the ground better and more fertile we
designed our stove to be the best
companion of your outdoor adventure it
is minimal this compact and all the
design features are strictly linked to
its operation we made it in two sizes to
let you choose between portability and
personal use or base camp and a lot of
power everything is made in Italy using
the best materials to create a product
that is really gonna last forever an
Keystone wild has been made to let you
live your adventures with a deeper
contact with nature
environment is our greatest treasure and
taking care of it is no longer a
privilege or an important duty with Anki
stole wild you can do your part in
saving our planet by taking no
compromises

hi I'm Jason creator of the go hammock
that was recently funded on Kickstarter
all rewards have been fulfilled and
we've been getting lots of positive
feedback it's great to see how much our
backers are enjoying their hammocks many
of you have requested us to design a
hammock camping tarp we listened and
here's what we came up with it's called
the apex can be shelter the apex is a
versatile high-quality weather shelter
that will protect you and your gear from
rain wind Sun and even snow I designed
this tarp especially for the go hammock
but it can be used with virtually any
camping hammock on the market it also
makes a great all-purpose camping tarp
or shade canopy even when you're not
using a hammock set up as simple with
the included guy ropes and stakes the
apex can be pitched in countless
configurations to adjust to changing
weather conditions here are just a few
of the many setup modes that can be used
with the apex camping shelter
with 22 out loops the only limitation of
configurations is your imagination the
apex is made from high-strength 70d
polyester fabric with a durable
polyurethane coating we'll need your
help to bring the apex camping shelter
into production if we can mass-produce
it
we'll be able to pass the savings on to
you and offer it at an amazing price do
you see the tent over there it's a
channel 10 it's really easy you just
make and it's done
hi I'm Garrett and this is Jurgen we
love spending time in the nature with
our friends and families and we used to
get angry about complicated ends web
construction missing parts you know what
I mean and then we decided to start
channel 10
it's not two years since we started work
on developing our air tents we wanted to
design a new tent one without poles and
small confusing pieces our vision to
create a tent which is absolutely stable
one which can even erect itself since
then we've been working on our mission
to make camping easier our air tents are
available in three different sizes the
gentle tent excess and extremely smart
two-person tent a perfect introduction
to the world of easy camping if you
prefer more room that gentle tent S has
a very secure sleeping bow and any car
can be attached to the tent but the
absolute head is our classic no other
tent is as versatile as a morning
community tent or for sleeping this is
camping luxury and we love it now is the
time with your support we will be able
to bring our travel dance to the mark
you have the chance to support change
attempt and make camping much easier how
does it work we show you come along
camping is relaxing it's about enjoying
nature and having a good time with
family and friends gentle tents make
camping even better our tent can be
erected in less than a minute and taking
it down is even faster maximum comfort
means putting up a tent at the push of a
button you can also replace the hand
pump with an electric pump
our secret the extremely robust pipe
system a completely gas tight inner pipe
is filled with air that's how the gentle
temp gets its stable windproof shape
high quality rafting valves provide the
necessary safety over pressurizing is
prevented by a special overload pressure
valve gentle tents have fewer parts than
normal tents for a fewer templates and
guy ropes that's how we save weight
despite this lightness a gentle temp can
withstand the strongest squall or heavy
rain quality is very important to us our
tent walls are extremely hard wearing
but they breathe well too we source our
materials from leading international
manufacturers the high quality
components and generous air openings
provide an excellent indoor tent climate
cleaning and repairing the tent is very
simple and you'll find this easy to do
yourself but if you don't want to of
course we'll be very happy to help you
it's pleasingly easy to hook the air
tent attachment to a car creating a
symbiosis of tent and car by the way all
gentle tents fit onto all types of
vehicles no matter the size of your car
the interior space of a gentle tent is
really quite impressive but when the
tent is deflated all that remains is a
small package do what you like take it
on holiday or put it in the pannier of
your motorbiking if you don't want to do
without your smartphone or laptop on
holiday you can equip your gentle tent
with a gentle tent power pack and charge
it with solar power as you can see we
invested a lot of time and energy into
our project with gentle tent camping
will become easier more comfortable and
better than ever before be a perfect
gentle tenant and helped us to achieve
our goal gentle tape makes camping
easier</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
