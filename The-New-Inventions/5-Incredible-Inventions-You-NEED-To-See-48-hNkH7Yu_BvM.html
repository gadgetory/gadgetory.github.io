project shadow is bringing back the
ultimate outerwear to Kickstarter this
time we redesigned and took our wind
breaker to the next level for people
with innovative minds we needed a jacket
that was super lightweight and
weatherproof yet keeps you dry with
maximum visibility for safety this
jacket is packed and ready for any
occasion and has a fashion-forward
design for the urban outdoors we call it
the ultimate lumen jet these
weatherproof high visibility jackets are
specially designed for travelers
commuters or anyone who wants to make
their travel beyond ordinary based on
the feedback from our backers we
designed our lumen jacket to provide
maximum visibility in low light
condition to keep commuters safe we've
made upgrades to existing features such
as adding mesh-lined vents on the chest
and back for maximum airflow an
invisible back pocket with a larger
eight and a half inch opening on side
seam to keep your essentials
an elastic cuff and hem band for more
comfort and flexibility a larger hood to
give you extra coverage and harsher
weather in front pockets that are
finished with water-resistant zippers to
keep your belongings dry we've made
multiple prototypes tested materials
improve the fit and explore any aspect
it creates the ultimate lumen jacket
packed with new features the ultimate
lumen jacket gives you total control
with an added earphone outlet inside the
left chest you can now listen to music
with the earphones locked in place we've
also added a detachable patch with
magnets can easily hold your earphones
we came up with three jackets that will
fit any need first the ghost made with a
special fabric that absorbs the light
and glows in dark
second the Olympian made with flash
reflective fabric so you will always be
seen in the city streets third the
shadow made from fully water repellent
materials to always keep you dry in the
harshest conditions we wanted to create
a jacket that was practical and
functional to make it accessible to
everyone at an affordable price to do
that we are skipping the middleman and
offering it to you our backers
