for the past 30 years this doesn't work
great in every situation and our
computers don't look like this anymore
or this they look like this or even this
a keyboard and mouse don't make sense
anymore it's time to get your hands
dirty with jest just lets you control
your computer with your hands for
example Photoshop adjust the contrast
look a little less ok now the brightness
yep perfect save that let's take this a
little further add a logo bring it down
lower little to the right great if you
have two of them you can even type
we take the raw data from every
accelerometer gyroscope and magnetometer
and pass it through advanced motion
processing it sometimes your friends can
get annoying quick hand gesture takes
care of that just connects to your iOS
or Android device so you can connect to
almost anything like your lights and
your music
what if you could turn back time and
relive the best memories of your life
like see your daughter's first steps
again watch your son's first base ball
hit again or simply experience the best
family vacation you've ever had again
meet teleport an entirely new way to
capture and relive the best memories of
your life through the power of virtual
reality technology to capture those
special moments simply plug the teleport
camera in your phone and start shooting
instantly it's that easy teleport camera
has two lenses that work the same way
our eyes see the world it captures
everything you see in 3d
to relive those memories you've captured
simply put the teleport headset on
you'll feel as though you're actually
there and experience those unforgettable
living memories again
so clearly and the same emotions you
felt in the past are felt again
memory is one of the most beautiful
creations in life it's one of those thin
string that hold you and the people you
love together through the good and the
bad times save your best memories
treasure and relive them
project shadow is bringing back the
ultimate outerwear to Kickstarter this
time we redesigned and took our wind
breaker to the next level for people
with innovative minds we needed a jacket
that was super lightweight and
weatherproof yet keeps you dry with
maximum visibility for safety this
jacket is packed and ready for any
occasion and has a fashion-forward
design for the urban outdoors we call it
the ultimate lumen jet these
weatherproof high visibility jackets are
specially designed for travelers
commuters or anyone who wants to make
their travel beyond ordinary based on
the feedback from our backers we
designed our lumen jacket to provide
maximum visibility in low light
condition to keep commuters safe we've
made upgrades to existing features such
as adding mesh-lined vents on the chest
and back for maximum airflow an
invisible back pocket with a larger
eight and a half inch opening on side
seam to keep your essentials
an elastic cuff and hem band for more
comfort and flexibility a larger hood to
give you extra coverage and harsher
weather in front pockets that are
finished with water-resistant zippers to
keep your belongings dry we've made
multiple prototypes tested materials
improve the fit and explore any aspect
it creates the ultimate lumen jacket
packed with new features the ultimate
lumen jacket gives you total control
with an added earphone outlet inside the
left chest you can now listen to music
with the earphones locked in place we've
also added a detachable patch with
magnets can easily hold your earphones
we came up with three jackets that will
fit any need first the ghost made with a
special fabric that absorbs the light
and glows in dark
second the Olympian made with flash
reflective fabric so you will always be
seen in the city streets third the
shadow made from fully water repellent
materials to always keep you dry in the
harshest conditions we wanted to create
a jacket that was practical and
functional to make it accessible to
everyone at an affordable price to do
that we are skipping the middleman and
offering it to you our backers
whether you wear it on your weekend trip
on your next camping expedition or just
on your regular commute the lumen jacket
is the most versatile jacket on the
market we need your help in making this
project become a reality so take your
