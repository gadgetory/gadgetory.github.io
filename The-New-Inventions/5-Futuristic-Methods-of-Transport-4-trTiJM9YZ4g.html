revolution and pre-order yours today to
add a next chapter in personal
transportation hi everyone it is our
pleasure to present the Adam fly we
started to design and create the Adam
fly a little bit more than a year and a
half ago our idea was to make the best
and the most durable hoverboard on the
market we have finally made a fully
functional prototype after many tests
with many different components and we
are ready to hit the market you can ride
your Adam over a variety of terrains
that come across your path ride down
streets and you'll feel like you're
surfing on waves in the ocean
Adam is made with an aluminum alloy
frame and you can even ride down stairs
without any problems feel the freedom of
movement at a top speed of 12 miles per
hour
Adam fly is water-resistant so if you
see a pile of water don't hesitate just
run over it we have created Adam to fit
everyone take your Adam on a rocky
surface or even on grass it is up to
your imagination
my will work for seven and a half miles
on a single charge so you can plan a
trip and go for a distance without a
problem we have tested Adam on different
obstacles and terrain you can easily
ride over bumps and go up hill or ride
down stairs like to change we wanted to
create a hoverboard that feels like a
skateboard or surf course it also works
as a transportation vehicle that takes
you wherever you want we're developing
an application that supports both iOS
and Android that will make it easy to
adjust the settings of your atom it will
also have an anti-theft function which
means your atom can only be started when
you turn off the anti-theft function on
your end the life of Adam quits at the
same time you switch the direction
you're going that means you will always
have a bright light on the front and a
red light on back no matter how many
times you turn around Adam is the
ultimate off-road all-terrain vehicle we
are ready for production and now we need
your help to get Adam fly to the market
two years ago I partnered with two guys
I met while teaching at Art Center
College of Design we started a company
to develop product solutions for growing
consumer market needs one area we
decided to focus on was personal
mobility and the growing trend for
consumers to find alternative forms of
clean energy transportations to you
although more more commuters are using
bicycles the challenge still is getting
that bicycle onto a bus or a train the
erbium is created to solve that problem
there are other personal electric
vehicles on the market but most of them
are too difficult to use too heavy too
bulky or more expensive Kirby is the
world's most compact personal vehicle it
can go 20 miles on a single charge as a
top speed of 15 miles an hour
fold small enough to fit between your
legs on a trainer bus was only 27 pounds
and when you're not riding it you can
pull it behind you like a piece of
luggage</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
