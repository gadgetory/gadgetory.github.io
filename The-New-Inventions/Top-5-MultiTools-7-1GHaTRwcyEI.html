lawns Barbara and Tom Stokes
it's a hard-working multi-tool with
dozens of everyday uses the adjustable
wrench opens to a half-inch for light
repair and assembly jobs a high-carbon
two inch stainless steel blade can be
opened and closed easily using the blade
slot the removable bit carrier is a high
intensity LED light and has two locator
posts and strong magnets can hold it
securely to the gup-e side the removable
bit and driver are held securely in
place in the tail of the body the
stainless steel clip will hold the guffy
in your pocket or gear and can also be
used as a money clip the carabiner
detent bullets and bottle caps and metal
jar lids the gup-e is a versatile
multi-tool that is a convenient carry
option for a variety of everyday tasks
for those who respond when a life is on
the line Leatherman is proud to
introduce the revolutionary Raptor
medical shears for military and civilian
emergency medical responders the Raptor
medical shears is a high quality
state-of-the-art replacement for
traditional disposable shears and in
true Leatherman fashion it incorporates
a number of other tools specifically for
first responders it comes with a strap
cutter it also has a slot for open in
the o2 tanks and as an innovative easy
to use ring cutter doesn't have the
twisting all you have to do is clip it
in cuts right through rings
there it also has the black breaker on a
Kindle
the team at Leatherman worked closely
with Special Operations medics
firefighters and PMT personnel to find
out what these professionals wanted in
Leatherman designs shears with that
feedback the engineers designed a high
performance tool built to withstand the
rigors of daily use when a medic is on
site the situation is already bad so you
don't want to make it worse by having a
cheeps here that's going to fail and
break when you use it that's why that
have been designed to make the Raptor to
give the quality of a product that's
going to work every time
for a lifetime of use it's got a lot of
meat to it if it feels durable I don't
have any worries about it breaking for
becoming dull if it worked through a lot
of that we put it through the testing
out here
what nice absolutely love it it does the
function of about five tools and one and
does each one of those jobs so well it's
truly an amazing tool a lot of my guys
at the fire station we're impressed with
this tool size instead of carrying many
tools we just have to carry this one
tool built with the superior 420hc
stainless steel the serrated raptor
shears will make quick work of various
materials and medical supply and they
can be taken apart easily for thorough
cleaning a lanyard attachment gives you
a third carry option and the zytle
handles not only provide extra grip when
wet but allow for comfortable use in hot
or cold environments
another advantage of the Leatherman
wrapper is you can make it compact by
simply pushing the two button rotating
the handles down you can make it half
size even with the wrapper closed we
still have access to the strap cutter
the oxygen wrench the carbide glass
break and the lanyard attachment a lot
of times small pocket tools are not
easily accessible with firefighting
gloves this tool was easy to operate
with my expectation gloves my
firefighting gloves and my ems look once
you put the Raptor on your kit and just
describe how often you actually use it
it is active for all aspects of mission
forever and everyday use it as long
created with input from professionals in
the field and brought to life by the
multi-function experts at Leatherman so
Raptor is built for the most demanding
conditions when every second counts the
Hammerhead 4 volt rechargeable
screwdriver is kind of like the Swiss
Army knife of screwdrivers sure you can
zip in or remove a screw with ease but
you can also light an area strip and
Bend wire and detect a live circuit all
in the palm of your hand the Hammerhead
4 volt rechargeable screwdriver as a
forward reverse ring that activates with
a simple twist once activated the LED
lights turn on illuminating your work
when not in use
the spindle locks and can be used like a
manual screwdriver a circuit sensor is
located at the front of the tool press
the voltage detection button and place
the sensor within 1 inch of a switch
outlet cord or fixture to see if it is
live a light and a buzzer will let you
know if electricity is present an
integrated wire stripper makes short
work of taking off an insulation sleeve
and wires can be bent using the bending
slot on top take the guesswork out of
any electrical project and use a
rechargeable screwdriver that just does
more
