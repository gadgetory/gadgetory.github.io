mirrors calm Hollywood California the
place where dreams are made it's here
that we started urban fiction and
created our first product Triton fin the
fully loaded compact anywhere gym with a
hectic life let's tell you how this all
got started we really wanted to get
healthier but we didn't always have time
to get to the gym so we thought wouldn't
it be great to have one piece of
equipment that could work out the entire
body anywhere anytime with no
restrictions yeah let's make it for one
year three months in two weeks we did
nothing but eat sweat and dream about
how to build the most compact workout
system to work out the entire body
anywhere anytime we do sketches
prototype metals all plastics and
silicones covered with durometer men
tried different fabrics and resistance
bands ergonomics and come field-tested
with elite trainers met with
manufacturers to make the dream fitness
product we wanted we had to reinvent
every single thing
we developed Triton fit to be adjustable
with a one-size-fits-all design so that
anyone can get a custom workout they
want Triton fit can add up to six bands
in seconds increasing or decreasing
weight resistance and providing you with
an incredibly demanding work up by
quickly configuring the bar adjusting
the harness and deciding the number of
bands to use you can easily do hundreds
of exercises
what's awesome about tracking fit is our
patent-pending and innovative design
that eliminates the need to be tethered
to anything since Triton fit uses your
body as the anchor point it doesn't need
to be attached to anything else this
means that you can work out anywhere you
want the beach the park on top of a
mountain in your hotel room our unique
design doesn't just make Triton fit
portable it also makes using it twice as
effective because now your core is
always engaged the Triton fit system
utilizes the benefits of progressive
resistance the preferred training method
used by today's elite athletes I love
the fact that it utilizes the resistance
bands I'm a huge proponent for that all
the cells in your and your bicep we're
going to go ahead and activate as soon
as you activate that fan but also all
your core is going to fire too just to
compensate that movement so every
instance you move the band all that
energy has to come up through your core
your core is your body's center of power
and trainers will tell you that if you
want to supercharge your workout work
your core that was a little skeptical
didn't think that something so small
could actually work than five minutes I
was already feeling the burn my core was
activated I was very impressed with the
Triton fit what i like about try and fit
is how portable it is the mom having
kids I can't have a gym membership and
be gone all the time so to take this to
somewhere as simple as a park and be
able to get in a full body workout while
my kids play it's the most convenient
thing I love it try keep it you don't
need anything else we love Kickstarter
in its community because it helps people
live out their dreams and hopefully now
ours we created try to fit to solve a
problem in our hectic life and we know
if you back our campaign you'll be
contributing to your own lives too we
wanted the world to be healthier even if
it's only one person at a time we
started with this got to hear our next
goal is to get Triton fit into
production to do that we need your help
so please pledge now and get your fit
with Triton fan
it's time to get on tether</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
