vortex is a revolutionary product for
children it is a smart and responsive
robot that kids can play with and
program using the vortex and apps kids
can play different games learn about
robotics and even create their own
playing with vortex is incredibly fun
and easy thanks to its unified system
and intuitive app for example the
bumping fight is a sumo-style party game
suitable for multiple players the
computer inside vortex has sensors to
detect motions like hitting spinning or
being still vortex embraces new
technologies and allows users to
experience them the fugitive is a unique
game with augmented reality and motion
tracking technology children already
love playing with our vortex prototypes
and we can't wait for kids everywhere to
get their own vortex vortex is
compatible with both iOS and Android
devices and comes with an open SDK
anyone who wants to develop a game for
vortex is empowered to do so because
every vortex is a dev kit the only
limits your imagination vortexes app
allows kids to learn to program the
robots in a fun simple and educational
environment by abstracting complicated
actions and visualizing the process the
app teaches the basics of programming
without any coding or advanced skill
learning by doing has never been easier
just drag drop and hit upload that's
simple we wanted to make a great product
and to do it we gathered the best people
from industrial design user experience
hardware software and game development
for the past two years vortex has
undergone countless revisions and
improvements and we know that only
through this process can we create a
product that won't disappoint our future
inventors board size is built on Arduino
an open-source hardware platform it can
see and speak by using infrared
grayscale and sound speakers vortex can
find its way around obstacles detect
lines and report back to you
we've pre-installed the program and done
the assembling vortex is fun right out
of the box just open the app switch it
on and start exploring vortex is also
designed to be highly customizable with
colorful parts stickers and maps
we've come a long way in creating vortex
and now we need your help to make it
real thank you
hey
hey honey time to sleep the night to our
tix good night Julie
finding parking in the city can be hard
and we quarters only give you a few
minutes times can be tough add an
expensive parking ticket on top of that
and you're gonna have a bad day how
great would it be if our phones could
help us avoid things like this a where
car is a free app for iOS and Android
devices that makes your smartphone
contextually aware of your car all you
need is this device just put it in your
glove box and forget about it the
battery lasts more than a year you can
open apps as you approach drive and
leave the car when you approach your car
a where car will even show google maps
on the lock screen for single swipe
launch if you're in a hurry a where car
can easily find where you last part you
don't have to do anything it happens
automatically if you're parked in a
metered spot a where car automatically
asks you to enter the amount of time
that you paid for plus when you're too
far to walk back to your car before the
time is up they have to learn to
a ten dollar investment to avoid
expensive parking tickets makes a lot of
sense
you
the home of today populated with
multiple hubs and remotes you have
separate devices for security energy
management and media control each having
its own protocol this has ended up
creating a lot of clutter in our lives
fully functional maybe but then our our
homes truly automated and now presenting
be one the most advanced powerful and
intuitive smart home system that allows
total control of your security ambience
and entertainment from a single hub and
a single app be one has been designed by
a team of engineers with over a decade
of experience in the design and
implementation of advanced security
systems for banks and smart homes be one
supports extensive radio protocols
namely Wi-Fi vle z-wave zigbee GSM and
NFC truly a revolutionary product be one
is built from the ground up the circuit
board is a specifically designed for
layer board with ten processors be ones
parallel processing framework with hard
real-time performance for which we have
a patent pending makes this the world's
fastest and most efficient hub the
strategically placed 8th IR blasters at
either end of the product provides the
system with a 360-degree coverage
configuration via NFC makes adding
sensors and controls simple and instant
and the QI interface means that you can
charge your mobile devices wirelessly v1
saves you a lot of money or suppose your
wife goes out shopping when you're at
the office and coming home she finds
she's forgotten the door keys all she
has to do is ring the doorbell and you
get to see her right here on the app all
you have to do is just unlock the door
for her no hassles this is how simple be
one is and that's not even the best part
have you ever driven yourself crazy
trying to install a new system with be
one you can finally say goodbye to all
such problems it's so user-friendly the
b1 hub is configurable and usable by the
most tech challenged of us all with an
overall configuration time of a mere 60
seconds you can integrate and use all
your connected devices within minutes
it's perfect for outdoor situations when
your battery's dead or if you just can't
be bothered to get up simply nip into a
corner shop or pop out the batteries
from wherever and off you go we think
it's a great product and we're on
Kickstarter for your support it's a ramp
up production and get the nipride if
like us you need this then back us now
and be among the first to get the nipper
so you're never caught shorten an
emergency again
as a kid I remember sleeping over my
grandma's house almost every weekend the
distinct sights sounds and smells hold a
special memory in my heart
unfortunately one of those memories is
waking up on sunday mornings seen
grandma so all the pills you need to
take for the week this practice is the
case for many people of all ages who
rely on taking multiple medications to
stay healthy over the years I've noticed
it's become more difficult for grandma
to take her medications and keep track
of what pills she's taking so I decided
it was time to help I looked into buying
her some sort of product to help her
manage her medications but there weren't
any good ones out there be looked into a
visiting nurse service but we just
couldn't afford one after doing some
research I discovered that many people
of all backgrounds had similar issues I
want to create a universal solution to
help all these people I decided to wake
up the medical industry by using
innovative technology create the first
fully automated medication sorter and
dispenser for home use our team of
engineers designers and programs work
tirelessly to make luma safe easy use
and affordable we designed the device to
be used by anyone with any level of tech
savviness
adding a new medication is as easy as
selecting the medication you want to
take choosing the time you want to take
it and pouring in your pills for them
all luma does the rest when it's time to
take a pill gremo will be alerted on
luma or on our foam and luma will then
dispense the correct pill and dosage
grandma can even set up me so I'll
receive a text message if she missed
taking her medication on the companion
mobile application grandma or I can view
how well she stuck to our medication
regimen grandma can also choose to send
this information to other loved ones or
even her doctor so you can all make sure
that you staying out luma will also
notifier of any drug interactions
through our medications
the soundtrack to your water activities
has changed this is the oma plus the
optical musical object a bluetooth 3.0
that is waterproof and it floats
there's something about being in the
pool or even a hot tub that goes better
with music but our music today comes
from our phones and our phones don't mix
well with water but with the Omo plus
your music and swim designed to float on
the surface of the water and immersed up
to one meter the Alma plus connects to
any iOS or Android device for speakers
and two subwoofers fill the surrounding
area with high quality sound and best of
all you don't have to get out of the
water to skip to the next song the Omo
plus has a complete control interface
you can play pause and skip music even
turn the volume up or down right from
the pool but the Omo plus isn't just
about what you can hear it's also about
what you can see when the sun goes down
the building lighting takes your music
to the next level from above and below
the water the colourful illumination of
the Omo plus gives your nighttime swim
or pool party an exciting look meet a
charge when out of the water two USB
ports also provide easy access to add
power to your mobile devices the pmo
plus lights sound action
