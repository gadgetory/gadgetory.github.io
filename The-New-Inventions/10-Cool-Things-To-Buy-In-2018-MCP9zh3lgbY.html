at the world and how you're looking at
the world affects how you think about
the world traditional business tools
they get in the way of the thinking when
I started using paper for work it was a
feeling of liberation when I'm working
with clients they're seeing our entire
creative process as it evolves most
people if they haven't seen the app
before like what is that it's so cool
well I didn't even know you could do
that you can amend change alter your
ideas we can rearrange things take a
shape circle it and just push it show
relationships do diagrams to actually
see how things relate
I think paper is a very empowering tool
I think it makes me more creative
drawing things out helps you think
clearly that changes the game completely
nowadays sedentary lifestyles are
putting planet Earth's manhood in
serious danger if we continue down this
path man could ruin his most precious
gift the love muscle also known as the
pelvic floor the love muscle is located
at the lower opening of the pelvis it
not only affects prostate health but
also controls erection and ejaculation
so we brought the best scientists and
engineers together to tackle the problem
how to develop a stronger pelvic floor
for better men's health we found that
the pelvic floor is rarely engaged in
nearly every sport and some sports such
as biking can even have a negative
effect on your love life we conducted a
series of physical and mental tests to
collect detailed statistics about each
aspect of a man's life if you fail to
engage the love muscle in your daily
lifestyle it will get weak performing
more like a limp noodle with age
so we created a product that helps men
exercise the pelvic floor regularly as
part of their daily life introducing
Philip Swift the love muscle training
underwear for better men's health
we designed a six month daily training
program which includes professional
guidance and interactive visualization
sitting still for too long is the main
threats to men's health
vil of monitoring system will guide you
to complete quick easy exercises
throughout the day in short spurts black
motivation or discipline not a problem
as you progress you'll train with video
game challenges you'll be engaged and
entertained while optimizing your
manhood

muscle at peak performance get ready to
be surprised by your potential
in today's world we are surrounded by
the multiple electronic devices that we
need for everyday life we charge the
batteries at home and at work even when
we sleep the regular charger violently
continues to push the power into the
battery even when it is already full
keeping chargers plugged in when they're
not being used to consumes unnecessary
energy shortens battery life and
increases the risk of fire through
overeating luckily there's a solution
bright charger is a brand new invention
from Finland it's a beautifully designed
charger which saves energy and at the
same time it's most gentle for your
device's bright charger automatically
stops drawing power from the outlet when
the battery is charged after this it
functions as a soft LED light
at current rates the amount of mobile
devices worldwide will top 10 billion in
2017 what if we could just stop wasting
all this energy while we still can
besides wrecking nature this is wrecking
your own wallet as well batteries can
only be charged for a limited amount of
time before they become totally useless
why is this consider normal why spend
hundreds of dollars on your phone just
to buy a new one within a couple of
years we all know how unpredictable worn
out batteries can be especially at low
temperatures when you're just chilling
out in the wilderness right children

charged the way they were designed to no
more worrying about forgetting to above

the same time the life of a planet with
our normal charging habits switching to

amounts of energy worldwide and at the
