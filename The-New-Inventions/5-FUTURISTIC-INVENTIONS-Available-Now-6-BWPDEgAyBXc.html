jewelry wearables refusing an art
fashion and technology look see as
infinite possibilities for your style it
really allows you to take control over
your look and over your use of functions
so this is probably going to be one of
the first commercially available
flexible displays on the market and it's
always on it's a very thin very elegant
display that just flexes around your
wrist this is artwork this is now jewel
grace like this is now very very
different it's technology that is
empowering the fashion versus the design
that is elevating the technology it's a
complete shift in paradigm I mean you're
wearing an accessory why shouldn't it
look good many of the smartwatches are
pretty similar they're fairly small
displays normally off to save power I
said you know this this isn't enough the
filtering is essentially limitless you
decide what the selection criteria are
anything in your notification center on
your phone can be custom driven to your
bracelet with a glance of your wrist you
can basically see what appointments are
coming up or you can also look at the
way in which your information is
structured the convenience is really
amazing you can say I want messages from
my spouse I want my sister's Facebook
and anything with the keyword pizza you
can choose to only have tweets from this
person or text messages from that person
or emails from this other person appear
you can have a moving map so if you're
walking down the street you can see
where you are and where your destination
is time different watch faces QR codes
for paying for coffee or boarding your
flight and for example activity
monitoring showing how much you've
walked and how many calories you've used
everyone who sees the bracelet loves the
slideshow you can change the image
upload a picture write text you can take
a picture of the outfit that you're
wearing so you're matching that or if
you're walking to work take a picture of
this reach graffiti and there's
something about the quality of the
screen
the e-ink display it just has a hasn't
appeal to it that's kind of hard to put
your finger on if you look at where
fashion and tech are going the tech is
getting good enough and small enough
where it can basically be behind the
scenes and make it fashion or design
first your creative vision the aesthetic
vision is taking priority you take
control of your look with look see we've
got the engineering we've got the
designs and now we need your help to
make look see a reality please help us
Thanks
hi my name is Garrett I'm here to show
you something really cool
these are RGB LED shades they're just a
really fun piece of wearable technology
the pixel matrix on the front is very
colorful and bright from the outside but
you can easily see through it you can
wear these at concerts parties trade
shows maker fairs maybe you in the
grocery store if they're eg it's good
enough
doesn't really matter where you are but
these are the best conversation starter
ever it's impossible to ignore people
have to know what's going on they will
come up and talk to you but they're more
than just a blinky fashion accessory or
the ultimate icebreaker they're designed
to be easily reprogrammable unhackable
if you're new to embedded development
this is a fun place to start and if
you're an expert can't wait to see what
you'll do your design needs to be
Arduino compatible so all you'll need to
develop code is any computer with a USB
port and a free download of the hard
camino ide on the front we have 68
individually controllable pixels they
can display a wide range of colors and
animations and are really bright so
bright that we usually set them five
times dimmer than maximum just to keep
from blinding anybody nearby and save
some power on the side we have an
Arduino compatible controller programs
that control pixels are saved on the big
chip in the center and the buttons below
it control program settings you can use
your computer with the open-source
arduino ide to write code and upload it
to the USB port for hackers we have some
places to solder wires to external
sensors and signals
the frame itself is made entirely of
circuit boards including the hinges that
allow it to fold everything is made from
the same material it's produced in just
one manufacturing step the parts fit
together like a 3d puzzle and then
they're securely locked together with
screws since these are so bright you're
going to need a good power source we
like using these USB battery packs
they're really easy to recharge and
they'll last for two or three hours
simply plug in the USB cable and slip it
into a pocket at this point we've taken
the prototypes to a lot of events and we
got a huge positive response from
everybody who saw them in person so we
definitely want to keep improving the
design we want to get these out into the
hands of hobbyist programmers artists
and see what they can do with it we're
confident we can do it we've been
manufacturing LED products as a small
business since 2008 so we do all the
design and prototyping here we control
every aspect of the final product we've
also developed good relationships with
our PCB manufacturers so over the years
of solving and preventing delays and
other problems we've gained a lot of
confidence there so we can do the work
and we've run it on a lot of it but we
need your help first we'd love to get
your feedback
well feature it make this better how
would you use this let us know second we
think the RGB LED Shaye's deserve to be
launched on a much larger scale than we
can afford
right now so your pledge will make that
happen and help us keep working on
improvements our rewards include the RGB
LED shades in several forms you can get
them preassembled ready to use or you
can get them as a kit where you get to
assemble the hinges yourself and solder
a couple of wires we have a hacker
edition which does not include the
controller so if you know how to control
ws2 812 B pixels you can add
something else in control them with that
we also have a bare-bones edition which
doesn't have any electronics on it it's
just the PCBs so you can assemble the
hinges and you wear them but it won't
work unless you get these pixels and
start them on yourself we're really
excited about this project and hope
you'll choose to be a part of it any
pledge amount is greatly appreciated
even if you can't pledge enough to get
RGB LED shades now you can help make
sure that they will be available in the
future thanks for watching and please

in taking your filming to the next level
with hands
linkie shoes is an easy-to-use kit that
turns your favorite pair of shoes into
this
we designed blinky shoes to react to
your movement the waves of flight spread
out from the point where your foot
touches the ground and the harder you
step the more energetic the pattern gets
they use an accelerometer to sense your
steps and they know whether you're
touching your heel or your toe
turning your shoes and delinking shoes
is easy you attach the velcro to your
shoes and then stick the LED strip onto
the velcro plug the strip's into the
included rechargeable battery packs hook
them onto your shoes and you're ready to
go
blinky shoes come pre-programmed with a
handful of great color patterns for you
to use and you can create color patterns
of your own by reprogramming the shoes
using our open source Arduino project
we've been wearing blinky shoes
ourselves for a year now and we've had
so many people come up to us and ask how
they can give their own we got pretty
excited about the idea of brightening
more people steps we spent the last few
months making sure that blinky shoes are
super easy to attach to lots of
different kinds of shoes and we've made
the patterns more responsive and more
complex
we've rigorously tested the shoes to
make sure that there's no blasts and
we've got manufacturers all lined up the
only thing left is your support to make
sure the production is possible we've
loved turning our shoes into blinking
shoes anything that you need
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
