avicii and Hardwell use pyrotechnics at
their EDM shows because fire two events
makes them more fun and memorable but
chances are you're not an entertainment
company with a seven-figure a show
bucket so entertaining your guests using
cool displays of fire is amazing
unfortunately there's never been an easy
to use and affordable way of
entertaining your guests using fire
until now introducing the sound torch
the walls first consumer-ready solution
that seamlessly synchronizes fire and
sound every song the link to the sound
torch creates a unique fiery display of
Awesomeness the only thing limiting the
amount of patterns for the sound torch
is the amount of in Petry's your home
all you have to do is hook it up to any
media device via bluetooth or your
headphone jack then kick back and enjoy
unlike table sized alternatives the 12 x
12 x 16 centimeters size of the sound
torch makes it small and portable yet
remaining large enough to put on an
impressive show djs in particular will
love the sound torch because it's an
entry level way of making kicks
memorable the sound torch works with any
kind of music different songs creates
different patterns for example
connecting the sound torch with a low
gas track will create a candle light
presence by your bedside and if you want
to have flames burning without the music
there's an app for that you simply
connect your smartphone via bluetooth
and then you can control the planes
however you want a small business like a
bar or coffee shop looking to get a
competitive advantage can do so with the
sound george most of these places play
background music anyways so adding fire
that syncs to the sound will stimulate
the sensory experience and enhance the
ambience so far it's an amazing way of
providing entertainment but fire can
also be dangerous this is why we made
the sound torch immediately shut off
when tilted chances are your barbecue
doesn't even have this feature so if
you're not scared of your grill you're
more than qualified to use the sound
toward the sound torch is almost ready
to ship you just need your help with a
few finishing touch
I'd like to introduce you all to a very
exciting and interesting thing now I've
put a lot of thought and research into
ways of seeing small and delicate things
with the naked eye as you can see
traditional microscopes are big and
heavy they can only be used in certain
places but now the perfect microscope
has been invented let me introduce you
to the new rugo microscope it's very
easy to use you can just mount on the
back of your smartphone there are no
cords and no additional batteries since
it's a small microscope you can utilize
it anywhere and anytime now let's take a
look at this small microscopes amazing
performance as you can see here what
can't be seen with the naked eye can
easily be verified with this product
and the image is a high resolution
compared to other microscopes let's take
a closer look it's astonishing how this
small microscope can enlarge the target
by up to four hundred times its original
size nuru go microscope not only can it
be use for research and education but it
can also be utilized in fields that
require a microscope such as work and
everyday lives the two key factors for
producing the high-resolution image are
the lens and the lighting the lens is
capable of enlarging a target by up to
400 times its original size and this
lighting technology has also been
patented you can also get video without
any additional batteries or cables
everyone had an amazing response when I
upload the videos and images taken by an
arugula microscope on SNS if you simply
and easily want the best results

most people watching this video already
have some type of hearing loss and 18
children already have some level of
noise-induced hearing loss bug the level
of hearing loss and preventable why are
people not wearing earplugs well because
they're not cool and that's why we
created YouTube our proc design is a
complete redesign of what ear plugs
should be we partnered with a team of
engineers and develop an interchangeable
adjustable filter system to help the
consumer reduce ear damaging sounds
based on their preference our unique
patented design allows you to insert
noise reduction filters for varying
sound reduction without proc you hear
normally and then with a quick turn the
dial you reduce the sound coming in your
ear without removing the device I'm by
the way we're really excited about this
we just developed a technology to take
out the interchangeable filter and
insert wireless bluetooth headphones
with a microphone for voice control
technology and people in
telecommunication field as well as
military can integrate this into their
comm system and if you're like most
people you can't work out without
headphones falling out of your ears and
over there your headphones are just too
bulky with our high-end in-ear stereo
headphones you'll receive dynamic sound
quality with amazing bass without the
headphones falling out of your ear our
headphones offer dual microphone noise
reduction in a sweat proof case with
five hours of music in 120 hours of
standby our headphones are some of the
lightest in the market but will not fall
out of your hair is no matter what
you're doing once we created the
technology we need to make it look great
so we added a space for your design
purposes now you can design your own
custom earplugs and we have not forgot
about the kids they'll have cool design
earplugs for their ears but for us to
move the next stage it requires
expensive tooling to mass produce a
product and the capital's buy high-end
molds by backing this kickstarter
campaign you can have one of the coolest
looking ear plugs with integrated
bluetooth wireless headphones
