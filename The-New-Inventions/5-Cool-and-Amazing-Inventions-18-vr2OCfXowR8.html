bit about the story of gamer reality and
update on what's been going on so we
started off developing kinetic devices
for mobile apps and we developed
controllers for a rvr and we saw what
pokemon go was doing and how is
revolutionising the gaming industry and
that's what we're all about so we wanted
to jump on board and take advantage of
that opportunity and seek out a
partnership with them and we got our
meeting with Nintendo and it was awesome
and we're not done pursuing that and
we're going to very much so continue
going after that partnership and we're
so glad that you guys have all decided
to partner with us that if you've
already purchased a ball we're actually
going to throw in a gamer reality
viewing set for AR gaming and this is
also a product that we're going to be
releasing for sales as well in the
future and but just to say thank you if
you've already partnered with us we're
going to give you one for free and we're
actually going to open source our
developer kits now for free so if you're
a game developer and you are interested
in a RV our kinetic device gaming and
then you can actually build out a game
that will pair it to our device on our
open source API we believe that this is
going to revolutionize gaming and open
up a whole new realm of possibilities
for new games to be developed and
invented and the possibilities are
endless so we're so excited with what's
happening and if you are a game
developer then reach out to us message
us email us and we will feature you on
an update if you're interested in
getting our developer kits so thank you
guys very much and we're excited about
where this is going this is only the
beginning thanks
imagine if you can eliminate those
awkward phone moments you know those
times when you want to look cool calm
and collected but your phone is ringing
and you can't find it and you miss an
important call for those awkward times
when you're not sure when you're
important call will come in it catches
you off guard and you end up in the
bushes
or how about the times when you receive
a call and your phone is out of reach
and you try to use your SmartWatch but
well that's usually awkward now you have
pin pin allows you to answer your phone
in style whether you are connecting to
an iPhone or Android device it is super
flexible clipping to your shirt or bag
it was tested on the run so you don't
have to worry about losing it go
anywhere and easily access your calls
and messages while on the go and pins
LED lets you see your texts so you won't
miss important messages
when you want to listen to some beats no
worries with pin you can still use your
favorite headphones I lose my phone a
lot I want to keep safely my phone in my
pocket or in my backpack that's why I
credit him the big idea was to create
something that instead of just pulling
out your phone you could actually just
take this device and look down at it and
interact with it directly without having
to even think about your your phone Sean
had a vision for an integrated device of
audio and phone control and messaging
that was one of the fun challenges of
working on this project was staying true
to the vision and hiding the complexity
from the user so a lot of the
engineering challenges to make them
happen we're allowing as many user
options into a really small compact
device that's also entirely wireless in
the main base itself we have an oily to
display we have a speaker box with in
there as well to allow for conference
calling we created prototypes mock-ups
and I actually took them along with me
to my on my morning commutes I learned a
lot just from riding my bike trying to
access my phone while biking trying to
answer calls and text messages and while
on the move I learned a lot how great of
a product this would be when commuting
we have designed in such a way that when
you remove the earpiece it's very easy
to slide it in and out that it doesn't
pull the device off your shirt that when
you remove it you can place it in your
ear and the audio is facing the correct
way so you can look down and easily see
the buttons all those things were very
important and now I can leave my phone
in my backpack all the time and that's
exactly everything I needed
my dream is to make pin available to
everyone though
your house is your castles your lawn is
your castles long and by god you would
do anything to protect them both this is
yard Ian the world's first smart
sprinkler / home security system wait
what look most people waste fifty
percent of their long water each year
and one hundred percent of break-ins
come from outside those are facts yard
Ian makes them history yardi and easily
replaces your old watering timer and
automatically adjusts your watering
schedule based on what kind of grass you
have the weather even the local water
laws that saves you headache and green
but yard Ian also comes with a built-in
night vision camera that streams
directly to your phone so if someone is
creeping on your castle they won't be
for long greener grass more savings and
a totally badass security system yard
Ian your yard guardian
introducing the pad by t1 a tiny
portable telepresence robot allowing
friends and families to interact
seamlessly via voice and video in real
time the padlock key ones flexibility
and size allow you to observe
surroundings you're not at with a
different vision I'm fortunate enough to
come home on most nights to my wonderful
wife my son and even this little
princess sometimes work takes me on the
road and I missed that quality time with
my family that's where the pad bot t1
comes in it allows me to have a virtual
presence even if I'm not physically home
the ability of the t1 allows interaction
with my wife and son while I'm on the
road for business it's great for a
playtime of Timmy or just to check in
with Christie the t1 is a great way to
be present and enjoy every moment
especially if you're not physically
there even if that means horsing around
with Rosie with no concerns harming her
during playtime with the pad bhatti once
built in anti-collision system safety
comes first when the pad by t1 is around
users of any age I breathe easy using
the pad lot to build and play with toys
with my son during those conversations
with my wife there's no need to worry
about the phone's battery as the pad bot
t1 comes with a built-in charger to keep
the phone powered up in addition to
being a phone charger pad but t1 along
with the plugged in apple or android
smart device with Wi-Fi or 4g
connections enable can mimic physical
movements via remote control from a
hotel room thousands of miles away the
t1 also has an anti falling system which
prevents the robot from falling off of
elevated surfaces if it gets too close
to the edge of a kitchen counter while
my wife fixes the nightly meal I can use
my pad bot t1 on the table or on the
floor without ever having to worry about
it dropping off a ledge at night I can
use it as a monitor to make sure my son
gets a good night's sleep or to ensure
my home is secure even though I'm not
there in addition when I can't be on the
road for business and need to work from
home
the pad bought t1 can provide a presence
for me at the office especially during
business meetings allowing me to
remotely control my perspective from my
smartphone they say you can't be in two
places at once but the compact and
lightweight pad bot t1 has changed that
idea for my family in need give it a
shot in your home just like me so you
can always be present
