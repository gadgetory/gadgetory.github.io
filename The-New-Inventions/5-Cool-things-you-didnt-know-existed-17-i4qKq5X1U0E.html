day smartphones are becoming smarter but
the battery life remains critical we'd
like to use our phones without the fear
of running out of battery of course
there are solutions such as power cases
and extra batteries but they're either
not portable enough or is to forget we
designed a product so compact that will
follow you everywhere a cable the size
of an inch we call it in charge it's a
very simple product it's so useful that
we believe everybody should own one
that's why one of our main goals was to
keep it affordable a tiny product at the
tiny price
we spent an average seventy percent of
our day next to a USB port and every
time it's a chance to top up for
batteries there are over five billion
USB ports around the world in charge
will fit into your pocket and you won't
have to fight with diamond cords ever
again thanks to its remarkably compact
design you can snap it onto your keyring
and there's no chance to forget it at
all we spent the last three months
design the product and testing the
prototypes and now we are finally ready
to start the production in charger will
be available with both lightning
connector and microUSB so it's
compatible with most of the devices out
there we are really excited about this
and we hope you are too now we need your
help to bring in charge into your pocket
as a supporter you will get your own in
charge at a special price so please
consider back in our project and share
it with your friends thanks for watching
we really appreciate your support thank
you
hi my name is Alan I live my life from
my phone it arranged is my life for me
it stores all my special memories it
also keeps me in touch with the world
but I have a serious serious problem I'm
always losing my phone I've lost more
than 10 phones over the last three years
I'm tired of losing my contacts
schedules photos everything this has to
stop I need a better way to protect my
phone
now i use the duet
just click and the duet device helps me
find my lost phone even in a heart to
reach spot in fact when I'm more than 10
meters away from my phone I can set the
device to alert me
so I'll never be late for another class
again it can even track my other lost
items by the protag app my wallet my
keys laptop whatever
because the duet protects my phone it
protects my life too
you
this is charged all the world's smallest
portable power outlet not only can it
charge your phone and tablet but also
your laptop computer it's a portable
wall outlet meaning you can power
virtually anything anytime anywhere
we've all been in situations where
plugging into a wall outlet just wasn't
possible or being forced into orbit
places just to get that little bit of
power
until now chargeur is so small it can
fit in your pocket you can keep one in
your backpack or your favorite purse it
gives you the power to do things you
never could before and it will always be
with you it features fast charge
technology and enough power to charge
your phone or tablet for an entire week
imagine taking a wall outlet wherever
you go you can charge your phone power
your laptop or even curl your hair in
the middle of the park you'll never miss
capturing that special moment with
charge all so say goodbye to the low
battery stay connected and stay powered
give the gift of power to all of your
family and friends and keep one charged
and all the most common places next to
the door in your car or in your favorite
bag power brings people together it
gives life and it gives us hope help
make charge all a reality the power to
change the world lies in your hair
hi guys today we have the portable power
outlet from charge all brand new product
coming out of the market it is the
world's smallest power outlet physics is
a system that takes any carbonated here
and makes it awesome we're just a bunch
of technologists and passion beer geeks
and our pursuit was to create a device
that can give us the absolute best
learning experience we consider
ourselves to be master beer chefs and
the whole idea physics is to bring the
perfect lure into the living room the
sixth takes any beer that you can buy in
the store in kannur bottle and it
amplifies that and makes it into a draft
quality for the proper way to pour out
of a bottle is you hold a glass at 45
degree angle you pour the beer down and
then we hear two-thirds up you would
pour the beer straight down to create
the head sometimes you put too much
sometimes you get beer pull over the
glass but that head it always had this
unpleasant mouthfeel what we found is
ahead of the beer is one of the most
critical elements of the beer drinking
experience there's a part of your body
called the trigeminal nerve which will
determine texture if the bubbles are
large in the head your mouth is going to
feel a grainy type of texture tube which
isn't pleasant we take sound waves and
basically chop the bubbles into finer
bubbles so what might be one bubble in
your beer glass will end up being a
hundred bubbles in our beer glass has
this enhancer room hands flavor taste
the sensation is smooth and creamy it's
pretty awesome business was designed
with easy use in mind the first step is
you open up the lid you place any can or
bottle into the canister put the tube
inside the can or bottle close the lid
when you pull the handle foer to tab
what we do is actually pressurize the
canister and we push the beer down the
bottle down
and up through the tube and there's a
digital micro controller that controls
the fluid rate of the beer dispensing
out so what we want to do is maintain as
much carbonation in the beer and not
break up the carbonation when we're
tapping and then once you fill up the
beer to whatever desired level and you
want to put the head on you'd push the
handle in the backwards position and we
utilize sound waves to break up the
carbonation and create a very dense
creamy and smooth pen this is all
handcrafted by us in our lab we took it
to the AC beer music fest from the moon
with the doors open we had a line of
people in front of review you know
everybody loved it you know the fun
factor of using it you know the enhanced
taste aroma we had everything from you
know novice beer drinkers that were just
going to the event to try a bunch of
beers to like brew masters that were
coming over with their own beer and
wanted to taste our own beer through our
system so they have a real detail
reference point so for us is it was a
great validation point this is something
that we really need to pursue we need to
seek the help of the beard loving
community on crowdsourcing and bring
this product to market
physics is a culmination of two years of
engineering in pursuit of redefining the
perfect pour now we need your support so
we could bring physics to you so you can
enjoy any beer anytime anywhere thank
you
lady is an innovative waterproof
dustproof floating bluetooth speaker
with superior sound quality my DS
patented sealed body construction has an
IP rating of 67 which means it keeps out
dust and sand entirely while also
providing water protection for over 30
minutes at one meter of submersion but
you won't have to worry about that since
my tea also floats the mighty speaker is
over twenty percent louder than our
previous rebel speaker weighing just two
ounces more mighty also features 75%
more battery power than the rebel
speaker utilizing a 3.7 volt
rechargeable Nokia lithium-ion battery
the charger port coming loose on the
rebel speaker was the number one
complaint that users reported instead of
a micro USB port which was able to work
itself loose on the rebel the mighty
speaker features a 3.5 millimeter
headphone style charger port similar to
the ipod shuffle and it also comes with
a 30 inch USB to 3.5 millimeter charging
cable the controls on my feet are much
easier to navigate the power button is
located on the top panel along with the
other for control buttons the center
button is designed to play pause and
stop during the bottom button is for
answering phone calls or talking to Siri
the left and right buttons SS love track
selection and volume controls a short
press changes tracks and a long press
adjust the volume in the indicated
direction we are so confident in the
improved quality and manufacturing
processes that each mighty speaker will
be covered by a one-year limited
warranty against any and all defects</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
