granted yet our eyes are one of our most
precious sentence having healthy eyes
not only affects how well we see but
also how we feel at work and at play but
most of us don't see our ultimate risk
nearly as often as we should or as
regularly as we see our dentist now
there's a simple intelligent way to test
your vision and track the results from
the convenience of your own home
introducing the IQ personal vision
tracker a low-cost optical device and
mobile application that accurately
measures your vision and delivers vision
correction records that can be used to
order new eyewear to get started press
the test button at the bottom of the
screen and attach the IQ mini scope to
your smartphone place the IQ mini scope
over your eye so that you can see the
red and green lines then tap the on
screen plus or minus buttons until the
lines completely overlap once you've
completed tests on both eyes IQs
powerful patented technology will
process the readings and generate your
eyeglass numbers in no time at all
you're ready to get on with the rest of
your day with IQ you can track your
vision history through your personal
dashboard to view and compare all of
your eyeglass numbers and use the latest
test results to order new glasses online
the IQ personal vision tracker a low
cost effective and fun way to keep track
of your vision isn't it time you did
something wise for your eyes
you
hi I'm Sean and I have a dream I believe
everything in the entire world should be
connected to the Internet to make our
lives easier the thing is you go into a
store these days and there's usually an
internet-enabled version which basically
means it's five times more expensive and
takes an engineering degree to make work
plus I don't want new things i buy to be
part of the internet I want everything
to be part of the internet so I got to
thinking what if there was a little
device that I could put on anything that
will allow me to monitor it and thus
control something based on that I think
that would change the world so this one
day I'm out with my buddy James and I
say hey James you think we could make
this happen well Sean you're a software
guy I'm a hardware guy we can definitely
do this can you imagine what would we
want to monitor and control a restaurant
could put them on their chairs and count
how many times they've moved or put one
of their beer taps and count how many
beers have been poured hey we could even
put one in a fridge or freezer and
monitor the temperature at all times or
hey could you put one on my beer so
nobody steals it hey Sean think about
where we could use this around the home
you can put one on your front door or
garage and be notified anytime it's
opened yeah I'll put one on a mailbox
and get a text if your mail arrives what
about putting one in your child's
bedroom to monitor the temperature at
all times oh yeah or put one on a
windowsill and get alerted if your
teenager tries to ask a great idea just
think about all the places we could use
this inside like in a kitchen that's
right like on a dishwasher to make sure
it's on or make sure people aren't
getting into the wrong cupboards hey we
could count how many times the fridge is
open or put one in your wine fridge to
make sure the wine is staying chilled
exactly or put one in the cookie jar so
you know when your kids grab snacks
before dinner what about at work yeah
you could monitor the temperature from
office to office instead of just one
place can you imagine putting one on
your chair and being notified if
somebody's been messing with it or more
importantly somebody's not messing with
your desk and tries to steal your
stapler you know there's already
products like this out there but their
little circuit boards that feel like
they're going to electrocute you or stab
you or kill you in some way let's just
stop talking about this Sean and let's
make it happen introducing the cubic the
world's first truly affordable internet
of everything device it will help you
control and monitor everything in your
life from the comfort of your phone this
one inch cube is large enough to be
found easily yet small enough to be
attached to almost anything cubic is
easy to set up connects to your Wi-Fi in
a flash to transmit data to the cloud
and comes with a rechargeable long
lasting battery we're starting with four
different versions temperature movement
humidity and light and this isn't just
an idea anymore it is real we've spent a
year refining our designs and testing
our prototypes it's ready to go we just
need financial support to complete the
required certification and tooling we
believe this will change the world what
do you think Kickstarter friends it's up
to you by one and help us change the
world
much better life can be smelly that's
why you need vente for it the best
weapon to take out stinky odors it works
let add in ventilation to your trashcan
another closed spaces freshen up the air
so you can actually relax when it turns
into this guy who keeps a spill in this
area a lot more tolerable any make sure
that you can smell the sweet scent of
dimple in a never right here rather than
this you can install vente fresh to your
trash can easily within seconds just
leave it alone high maintenance it's a
high-tech ventilation system combining
UV lighting and Platinum belt save
technology breakdown odor molecules and
yield fresh air a light sensor starts to
the organization when the trash can is
flows fenty fresh adapts to all kinds of
trash cans and you can use any regular
garbage bags there's no consumables that
keep you spending more and with an
additional portable power bank you can
use vent fresh all around the house such
as treating the fridge where needed
under the kitchen sink and of course
your smelly shoe cabinets so go get a
fancy fresh so easy to install and one
hundred percent hassle-free and acid I
call clean job
salt and pepper I have a charger port
portable microphone sprinkler head an
attachment for a camera or something or
it's a spy coming true very nicely it's
very very powerful for the compact size
that it is it plays really long does it
go to 11 pebble is the world's smallest
true wireless speaker that produces
sound beyond its size the new pebble
sound system provides unparalleled
clarity as well as sound separation you
can pair your pebble speakers together
allowing them to play music
simultaneously amplifying your sound or
you can place your pebble speakers in
separate rooms sharing the music and
various spaces to create an incredibly
flexible audio experience pebble so
compact that you can take it with you
everywhere and pebble is so small you'll
barely notice it whether it's at the
office in the park or on vacation enjoy
the freedom of creating your own
personalized sound environment for both
indoors and out you can really create
like a home stereo system using just
these three just like in like very
covert locations throughout like your
house like just in a room yeah far I can
take it all right I can hear you that's
amazing pebble packs enough power to
keep you entertained throughout the day
and pebble comes in a variety of color
options including black silver gold rose
gold and JetBlue I'm Susie can I just
take one with me like beauty this back
one for all my friends honey they shrank
the speaker
pebble size matters
you know sometimes being a kid isn't as
easy as you might think I mean we have
the ideas we have the motivation and we
have all the potential a while but
sometimes we just don't have the tools
you need that's why we've decided it's
time to make our own tools so we created
yeehaw the only three printer design of
us kids in mind we made it easy to use
one hundred percent safe for kids it's
controlled directly by its cloud system
either online or through an expertly
designed app so there's no need for
manually adjusting anything you can
create unique and original design to
pixel by pixel or knife or you can
choose from always growing library of
more than 2,000 ready to print toys all
you need to do is pick your color press
print and yeehaw does the rats it's
fully enclosed by its safety door so
there's absolutely no danger when the
machine is printed if the bird open or
the machine is tilted or anything else
goes wrong the machine will
automatically stop printing and retract
it's novel hee-haw is sleek compact and
see through all around which allows you
to see our gears come to us with any
angle all four filaments are
eco-friendly and non-toxic and they come
in 12 different colors we wanted to make
sure that yeehaw allowed contorts
further creativity in whole new ways we
can be innovative in our problem solving
we could dream up new and exciting world
we can hope you try to learn grow and
achieve our potential and don't worry
they've made it safe for grownups to
support us on IndieGoGo and share our
campaign with family and friends Neha
the 3d printer designed with kids in
mind
