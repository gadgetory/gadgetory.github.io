raised nearly half a million dollars to
bring photo the first stick and shoot
camera to life since then we've shipped
to 37 countries grown our team and been
enjoying all the pota photos you've been
sharing online we've also learned how to
do what we do better so let's get to the
point photo is back and better than ever
and even more affordable if you haven't
heard of proto it works like this just
stick and shoot done how you shoot is up
to you and not to reach of your arm
photo sticks using your special micro
adhesive pad it's quicker and more
versatile than any mountain and it
doesn't wear out to clean it simply wipe
with water and it sticks like new ok so
that's the Poteau we know and love
here's how we made it even better we put
in a brand new image sensor with pixels
twice the size before bigger pixels
gather more light meaning less noise and
better low-light performance in other
words your photos will look amazing and
unless you're printing your photos
bigger than this how many pixels doesn't
matter their size matters and compared
to the iphone 6s and Galaxy s7 well our
pixels are bigger next we put in a wide
angle precision cut glass lens not
overly fisheye wide but enough to fit
you and the whole crew ok so this is a
cool totally new feature you can now
connect up to 6 photos and control them
with one phone imagine a 360 degree
photo booth or multi-angle time lapse at
your next party best of all photo is
available on kickstarter for forty-nine
dollars it's our small way of saying
thank you for supporting us the first
time but act now because this price is
only available for these 30 days so
order your photo today and get one for a
friend let's get creative and fun with
the way you take photos thank you for
sharing your time with me and go photo
