become the next great digital visionary
you just have to allow it to take root
coding shouldn't be something just
computer scientist still it should be
something everyone can do and root makes
that possible it starts with a language
so simple that a young child can use it
even before they know how to read if
this then that at first coding with root
might look like simple blocks but this
coding is very real root engages the
part of a child's brain that thinks
analytically and unleashes the
creativity within root can be used on
just about any surface making it a great
platform to create all kinds of
challenges and games with friends it's
easy for coding to feel abstract but
root teaches computer programming in a
new way making coding a real-time and
interactive experience kids think of
things I want to do and push themselves
to that next level see what they've
imagined come to life or they can
explore other people's programs from
around the world and make them their own
when coding with root the only real
limit is curiosity Bruce the only robot
of its kind offers this many learning
opportunities
this make the journey from simple blocks
to full text coding languages into it
makers and researchers can have some fun
too by adding 3d printed parts and other
accessories
fruit it's not about having one
experience it's about making experience
who is the best way for anyone to fall
in love as
where they go from there is completely
up to them this is the achal serious a
the world's most versatile Windows 10
mini PC ever created it's a complete
desktop PC equipped with powerful
hardware components for optimal
performance wired and wireless options
enable you to create a comfortable work
space within seconds you can enjoy
working in silence as the serious a
doesn't require a fan for cooling the
unique switch mode developed in direct
partnership with Microsoft changes the
serious a into an input device once you
connect it to your school the achal
serious a is small enough to fit into
your bag or pocket you don't even
realize you're carrying a complete
computer with you the full HD
touchscreen and integrated battery allow
you to use the device unplugged and on
the go the achal serious a is extremely
versatile it's the easiest way to store
and share content it's the remote
control for all your smart home devices
it's the Gateway to your favorite media
it's your gaming device it's your
connection with the people you care
about
bigger is better whatever I know how it
TV works yeah but can your TV do this
flashing my plans and 16 yeah my TV can
kind of do that sure but can your TV do
this boom boom now I can chat a woman
just do more flicks boom boom yeah but
who cares I can do that with my TV my
phone and my laptop too exactly it's
just a few clicks I did all that mine
Vivek Cyril remix I oh what's remix I oh
so what is remix I'll Phoenix I'll is a
device engineered to be a 4k TV set-top
box a gaming console and an android pc
all-in-one device this is a result of us
listening and learning from our user
community over the past couple of years
to bring about our next phase of
innovation for those of you that don't
know us we're joy technology and we're
all about pushing the limits of Android
and of computer we first introduced our
vision right here on Kickstarter with
the remakes ultra tablet a laptop
experience on a tablet and then we
brought you guys the remakes mini the
world's first android pc we even made
remix OS free for the world through
remix OS for pc and remix OS player
remix io integrates the feedback we've
gotten from users of all these products
we've learned that watching videos was
hugely important for all of our users so
for example we've worked on creating
remix OS TV mode not only optimized for
remote controls but it also has bigger
app icons and a dedicated TV app store
populated with apps developed just for
TVs we've done the work to make being a
couch potato even easy
now for Android gamers we haven't
forgotten about you guys we've been
developing our gaming toolkit app for
the past year that will allow players to
keymap android games for keyboard and
mouse as well as game controllers
android games now Unleashed for big
screens and finally android pc and remix
OS remix OS was born to bring to life
the realization of android pcs multiple
resizable windows keyboard and mouse
optimizations and shortcuts a task parts
manager system and your apps now with
remix I oh we're redefining again what
computing can be a set-top box that can
browse a gaming console that can chat
and a pc that can turn on your lights we
work hard so that these functions are
simple and seamless for you the user now
we're back on Kickstarter because this
is where we it all started for us we
built our community on Kickstarter it's
here that we want to share the fruits of
the past couple of years with you and
it's you guys we're here for join us in
our continuing journey to explore and
push the limits of Android and of
computing get a friend to back us and be
eligible for a free remix aisle from all
of us here at jai technology thanks for
your support and remake song thank you
I'm Carl winans I'm one of the
cofounders of mega tiny corporation and
I'd like to introduce you to our new
product the Powerball so the power bulb
is the world's first LED light bulb that
allows you to turn any lamp into a
charging station and we do that by
combining a beautiful warm LED light to
high powered USB ports that essentially
gives you convenient charging just about
anywhere in your house wherever you have
a lamp we all have these devices that we
need to charge day and night from the
living room to the bedroom to the office
could be a phone tablet speaker all
these different devices that we need to
charge and we think it's as simple as
just plugging into the bottom and that's
it but what we forget is that we have
this piece here that we've got to find
and then we have to find a six vote or
ten foot extension cords so we can get
it to the wall socket and it's either
going under the bed or
under the couch over behind the couch
and we end up with this mess I think
we're all familiar with this mess and so
what we decided to do was to take a look
and see if we could just you know just
have this piece here and how can we
charge with just this and so we came up
with a Powerball we essentially take any
lamp and turn it into a convenient
charging station where you simply just
plug in we designed the Powerball with a
clean modern look that fits into any
decor with its mega smart charging
technology the power valve automatically
senses and sends more power to the
device with the lowest charged with its
integrated power button you can turn the
light off while allowing power to flow
through to your devices the silicone
jacket dissipates heat and keeps the
body of the Powerball cool to the touch
the power Bob works with all a 26 and 27
sockets allowing you to use it just
about anywhere in the world at 608
lumens and 2,700 degrees Kelvin the
power bob has a warm soft white color
the power bob was rated at 50,000 hours
of life which is actually over five
years of continuous use
we are really excited about the
Powerball it's a simple elegant solution
to a messy problem we've thought about
every single detail from the mega smart
charging to the LED light bulb to the
actual design of the product itself all
the way through testing and
certification so we couldn't be more
excited but now we need our backers help
and we need them to do two things one we
need them to be one of the first people
to back the power off and then too we
need them to tell all their friends and
family about this unique product this is
a chance to support a product that helps
a ball the light bulb to take it from
its early days to LED bulbs that we have
now and that now it's a chance to do
more with the ball it's really truly
where light meets power introducing new
v a smart sleeping mask developed based
on extensive brainwave research made for
the modern age it is practical and
highly efficient using an innovative
light treatment nearly alleviates the
negative effects of long distance travel
by pre adjusting your internal clock
nuvi prevents you from feeling sluggish
or jet lagged upon arrival at your
destination
using movies HiFi stereo speakers you
can choose to play binaural beats or the
Zen music can post specifically the
movie sleep regulation function
this allows for optimal sleeping
conditions that provide the deepest
sound asleep
nuvi smart wake up function wakes you up
naturally with its soft lights and music
this gradual transition allows users to
go from the sleeve to awake without the
usual prob unison leaving you truly
refreshed and energetic
feeling tired during the day try and
move his power nap function in only 20
minutes it will allow you to recharge
and wake up to a far more productive
Selma

prototypes in search of perfection as a
result we have successfully created the
