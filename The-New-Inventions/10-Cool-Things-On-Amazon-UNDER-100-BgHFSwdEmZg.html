there
so
from the makers of myth meat turbojets
your own personal minion KO kim bosom or
shake some sense into him control them
with your hand or the app make him down
drive or interact with familiar faces
challenge your friends do a fart battle
hmm coding for high tech bun meat mini
turbo Dave to work turbo Dave you're a
minion under your control from while we
Despicable Me 3 only in theatres
health is not thrust upon us it's
something we build every day
when it's about our health we don't
compromise
we refuse to settle for mediocrity and
best guesses
we invited tools the wicked move beyond
the uncertainty
we learnt how to pet the right goal
how to work hard to get at the top
to let them know how to spare America
to give them the windpipe and we're not
stealing well that they can make
multitude digits about our health and
behavior
we put out to explore to build and
configure the now
a world where we all know what health
looks like
because we owe it to our human to get
them off the counts to keep hounding
them to stay active and healthy
we can wake up every day of our lives
after totally insane
- yeah
cars have had powerful computers inside
them for years but that hasn't really
improved the way that we drive them in
creating automatic we set up to unlock
our cars potential and redefine people's
relationship to driving making it safer
more efficient and fun we did this by
introducing your car to your smartphone
it all starts with the automatic link
just plug it into your car's data port
and follow the simple instructions on
screen now your car and smartphone will
connect wirelessly whenever you drive
most people don't realize just how big
an impact their driving style can have
on Joule efficiency you can save up to
1/3 on gas with only a few adjustments
to how you drive an automatic helps you
do that without being a backseat driver
it learns about your driving style and
gives you subtle audio cues when you do
things that waste gas like accelerating
quickly the app shows your weekly Drive
score and trip timeline so you can track
your progress and see where to improve a
high score could save you hundreds on
gas every year when you drive automatic
monitors your car's health and more and
do something's wrong so if your check
engine light comes on you'll see a
description of the problem and possible
solutions you can even clear the light
yourself and save a trip to the mechanic
because automatic connected to your car
when you drive it always knows where you
parked your family can even access that
location for seamless car sharing
accidents happen and far too often there
isn't someone there to help if you're
ever in a crash automatic alerts 9-1-1
with your location it can even contact
your loved ones to let them know what
happened and it helped us on the way we
wanted to reimagine what driving could
be and I think we did that with
automatic we believe that cars should
live up to their potential and that
every driver can be a smarter driver
that's why we created automatic the
smart driving assistance meet I'll make
