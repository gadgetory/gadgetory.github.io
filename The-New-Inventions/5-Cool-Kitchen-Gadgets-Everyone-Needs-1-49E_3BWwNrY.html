when I was making my lunch to take to
work I had an idea I figured there has
to be an easier faster way to seal these
pesky sandwich bags that idea was always
kicking around in the back of my mind
fast forward a decade I was at home one
evening all the pieces came together
with a pair of old barbecue tongs some
paper rollers ice caveny from my desktop
printer a few finishing nails some
moldable thermoplastic I got online and
a few hours of trial and error
the very first zip lock was perfect
after a visit with my lawyer and the
patent applications were filed I sat
down with the owner of a local
world-class manufacturing facility and
they set me up with a great industrial
designer and together
with this the first 3d printed version
of the SIP Locker
during our focus group sessions and
quickly found out that we needed to make
the change because of the way people
naturally wanted to hold the tool we're
determined to make zip Locker as easy as
possible to use so some more design work
extensive testing we found a precise
angle is needed to ensure the rollers
lined up with the back zipper
introducing zip Locker ez is the fastest
way to Co send robot bags
you've ever had any trouble concealing
ziplock bags zip Locker
bolo is a true innovation combining two
of humanity's most important inventions
to date the knife and the wheel creating
a one-of-a-kind rolling knife your
perfect kitchen accessory
Bodo makes preparing your meals faster
and easier
the engineered circular blades coupled
with bolo sturdy construction allows you
to achieve chef quality precision in
your cutting and bolo easily tackles
many of the jobs your other knives can't
do the ergonomic handle makes bolo more
functional and more comfortable than
your regular kitchen knives and the
special blade break even turns bolo into
a chopper and cleaning bolo could not be
easier just open at both ends remove the
blade and rinse
like most of you I love products that
really work great are beautiful and are
a very high quality a group of my
friends and I have developed an ice
cream scoop that has all of these
characteristics and we're seeking your
support to launch this product to
improve the ice cream scoop a product
that's been in use possibly since
medieval times we had to solve problems
that hadn't been fully resolved I
decided to work on these challenges as
part of the design course I teach to
tens of thousands of students through
the Coursera online education platform
I've always been really interested in
ice cream scoops I have a whole
collection of antique scoops and
contemporary scoops and something that's
always bothered me about invention eliza
cream scoops is the wrist angle if you
think about it you hold the ice cream
scoop
roughly axially with your arm and then
you have to kind of reach into the
curtain and it's a pretty awkward wrist
angle and so one of the concepts that
emerged as I was developing ideas for
new scoops was that the scoop would be
angled with respect to the handle and
that became the big idea behind the
angled scoop that would provide a
straight wrist and better ergonomics to
allow better scooping better access to
the ice cream greater comfort and
overall greater user satisfaction to
improve the wrist position and scooping
capabilities
I am gold and elongated the head of the
scoop this keeps the wrist straight and
comfortable and makes it easier to get
all of the ice cream off the sides and
bottom of the container the designers at
lunar took my somewhat ugly functional
design and refined it into a gorgeously
simple and elegant form lastly to ensure
the highest quality and best
functionality we make the scoop out of
solid die cast aluminum
hand finish it and then apply striking
surface treatments the result of all
this is a really beautiful ice cream
scoop
that feels great in your hand performs
brilliantly and is crafted to last we're
launching this product on Kickstarter
because the conventional retailing model
makes it so hard for even professionals
like us to get products of this caliber
directly to you so please help us by
supporting us for the pledge we're sure
that you'll love your new Bell V ice
cream scoop</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
