introducing heroes the first protective
hearing devices designed with music
lovers in mind never get home from a
concert a clog or any loud event with
muffled hearing or a ringing in your
ears that acoustical hangover is the
sign of hearing damage a terrorist were
out to change them without patent
pending technology we have developed the
solution that reduces decibel levels
maintain quality of sound and lessons
hearing damage hi my name is Ronnie
madra and i'm the founder and inventor
of Eros I have noise-induced hearing
loss i also have tinnitus I own and
operate several my clubs I'm in loud
environments all the time seven days a
week I need to do something now for
myself but for people that I I host or
people that come to my places 80
decibels of sound it is what oh she
recommends hearing protection at and
that's roughly the sound of walking down
the street in New York City what eros
was designed to do which is so cool in
that it blocks the bad decibels from
getting in while still allowing sound
quality these little tiny soundboard at
travels through the product to an
acoustical filter you can stand at a
concert and hear the music crisply or
still protecting your ears from the
damaging decibels what I thought was
really exciting and interesting about
the approach that running in the team
took was that they incorporated app
technology into the whole product set
and what does that mean that they
created a solution that allows you to
really understand what
happening in your is based upon the
noise levels around you since this
product doesn't operate on batteries it
does it requires to make it rechargeable
we don't have to provide an extra plug
with it we've designed the passing
technology this has a very strong health
benefit I think that's important I think
because I feel it I know it I live it I
want to keep building clubs I want to
keep throwing events and I want to keep
being in hospitality that's what I love
to do we need your help back this

sound gives memories water smart mine
records every routing moment so you can
share a momentary inspiration we've been
able to continue innovating and created
something new and exciting introducing
the awarded Naruto smart UV for your
phone the smart UV camera lets you see
into the UV light spectrum and reveals
amazing discoveries people all over the
world are reacting to this incredible
innovation from total shock and
excitement to being in awe or even a
little grossed out the smart EV captures
what lies beneath the skin so you can
see what it really looks like we've all
heard numerous times how important skin
care is but until it becomes real for
each of us we rarely do anything about
it if you could see your own skin and UV
light maybe you start making better
decisions for us this is what we call
seeing smart so we can be smart so how
does being smart actually works there's
more to life than what the human eye can
see when you look at the light spectrum
you see the visible light measures from
about 400 to 700 nanometers in
wavelength we call this visible light
because this is the only light humans
can see UV like sits next to it in the
spectrum between 200 and 400 nanometers
invisible to humans but interestingly
cats can see from the 300 nanometer band
up which means they have UV vision when
observing your skin visible light
bounces off the outer layer which is
what we see every day but because UV
light has a smaller wavelength it passes
through the outer layer and only bounces
off the second denser layer showing us
what lies beneath
that's what makes a smart you be so
great it not only lets you see in UV but
also lets you take a UD selfie the first
of its kind in the world now we're going
to look at how smart this device really
is it fits in your pocket connects via a
reversible USB connector has a photo and
video camera works by an app is iOS and
Android compatible and has the same lens
technology as professional UV camera
we've made it really easy to use you
download the app on your smartphone and
attach the device to your phone check
that you have natural light or UV light
source then take a picture or video and
be amazed at what's been right in front
of your eyes this entire time what makes
this different than other UV cameras it
works with your smartphone's giving you
access to a bigger screen it's much more
affordable than professional equipment
the camera orientation allows you to see
yourself you don't have to charge it
ever it makes your smartphone even
smarter and it uses your phone sharing
capabilities letting you share in real
time this is my robot critter if their
remote control toy but when you add the
fossilized smartphone kit it comes to
life with artificial intelligence these
robots explore Forge and avoid
unpleasant obstacles think it hesitate
and make the face
and you can teach them improving your
skills one kit can bring two robots to
life so they have a friend to play with
there's some good old-fashioned AI this
is the new stuff welcome MIP robot magic
that's organic and unexpected but these
are the guys who made a wish you the
same thing twice we talked a lot it is
the box of life and Mark own kids bring
cutting-edge AI computer vision and
robotics together in a new way we hope
that it will entertain you and fascinate
you and it will also inspire kids to
learn about the engineering that makes
these things work our team designs bots
alive to make a portable and compelling
robot creatures for you and we can't
wait for you to happen we're deeply
