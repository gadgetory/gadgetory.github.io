part of our everyday lives but there's a
problem here they're getting bigger and
bigger sure that large generous screen
is pretty but is it really worth it
look familiar
well we think those huge screens aren't
totally worth it so we want to work
trying to design a solution we'll bring
back the joy of one-handed use to modern
phones after discussing it for a few
seconds in this video I think we got it
introducing unrep it's a simple solution
to a modern-day problem it's small and
thin and it literally waves nothing
unrep attaches to the back of your phone
with or without a case unrep uses an
adhesive tape as extremely strong these
it's remove and does not leave any
residue so how do you use it simple you
just insert your fingers in the distract
immediately you feel that your phone is
secured to your hand
you grip your phone as usual or you
ungroup it it gives you a freedom that
was never there before and because it's
made of fabric it's easy onion fingers
there's no need to worry about you
dropping your phone and it's always
slipping from your hands again it's
unintuitive it stays flat when you want
to be flat under it is strong it can
carry up to an excess of 4 pounds of
weight the gun grip there are so many
new ways you can hold your phone after
using it you'll wonder how you even
managed to hold your phone at all before
and the best part of it all under it
looks good in fact it looks good on a
phone not only that but it also looks
hot in your
it doesn't look dorky or utilitarian on
grip is not just an accessory to help
you hold your phone it's a fashion
accessory it comes with many different
colors and designs and did we mention
the strap is detachable so depending on
your mood or outfit you can mix and
match heck it's easier to change the
thing of clothes
our team has already finalized the
design and already worked out all the
issues of production and our suppliers
are all ready to go but we can't do this
alone we need your support to take on
grip all the way to the finish line we
believe on grip can bring that the joy
and ease of use of your phones with all
of us working together we can finally
let go of our phones
this is cruddy stand the $5 phone stand
which fits in your wallet hello key
starter
my name is Muntz and i am the designer
behind credits and i believe that the
best dimensions are the ones that you
always have with you I needed a stand
for my phone and all the existing
products had flaws
some were too expensive something
complicated but the biggest solved mall
was portability
I needed something which was out of the
way when not in use but always say when
I need it after working through several
design iterations and sourcing the
perfect material I have finalized to
design your phone will sit at a
comfortable angle for watching movies
understand is as stable as possible
without sacrificing simplicity use it in
your car with your phone's GPS during
lunch
on an airplane wait no we don't have the
budget for that Britta Stein will be
manufactured locally here in Sweden to
get the price down to a reasonable level
I need to order a large quantity that's
why I need your help Kickstarter help me
make my dream come true
this is cute
your Wireless smartphone companion
hey what are you working on I'm working
on your marketing class video yeah maybe
you can be it for me come around I'll
show it to you on my laptop or you can
just put it on USB key and I can view it
on my phone
you can connect external storage devices
such as USB flash drives and hard drives
to your cube so you can preview files on
your smart phone
the powerful hue app allows them to
browse through files on queues internal
memory or any external device connected
you can also choose the files and love
to copy - from your smartphone on
computers internal memory or any
external storage device nice I like it
is it okay if I copy to my cue
you don't even need the app to copy
files simply press the power button for
five seconds to copy all the files from
the USB flash drive two cubes internal
memory
it also works with an SD card anytime
you or any of your friends take pictures
with their professional camera you can
backup the files on the queue or onto
your smartphone coz once again you can
preview the pictures on your smartphone
so you only copy the ones that you need
you can even connect external hard
drives to keep did we mention charging
when your smartphone is low on battery
simply connect it to one of cubes two
USB ports cube supports up to one half
charging current for fast charge and
it's 2100 milliamp hour battery can
recharge your phone to 80% capacity you
can connect two hosts of devices to keep
including iPhones and Android phones USB
flash drives SD cards external hard
drives laptop and desktop computers
tablets and also keyboards and links if
you were to buy a wireless external
memory USB plug an SD card reader and a
battery charger separately it would cost
a lot more money than what the cube is
priced at Cube offers a lot more value
for your money in a small single package
that fits perfectly in your pocket hi
I'm Nicole Murphy friend of the inventor
and first owner of
hi I'm Norman co-founder and lead
designer of Cuba a wireless versatile
device like no other on the market you
can store your pictures videos audio and
documents in cube instead of your
smartphones and xsm on your smartphone
anytime wirelessly you can also charge a
smartphone when the battery is low you
can also connect a host of USB devices
to your smartphone via cube wirelessly
we've been working on this dream for
about a year now and they've come a long
way through testing and prototyping and
we believe you're ready to send the
cubes to manufacture but tooling and
injection molding takes a lot of money
which is very common we need your help
and support and realizing this dream so
please start this campaign and pledge
your support today and you feel like
cube then please share the idea with
your friends and family thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
