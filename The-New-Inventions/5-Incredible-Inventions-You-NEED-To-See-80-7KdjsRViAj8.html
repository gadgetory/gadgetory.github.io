like I sent you created you can save and
share it Buddha was created by a ganar
Roma that's up and we are so prolific in
the world of sense but there's probably
a little of us in every product you
smell this is our first consumer product
and we wanted to get it out with the
help of the community we need your
support and feedback support mudou and
help bring the power of smell into your
home clue do i spent seven years working
as a mechanic so I saw firsthand the
kind of handheld lights and area lights
that were being used they were cheap
with dim underpowered bulbs and flimsy
construction I'm constantly be buying
new ones because they always fell apart
even with newer LED lights the
electronics often broke creating an
unreliable life I remember thinking then
that car shops deserved a better life
and so did truckers electricians first
responders anyone else who works with
their hands when I started working at
the gas solution I knew this was a
project that I wanted to pursue I came
up with a rough concept a handheld area
light that was bright cordless portable
durable a life that was over engineered
to stand up the years of abuse and harsh
condition I pitched the idea to our CEO
Carrie Smith and he actually encouraged
me to pursue this project and see where
it led and now after two years and
countless hours of work we have the big
ass light bulb we wanted a life that was
bright as hell with 5,000 lumen at
maximum output it's everything you need
up to 48 hours of continuous lights on
battery power the light bar itself is
made of a chemically resistant sitel
glass filled nylon that means that you
can spray it off with common chemicals
the shape of the light itself was
actually designed to prevent it from
rolling away if you dropped it or set it
on the hood of a car
with this I 266 grading you can take it
outside and not worry if it gets rained
on we know that you were going to toss
around the life on so we over molded it
in key areas with the technology called
birth to flex the shock absorbent
now we're closer than ever to making the
big ass light bar reality we need your
help for the final stage of production
if your assistant will be able to begin
manufacturing and start shipping the
light bars to all contractors first
responders soldiers police officers and
anyone else to demand the product that
they can take to hell invest in return
you'll be the first customers to receive
the revolutionary big a slight loss this
has been a passionate project for me
it's something that I've worked on for
years and I'm very proud of what we've
come up with it is absolutely the best
handheld area light in the world bar
none
working in the security and payment
industry has completely open my eyes now
antiquated and messed up our digital
world really is seriously think about it
in terms of functionality it's like
we've been stuck in the 90s for the past
couple decades treatment why are we
still entering the same personal
information over and over again every
time we go online and recommend the
street addresses account number euros
first name last name credit card emo
birthday email address postal code
frustrating us what about logging in how
are supposed to remember endless
usernames and passwords it's a waste of
my heart only kidding words and don't
even get me started on security we
really think that our personal
information is secure
