in the load stary you can use it as
transportation print along onto subways
buses or even car trunks to a further
distance you can write it to get
breakfast or cursory a few blocks away
never need to worry about parking or
locking
when entering a restaurant with your
board in fact you can print to anywhere
I'm a friend of the actress people they
are heavy clumsy almost using the ryokan
skip only what we want is a revolution
of electron skateboards so we smashed
two bounces through batteries away who
bails out it's called on motors and
redesign a brand new ultra light
electricity board which history to
achieve the same inning impossible task
we had to redesign the motor to had it
inside wales as well as putting gearbox
and sensor inside we designed many
versions of remote-control running for a
better user experience instead of the
short-lived out we use the planetary
gears to provide unbeliev blaze from
power
sorry has perfect power system to
support high speed up to 20 miles hour
and growing up here of a circuit gray
strokes with a small remote in hand
anyone even with no experience can
easily control the board using our
braking and accelerating features
stirring is safe and smooth to write for
all users from beginners to experts
our technical team has top talents in
factory mechanic and software
engineering we won't attend young
people's way of transportation and your
support is essential for us thank you
the monolith is the easiest to use and
most intuitive electric skate ever
created this new emerging market
lightweight electric skates under 15
pounds is a pretty exciting new frontier
it transforms your errand on a weekend
or running to this corner store to pick
up vegetables into an activity that you
look forward to you do all the exact
same things that you do on a traditional
longboard skateboard except now you've
got the power to go up a hill at 20
miles an hour as fans of long boarding
and electric skates we kept having
issues with the existing boards on the
market they were heavy they looked bad
with their external motors and batteries
and the belts would break down and you
can't push it or ride it like a real
estate board that's why we've created an
entirely new technology and it's called
man to drive for the first time ever
we've actually put a motor inside the
wheel of a skateboard this has allowed
us to create a powered skateboard that
feels smooth intuitive and makes the
model if amazingly easy to use yet
powerful
my name is 0 7 s key I'm one of the
founder and the main engineer at the
board
theone I've been action sports athletes
our entire lives we actually met when we
respond sir by the same brand
you know from speed flying to
paragliding surfing skating we love
these sports because of the feelings
that created us and that's in large part
due to the feel of the board with the
monoliths in order to create the highest
performance product everything every
aspect of the design had to be done
customer the mentor technology has
allowed us to get rid of the external
motor and bedstead breakdown instead of
having a motor outside of the wheel that
turns a belt and then that belt turns a
gear and then that gear turns a wheel
everything's already been integrated
inside the wheel itself so one it looks
really clean but to because there's
nothing that's binding the wheel up once
you hit your top speed you just collide
and you get that coast
that's what can get with a normal skate
that's what we wanted to create with
removal of the external belts and years
we've been able to reduce the weight
significantly to create such a fun
thinking product we knew we had to build
a facility a team of action sport
athletes with engineering and product
design skills to manifest and innovative
products monolith is the only board in
the market with swappable battery packs
what this means that you essentially
have a limited range as soon as you
start to run low on one battery you just
swap the old for the new so in designing
and boards reflex remote we wanted to
focus mainly on comfort and secondly on
usability and then storage so using this
remote should be completely effortless
so we took a different approach with the
remote design the reflex has a
forward-facing tail this feature will
give the rider a sense of security
you can adjust or even open your hand
while riding and when you close it it'll
be right where you need it to control
the board again in keeping with imports
future for product design we've added
auxiliary USB ports onto the board you
can use this for charging remote or if
you're at the beach and you know the Sun
setting and your phone just ran out of
battery you can charge your phone so you
can get that one last night
our mobile app gives you complete
control of the electric skate experience
it allows you to customize your speeds
accelerations connect with other riders
and even recap on your latest session if
you're new to Electric skateboards our
beginner mode makes the model it's very
easy to get going for the first time in
addition our advanced and custom
settings allow their user to realize the
full potential and power of the board
we spent years developing this
technology and now we're ready to bring
it to manufacturing but we wouldn't be
here on Kickstarter if we didn't need
your help with your support we'll be
able to invest in the custom molds and
tooling to bring the model at the market
we can't wait for you to shape the
future electric space I can't wait for
you to shape the future of electric
skates we can't wait for you to shape
the future of anything steel so marble
is a dedicated team of engineers and
designers who are really passionate
about the project and passionate about
the idea of short range transportation
and sustainable transportation whether
it's community to work getting to the
subway or bus stop running errands or
trying to just get across a college
campus short trips and urban travel have
always been frustrated in a car we have
to deal with traffic parking and of
course rising fuel costs on a bicycle we
work up a sweat and then have to find a
safe place to lock it up we felt there
had to be a better way to handle these
short trips our goal at Marvel was to
create the lightest electric vehicle in
the world but also with an amazing user
experience we have spent the last two
years dedicated to crafting and refining
our marble electric skateboard the
lightest electric skateboard in the
world with an amazing team it's modern
technology and support from our
community we built the marble board to
be simple to use efficient and of course
exhilarating to ride the marble electric
skateboard is the lightest electric
skateboard in the world it weighs only
nine point nine pounds with one full
charge the board goes ten miles
that's not ten testing in the lab miles
its real-world conditions most of our
test riders are actually getting over
ten miles per charge the question we get
most is how fast does it go well it is
one of the fastest electric skateboards
it has over 2,000 watts of power and
will hit speeds of up to 20 miles an
hour it can actually hit 20 miles an
hour even going uphill
we realize that 20 miles an hour is
pretty quick so we have designed the
board settings to be complete
myzel through a smartphone app our app
that we call the dashboard lets you set
exactly what you want your top speed to
be and determine the level of
acceleration the best suits your right
side this allows you to perfectly tune
the board to your needs if you want you
can even directly control the throttle
of the board from our dashboard app
which will allow you to leave the
wireless handheld controller at home we
were able to achieve all of this by
using state-of-the-art carbon fiber and
Kevlar composites to create the deck
design that completely encases and
protects every bit of the electronics as
well as the battery cells on top of that
we're using incredibly efficient
three-phase DC motors battery technology
very similar to what you would find in
Tesla Model S our custom electronics are
being manufactured for us right here in
the United States and finally everything
is assembled tested quality controlled
and shipped from our facility here in
Tampa Florida a couple of surfaced from
California had a smart idea they stacked
some wheels under a wooden board so they
could surf on asphalt when there were no
waves fifty years later there's your
house since he was a kid
he's been riding every board he can
approach forward for the endless fight
for him skateboarding is a good way to
ride all year round
and yes it's a good ride but it could be
better
so if he had a pretty smart idea to it's
called meta a couple of months down the
line monster trip to Morocco he meant
Killian we tells Killian about meadow he
needed this car so they decide of time
to bring the ass faster
meadow is the first and only
state-of-the-art compact electric drive
system that can fit under any skateboard
within minutes it can transform any
normal staple into an electric
skateboard so Meadow is just the small
two point five kilo component put a cast
the capacity to upgrade your favorite
board into the most dynamic and
high-quality electric skateboard on the
market all you have to do is unscrew the
rear track of your board replace it with
a mallet or any way to go not of Kilian
tell you all about the new details the
heart of metal is the mantra food and
we're really proud to say that it's been
developed tested and produced in Germany
before we found Melo I was an electric
car engineer at BMW this definitely
opened some doors for we start looking
for the best partners in supply they
immediately share their vision of a
compact yet potent in wheel motor for
direct transmission and thus maximum
riding pleasure even if you are an
absolute skateboard rookie the handling
of Melo is really simple with the
intuitive hand control all functions are
just under your thumb finding the right
battery for Melo was a challenge on the
one hand he wants to an endless ride on
the other hand we wanted an S little
weight as possible the solution is a
custom-made swappable battery pack so in
case you really want to go for an
endless ride you can easily exchange it
on the go okay kin-yuen thank you so if
you think now right story great product
what do you need me for
let you wanna sum it up
derived as eboard you simply lean
forward to go and lean back to stop the
Seaboard is equipped with weight sensing
foot pads which means you lean forward a
little bit to go slowly alongside your
friend walking and leaning forward a
little bit more hit the top speed of 17
miles per hour the idea for the Seaboard
came to us while studying mechanical
engineering at the university of
southern california at USC traffic sucks
and there's no parking so nearly
everyone rides a bike or a skateboarding
class and we thought let's design a
device that's faster and easier to ride
than a skateboard and more fun and
portable than a bike
our final semester senior project has
turned into a three-year development
process the result is the Zboard
the weight sensing electric skateboard z
board features a maple deck front and
rear foot pads that control an electric
motor and off-road wheels that will
handle any terrain it even has a built
in handle for convenience and
regenerative braking to extend battery
life the z-boy is a blast to ride and
can add some fun to your everyday
short-range commutes so take your Z
board next time you go to the ATM or
pick up your dry cleaning or get coffee
for the office the Z board is ready to
go all we need is your backing funds
will go towards manufacturing our
initial inventory of Z boards made right
here in Southern California</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
