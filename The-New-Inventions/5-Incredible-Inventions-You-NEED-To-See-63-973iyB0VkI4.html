who wakes up early dive straight into a
morning meditation is super productive
at work drinks those eight glasses of
water and always hits the gym but let's
be real living that life means building
better habits and our brains want to
follow the ones we already have not the
new ones we're trying to cram in but
sometimes all you need is the right
nudge hi I'm Kayla and meet modi a smart
companion for building better habits we
created modi with a distinct purpose to
empower people to take those small steps
that over time result in big impacts in
our health and happiness these more than
just a cute face Modi is designed the
latest insights from both behavioral
science and social robotics when you
place Modi in your home or office every
time you walk by he becomes an instant
reminder to keep committed each time you
do your habit Modi is there to help you
track and celebrate your small bits
giving you that immediate gratification
the better you get the more excited 30
cuz but slack off and Modi might get
angry for sat or stay purely emerging
Modi knows what works best for you
because he's connected to the web he's
constantly analyzing and evolving so he
knows how you're progressing if you're
at risk of falling off and when to send
the right types of nudges specifically
free compared all this to the same daily
push notification you keep ignoring so
how can something so simple actually
change your behavior to tell you about
how we form good habits let's start with
something that we're all familiar with
forming a bad habit boo cookie
fundamentally your brain needs three
things to form a habit a trigger a
routine and a reward when I saw that
plate of cookies I didn't even think
about grabbing one my brain immediately
triggered me and I knew that eating that
cookie would reward me with its sweet
Joey deliciousness your brain forms good
habits in just the same way by
completing this loop over and over again
modi works by seamlessly integrating
these three elements into your busy
lifestyle modi himself is a trigger more
specifically what's known as an
environmental cue and by using modi your
habit is already set up to be small
distinct and actionable finally movie
celebrations provide an immediate reward
he makes sure that you feel satisfied
and accomplished each and every time and
perhaps big guilty if you're not Moniz
the outcome of over a year of human
centered design and engineering rigor we
discovered that triggers and rewards
driven by emotion are far more potent
than numbers lists or alarms now we're
finally ready to release movies straight
to you the only question is what habit
will you born
when we can't help you magically climb
Mount Everest or run a marathon
overnight he's there to help you do
something more essential become a better
view one habit at a time
hello
I'm
ah
this is a tie he always loved eating he
recently made a decision to eat
healthier he recently made this decision
every week for the past 10 years but it
I did not improve his nutrition because
well food is awesome and old habits die
hard then he had this amazing idea what
if he could create something that would
go everywhere with him blog his eating
habits analyze them and give him
recommendations in real time this is how
he came up with Brian
Brian was he ties eating pal he was with
him all the time and really cared about
his nutrition reminding him to snack
less chew more any better Brian was a
hit soon enough everybody wanted one the
sporty girl from the gym they always on
a dive guy from the cafe and that woman
who always snacks between meetings but
as time went by ty felt like he needed
to make something smaller more
scientific and less awkward yeah so now
back by leading academic clinical
dietitians top nutritionists and experts
in design engineering and software he's
proud to introduce bit byte bit byte as
a revolutionary tiny device that helps
you track analyse and change your eating
habits if the first ever wearable device
that helps you improve your nutrition
with bit bite you know exactly how much
you eat how often and how fast it helps
you make better decisions and follow
them bit by this war on your ear like an
earphone only unlike in your phone it
doesn't lock airflow the earphones
patent-pending design was specially
designed for the shape of your ear so it
would feel extra comfortable you can
snap it onto the slim bracelet or pin
and always have it with you bit byte
analyzes your strange sounds and gathers
information about your eating place and
the number of choose you've made so it
knows how much food you consume its app
shows beautiful infographics of your
eating habits and also helps motivate
you to keep up with your goals you can
tell bit by it's voice-activated sensors
what you're eating and receive a daily
automated food lock it's also designed
to integrate with Apple watch Android
wear and other fitness platforms and
diet apps and it even functions as a
great bluetooth headset bit byte uses
pattern recognition and machine learning
algorithms to study your eating habits
it will give you live recommendations to
help you achieve better outcomes say you
usually have a snack at 10pm bit bite
will notice and recommend some fruit at
nine-thirty so you won't feel like
snacking later on or if you're over
eating at lunch bit bite will notice
your poll and suggest you put your fork
down even if you're not consuming enough
calcium bed bite will notice it and
recommend that you have a yogurt basic
it's the missing link to a healthier you
the thymus team have been working on bit
by for a long time and they're ready for
mass production all they need is your
help so if you care about your nutrition
support bit bite it will help you eat
better feel better and be healthier bit
byte jar bike is the easiest and
quickest way to learn how to ride a
bicycle using a jar by kids can learn a
ride without training wheels or
stabilizers and learn a ride in one
afternoon as far as a child learning the
rider bike confidences is everything
having a product that it gives that
stability from the outset could really
fast track child's development and
confidence in Saigon I mean as far as
I'm concerned the the gyro bike is the
paper clip of the bicycle world I mean
why is why is nobody on it before it's
such a brilliant concept well any
spinning disk is a gyroscope it's just a
matter of what you do with the gyroscope
to put it to work for you when you spin
a disc it creates a force it doesn't
want to move off its axis what we do is
we turn it on its side and when this
spinning disc is tilted it actually
turns the wheel so that the child can
continue riding up right gyro bike has
engineering happening all around the
world and specifically in Holland we
have advanced war going on with computer
simulation models to understand the art
of balancing a bicycle when a bicycle
this is writing at a low speed in this
model we can see a house table the
bicyclist we implemented the gyro wheel
into the model the gyro wheel is doing a
great effort on under stability of the
bicycle
Jagran can help I could see the
opportunity here not just for children
but started to think about how this
technology could help more people
a lot of children with disability get
left behind and therefore something that
people take for granted like riding a
bike and not being a 12 year old with
stabilisers would give them so much
confidence go Ani go well that's the
farthest well up the first time she's
ever actually got on a bike and being
able to ride out you think it's it's
really fascinating when you see the gyro
bike for the first time and that it
doesn't fall over and that's really
revolutionary I haven't seen anything
like that before I must be fantastic for
a child's confidence when they're
learning how to cycle from a customer
perspective that that speed and
simplicity of teaching the child the
cycle that process can happen quickly
then you know the learning becomes a
small part of the journey and the child
can can then start exploring and seeing
how far they can go mark one was
invented by the University students at
Dartmouth and they produced a very
successful product like all version ones
in any product there's lots of learnings
from it and we took all of that learning
and put it into version to it the
principal improvement in the in the new
gyro bike wheel is the electronics are
greatly improved the new product is more
efficient it'll run longer it's lighter
it'll produce more force and we've added
a great deal of fun in the mega sound
and the ability to change sounds after
you've learned how to ride a bike using
the product you can reduce the settings
until the bike does less balanced and
the child does more until it's
completely turned off and if you want to
make the bike lighter you can actually
take the cover off remove the flywheel
and put the cover back on we listen to
our customers and we've developed a
wireless control that allows you to
change the stabilities chain to the
audio function and also change the
volume controls
we've got as far as we can in terms of
design and development and we're really
looking for people to support us and get
behind us so that we can move to the
next phase of production and get this
product out to as many people as
possible
I love bikes I grew up on bikes some of
my best memories in life are on my BMX
with my friends I want to instill that
type of memory that type of love in
product with anyone who touches his jar
by genre by engineering is all about
balancing 404 so we're always balancing
and that's why our tagline is
brilliantly balance I think any dog
owner can relate to it you look into
their eyes and share a brief connection
and see that they really want to
understand so when you think about
trying to talk to your pet there's
really only so much you can say but what
if somehow you can communicate more what
would you ask them first this was the
inspiration for clever pet clever pad is
an interactive device that reward your
dog for solving simple puzzles we know
that when your reward an animal for
performing certain behavior it's more
likely to perform that behavior again in
the future we use this every time we try
to get our doc to do something for a
treat and to the most important factors
of making this work or repetition
consistency so clever that uses your
dog's morning meal the time it spends at
home to encourage interactions
throughout the day
it starts out simple your dog will get a
treat whenever she presses any of clever
bets buttons once she's got this down
clever pit makes her job a little bit
tougher now she only gets a treat when
she presses the button that's lit up
once she's learned that the game changes
again clever pet gradually teaches her
to interact a more interesting ways and
she stays active and happy all day long
the really great thing is that this is
all automatic clever pet engages your
dog even when it can't be helped my
favorite part about working with dogs is
seeing progress on a daily basis I've
learned a lot about how dogs interact
with their surroundings and the most
important takeaway is that a dog to the
job is a happy dog what's really
interesting is that all my clients have
the same request they all want a happy
healthy and well behaved dog so when I
was first introduced to clever pet I
learned that there was something for
these problems keeping our dogs engaged
and busy while we're not at home I've
introduced dogs to just about every
interactive toy and device on the market
and nothing challenges your dog like
clever men does we begin with simple pet
behaviors and have since advanced some
more complex interactions at clever pet
we're driven by compassion and curiosity
to find a way to care for pets when
they're alone and get a better sense for
who they are so whether you're looking
to keep your pet healthy and happy or
simply dealing with your dog's anxiety
when you leave the house clever pet
adapts to meet your dog's needs clever
pet engage idle pause</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
