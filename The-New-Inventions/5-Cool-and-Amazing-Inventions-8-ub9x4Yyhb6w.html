the reason that most people either stop
an exercise routine or never start one
in the first place is because we tend to
gravitate toward students that we
perceive as pleasurable and a waiver of
things we perceive as painful and let's
face it most people place exercise and
especially core training on the painful
end of the spectrum now imagine exercise
being so effective so convenient and so
much fun that you don't even realize
that you're doing it and with your help
and my product this can be a reality I'm
matross I'm a physical therapist and the
creator of the stabilizer core training
and gaming system the stabilizer was
designed to be an advanced shoulder and
core training system for use in physical
therapy clinics and with athletic
trainers but when I realized you could
play games on it with your phone or
tablet and it was addictive I newer
needed to be available to everyone how
does it work you simply find games on
iTunes or Google Play that are
controlled by the tilting of your phone
then place your phone on the stabilizer
and control the game action while
flaking or doing squats and with
streaming devices like Apple TV or
Google chromecast you can stream the
content from your phone on to your
television and everyone can watch you
play imagine planking or squatting 45
minutes and actually enjoying it my kids
would play for hours competing to be the
first to complete the next level of a
game and when their friends come over
they'd rather play on the stabilizers
and sit on the couch and watch movies
this product could reinvigorate k
through 12 gym classes as we take the
one thing that kids care about most
their cell phones and let them use them
to streep train we're just scratching
the surface for the potential of this
product I envision an explosion of game
naps with toys that can be controlled by
tilting your thong the stabilizer has
plenty candles that are perfect for
upper body strength and stability put
plates that are perfect for a lower-body
strength and stability and if you want
both you can use them simultaneously and
now you're balancing on two areas the
size of a dime and if you want more
traditional workout tools the stabilizer
can do that too it can be converted into
push-up handles and medicine ball
aerobic steps and even an ab roller
giving you hundreds of exercise options
but with the added benefit of being
destabilized which forces your body to
work even harder than normal which not
only strengthens those critical deep
stabilizing muscles but also cuts your
workout time in half the stabilizer fits
in a duffel bag you can take it on
vacation or to work and when you're done
with it at stores in a closet or under
your desk everything you see in this
video was done with prototypes with your
help you could be the owner of one of
the first stabilizers ever created
Fitness should be fun and now it can be

reinforced so it's super strong also the
end of the lock works is a bottle opens
