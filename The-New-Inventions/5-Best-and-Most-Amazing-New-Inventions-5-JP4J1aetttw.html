old and this clock is same old same old
isn't it time for an upgrade introducing
glance clock the clock that can tell you
that that and that at a glance glance
clocks brightly lit LEDs represent
information you choose to see ahead of
time it tells you who's calling gives
you reminders shows you the weather and
displays your schedule by showing you
all your appointments meetings and
events in different colors so you know
exactly how your day is laid out let's
see how Jeff uses his glance talk
connect glance talk to your fitness
tracker and have it show how well you
slept or didn't sleep how many steps
you've taken or haven't taken
check what the weather is like so you
know what to wear before going outside
or use the timer so you don't forget
about the important things and know when
to leave the house when your uber is
outside glance clock lets you make the
right decisions and take action hey
amantha the creator of glass clock we
decided to create a product that
seamlessly combined beauty and
information a clock was the perfect item
top grade because it's familiar
beautiful and functional at the Greek
glass you will know more than just the
time all information you want we'll be
right in front of you we are really
excited about what they've created and
would really love your support so leave
this behind and move forward pre-order
your glance clock today my name is Tracy
Howell and I'm from Overland Park Kansas
my son Britain is six years old and has
autism so I'm Eileen I'm Charlie's mom
Charlie's a little boy who is three
years old he's severely autistic what's
great about lekha is that my son
immediately connected with this robot is
this ball that was running around and
coming back to him and responding to his
call when I saw Charlie playing hide and
seek with it I mean that's something
that a neurotypical kid we just kind of
do anyway but Charlie doesn't usually do
that I've noticed my son had a very
rough day at school today he had some
really challenging time but came home
and took 30 minutes to spend with lekha
and is a much more calm and relaxed
child I think it's shown hey there's
your proof but it's a pretty remarkable
product and to have it in the home of
the outstanding I'm gonna disown us I
know and together we want to have
exceptional children live exceptional
night that's why we created this little
guy liquor meet lekha the first robotic
interactive smart toy designed
specifically for children with special
needs children with autism live in a
world where they are constantly
overwhelmed with sensory stimulation it
is often hard for them to connect to
other people or foe
it's on a single activity for a long
time that's why parents and therapists
often use reinforcers to teach the
children for summit will be music for
others colors and lights or just
vibrations using these reinforces teach
rules and guidelines that the children
is paramount as it helps them understand
and interact with the world around them
lleges unique strength is in combining
both the activity and the reinforcer
within one toy like I can play music
move around change colors and even has a
screen to display images icons or
emoticons this makes the child more
motivated and engaged because their
attention is focused on the toy and the
task at hand not just the reinforcement
lekha has been tested with more than a
hundred children in france and in the
u.s. it's been trialed at home with
parents with therapists and specialized
centers and hospitals and the results
are quite simply amazing this could be a
great great tool for therapists to
connect with these kids keep them
engaged which is the second very
difficult thing to do and use it to
connect and teach them we're really
seeing that we have something that will
truly make an impact on the whole
community working with exceptional
children and that's the data that they
collect and passes back to our
monitoring platform identifying what's
the next step in therapy or what is
something that maybe the child is
mastered it would be remarkable to be
able to share that data and also be able
to share that with educators now we're
actually getting into the field of
technology and how it can work with
individuals with autism how it can
empower therapists to work with those
individuals and ultimately I believe
will help us from a research perspective
nika is not just a toy it's truly an
education that aid and we are working
hard to bring you the best application
like a will of numerous apps and
activities available on the App Store
right from the start and new absolutely
developed and released continuously it's
important to us that each child makes
the most out of his amazing toy but it's
really more than just a toy
it's a companion an interactive robot
and a wonderful educational tool it's
lekha from the beginning of the project
we went to school special education
schools and I was sick seeing kids
playing with the robot and we loved it
and I wanted to go further and make the
project will I haven't seen it anywhere
else besides you guys with leica there
are some of course apps or games but
nothing that is a motion sensored or
nothing that is really interactive with
the child and that respect I think that
like is really coming upon something new
and inspirational for children we really
believe that we have to get this
technology into the children's hands as
quickly as possible and that's why we
are here to ask you to give us a hand
you can help us by spreading the word
and if you are interacting with
exceptional children other people around
you are you can order later now they
gain Swedish means to play in to heal
and that's exactly what we are going to
do with love from the like a team
think about all the gadgets you need to
remember to recharge and bring with you
every day it's tedious annoying and
frustrating when you forget the reasons
simple we need our devices charged in
with us at all times and there hasn't
been a solution that actually simplifies
our life until now meet smart bomb the
world's first customizable power bank
with intelligent wireless charging that
you don't ever have to remember to
recharge or bring with you again sport
club is much more than just a battery
about we built in bluetooth key tracking
an appt with intelligent notifications a
removable cable and the ability to
easily add features through its modular
design so if I want to watch my favorite
movies will need more space for photos
or videos on my phone it can also be my
external flash drive or from hanging out
with friends it can be my bluetooth
speaker and if I want a new module I'll
be able to get it through the smart bomb
marketplace or if the module I want
doesn't exist yet I'll even be able to
build it myself but what really makes
this product magical is that I never
have to think about charging it ever
again
since your keys typically stay in one
spot when you get home we knew this was
the perfect place to recharge them we
created a beautiful charging surface
using state-of-the-art residents
wireless charging technology so you can
drop your keys onto it in either
orientation and without any bus and
you're smart Bob will always be charged
and ready for you to use when you leave
your house you can also plug your phone
ana ma joins as water bottle and place
them on the charging surface for all
limp to charge and we built in a male
USB adapter so you can charge your
smartphone in any USB port for those
times when you're not at home but I know
what you're thinking I always lose my
keys or don't always put them in the
same place well we thought of that too
and have created a smartphone app which
will recognize when you get home and
that you're smart fob isn't charging and
send you a notification to put it where
it belongs and if you can't find your
keys it'll even help you locate them
using our key tracking features though
right into our app with our breakthrough
intelligent notifications smart fob can
connect to your calendar and suggest
modules to bring with you based on your
schedule like if you're traveling the
next day or have a heavy day of meetings
it can suggest you bring extra battery
modules with you with our app you can
check smart plugs battery percentage and
charging status and access your files on
