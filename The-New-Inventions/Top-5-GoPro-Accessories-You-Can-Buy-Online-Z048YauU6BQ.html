these have transformed the way that we
record video I'm going to show you how
to take it to the next level introducing
Vittra molest it changes the way you
record literally the same camera you use
every day will now be recording in 3d
vikrama is made to be durable and
lightweight so you can take it with you
anywhere just put the lens on and that's
it you're good to go can you imagine
recording disk and this and this all in
immersive 3d we can because we did
you might have seen someone with one of
these 3d rings but probably not they're
bulky and super expensive on top of that
need extra software just to create the
3d video bitume is different he creates
the same 3d effect with just one camera
and its video is ready to be watched no
software needed just upload and enjoy
how well you see that's because you do I
they see things from slightly different
perspective and your brain can find them
so you can see them don't believe me
well try catching a ball when I close
bit remote does the same thing it uses
mirrors to record two perspectives the
videos end up looking like this when you
watch them in a viewer their 3d we're
actually going to start shipping victim
LMK before the end of the campaign
that's right we're skipping the lenses
before the campaign even finishes we
came to indy gogo to find people who
wanted to change the way that we record
so let's get dirty story is it climbing
El Capitan sir from the Gold Coast or
just er your captain to superhero if you
want to be among the first to start
recording your life in 3d and pick up a
victim a lens I was taken according to
the next level hi I'm Craig strong
almost 15 years ago as a professional
photographer I was going out and getting
weird optics and focusing with them in
the equally weird ways and that ended up
being the foundation and the start of
lensbaby since 2004 we've been designing
manufacturing and distributing lenses
that help you find your visual voice our
latest lens is a circular 180 plus for
gopro like all ends maybe lenses it
creates a unique and fun perspective our
lens increases your dope
you to 185 degrees in every direction
giving you the ability to show more of
your adventures the circular 180 plus
expands on GoPros first person point of
view making it even more immersive
it just pops right on the front of your
GoPro housing and you're ready to go
your GoPro is the camera you can take
anywhere this lens is rugged and
waterproof to go with it it has nearly
infinite depth of field tack sharp from
edge to edge and the motion effects are
phenomenal things right in front of the
camera are kind of go on a normal pace
but the moment you pass it I just sit
right by lens maybe has a lot of amazing
projects in the works we're bringing
this lens to Kickstarter so that we can
get it in your hands way sooner than we
could otherwise
lensbaby has an amazing community of
still and video photographers this is
our first offering into the action
sports and immersive video world we made
the lensbaby circular 180 plus so that
you can push the limits of how you see
and document your world
is it on between the endless hours of
sifting through hundreds of extra photos
dealing with wasted memory space and
lost battery life we decided it was time
to improve the GoPro experience
introducing go Hawk a new way to capture
the action the go Hawk is an expansion
pack that adds exciting new features to
your gopro hero4 the go Hawk is a
plug-and-play solution that adds an
external shutter switch remote LED
indicator and allows you to connect a
USB power input so you can shoot all day
with the go Hawk you can use any type of
remote shutter trigger include a bite
tongue and handlebars with ease set your
camera to continuous or burst photo mode
to grab high quality still photos of the
action and formed yet our flexible LED
indicator lets you know when you are
ready to shoot I went to add the
auxiliary battery the red LED mimics the
cameras record and cheddar lights the
matter what mode you were shooting it go
Hawk uses a side latch to secure to the
back of the gopro hero4 to ensure that
it stays put the design is compatible
with existing GoPro fixes the go Hawk is
perfect for action sport photographers
and videographers who want more control
over their shooting after 10 long months
of development we created a better
solution that works right out of the box
requiring no additional soft</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
