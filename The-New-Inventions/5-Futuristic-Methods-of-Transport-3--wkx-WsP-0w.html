experience with us hi my name is Scott
Taylor I created the lift so that people
could discover how great it is to have a
cargo bike in your life
the lift turns your bike into a cargo
bike it's super easy to use it's still
your bike but when you need to carry
more the lift is ready for you things
you couldn't have carried with your
regular bike are easy with the lift you
can grab your bike attach it to the lift
and go find an adventure
typically front loading cargo bikes
start at about $3,000 we wanted to lift
to be sub $1000 and we made that goal
without sacrificing quality we're making
the lifts here in Colorado I teamed up
with an expert carpenter and a Colorado
based custom bicycle frame builder this
ensures a quality product and it
drastically cuts out the wait time
typically seen in overseas manufacturing
this is the first cargo bike that almost
anybody can afford and kickstart is a
perfect place to start that we finished
the lift but we need some help so we can
turn your bike into a cargo bike our
local suppliers are waiting for our
orders
it's rare for established by companies
to collaborate on a new product together
especially to grow a new category that
is barely recognized by our industry for
this project we at earn an extra cycle
each brought our unique strengths
together it was a natural partnership
because we shared the same vision
removing barriers urban mobility hi I'm

about Josh is that he's a brilliant
pragmatic doer who is deeply passionate

to finding new and innovative ways to
make bikes fit better into our everyday
lives and they have the patents to prove
it hi I'm Ross Evans inventor and
founder of extra cycle 20 years ago I
set out to make a bike that would change
the world as an idealistic engineering
student I landed in war-torn Nicaragua
in a tin and cinderblock shed I welded
together a bike that would alter the
course of my life and as it turned out
the lives of people worldwide
the city is full of incredible
opportunity and things to explore
designing a bike that can unlock the
hidden treasures of our cities is a
challenging design problem for this
project we at turn an extra cycle each
mod are unique strengths together to
build a special bike the cargo node
