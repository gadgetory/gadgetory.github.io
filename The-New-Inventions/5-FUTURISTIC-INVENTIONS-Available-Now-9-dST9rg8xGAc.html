a lot of fun growing up but the
technology just wasn't good enough to
let us do what we really wanted back in
1997 we set out to turn pogo sticks into
a whole new sport our concept was based
on the idea of having a portable
trampoline something you pick up three
six or even Ken feet high on but also
take any where you want to go the v4 is
the portable trampoline we've always
dreamed up with the v4 you have the
ability to add a remove air and
completely change the stiffness of the
bounce someone who weighs 300 pounds can
jump on the same exact be forward as
someone who only weighs 80 pounds all
you need to do is change the air
pressure in less than a minute
you can perfectly tune the v4 to each
riders preferences pumping more air in
to jump higher and taking air out to
jump lower this makes sharing it with
friends and family a fun-filled
experience that everyone can enjoy
you can also collapse the v4 to make
transportation a breeze whether you're a
pro or just stepping onto the v4 for the
very first time you'll love the
weightless flight like experience you'll
get the basics in minutes and from that
point on there's no limit to how far you
can challenge yourself with the v4
you'll be able to jump up onto ledges
down stairs and over gaps of all sizes
while nailing down some pretty awesome
trips after playing around on the v4
you'll never look at your surroundings

features that are too high for bikes and
skateboards are perfect for the v4 so

it's time to drink coffee naked with the
all-new bod Coffee system no more cold
brewing with mason jars buckets and
quarts or 3-foot towers that look more
like a chemistry set than a coffee maker
with the bod you can brew anytime
anywhere
it's compact modular portable spill
proof and shatter proof and with our max
extraction stainless filter you'll never
buy a filter again and the BOD makes up
to 15% more extract than other kool
Brewers best of all it's super easy to
use here's how it works
just add coarse ground coffee to the
stainless filter attach the filter cap
and insert the filter cartridge into the
brew chamber fill with cold water to the
fill line and brew for 12 to 24 hours
with the removable count up timer you
can discover your perfect brew number
each brew cycle produces 24 ounces of
super concentrated sediment free coffee
extract that makes 10 to 12 cups of hot
or iced coffee after brewing just
flipped to transfer the coffee extract
into the built-in bean canteen which
stores conveniently in the refrigerator
for hotter iced coffee on demand you can
even rebou the grounds a second time and
get three additional cups of regular
strength coffee a coffee extract is
super convenient for a hot cup of coffee
in seconds pour 1 to 3 ounces of coffee
extract using the EZ port twist caps
into the shot glass to measure and
dilute with hot water
