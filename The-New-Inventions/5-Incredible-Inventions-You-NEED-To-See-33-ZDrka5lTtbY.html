blogger when I travel I like keep things
light use my iPhone to capture moments
and this is the last thing I want to see
with videos music applications and games
things add up quickly
unfortunately storage costs money that's
not all I have to sort out the contents
use iTunes backup sit for hours and hope
it doesn't stop I dine is a simple
solution that adds extra storage to my
phone magnetically snap it on the back
of the case and twist 15 degrees lock it
awesome let's see what I can do with
iodine for the whole day 10 a.m. Times
Square is full of excitement look at all
these mascots and tourists taking
pictures everyone is taking pictures it
feels like a competition 2 p.m. got in
the taxi sat in traffic came to Bryant
Park took pictures more pictures more
pictures and even more pictures no need
to delete or transfer just yet
5 p.m. came to the subway station listen
to a live gym but there's no reception
on the subway not my problem I have all
I'm using Ida 7 p.m. went to a famous
restaurant five stars for the good food
took even more pictures interview with
an owner what you got with that Wow
what the hell is this where did you get
these iodine is ready for mass
production and started pre-sales on
Kickstarter 9 p.m. came back to the
hotel room time to check out what I got
today transferred all my footage to my
laptop with iodine USB holder file
transfer is easier and faster simply
drag-and-drop files in and out of iodine
yes steady
it also comes with a lightning holder
which I can stick to the bottom of my
phone I totally forgot about my
girlfriend gotta go
this is my girlfriend Sarah what did you
do today
so do more without measuring tapes help
us measure distances and the dimensions
of different objects but a measuring
tape doesn't work in every situation
why isn't there a single tool that lets
us measure everything now there is
introducing bagel the smart tape measure
bagel lets you measure just about
anything at home and at work
bagel has three different modes spring
mode wheel mode and remote my spring
mode is great for measuring straight
lines curves and around corners wheel
mode lets you measure irregular or odd
shaped objects and it also makes taking
measurements with one hand much easier
remote mode lets you measure objects
that are far away and out of your reach
after you're done measuring you'll need
a way to record your measurements using
pen and paper can be a real hassle with
bagel you can quickly and easily save
your measurements with voice
descriptions just take your measurement
push the Save button and then tag a
voice memo to it dog the future ADA when
you're done bangle will send your
measurements to bagels mobile app via
bluetooth this mobile application lets
you review your saved measurements and
share them with your friends bagel is
precise it uses our patented technology
to make sure you always get an accurate
measurement also bagel has an easy to
read digital display that's viewable in
most lighting conditions in the past few
years
also some measuring devices have become
smarter and made our lives easier
it's my skillz smart thermometers and
even smart watches but when it comes to
measuring size we still use a tape
measure which is more than a century old
why don't you innovate the way we
measure size so we created bagel a smart
a measure we put a lot of effort into
creating bagel our team works night and
day to make the best quality product
which is finally design
we have our final prototype that is
ready for mass production now we need
your help to deliver this amazing
product to everyone please help us bring
this bagel to life
thank you
