this is Matt and I'm Jay we are the
developers for the next generation in
micro flying robots called the dragonfly
for hundreds of years man has looked to
the sky to fly like the birds our
inspiration comes from one insect in
particular the dragonfly with unmatched
flight performance in the insect world
the tech tech dragonfly is a lightweight
robotic insect that collects and relays
information while flying like a bird or
hovering like an insect weighing in at
less than one ounce approximately the
weight of a double a battery the
Dragonfly is the latest in ultra micro
avionics with stereoscopic vision flight
control systems and a camera-ready
operating system this means you can do
amazing aerial photography spy on people
secure your house or use it as the
next-gen gaming platform we've all seen
helicopters we've all seen quadrotors
and airplanes but really all of them are
bulky low on battery and really just a
one-trick pony the tech tech dragonfly
is really in a league of its own it
hovers like the best quadrotors and
helicopters it flies like a best of
airplanes it's really all these
different Flyers combined the Dragonfly
gets smaller and smaller with each
iteration while enhancing its
performance something physically
impossible for all the other flying
systems what you have is the world's
first aerial photography tool that's
efficient user-friendly and you can take
it in your pocket wherever you go you
can make it faster and more dynamic for
gaming or higher endurance and more
stable for aerial photography we offer
three different electronics packages
ranging from basic flight control using
gyroscopes and accelerometers to more
advanced packages which include gps
high-definition video multiple cameras
and wireless communication the packages
are the lightest in the world going from
3 up to 5 grams weighing less than a
quarter and are smaller than a stick of
gum what you get is your choice of
dragonfly robotic insect fully
customizable software development kit a
smart flying instructional manual and
other high end users get a google pad
the unit comes ready to fly out of the
box we are offering the Dragonfly
development platform as a pre-launch kit
so we can get the dragonfly in your
hands to let you experience the newest
