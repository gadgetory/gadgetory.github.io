can adopt elbow is an affordable
educational and easy to assemble robot
it takes less than an hour to assemble
and we'll teach you about robotics the
ant whoa has six legs and walks just
like an ant
plus it is also a robot and plus robot
equals and both designed for anyone with
an inquisitive mind ant Bo is a great
starting point for young inventors and
for people interested in steam education
even if you are not a maker it is still
a cool robot companion that you will
have fun with once assembled you can
control ant Bo by remote by your own
voice or even by drawing lines with more
than one ant Bo you can even make them
fight each other n po enhances
problem-solving abilities when you are
familiar with how it works
tweak its code and make it do different
things you can also upgrade your robot
with dozens of different sensor modules
and program it via Arduino scratch or
when do ANFO is connected it collects
user data and uploads it to the cloud
users will be able to check metrics like
distance skill levels and
accomplishments and share with friends n
PO is intelligent it has 30 neurons that
enable it to learn to adapt just like a
real creature as time goes it becomes
smarter faster and more capable tampo
also has emotional reactions to
different scenarios for example glancing
left and right when it feels inquisitive
trembling when it feels threatened and
showing affection and loyalty we are an
experienced team in the design and
manufacture of innovative robot products
and we believe aunt beau is a perfect
start help support our project and give
aunt beau a home thank you hi my name is
Eric I'm a passionate kite surfer
engineer and the CEO of Revell the
Revell Arc is the world's smartest 4k
action camera so why is our cameras so
smart
well we've built in four different
sensors into this camera that measure
elevation rotation speed magnetic north
as well as other motion telemetry
we use it for electronic image
stabilization which takes out all the
bumps and jitters from your video but
beyond that we've built in a secondary
stabilization system which has a motor
built into the back of the camera which
keeps it always level to the horizon no
matter what you're doing including if
you mount the camera on a hubcap of back
I think of it as a gimbal a camera and
more combined into one compact camera
which is waterproof and you can mount
anywhere you're not gonna mount this
anywhere this means you can kite loop
barrel roll and even backflip while the
rebel art keeps your footage stable and
level to the horizon this has never been
possible before with any other camera or
a gimbal system so what else do we do
with all of this information we capture
all kinds of live data including how
fast you were going how much air time
you got even how many g-forces you
pulled on top of all that you can
connect external sensors like a heart
rate monitor to measure your excitement
when things get a little crazy
the final piece of the puzzle is our
sensory AI which analyzes the data
associated with your footage and makes
intelligent decisions it then determines
your most exciting moments and
automatically creates a shareable video
without hours of physical editing or
even a computer at revel we believe that
life was made for adventuring not
editing we want to make it as easy as
possible for you to shoot edit and share
your best moments instantly we can't
wait to see what you will be able to
create with the Rebel arc thank you
these days we spend up to 10 times more
with our devices than we do with our
children which memories will last a
lifetime for your child
memorable hits that get the heart racing
happy moments with his loved ones
those special times and playing with
Reds
unforgettable journeys to distant lands
encounters with incredible animals and
birds and how these amazing things came
to life he will remember as one game
ends
another one begins
cherished evenings with
magical voyages throughout an imaginary
universe as the little kids drift away
the big kids come out to play</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
