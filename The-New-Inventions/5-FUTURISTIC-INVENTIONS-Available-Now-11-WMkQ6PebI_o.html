can be a handful when not feeling well
taking a child's temperature can provide
you with tremendous insight into their
health but accurately taking a child's
temperature can be a challenge at
wishbone we've created the world's
smallest and smartest non-contact
thermometer perfect for taking your
child's temperature in under two seconds
comparing to traditional thermometer
wishbone is much smaller works faster
and is less prone to user error and it
doesn't contain mercury wishbone can
also track past readings and offers
better ways to manage your data wishbone
is great for other things too like
determining how hot the milk is or
checking the temperature outdoors or
even taking your own temperature which
is especially helpful for parents who
are trying to conceive the most striking
feature of wishbone is its unique y
shaped design on one end of branch is an
accurate infrared sensor pointing at an
angle so that you can view the display
comfortably and the other branch
contains a battery ensuring a consistent
and accurate reading while allowing
wishbone to work on both iphone and
android devices as a father and a baby
product store owner I know the hassle of
taking a child temperature from my own
experience and for my customers
pledge now and let's make wishbone a
reality
over the last year we've been projecting
a device that allows you to make
melodies to play drums and to manipulate
sound by using your own hand we created
an instrument that is easy to use fun to
play with and that gives space to
hundreds of new ways to execute a show
I'm very happy to introduce you to our
first wearable MIDI instrument the t8
the tas is a midi controller so you can
use it to control infinite combination
of sounds screams piano drums and given
to control vijay softwares we are
creating tons of touches to integrate
our product with the most possible
software and applications we focus on
creating a beautiful light and resilient
product that's what we decided to
separate the dresses from the glove so
the black thread post the controls and
fills your movements while the glove is
your gestures this way we obtain a more
ergonomic and solid an essential design
we were without musicians and people who
never played an instrument to choose the
best answer configuration and to
implement the software interface with
the th players can now browse through
the note sets modify sounds and play in
a whole new way and don't forget it
works on every kind of surface so
there's a whole world to explore
Oh
check this bike it is the closest to the
one we have dreamed off after being
folded is just the size of a suitcase
and it only waits 13 pounds the top
speed of a panel has 14 miles per hour
when you don't need it you can fold it
back into its bag it's called the
world's smallest folding bike but for us
it's still too big to carry is it
impossible to make a real portable bike
this is our work we call them possible
we have worked on this idea for three
years
you
after being folded it's only 17 inches
high
you can easily carry impossible your
backpack
even the smaller one we will laptop and
your books
the different appearance and the
subversive design makes it out of the
ordinary it's not a bike it's a
revolution some bikes are as large as a
backpack some bikes are backpack and the
impossible is the first bike you can put
it in the backpack have you ever dreamed
of a real portable bike here it is I've
always felt that traditional desktop
scanners are a cumbersome and ugly and
complicated technical all my team and I
have spent a long time designing a
scanning solution that we would love to
use like we wanted to make copying
faxing and scanning intuitive and
effortless we created a device that
makes scanning a breeze scan pad is the
new home for your smartphone it lives
here and it works here we wanted to
provide the best user experience
possible each scan pad is crafted in
Germany and individually measured using
laser technology for the highest
precision scan path uses patent pending
nanotechnology with the swipe of a hand
folded and wrinkle documents are
smoothed out scan pad integrates for
different functions scanning copying
faxing and photography the result is
professional-grade scanning in a
gorgeous design flip the pad over to
isolate a 3d object using blue screen
technology it's like having a photo
studio right on your desk no glass no
reflections and no giant plastic lid
scan pad works with almost every
smartphone our patent-pending technology
always keeps your phone securely in
place
there is so much that we know about what
we drink every day and we know even more
about the food we eat
but whilst every day starts with a new
breath there is so little we know about
the air we breathe
we trouble some of us a lot to places
where we don't know how the air will be
we commute to work every day you
transport our kids to school and each
time we sit in our cars breathing in bad
air whilst at home clean air is a must
we at square want to give you a mobile
device that protects you from bad air
wherever you go we think it's time to
bring quality to a breathing in order to
perfectly purify the air we combine some
of the best existing technology PM 2.5
dust particles and pollen are perfectly
filtered by a paper carbon per set
toxic gases virus and bacteria are then
eliminated by a German made and patented
non-terminal plasma technology we went
through a meticulous process to develop
the perfect product titanium zinc alloy
Swiss crystal and airplane grade
aluminium ensure this is not an ordinary
air purification device it is a square
with such extraordinary material in
place the design is to match with this
iconic top view with these signature
fins or whether it's precise details
this square not only has a timeless
emotional design but also a purposeful
functionality
we have even gone so far that we built
our own air quality sensor and
application to ensure that only the
cleanest air is produced overall the
square mobile combines all the amazing
capabilities needed in the device that
you can take with you anywhere fresh
between air
so support our quest and be part of our
clean air revolution thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
