you
if you drink your coffee on the go and
don't like using disposable cups pick up
a stoge oh and leave that bulky travel
mug at home hi I'm Jerry in sports I'm
one of the three co-founders of stow Joe
we launched our first Kickstarter in
2014 and with your help develop the
patented 12-ounce dojo pocket cub it's
the world's only ultraportable
collapsible leak-proof coffee cup we've
manufactured and sold almost 200,000
cups to date and learned a thing or two
along the way we've also received lots
of customer feedback about what works
and what doesn't we think the proof is
in the reviews so check us out online
and see what people are saying about our
first product many of you have asked for
a bigger cup and wanted us to offer a
straw so you can enjoy both hot and iced
beverages well you spoke and me listen
I'm excited to introduce the snow joe
biggie it's a 16 ounce cup that works
just like an original snow joe hockey
come when collapse it's still small and
compact so you can easily stow it in
your bag purse car stroller or pocket
made from food grade silicone and
recycled bpa-free plastic it blows so
generous 16 ounce capacity and has a
leak proof lid it comes with a heat
sleeve and straw that make it perfect
for both hot and cold beverages made of
five main parts it breaks down and be
assembled for easy cleaning and of
course it's dishwasher and microwave
safe as three busy dads who share a love
for coffee in the environment we were
shocked by the statistic that Americans
toss 58 billion disposable cups each
year it gets worse did you know that few
disposable cups actually get recycled
that means every time someone orders a
coffee in a to-go cup even though that
coffee has gone in minutes the resulting
waste will be around for centuries the
only good solution is to bring your own
cup but most reusable cup options are
bulky and get left at home that's why we
designed a reusable cup that's so
portable and convenient you'll actually
use it we love what we've created
know that you will too so back us today
pick up a stoge Oh Big E and join us on
our mission to end disposable cup years
