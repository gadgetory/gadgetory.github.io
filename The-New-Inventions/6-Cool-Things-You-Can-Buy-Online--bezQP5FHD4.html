automatically locks your computer when
you walk away when you look that
gatekeeper will have unlocked a computer
by the time you sat down
thanks to gatekeeper your computer is
never left unlocked and vulnerable to
snooping you don't have to waste any
valuable time locking and unlocking your
PC when you get up from your computer
there's nothing to stop a colleague
helping themselves with gatekeeper the
computer will lock as soon as you leave
your desk using gatekeeper couldn't be
easier simply insert the included
battery and download the software pair
the dongle and you're ready to go there
are three unlock modes the first of
which is automatic when set to automatic
gate keeper will unlock your PC within a
customizable range anywhere from three
to thirty feet this mode is beneficial
for people such as IT professionals
we're frequently leaving and returning
to that workstations providing security
without wasting precious time the second
option is touch to log in when in this
mode gatekeeper requires a user to tap
it keeper against the Bluetooth receiver
in order to unlock the computer this
mode ensures that only the person with
the key fob can access a computer even
FQHC but is in range finally log in
using gatekeeper and pin requires the
user to enter a password alongside the
presence of gatekeeper before the
computer can be unlocked this two-factor
logon option is the most secure as I add
the second layer security to logging in
this is ideal for use in hospitals and
healthcare facilities by doctors and
nurses for any other industry that needs
to protect confidential information but
what happens if you lose your gatekeeper
thankfully the gatekeeper also functions
as a Bluetooth tracker so you can find
it and their keys with the gatekeeper
app on your phone this works while
you're within 30 feet of gatekeeper
providing it not connected to your
computer when located gates affords
shine on the app we'll give you an idea
of how far away the key forbids to learn

smart glasses you can spot them a mile
away
they will he uncomfortable and
distracting and having a cameras up to
your face it's kind of creepy

water-resistant housing and built-in
activity traffic
you ran 6,000 gusts today and burned 350
calories nice job
you can set friendly reminder hey going
you've been sitting for a while let's
take a break and it's simple to
customize the wall press and a double
tap this is the time is 3:35 p.m. always
losing your specs let's find my glasses
you can easily locate them anywhere you
have to design classic and trendy which
is easy to use charging case use
batteries blast on to plunge smart
glasses that fit your lifestyle and your
look say hello
we put a lot of energy into our day what
if we could get some of that energy back
happy is a wearable device that captured
the energy from your motion throughout
the day and turns it into power for your
phone your movement is your power
and that's about it that's all there is
to it
wait cut that's it yeah you move in your
plug this is supposed to be a
three-minute video you're killing me
pages Mike and I met during our
engineering PhD at Northwestern we all
have the same problem our phones would
die before the end of the day so many
people have this problem over the past
year and a half we've refined the
technology inside NP we have optimized
the car generation components to the
point where you can still produce
significant power while maintaining a
small form-factor
you don't need to be an athlete any
motion will charge it we knew we were on
to something but amp attempt winning
crowd favorite prizes of business
competition everyone kept asking if they
could get one people love the idea of
taking control over their charging habit
it frees them from the wall and
motivates them to get moving
anthe is designed to just fit into your
life it's shaped matches the curve of
your body and it's easy to slip into
your pocket or pop into your purse if
you live in a city you probably walk
enough to extend your phone's battery
life by 3 hours if you also go on a run
or maybe go cycling you can extend it by
six hours the more you move the more
power you get or you can use an P to
charge your wearable devices or any
other device the charges via USB but you
don't need to use the power right away
you can store it for however long you
want and use it when your device is
needed most now we know that everyone's
different some people move in some
pretty creative ways so we've designed
an accessory kit that lets you move just
about any way you want
we can't wait to hear how you use nd if
you want to know how much power you're
getting out you can check the companion
smartphone err unless you track the
energy generated along with the calories
you burn with ampie you're producing
green energy we've got fully functional
prototypes being tested by our pilot go
and they lock those or continuously
collecting feedback and making
improvements but now we need your
support for the final step to move Antti
towards full-scale manufacturing we're
so excited about what's to come one day
our technology integrated directly Mart
watches fitness trackers another crazy
wearables that haven't been invented so
you never have to wonder them but it all
starts now the joint help us bring an T
to the world that better yeah can I get
one
you
hi I'm Eric and I'm Paul and we're the
creators of core water we started core
years ago because we retired being held
hostage in bottled water it's become an
irrational but necessary evil for all of
us from long ago right like I was at the
airport the other day
couldn't find a water fountain so I had
to buy a four dollar bottle of water the
same story when I'm in a hotel ball game
or the gym but what if together we get
in the excuse of bottled water once and
for all we asked ourselves the same
question how can we match the
convenience taste the style of bottled
water we spent over 18 months developing
our prototype and I think we come up
with something truly revolutionary
called the core nava nava is a reusable
water bottle yes its own filter it looks
cool it's easy to drink from and it
allows you to have clean great tasting
water I can attack it shows to make our
filter out of coconut shells that are
converted into activated carbon now
activated carbon has been used for
thousands of years to purify water a lot
of filters though are made from cold
which can contain heavy metals coconut
it's not only safer it's a renewable
resource to make it really easy to break
the bottled water habit we're going to
create a filter subscription program
right on our website you'll get the
filters delivered to your door when you
need them you won't have to worry about
going to get replacements our filter
lasts for about three months for 40
gallons of water so that's 300 plastic
bottles that aren't going into a
landfill that aren't even being
manufactured and trucked around the
planet and you'll be saving yourself
about $400 with most bottles the
mouthpiece and drinking experience is a
complete after thought with the nava we
strive to create an amazing ergonomic
spout it feels great on your lips a lot
of filtered bottles require you to
either squeeze the bottle to force the
water through the filters or you have to
suck through the spout like a Hoover
vacuum our breakthrough was to create
something we call easy flow it gives an
amazing drinking experience easy flow is
an optimization between the coconut
carbon filter and the housing plus that
it gives you incredible tasting water
but with great fluff if we've done our
job right and I think we have with the
core nava all the hours of engineer
and technology that's gone into this
bottle is invisible and they're just
left with an incredible experience with
just about every other bottle we looked
at the mouthpiece is exposed to germs
and dirt so our solution is this push
button cap that protects the mouthpiece
it opens with one hand has a cool
ergonomic handle and you'll never lose
your cap because it's attached to the
bottom we're really concerned about
health safety that's why we made the
Nava out of a material called Triton
it's BPA free and the mouthpiece itself
is made from fda grade silicone after 18
months and over a dozen prototypes we
think the core Navas
is truly groundbreaking the money we
raise will help us finalize our tooling
pay for the first production run and get
these novice at your hands as soon as
possible please share this video with a
friend today and let's stop the excuse
for bottled water once and for all
together we can do this
