imagine if your child struggled with the
most common way of learning if letters
on a page looked foreign if it took them
three times longer to finish a simple
homework assignment imagine if your
child had dyslexia what would you do
well then 45 million people across
America struggle with dyslexia every day
that's why we've created reading style
pen a patent-pending electronic reading
pin they'll instantly convert text to
audio with a simple path of a hand by
reading text aloud the reading style
pinned will help your son or daughter
learn to overcome obstacles on their own
boosting their self-confidence and
making them more independent the reason
style pen was built with the classroom
in mind because it stores no information
it can be used on tests with no risk of
cheating this means never again will
your child experience the pain and
embarrassment of being pulled from the
classroom at home your child will be
more efficient knocking their homework
out in a fraction of the time leaving
them free to be a kid we start this
project three years ago with the mission
to support the education and empowerment
of people through technology getting to
this point has taken a lot of hard work
asian and personal growth we're finally
in a position to bring this product into
the world with the support of the
University of Kansas our family and our
friends we have made a great deal of
progress our prototype is complete our
manufacturers ready to go now we need
your help to make the reading style pen
a reality our goal is 40 thousand
dollars which will cover the equipment
tooling and inventory necessary for our
first production run
by backing at one of our three proud
dyslexic peers you will be one of the
first to get your hands on the leading
style pin for those who don't have
dyslexia and still want to show support
we have custom design apparel so you two
can help spread awareness of this common
condition click the button that says
back it right now to support our project
and be sure to share it on all your
social media the more support we receive
the faster we'll be able to ship your
rewards is ringing the morning after
that's the sound of damage family and my
friends had the same problem so I wanted
to find a solution I wondered a protects
that protected my ears but still meant
that I could enjoy going to gigs with
loud music without feeling like I was
listening to music underwater
conventional earplugs fiddly and cool
and not fun to wear especially at
concerts and geeks because they make the
music sound muffled through developing
our ear phones which was successfully
funded on Kickstarter last year I
discovered a revolutionary way of
protecting our ears I'd like to
introduce isolate ear protectors
traditional ear protection products try
to absorb sound from entering your ears
they ruin your music experience and
failed to isolate you properly from bass
weaknesses and you miss out on the
details of the higher frequencies making
what you do here sound very unbalanced
by using our own patent pending
technology I discovered a way I could
create ear protectors that don't absorb
sound they block it giving you sensation
that you are simply lowered the volume
using flour isolator a concert is really
something else you can hear every
instrument every detail at a safe low
level like never before everyone who
loves going to gigs and festivals is
going to love isolate they take out
peaks and excessive base which means you
can hear details at constants that's
normally mast and no dangerous ear pain
from sudden whistles of Springs from
behind you in the crowd our bodies and
bone structure act like dynamic
dampeners to your ears as the sound gets
louder your body feels everything but
your is stay safe and an amazing comfort
with isolates you simply pinch roll and
insert they can be used in any
environment in which to isolate your
ears one titanium is a denser of the two
metals and so attenuates sound to a
higher level as you can see the isolate
design is finalized to move to go now
you too can be one of the very first
people in the world to join the ear
protection revolution isolate by Flair

do you or your loved ones have a
hypertension high blood pressure or
heart problems then listen carefully you
cannot trust your home blood pressure
monitor
a few years ago a friend of mine was
misdiagnosed because they inaccurate
monitor readings when the doctors found
out the real reason of his sickness it
was too late that day I made a pledge to
find a solution which for the save
others and that's their friends and
families avoid painful loss I didn't
find any automatic blood pressure
monitor I could trust all those should
discrepancy from doctors professional
tools being an engineer myself I decided
to make such a tool now three years
later and proud to present you a
contention the first blood pressure kid
for at-home use that provides the
results as accurate as doctors
measurements the doctors must is very
simple and three forward the user
stethoscope to listen to the sons of
blood flow the problem is to accurately
measure the sons in real time my
solution is was Marvin almost everyone
has internal and it can become a
powerful tool for your health care
regime a contention can work with your
existing tools or on its own you can
plug it into a traditional spy camera
meter or an automatic blood pressure
monitor
and for those who don't have either
there's a special cuff to directly
measure your blood pressure record blood
flow sounds using your smartphone a cue
tension that visualizes them so you not
only hear the sounds but also see them
on your phone screen you can play back
the sounds later to ascertain the
reading ork to show to your doctor the
visualize sound curve lets you see them
for precise measurement it makes the
measurement easy and accurate every year
hypertension and high blood pressure

can help save lives I want to bring it

journey choose your reward serious
campaign with your friends and family I

can get help on time my name is Shawna
pure and I am a business traveler and
like millions of people out there I
can't sleep on planes
travel pillows are simply too big to fit
to my small carry-on and to be honest
they look kind of ridiculous like having
a life preserver wrapped around your
neck
so we set out to design something better
introducing the bull rest the travel
pillow reinvent
it's eighty percent smaller than
traditional travel movies so it easily
fits to any small Carrie
it works by using an ergonomic design
that locks your head into place keeping
it straighter or superior comfort and
rest
it is designed to fit both men and women
using memory foam mold to each unique
neck size and shape
and with four colors to choose from
there's a style for everyone
and now we are proud to announce our
partnership with poster a leading
product innovator for 50 years they are
managing the manufacturing process to
ensure the bull wrestlers of Tehran's

rest apartment we want you to be one of
the first Abbott place you order today

tiny sticky go is the super sticky pad
that only sticks where you want the
protective peel away backing means tiny
sticky go won't stick to your pocket or
your bag it will only stick to the
surfaces you choose and the peel away
backing can also be used as an
instantaneous tripod just peel away the
backing when you need to use your phone
hands-free and gently press your phone
to the surface you wanted to stick to
for a short break use tiny sticky go
wherever you go for safe hands-free
driving better selfies or to follow your
favorite recipes and when tiny sticky go
starts to lose its stickiness just peel
it open and give it a quick rinse to
bring it back to its original super
sticky state
