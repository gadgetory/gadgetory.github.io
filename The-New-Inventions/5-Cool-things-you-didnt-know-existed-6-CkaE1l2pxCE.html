home security is simple you need to know
what's going on at home even when you're
not there did you know that even if you
have an alarm system forty-one percent
of attempted burglaries happen when the
alarm system isn't on that's because
classic security systems are
unsophisticated and frustrating to use I
mean who wants to tap a keypad every
time you step outside and even if the
alarm is on classic systems can't tell
you who's in the house whether it's a
spooky cat burglar ninja or just a
grandma dropping off her famous
casserole which was delicious by the way
thanks grandma but really why is your
smartphone smarter than your home
security system meet Angie world's first
truly autonomous home security system
for everyone we built it to be
completely secure effortlessly usable
and absolutely reliable
angie's fully automated two-step
authentication process senses the
Bluetooth signals from cell phones to
immediately identify anyone who enters
your home and if your phone's dead and
uses voice recognition to identify you
and your family so relax Angie's got you
covered here's a future that'll turn
heads Angie has 360 degree visibility it
automatically rotates to follow all
motion and activity and it doesn't just
watch the room it's you Angie monitors
the entire perimeter of your home simpli
Stik motion tags on the windows and
doors and you're set the battery also
makes Angie easily portable so it's
ideal for keeping an eye on your kids
pets anything really but life isn't only
about being safe it's also about having
fun with your family and friends Angie
can help you communicate with whoever is
at home from kids to your parents it can
also record stream and share all easily
controlled by your voice so you can
always remember that your little Emma
got a new puppy or that awesome of dance
I did at the party our team has
developed and operated mobile
applications with millions of users
we've always taken pride in our ability
creating unbeatable user experience
and with Angie we've taken missed the
next level
what is the most precious thing in your
life for me it's my home and my family
their safety is priceless I think this
is true for many people that's why I've
decided to build engine the first truly
autonomous home security system for
everyone with an incredible team and
funding from a big hardware company
we've built a prototype of ng in nine
months it exceeded everyone's
expectations except ours eventually the
big company wanted to buy us take away
our vision instead we've invested our
own money stuck to our efficient and
built a much improved version of engine
to get Angie to your home we need your
help I hope you'll join us that was
fantastic and the thing he was nervous
about his monologue seriously guys he's
not an actor just a nerd who built an
amazing product so show some support
thanks max
you
if you're like me you like to sleep
every night there's science behind how
sleep makes us more productive and
prevents disease but I mostly like it
cuz it feels good I happen to be on the
road tonight for the national speed
cubers expo and room 214 just decided it
was a good time to rewatch Rambo totally
understandable sweet flag but I don't
think anyone's counting on them to give
a big keynote in the morning on 5 sided
techniques that's why I brought my
snooze this little guy is the Delta
between contaminant noise and ambience
and that's fancy talk for helps keep me
asleep so Stallone doesn't knock me out
of my REM cycle
you hear that it sounds good that's cuz
there's no looping tracks of crickets or
waterfalls so waves crashing on the
beach but I'm the Midwest he uses real
fan but unlike a real fan I can pack
this thing in my carry-on it's not too
cold in the winter and it uses
ninety-eight percent less energy whoa
that's like almost 100 I'm gonna go 100
close enough bet you think is this
pretty in portable don't you well it's
adjustable to you can customize the tone
for light fan too deep fan which is like
packing a billion fans and you can turn
up the volume which is great when you're
doing a five by five and you need that
extra concentration I used to have to
take amphetamines
and I think we've all been in that
position before
plus you can control it from your phone
you know for all those times you forget
to turn your snooze off before leaving
your house that nabbit you think it's
noisy on the Rubik circuit you should
try sleeping next to my wife it's also
great for kids studies have shown that
babies are three times more likely to
fall asleep when exposed to white noise
in my own personal studies it's more
like four but hey I'm not a scientist
sleep is important and those cubers are
counting on that's why i use my snooze
okay technically it's not my snooze it's
my brother's snooze I stayed at his
house and I accidentally took it with me
that's why I used to take any way I like
to think of it as a snooze button for
the beginning of my sleep
