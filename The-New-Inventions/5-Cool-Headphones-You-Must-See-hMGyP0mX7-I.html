we all love to listen to music on the go
but this isn't always easy to achieve
managing playlist takes effort unstable
internet connections are frustrating and
frequently having to recharge your
battery simply cuts you off we believe
listening in community should be easy
and this is why we may ivy Ivy are smart
stand alone headphones they open the
door to more than 40 million songs from
the moment you put it on the music is on
ID is easy to use simply swipe forward

better it understands your preferences
the more it plays music aligned no more
wasting time for organizing your music
ID organizes it for you selected from a
library of over 40 million tracks IV

it this means no more syncing with the
computer searching through apps are
waiting for songs to load with icy music

battery life lasts up to 40 hours
it's as if the music never stopped until
you want it when you remove your
headphone it pauses the track
automatically so you'll never miss a
beat first of all I don't think there's
any headphones like meat on the market
ocean is longer or a revolutionary man
electrostatic has moms that universally
accepted as the best headphones in the
audion the street only hardcore music
professionals use them please you get a
lot of clarity and transparency so
you're hearing the music as it was
intended life you know the person who
makes the record when I first put these
on this up more like a thousand-dollar
headphones earth immediately the first
thing I noticed was how comfortable they
were normally electrostatic headphones
almost amplifiers that are heavy big and
bulky it adds two thousand dollars to
the price tag unbelievable it all starts
with electrostatic technology this is an
incredible technology it's unlike
anything we've ever worked with before
you have a very light thin film between
the two perforated plate that move back
and forth and they create sound in a way
that's very transparent to the actual
recording the electrostatic film is
actually about 10 to 20 times thinner
than even this piece of plastic you
might be listening to your favorite
tracks that you can look into three
years and as soon as you listen to them
through these you'll hear things that
you never heard it in the mix before I
get inspired you know like these
headphones inspire me to write and wanna
go record or a consumer products are
unbelievable look what you get for the
price compared to other products that
are in that range its way above
everything I've heard and that kinda
or if you look your other when the
vocals are really clear we examine them
sitting down in front of exeter's
listenings when I told me them we
go to change in my favor man I'm really
impressed you know we've been going back
and forth with different cans we have X
to do and please be sound beautiful
what's up everybody Frank knuckles from
the legendary roots crew the amazing
thing about this that shocked me was the
quality sounds of it was amazing it made
everything sound brand new to me it'll
change the way you hear music I don't
need to be overly dramatic but you will
start to hear details and exactly you've
never heard before after countless
prototypes we were able to just produce
an initial run of 500 units for early
adapters with your backing in your
purchase we will very soon be able to
make this dream a reality our goal is to
bring the highest level of sound
possible to the masculine worldwide to
make it affordable to make it available
I'm excited about this and so should you
can you join them so we can bring
electrostatic headphones and true high
fidelity sound to everybody yes
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
