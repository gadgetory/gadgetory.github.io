the outdoors on camping and backpacking
adventures but a problem we face again
and again is that each trip calls for a
specific tent an ultralight shelter when
it's just me two-person tent when the
body time is long and something bigger
for a group a cotopaxi we set out to
solve this problem we're introducing the
new NT to tent system offering you one
streamlined setup that adapts to your
specific needs our system is made up of
a two-person standalone ten it's rain
fly and a snap in alcove that seamlessly
integrates with the tent
the in-situ itself sleeps two features a
double wall construction and uses just
three holes for secretly set up it has
just the right blend of features your
lightweight backpacking and camping
adventures the simple lightweight body
looks perfect for one or two person
backpacking
and the included rain fly with dual
integrated vestibules lets you batten
down the hatches when the weather turns
now the alko also known as the tents
guestroom it's a separate shelter that
seamlessly integrates with your EMT to
effectively doubling the space for two
extra people or added gear many other
tent makers use some type of vestibule
or awning and claim it adds living space
but only ours features a built in floor
to create more space that were texting
from the ground up just like your 10 on
zone the outcome of single pole setup
and multiple stake out points means it
serves as an ultra light minimal
two-person standalone helpful it can be
set up in two separate configurations
lashes to a tree or a larger opening or
stake it down with trekking poles with
the in t2 tent system we're filling the
gap in the market our system is made to
adapt to any camping situation
pretenting ones in line system
from the initial concept of final design
into two tenses into something I'm super
excited
hens continue to get lighter and more
technical but overall design hasn't
really changed until now our system
solved the problem and we know it'll
help eliminate your 10 conundrums to
making your time in the outdoors much
more fun and hassle-free but the final
step of our journey in getting the first
batch of nt2 tent systems produced and
out to market involves you join our
campaign and get your in situ in time to
enjoy the summer camping season thanks
for watching and through the support of
everything we're doing new technology is
making life easier in many ways but it
hasn't really been applied to outdoor
and camping equipment until now this is
the world's first outdoor smart lantern
from o2 tech first I hope you agree that
it looks great your granddad may have
taken you camping but your equipment
doesn't have to look like is the lantern
can be adjusted here but it can also be
controlled by a Bluetooth app on your
phone at the end of a long day outdoors
you don't have to keep getting up and
down to adjust the lanterns brightness
you can do so from wherever you're
seated you can adjust it to a range of
16 million colors to suit your mood or
later you can even turn it off remotely
without getting out of your tent or
sleeping bag that's great when the
weather is freezing or you have
something else to do have you ever been
hiking and had trouble finding your tent
now it's easy just set your light to
flash but at otech we have gone much
further the lantern comes with built-in
weather sensors temperature humidity
barometric pressure it will even give
you weather alerts our smart lantern
comes in two sizes the 200 lumen and the
powerful 400 lumen that illuminates to a
range of nearly 10 paces at full power
it will last eight nights at low power
30 nights the lantern is strong durable
and lightweight it is water resistant so
no worries with spray on a boat with
full batteries even the 400 L is just
over three pounds or 1.6 kilograms it
also has a built in
tripod for uneven surfaces and the
handle it won't break it uses
rechargeable batteries or for D cell
batteries you can even use it to charge
your mobile phone or other devices
because it has a built-in USB port Oh -
tech is developing a number of other
smart camping devices here is our CEO
who can tell you more
Oh
do you see the tent over there it's a
channel 10 it's really easy you just
make and it's done
hi I'm Garrett and this is Jurgen
we love spending time in the nature with
our friends and families and we used to
get angry about complicated ends that
construction missing parts you know what
I mean and then we decided to start
channel 10
it's not two years since we started work
on developing our air tents we wanted to
design a new tent one without poles and
small confusing pieces our vision to
create a tent which is absolutely stable
one which can even erect itself since
then we've been working on our mission
to make camping easier our air tents are
available in three different sizes the
gentle tent excess and extremely smart
two-person tent a perfect introduction
to the world of easy camping if you
prefer more room that gentle tent S has
a very secure sleeping bill and any car
can be attached to the tent but the
absolute head is our classic no other
tent is as versatile as a warning
community tent or for sleeping this is
camping luxury and we love it camping is
relaxing it's about enjoying nature and
having a good time with family and
friends gentle tents make camping even
better our tent can be erected in less
than a minute and taking it down is even
faster maximum comfort means putting up
a tent at the push of a button you can
also replace the hand pump with an
electric arm our secret the extremely
robust pipe system a completely gas
tight inner pipe is filled with air
that's how the gentle temp gets it's
stable wind proof shape
high-quality rafting valves provide the
necessary safety over pressurizing is
prevented by a special overload pressure
valve gentle tents have fewer parts than
normal tents for a fewer templates and
guy rooms that's how we save weight the
high quality components and generous air
openings provide an excellent indoor
tent climate cleaning and repairing the
tent is very simple and you'll find this
easy to do yourself but if you don't
want to of course we'll be very happy to
help you
it's pleasingly easy to hook the air
tent attachment to a car creating a
symbiosis of kempt and car by the way
all gentle tents get on to all types of
vehicles no matter the size of your car
the interior space of a gentle tent is
really quite impressive but when the
tent is deflated all that remains is a
small package do what you like take it
on holiday or put it in the pannier of
your motorbiking if you don't want to do
without your smartphone or laptop on
holiday you can equip your gentle tent
with a gentle tent power pack and charge
it with solar power
