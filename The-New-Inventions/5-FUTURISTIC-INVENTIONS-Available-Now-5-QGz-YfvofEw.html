people worldwide making it impossible to
treat each and every person with a
sufficient level of care if they're poor
becomes increasingly difficult to
accurately prescribe medications and get
quick feedback about how well the
medications are working that's why I
built one ring which is an intelligent
tool for monitoring Parkinson's
it's wondering we look to revolutionize
the way Parkinson's patients interact
with their physicians a patient can pair
their ring it's an iOS device using low
Bluetooth energy technology and start
their day as they would any other day
wondering then captures movement data
for their entire day in order to detect
all possible motor distortions present
in the disease when a patient decides to
finish their day our signal processing
driven machine learning algorithms
analyze rock acceleration data to
identify unique Parkinson's movement
patterns such as brady kinesia
dyskinesia
and tremor with its powerful
classification engine wondering predicts
the severity of motor symptoms at each
and every hour of the day based on
patterns displayed in real parkinson's
patients during the model training
process these classifications generate a
smart patient report including date
stamps time stamps and hourly movements
abilities that a patient can view on
their smartphone this report is
additionally sent to the patient's
physician who can analyze the quantified
results to alter medication dosages and
timings with the top of a button
a patient can view all of their daily
reports and see how their motor symptoms
are progressing therefore one ring not
only provides vital quantification of
Parkinson's it defines an entirely new
way to monitor the disease's most common
symptoms we now have a completed product
but we need your help to bring one ring
to Parkinson's patients all around the
world
your funding will allow us to do in the
production and deploy several rings at
nearby clinical centers for Parkinson's
disease with this we hope to make
dealing with movement disorders far more
efficient by providing a novel
quantified metric for grading symptoms
we hope that you'll be able to join us
in our journey of improving the daily
life of a Parkinson's patient and we
look forward to seeing your support
it's hard to believe how much work it
can be just to take care of yourself
with so much stress and pressure to deal
with everyday making time to take care
of your own health can feel like even
more work just another thing to get done
we want to make it simple with mocha
heart a smart sensor to make everyday
health manageable and a new way to care
Mooka heart is a portable monitor for
your immediate health status it's small
quick to measure and fits into its own
custom smart phone case or keychain
attachment so you can check your vital
signs on-the-go including heart rate
blood oxygen level and mocha index mocha
index reflects your health status in a
simple scale of 0 to 4 it's calculated
from your blood velocity with mochas
medical grade sensor and a higher index
may indicate high blood pressure this
simplifies all of your data into
insights you can understand
poka also grabs your data over time so
you can better monitor your long-term
health trends not just compare numbers
from individual readings more readings
means more accurate trends and with
mocha now it's easy to never miss a
measurement
it's also easier to relate your health
to your lifestyle because MOCA tracks
your location current weather and saves
your custom notes
in the end though it's our loved ones
that we care for the most
mochas unique UI gives an overview of
your family's recent activities and
messaging features to remind them that
you care about their health
mocha heart a new way to measure a new
way to care
your back it follows you everyday it
takes part in every move you make
you
Berko purko is a second skin that gets
you in the right position if you're not
sitting properly tensors will stimulate
your back to make you sit up straight a
special fabric on the thorax emphasizes
the movement into the correct posture
together they provide impulses to your
fifth lumbar to bring your spine from a
C to an S position for over a year we
worked with innovative textile
specialists and an osteopathic clinic
Berko is made with breathable fabric you
won't even notice you're wearing it and
no one will
and most importantly it was engineered
by experts
they even tested it and the results are
highly conclusive

the work for you it teaches you how to
have the right posture that means that
you will breathe better look better
and even feel better as long as I can
remember I have been pushing my own
boundaries by taking on new challenges
we take such a joy in making a product
together with others bring it to people
who share our passions and see them love
it like we do Pro dry case is a direct
results from the many ideas that came
about from our award-winning pro dry bag
now used by professional athletes in
some of the most spectacular areas of
the world a true joint venture with
industry-leading engineers and designers
Pro dry case is a 100% waterproof slim
fit case that meets ipx8 standard to
bring our laptops
it has been an incredible experience
introducing us to new boundaries when it
comes to developing and testing a
product to the limit the outcome is an
amazing combination of ultra slim design
with the highest set of functional
properties within waterproof solutions
we hope you'll love it like we do
what if there is one number that could
help you run better meets tried the
first wearable device to give runners
away to measure and train with the only
objective measure of performance power
in cycling power has become the
definitive measure for understanding
intensity and work done because it's a
true mechanical representation of what's
happened by measuring power stride
enables a runner to properly gauge their
training intensity to ensure that their
training appropriately to see maximal
improvement invented by Princeton
engineers and tested in one of the
world's top sports performance labs
stride is being called a breakthrough
for running and a perfect recipe for
improvement stride uses patent-pending
sensing technologies to track a runner's
motion through 3d space and high
resolution we also track the
environmental conditions you're running
through and from that we calculate your
running power with stride for the first
time runners can actually measure their
running efficiency and they can uncover
ways of running faster without actually
running harder power is the only
accurate and predictable measure of
workout intensity with stride runners
can guarantee perfect pacing on any
workout in any race across any terrain
the great thing about stride is you just
clip it on and go there's not even an
on/off switch it automatically syncs up
with all the devices you already used to
train and when you get home you can look
at all your data on your PC or your
laptop and learn all about your book
I think stride is really gonna
revolutionize the way you train for
running it gives you information that
you never have had access to before
should you use pace and you can use
heartrate but it's you know they're just
they're not great metrics at the end of
day that's what I that's what I want to
see is my power number the bottom line
is this strides the game
only does it give you all of the
information you can traditionally get
from a stopwatch or a GPS minute but it
also gives you all of the forces
associated with that one giving you a
complete picture of what's happening
when you train as a coach I seen
technology change
I have leads train better measurements
brings better performance strides just
the beginning when you back us on
Kickstarter you joined this amazing
community of people who really loved
running from some of the most elite
athletes in the world to regular runners
just like me we want to help people run
faster when I help people run smarter we
want to help people run better stride
running with power
