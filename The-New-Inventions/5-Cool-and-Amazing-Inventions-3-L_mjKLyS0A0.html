available today but they all have the
limits and are often not suitable to be
used in certain areas this brush is a
universal way including attachment that
knows no limits
the principle is easy as a premium just
as with the brush the chips are well
flexible and fit perfectly onto all even
services it doesn't matter if it is a
small pool hidden corners or delicate
items is attachment boxes or places with
small parts like toys swing needles or
screws can be cleaned in no time at all
it used to be very time-consuming to
clean them in the future using dust
brush all kinds of boxes holding small
parts can be simply waiting it out
nothing will be sucked away and no small
part will get lost the boxes and
contents will be quickly and easily
clean look little afford in the car are
also similar difficult areas to clean
colourless you know this when delight
recruits see drags traced seat cushions
all these areas can be cleaned the
father's knee with testicles dust brush
sucks in dirt from deep within cracks
and ridges and fits perfectly between
the seat cushions the small area between
the window and the door fittings will be
effectively clean even the dirty areas
between the seat tracks into the
smallest snacks and crannies can be
easily clean
some of the biggest ass collectors are
electric equipment especially computers
dust collects on them they overhead and
do not perform well in combination with
the anti-static Raul we can use that to
brush to remove the dust without
compressed air or special equipments
difficult to reach areas will be easily
freed from dust even cables and
sensitive electronics can be cleaned
this way with no problems at the same
time no dust gets out into the
surrounding areas your PC will thank you
even our best friends are also blessed
with the dust occurs over time lose hair
and that's themselves met up the food
dust brush can work him the hair and
skin cells will be out of the firm the
tubes act like the brush and comb the
Fuhrer at the same time after cellular
usages the fur feels much smoother
there's enough suction when used in a
fur clothing direction to wake him up
the desking valves without dr. Koch
attaching itself to the skin but you to
move those hair from your pets before
can speed into the room instead it gets
sucked directly into the wetland cleaner
that is really great opens up new
possibilities this is our daily work
projects we can use in every area that
the brush is constructed tested and
perfected developed in Germany and
that's about the staff were 100% enjoy

area also to run new ideas and
suggestions and above all has to need
your help
so cakes like this please type a
screencast about to life help us to make
your home cleaner and healthier thank
you in a world where we are constantly
on the go fueled by the caffeine we
drink why are we still wasting time in
line and settling for substandard coffee
we asked why not make coffee portable
where you could brew a delicious cup in
the palm of your hand so we did just
that this is the jolt a portable coffee
brewer that can brew anytime anywhere we
have developed the most compact and
efficient design possible pushing the
limits of current battery and heating
element technologies in addition to
convenience taste is paramount we've
modeled our device after the traditional
French press brewing for a truly
delicious cup of coffee so how does it
work
simply fill with water and within
minutes it will reach the perfect
brewing temperature load the coffee pod
with your own coffee grounds or use our
biodegradable packets wait for the green
light and your coffee is ready to drink
as a mechanical engineer with a
background and electromechanical
packaging and heat transfer I've had the
opportunity to transform our concept
into a functioning prototype
incorporating feedback from friends
family and coffee lovers into every
iteration over the last three years
unlike other portable Brewers our
product utilizes the latest technology
to reach the proper correct temperature
of 200 degrees Fahrenheit so you can
brew anytime anywhere we pride ourselves
in not only your speed but also our
ability to deliver a quality great
tasting cup of coffee but the coffee pod
was equally important to us as the
device itself it's estimated that over
nine billion carry k-cups end up in
landfills every year but the jolt is
different
we've developed a biodegradable coffee
pot that brews great coffee and leaves
no impact on the environment leveraging
our team's background in mechanical and
electrical engineering we've solved some
immense challenges and after three years
of development were finally ready to
share our product with the world we've
come to IndieGoGo after perfecting our
technology and partnering with a great
manufacturer our goal is to raise enough
funds to meet our manufacturer's minimum
order quantity and that's where we need
your help so please join us today and
help make portable brewing area

and very expensive it took dozens of
concepts and prototypes hundreds of
experimental simulations thousands of
hours of craftsmanship and an infinite
amount of patience to bring you home
