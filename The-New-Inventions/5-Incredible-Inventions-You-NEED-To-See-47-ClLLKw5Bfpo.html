smart suitcase that follows its user
while avoiding any obstacles in its path
the code move system is the brains of
the RR one in charge of sensing the
environment planning reasonable paths
and avoiding obstacles all while
following its user the sensing ability
of the co move system is made possible
by multi sensor fusion technology which
is mainly based on a set of so nars a
death sensor Co I and cliff detect
sensors that allow our one to avoid
stairs and other dangers drop offs a
customized bracelet will be provided
with each r1 the Como system ensures
that our one rolls along within an arm's
length distance to the bracelet on the
user at all times a pair of active wheel
units when they retract will design
similar to aircraft landing gears
propels the suitcase forward when both
wheel units deployed the active wheel
units will retract as soon as you touch
the handle switching our one from
autonomous mode into manual mode
our one follows at a maximum speed of
4.5 miles per hour sufficient for most
daily needs the wheel units are powerful
enough to tackle any and all kinds of
terrain Co smart intelligent walk will
automatically lock itself to ensure your
valuables remain safe a simple double
tap on your bracelet will activate the
find me launch and r1 will intelligently
plan a route to make its way back to you
with the co smart intelligent lock
proximity alarm and embedded GPS your
belongings are guaranteed to be safe the
code smart intelligent lock also
integrates a tsa lock and a traditional
combination lock which ensures that
luggage lock is tsa approved and can
function properly even without the power
supply
the proximity alarm will notify you if
your luggage leaves your area if you
accidentally lose or misplace your
luggage don't worry with the onboard GPS
you can easily find its location on your
app are one uses the 96.5 one our
portable power bank as its power source
you can easily charge devices directly
from the power bank or with integrated
USB ports for on-the-go charging if the
power bank is plugged into the suitcase
the power bank is easily removable
making airport security checks a breeze
the front storage space allows for one
click access to remove electronics
during airport security checkpoints
without having three pack your bag while
the spacious main compartment is perfect
for the compact storage of other travel
necessities
wherever you go whatever you do our one
will be with you every step of the way
co robot r1 make travel less of a drag
hi my name is Thomas and I would like to
present you the most advanced data
protection for your contactless credit
cards and rfid-enabled documents
bullguard combining cutting-edge
technology with massive rd and developed
on the same principles as military
jamming systems vault card is the most
advanced RFID protection solution ever
designed it virtually ensures absolute
safety of your cards other products have
tried to protect your cards by covering
them in metal foil unfortunately it
doesn't work with high-powered scale
devices and so how does this work hard
work just over 1 millimeter thick you
simply place a single world card in the
middle of your wallet like so now all
your rfid-enabled cards are protected
within one and a half inches on either
side your wallet can be up to three
inches thick which as you can see is
more than adequate both cards switch is
on automatically when it senses the
electromagnetic signal emitted by
hackers RFID scanner the stronger the
signal from the thick scanner the
stronger jamming volt cart will generate
so your rfid-enabled cards will remain
protected even against the most powerful
scanning devices and RFID scheme
existence
when you use your cards as usual just
make sure to hold them at least eight
inches away from vult cards what's more
volt card harnesses energy extremely
efficiently and doesn't require a
battery for its separation well it
doesn't mean that wall card actually
lasts and protects forever that's right
join our community so everyone can enjoy
a future of unmatched edified insecurity
with a world card in your wallet so this
started about a year ago where we have
to measure the contours of an organic
surface turns out that's a very hard
problem the only available solution cost
twenty thousand dollars and that that's
ridiculous so we set out to build a room
we looked at what was available out
there at the intersection of computer
vision and surface measurement and we
couldn't find a single solution that was
compelling the 3d scanners they were
precise cost tens of thousands of
dollars and the ones that are affordable
one
today that changes
we're only just beginning to explore the
possibilities of capturing the world and
3d 3d printing is an amazing tool it
converts a digital file into a physical
object some call it and industrial
revolution the ER 3d scanner does the
exact opposite for 3d printer it lets
artists makers and designers capture
objects and surfaces and turn them into
high quality 3d models and use them as
part of the creative process we knew we
had to use a smartphone model of phones
are simply amazing we use them to take
pictures edit videos update social media
even for gaming the Euro 3d scanner is
powered entirely by your smartphone
using it as easy just open the app and
press scan it'll automatically adjust
focus and exposure and drive a green
laser to scan your object as it sweeps
we take over 1,000 photos and analyze
them in real time to give you a 3d model
a typical scan takes three to five
minutes and gives you a full color mesh
with up to 8 million points with a range
of one meter you can capture objects big
and swamp accurate to less than 100
microns that's the thickness of a single
sheet of paper when engineering the
scanner we had one objective in mind
precision all that's possible thanks to
a design that's both beautiful and
machined from a solid block of aluminium
with over 35 million operations we've
designed it to be both robust and
precise the light ring gives you quick
visual feedback and the adjustable knob
let's just secure any module smartphone
the green laser let's just scan in any
lighting conditions as most cameras are
twice as sensitive to green than any
other color for water type models we
also design a Bluetooth turntable it
will sync to your scanner and rotate
your object to make sure you get every
angle we meticulously design every
aspect of the hardware and we've tested
seven different prototypes we've put
together a great team and with lined up
several manufacturers now we need you to
help us put this together
introducing Zeus way in just 18 grams
this is the world's smallest 500 mah
portable charger with built in apple or
micro USB connectors we have designed
the Zeus to be there when you need it
not only if we kept it small but we've
crammed packed it full of features to
make your life a little easier take the
charging connector for example why
should you have to remember to bring the
cable everywhere you go with Zeus it has
a built-in iphone or samsung USB
connector built into already this is
designed to be there when you need it
why I have to remember something else in
the morning we do our check phone wallet
keys Zeus can fit on a keyring so this
can be with you wherever you go at now
we understand that you never know when
you're going to need Zeus so we've built
in a power retaining switch this saves
your battery when you're not using it so
it's always got some juice when you need
it we've even tried to make recharging
of Zeus as simple and convenient as
possible with our four unit connect dot
charge up to four devices at one time
have one for each of your devices one
for every family member or simply swap
and go so you never have to wait for it
Zeus to recharge it's very important to
us to keep the size of Zeus down but
also make a pack a punch with its 500
mah battery it's enough to get you out
of those sticky situations we know the
Zeus is added convenience to our lives
so we're reaching out to the Kickstarter
community not only to help speed up the
manufacturing process but to give the
early adapters like you the opportunity
to get to snare we've got some great
options for you to back so with your
support let's bring a little Zeus
convenience to everybody's lives</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
