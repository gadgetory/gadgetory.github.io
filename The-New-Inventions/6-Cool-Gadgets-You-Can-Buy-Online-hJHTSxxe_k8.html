hey my name is robert morrison and i am
the founder of access drones and today i
have with me the wallet drone
wallah drill is the world's smallest
quadcopter it fits inside of the
controller itself which is the size of a
wallet fits perfectly into your pocket
not only does the quadcopter fit inside
of the remote control but it actually
uses the remote controls batteries to
charge itself while not in use making it
go virtually anywhere that you can this
is the most portable compact quadcopter
on the market so we've had probably
about five or six different remote
control planes but the wallet drone
seems to last forever and maybe it's the
size of the small size it but it flew
longer than just about any other copter
whatever you

device and find the lost item in seconds
