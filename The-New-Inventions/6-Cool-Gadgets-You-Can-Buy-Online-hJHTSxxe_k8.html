hey my name is robert morrison and i am
the founder of access drones and today i
have with me the wallet drone
wallah drill is the world's smallest
quadcopter it fits inside of the
controller itself which is the size of a
wallet fits perfectly into your pocket
not only does the quadcopter fit inside
of the remote control but it actually
uses the remote controls batteries to
charge itself while not in use making it
go virtually anywhere that you can this
is the most portable compact quadcopter
on the market so we've had probably
about five or six different remote
control planes but the wallet drone
seems to last forever and maybe it's the
size of the small size it but it flew
longer than just about any other copter
whatever you
hi I'm Chris hi I'm Christian five years
ago we ventured out to create a small
wireless device to help you keep track
of your items using a smartphone since
that time we've worked tirelessly to
perfect the technology today we're proud
to announce tracker Bravo the simplest
way to track all your items tracker
Bravo is a coin-sized device that easily
attaches to a purse slips inside a
wallet sticks to a bike or attaches to
anything you would like to track
using the tracker app you can see how
far away you are from your items in with
the tap of your finger you can ring the
device and find the lost item in seconds
and it works both ways if you can't find
your phone press the button on the
device and cause your phone to ring even
on silent mode in case something goes
missing the app notifies our crowd GPS
Network to search for your loss item if
your item comes within 100 feet of one
of our tens of thousands of other
tracker users phones you will receive a
GPS update of where your item was last
seen tracker Bravo your search is over

bring tracker Bravo into production with
your help we can make losing items a
thing of the past thanks so much for
supporting tracker Bravo hi guys I'm
Lorenzo hi I'm Carla everyday
smartphones are becoming smarter but the
battery life remains critical we'd like
to use our phones without the fear of
running out of battery of course there
are solutions such as power cases and
extra batteries whether you're they're
not portable enough or is to forget we
design a product so compact that will
follow you everywhere a cable the size
of an inch we call it in charge it's a
very simple product yet so useful that
we believe everybody should own one
that's why one of our main goals was to
keep it affordable a tiny product at the
tiny price
there are over five billion USB ports
around the world in charge will fit into
your pocket and you won't have to fight
with tangled cords ever again we are
really excited about this and we hope
