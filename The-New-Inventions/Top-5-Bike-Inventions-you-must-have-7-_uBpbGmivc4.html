knavery my old bike so she could ride it
to work which I did and then I got
scared scared because large cities are
not always a safe place to ride a bike
you have to slalom you weigh between
Platteville is the size of a truck and
urban drivers are not always the most
patient or diplomat citizens so I
started asking myself how could I make
this better for her specifications you
need maneuverability which means a short
wheelbase and a steep head tube to
reduce your turning radius so you can
manage extremely tight corners a large
front wheel to overcome any obstacle the
city puts in your way
a small motorized rear wheel to increase
acceleration and climb steeper roads you
should be standing in an upright
position because there is a lot going on
in the city you need to keep an eye on
your surroundings and be able to get on
and off very easily it needs to be
simple easy to use intuitive and almost
maintenance-free
after months of brainstorming the basic
idea of the sneaky bike was born a
vintage concept with a modern twist a
lot of sweat and tears later with many
talented people who joined the project
ended up with an amazing product
a bellhop we love cycling we cycle
everywhere up however cycling is not
always that safe in the city when we
share the road space with cars we are
not really visible when turning and
breaking that's what we came up with
linkers
the blinkers had a set of lights that
may cyclists be seen on the stood and
expected by other vehicles in the road
from every angle and in every situation
there is a real linker and a from
blinker that show the direction of the
turn from the back and from the front
all these control with a path easily
reachable with a thumb - lasers create a
safety perimeter so cars respect the
cyclists space we have also equipped our
blinkers with smart position lights and
braking lights our product has many
functionalities but it's simple to use
blinkers are easy to connect and remove
because of our magnetic system you can
put our moans on the handlebar under the
saddle on the rack or on the basket it
has a powerful battery that it's
chargeable with USB and of course it's
fully water resistant we have been
working hard with a top designer studio
to build a product that makes your bag
look urban and dynamic we're a team of
students from ETH in Zurich and we have
fun developing smart technology for
cyclists we are ready to start
manufacturing but first we need your
support by backing this project you will
contribute to my cycling weather please
help us spread the word by sharing this
prayer with your friends let's make
cycling safe thanks for watching
meet him
tim loves his bike
well loved Tim has been looking for the
best way to protect his bike but he
hasn't been very lucky Tim feel safe for
now with Sherlock Sherlock is a small
GPS tracker hidden in the frame of the
bicycle it's connected to a mobile app
that lets him know where his bike is at
anytime we want to set aside with free
from the fear of theft which is
something we've all experienced we've
been working on the design and the
alternative Sherlock for about a year or
not for the printing the first
prototypes and studying how to make it
as small as possible so it can be hidden
inside the frame of the bicycle
Sherlock is designed to be easily
installed in the handlebars it can fit
any shape of tube thanks to its flexible
design and it is completely invisible
from the outside so the design of the
bike is not altered and thieves cannot
see that it is there if your bicycle
moves and it's not you moving it you
will receive an immediate alert on your
phone
Sherlock tracks the position of your
bicycle directly on your smartphone to
help you be reunited once again we are
now running tests and finalizing the
design of the product but we need your
help to get Sherlock into production be
like team support us today and get your
hands on one of the first shadow
catamite

automatic so you don't have to press any
buttons or struggle with your bulky bike

and enjoy more because that's what bike
riding should be about I locket is built
with strong and durable materials and
can be easily attached to most bikes in
e bikes and if your smartphone runs out
of battery

custom click code also if you don't want
to take your smartphone with you you can
simply use the I lock it key fob instead

integrated sensors also sets off an
alarm in case anybody tries to break it
or tries to carry away your bike so you

never been easier hi I'm Christian one
of the founders of I locket I like
riding my bike I use it for my daily
commute going shopping meet friends or
basically for everything else but
locking and unlocking my bike always
annoyed me that's why we start to work
on ideas how to change that as a result
we created I lock it I lock it we want
to create a product which can be easily
used by everyone and which makes life
more comfortable
we have several years of experience in
designing and developing products but in
order to bring a lock it into the market
we need your help we have a working
prototype and we're almost ready to go
into full-scale production but getting
together the components and tooling is
really expensive so with your help we
can get a lock it into production and
you will be the first receiving the lock
at a special discount so thank you very
much for your support</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
