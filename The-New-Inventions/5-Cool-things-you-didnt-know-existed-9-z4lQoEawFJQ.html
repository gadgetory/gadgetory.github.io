we all like our homes to be safe and
comfortable
we all have smart phones and smart TVs
and yet our homes are still lacking
smart features
most people don't know how much energy
they are using or which devices take up
most of it a lot of energy gets wasted
in our absence lights are left on when
nobody's around and devices are left on
standby for hours inflating our energy
bills
Mia do BOTS want to change this the
popularity of smartphones and Bluetooth
Low Energy makes us the perfect time to
smarten up your home imagine that with
one swipe of your smartphone you can
turn devices on and off in the lights
and safeguard your home what if you
could put your entire house on standby
just by going out the door that's a
comfortable thought a smart home is not
a new concept that already are several
products available to customize our
homes for things like dim your lights
switching devices wirelessly measuring
power consumption keeping track of our
devices or protecting our belongings
unfortunately these devices are usually
expensive bulky or creative form purpose
only that's why we created the crown
stone the crown stone is the most
affordable and modular solution on the
market to create your own smartphone one
of its coolest features is the ability
to identify devices based on their power
consumption patterns it also detects
your presence so for example the lights
will turn off when you leave but the
fridge will stay on the crown stone
comes in two flavors to smarten up your
power outlets a sleek built-in version
that fits into any power outlet making
it completely invisible and the subtle
ready to use plug-in version
we have spent the last 14 months
developing this smart innovation with
our team of designers engineers and
operation experts to get where we are
today we have made lots of prototypes
and iterated hundreds of times over both
the software and the hardware
let's make a change let's help people
remember to take all their bills and
medicine let's support people in taking
the right dosage at the right time we
want to help people recover from illness
and take care of their health in the
easiest possible way back in medicine is
a huge responsibility and worries there
are also other drugs you need to take
this requires a special schedule and
memorizing a bunch of medical lipids
which we all know is a hassle that's why
I should try dr. pocket dr. pocket is
our and your contribution with the
development of telemedicine telemedicine
combines the achievements of computer
technology communication and medical
services
this does doesn't health thus dr. pocket
is in the internet platform a mobile
application and an electronic pillbox
integrated with them both with your help
we want the pillbox to look like this
today we already have an engine that
performs like this it's simple when you
scan the barcode all available
information about the drug immediately
enters your account on the doctor pocket
platform and your pill box the pillbox
reminds you about the time for taking
your medicine it serves the medicine to
you and even informs you when your drug
supply is getting low you can always
expand your pill box with additional
modules on our platform you can check
the contraindications for taking your
medicine you get to know how it
interacts with alcohol other pills and
if it's safe to use during pregnancy and
lactation dr. pocket is also a tool for
doctors and caregivers it allows them to
effectively control your medical
treatment we are doctors engineers and
designers our idea is to create a
well-engineered tell a medical solution
accessible everywhere and affordable for
everyone we've already created a few and
we are constantly gaining recognition
from polish media we are young and yes
you want to change the world in fact we
already doing so if you're asking you to
join us and help us in use dr. pocket
this is the stone it's modern cutting
edge technology in a small package also
it has a button what does it do well the
stone tags your stuff so you can find
them later it even has a motion sensor
so you can tell when it moves one moment
since the motion tracker is
proximity-based it can notify you when
it leaves and when it returns it even
has a temperature sensor so you can tell
how hot your car is in the morgan all
right
enough about the stone let's talk about
the button you can press the button to
do anything anything well almost
anything like give me a pizza sure you
can even call a friend here we pizza
party my place you can also take us up
with ifttt the possibilities are endless
you can even tell it to do different
things different times of the day or you
can flip it to smart mode and it will
figure out what you want the pebble be
stone is the perfect way to organize and
simplify your life the phone cell
charger it's the first and only phone
charger that cleans and sanitizes your
phone with UV light we've started in the
basement but now we're all driving
Ferrari not really but really we're just
a small company trying to make great
cleaning products for all you dirty
people out there and thank you the
phones of charger has been a huge
success with shipments all over the
world and appearances on the view the
Today Show QVC and of course shark tank
we have thousands happy sanitary
pestered you know this business all
started when we realized how dirty our
cell phones and devices really are the
average cell phone is 18 times dirtier
than a public restroom bacteria that we
transfer onto our devices lives and
breathes there it's disgusting
especially since we store them in warm
dark places like our purse or our man
bag tablets are just as dirty
unsurprisingly the number one request
from our customers has always been a
tablet size sanitizer okay but seriously
do you even know the number one place
that tablets are used hospitals nope
school no back room really yeah maybe
okay well regardless just like phones
tablets aren't so dirty they're
disgusting i mean we touch them all the
time and we never clean them we have
been working tirelessly for many months
now to introduce the phone soap XL
phone soap excels unique design keeps
the tablet in an upright position it
looks great in a variety of locations at
home or at work it's sleek slimming
edges and metallic accents provide a
versatile and pleasing appearance the
four powerful UV bulbs surround the
device with germ-killing UV light there
is a charging port on the back with 2.4
amps so you can clean your tablet every
time you charge it and of course we have
indicator lights to show you that it is
working best of all it is still large
enough to put any number of items inside
my keyboards well maybe not but
definitely remote controls and Keith and
baby supplies pacifiers and bottles and
things don't forget money bluetooth
headphones or that pair of earrings that
you found on the ground subway or little
tiny baby shoes basically anything that
fits will be we have a proven track
record with clear results that is why we
need your help now to produce the phone
self-exile we already know that we have
a high market demand with a tablet size
screener that's why we're asking you to
work with us to meet that demand after
all this is the future of our children
we talking we need your help to justify
the tooling and get production rolling
this year the product you see here is
finished and ready to go no need for
tweaking just funds for production help
us launch foam soap at sell this year we
started our company to connect awesome
products to the Internet of Things in
the beginning of this year we launched
the product for the irobot roomba 560
under series because we think it's a
great product that should really be
connected we are proud to say that this
product is now available in multiple
countries and recently even on Amazon
USA with a five star rating we've got
lots of requests to make thinking
cleaner available for the 700 and 800
series so here we are with a project
specifically for the irobot roomba 780
hundred series to demonstrate the added
functionality you get
once your roomba 780 undred is connected
to the Internet of Things we would like
to show you a movie based on a current
500 and 600 models let's have a look
meet David he's totally connected and
enjoying a great lifestyle in his
beautiful house being a smart guy his
house is cleaned by rumor the best robot
vacuum cleaner in the world it's time to
go to work now so let's rush out and get
going we have an exciting day ahead
presentation of the new plans so no time
to lose grab your coat and get into your
car but hold on aren't you forgetting
something David David your Roomba ah
thank goodness rad this so many times
isn't it time to upgrade your room but
so it's more connected like you are
upgrading your Roomba is easy just
replace the standard faceplate with a
thinking cleaner faceplate which adds
Wi-Fi and a lot of other features to
your existing Roomba from now on roomba
automatically starts cleaning when you
leave the house or office it even sends
you a push notification to inform you
about any status changes you selected
you can also remote start stop or
schedule your room bar from anywhere in
the world and if you can't find it just
push the button and rumbo will sing a
song for you so you can drive it back
into your arms there are so many things
you could do once your Roomba is
connected check our website to see them
all apart from the 500 and 600 series we
will also like to connect to 700 and 800
series to the Internet of Things and
although the electronics and the
software are nearly identical we do have
to build a new face plate to accommodate
our electronics and the manufacturing of
such a face plate can be very expensive
the design is finished and everything is
ready to go but for the mold creation we
need your help in funding if you like it
bless your choice and connect your
Roomba
