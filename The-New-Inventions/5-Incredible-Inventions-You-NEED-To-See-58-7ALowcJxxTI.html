filling our bags with underwear or worst
of all running out of a fresh pair just
when you need it that's why we created
silver air a revolutionary new underwear
that doesn't smell so you can pack
lighter and stay fresh longer our secret
is pure silver the same silver that's
used in hospitals and even in spacesuits
for its antimicrobial properties it
prevents the growth of odor and keeps
your gear fresh over long periods of
time so go ahead grab two pairs put them
in your bag and you'll be set for the
week to create the most comfortable
fabric we used a 17.5 micron premium
merino wool which feels softer than your
most comfortable cotton underwear while
delivering better performance than
anything you've ever worn it even
regulates temperature so no matter where
you go your jewels will stay cool dry
and insanely comfortable best of all the
silver is permanently bonded into the
fabric and last the life of the product
finally there's this something all guys
can relate to so we created smart grid
which uses soft silicone beads to
provide just the right amount of hold so
your underwear doesn't write up and
instead of being these guys you can be
that guy from the smart design to the
beautiful craftsmanship we've thought
about every single detail and cross us
in the process of creating the ultimate
travel underwear we just made the best
damn underwear for daily wear boom
music is really about a mood or a
feeling and Luna really does that really
connects you with the music really helps
to get you there it really took me by
surprise honestly to have such full
beautiful Saheb coming out of this
compact device and with the brushed
aluminum the surface feels familiar like
my iphone so i can imagine having this
at a dinner party you know with my
family and friends around it's a great
conversation piece but it's also very
subtle me luna by crazy baby a
revolutionary smart wireless speaker we
listen to music more than ever and with
Luna you can take hi-fi audio with you
throughout your day
in party mode you can give access to
multiple phones and you can sync up to
32 devices at once
Luna will automatically set up stereo
and pairing when you use more than one
device with left and right channels
we believe a space with music is a space
where something unexpected can happen
that's why with the Luna switching from
Wi-Fi to bluetooth is simple
creating an atmosphere to work play or
spend time with those you love is
something we do every day
Luna makes this experience seamless from
any smart device in any room at the same
time
Luna is made from aircraft grade
aluminum it's ultra durable and portable
we've considered each part of Luna
inside and out so you can simply let the
music connect us and connect to Luna
this is luna by crazy baby we've all
heard that sleep is important or that we
spend a third of our life in bed but
quality sleep is really what we need and
it seems harder and harder to achieve
these days what if your pillow could be
an active participant in your sleep
rather than just a dumb record what if
your pillow could help you fall asleep
you could analyze your sleep
intelligently wake you up or even react
to when you snore here we believe a
pillow should do that that's why we
invented Z the world's most
sophisticated pillow the easiest way to
think about what Zeke does is to walk
you through how you would use it before
you go to bed you'll open up the Z cap
you're going to set your alarm answer a
few optional questions about your day
even choose what kind of music you want
to listen to Zeke will wirelessly stream
your favorite music whether it's iTunes
Spotify or some of the included sleep
tracks 28 precision place speakers
inside once your sleep timer goes off
Zeke starts monitoring and analyzing
your sleep as well as listening for
snoring if Zeke detects your snoring too
loud it'll subtly vibrate to encourage
you to change sleep positions
additionally when it's time to wake up
is equal vibrate again to make sure you
wake up exactly when you wanted to but
what's really neat is with our smart
wake feature since we're already
analyzing your sleep we can tell if you
should wake up a little earlier than
your alarm I needed music to fall asleep
at night but my wife needs absolute
silence so one night I took a pot a pair
of wireless headphones and shoved him
inside my pillow and to my surprise I
was able to hear the music but my wife
wasn't I knew his own to something so i
began to figure out how i could make
this pillow better Zeke's packed with
amazing innovations in technology in
order to make all of this happen we use
eight speakers inside of Z so the
sleeper can experience their sleep
playlist no matter how they lay on their
pillow Zeke also features a 3-axis
gyroscope to analyze motion in
three-dimensional space um this is going
to allow for detailed analysis of your
sleep the microphone in Z is so
sensitive
can determine to the decibel level how
loudly you're snoring if you do begin
snoring zeagle used its vibration motors
to gently nudge you to encourage you to
change sleep position so you can wake
you up either at your set alarm time or
using smart wake wake you up based on
your sleep cycle all the Zeke settings
can be personalized to your specific
sleep needs in the app any time we went
through many different component designs
to come up with a pillow that was not
only smart and sophisticated but also
incredibly comfortable for the sleeper
comfort is one of the most important
aspects when choosing a pillow and as we
tested various fabrics for the outer
cover of Zeke we found that tensile was
the perfect choice we spent the last two
years making Zeke out favorite pillow
and it's nearly ready for you all the
hard work is being done the prototypes
finalized the supplies are lined up we
just need your help to start mass
production please help us bring Zeke to
you thank you for your support if you've
ever grown your own food you know that
grocery store produce can't even compare
it to home grown in terms of taste and
freshness but it's not easy to grow your
own food a lot of people just don't have
the time to tend to a garden
or they don't have space for one that's
why we've created a way for people to
grow their own food right in their home
it's zero this is the nato farm it'll
grow fresh produce for you just choose
what you'd like to grow will mail you a
plant pad that has seeds and new treats
fill the Nano farm straight with water
put in your plant pad push start and
walk away no need for checking up a
water in three to six weeks the harvest
light will come on and you're ready to
enjoy your fresh produce harvested all
at once or as you need it when you're
done toss the plant pad throw the tray
in the dishwasher and you're ready for a
new planet we already have a large
selection of iPads with more varieties
being added every month you can grow
veggies herbs and microgreens from all
over the world each plant pack can grow
anywhere from a few plants to hundreds
of plants depending on the variety we're
proud to say that all of our seeds are
organic and the produce you'll grow is a
hundred percent pesticide
like a garden the Nano farm is scalable
by stacking multiple nano farms you can
grow exactly the amount of food you need
the Nano farms modular design allows you
to build your urban farm to suit your
space I'm Alex and I'm one we're the
ones behind the Nano farm and we're
ready to bring this product to market
forever a year we've been testing dozens
of writings and plant pads and
perfecting our system the design of the
Nano firm has changed quite a bit
incorporating feedback from early
customers and beta testers we're all
finished with product design engineering
sourcing and testing a banana farm and
we even found a manufacturer in the u.s.
to make it with boots in hand we
understand the cost to produce an ant
farm and we have a strict manufacturing
timeline everything is ready for us to
go into production but we have to
produce in volume to make the Nano farm
affordable that's where you come in with
your support we can bring the Nano farm
to everyone help us bring farming back
to where it started oh
