hi I'm Len Kensi founder of renovations
the creator of zipping store the storage
system that helps you save by organizing
your life in the kitchen I think we all
know what it's like to have a messy
fridge containers get sacked and Ziploc
bags get caused to one on another how
can we even know what's in the
containers when the can't even see the
food inside we end up having to throw
away containers have forgotten to turn
science experiment according to Money
Magazine the average household costs
about fourteen percent of the food they
buy
that's over thirteen hundred dollars a
year with zip in store you're saving
time and money by saving your food
here's how it works
dip in store tackle storage and
organizing problems in your kitchen we
all know what it's like it's time to put
the food away so you find a container
but you can't find the lid who is
stealing all the lids and goodness for
ziplock bags but there's still a problem
have you ever gotten more messy trying
to put food away than when you are
actually eating it not with the zipper
and store system it's a convenient doing
that that allows you to switch any type
of food simply and easily into court and
gallon ziplock bags without making a
mess it's a cutting board and a flexible
funnel that puts food waste into your
compost bin

impossible to maintain and they last

remember the time I sent my husband to
the store for half-and-half
he had no idea which one to get and

stores a store and forget the list at
home anyway or come home from grocery
shopping only to realize we needed
something that nobody added to the list
