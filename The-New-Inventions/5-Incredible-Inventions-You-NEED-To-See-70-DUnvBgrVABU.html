clock it was so rad but as adults we hit
a lot of hurdles
with only eight LEDs we couldn't share
our selfies or cap voters for our memes
and then one day John said hey Nick
there's a way we can do this so in 2011
we set out to make it happen
skip images to appear out of thin air
anywhere in the world
anyway a hard thing and at first it was
pretty rough thankfully that's no good
idea Steve brilliant rather than good
but okay we can continue fall in the
hospital recovering I've had some I
think pretty good ideas to make the
future direction of the product but then
