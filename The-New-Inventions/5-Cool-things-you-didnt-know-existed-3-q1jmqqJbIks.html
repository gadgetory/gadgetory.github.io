dollar computer connect over composite
VGA or HDMI chip does computer things
save your documents to chips on-board
storage surf the web over a Wi-Fi play
games with a Bluetooth controller but
wait there's more this is pocket chip it
makes chip portable take chip put it
into pocket chip and you can use chip
anywhere you might have noticed chip
looks a little different than every
other computer because we built chip to
fit into your projects and we're so
excited to see what you can do with a
nine dollar computer Kickstarter we need
your help to make chip for nine dollars
we need to buy components and extremely
large quantities help us make the nine
dollar computer a reality and back chip
on Kickstarter today thanks
you
we launched our Kickstarter campaign a
little over a week ago and the response
has been tremendous we've gotten a great
interest from backers all over the world
and we've also gotten a lot of great
questions about some of the science
behind Eden I wanted to take a minute to
tell you how the hardware and the
software work and how they work together
to see what's going on in your garden
the Eden Garden sensor tracks data above
and below the surface of your soil using
sensors embedded into the device Eden
sends a harmless electrical signal into
your soil and then we measure how that
signal is affected by things like
moisture fertilizer or my new changes in
acidity then we cross-reference that
data with soil science databases in the
USDA the Farmers Almanac and many other
databases that have been publicly
available but never consolidated into an
easy machine-readable format and
additional sensors on the device like
light humidity temperature and your
location and we use that to determine an
accurate picture of what's going on in
your soil at any given time we wanted to
take even a step further and make smart
recommendations we consolidated a
database of 5,000 different plant
varieties and added the optimal soil
conditions and environmental conditions
for those plants to thrive by combining
all this information together we make
smart tailored recommendations that are
specific to your garden
the Eden water valve acts as an
interface between your water source and
your existing irrigation system you plug
your hose into one end and the other end
into the start of your irrigation system
and the Eden water valve will
automatically regulate the water flow if
rain is predicted in your forecast the
even water valve will actually reduce
the amount of water that your plants get
if you want to manually set times to
water you can use the app the device is
solar-powered and just like the Eden
Garden sensor it connects to your home
Wi-Fi network many of our backers have
asked if they can track their water
usage and their water savings over time
and we listened to that feedback we've
added a small sensor to the Eden water
valve that will allow you to track the
flow of your water so you can determine
exactly how much water you're using on
your garden the response from the
Kickstarter community has been
phenomenal we really appreciate your
support your questions your ideas and
your suggestions for example people have
asked about API access and we'll be
opening that up soon we hope you'll
continue to support us and grow Eden
please tell your friends and keep the
ideas coming thank you
we all like to express ourselves by
customizing the world around us a 3d
printer allows you to do that I'm an
engineer I've been involved in 3d
printing for over a decade I've seen
firsthand the amazing things that people
can do with this technology and I'm
excited about bringing it to everybody
we developed this great low-cost printer
but what still doesn't exist in the
marketplace is a fantastic end to end
user experience recognizing this is why
we partnered with frog one of the
world's leading design firms to help us
create a suite of tools to make the
whole process simple when we started
working on this project we gave
ourselves this provocation what if you
could send a 3d print to someone like
you send them a text message we want to
make this as easy as downloading an app
for your phone and this is a
game-changer having a curated library is
important because we know everything on
there is going to be good it's going to
be from designers who know how to design
for 3d printer you'll be able to read
about the artists and so you can learn
more about them you can see objects
themselves in the context of homes and
really get inspired by what other people
have done with their objects once you've
selected your objects you can modify it
and we wanted to make this process as
simple as modifying a photo on your
phone you can add shapes to it you can
adorn it with your initials you can
preview different colored filaments you
get to experiment and tinker with this
thing move it around in space and really
see what it will look like before you
make it real this technology we've
developed not only brings the cost of
the hardware down but it also makes it
work better the parts just turn out
great
all of the little fiddling and
adjustments that have been to date
required to get good results have been
done for you so it's one foot printing
and you've got a great object what are
the really exciting things about having
such an affordable 3d printer is that
more of your friends and family can have
one so suddenly you can create and
modify these objects and then you can
share them with your friends and family
and they can render it off on their
printer and then they can upload photos
back onto the library at the end of the
day we want it to be a three pretty
experienced that is meaningful to the
way that you currently approach
communicating with the people in your
lives so create relationships not just
objects we need your help to prove that
a low-cost easy to use 3d printer is
exciting we need your help to bring a
user community to light we're going to
improve the product over time we're
going to add designs to the library and
your help is going to ensure that that's
a success
you
bikes are stolen like a lot to every
minute over a million every year and
that's just what's reported that's why
we're so excited to bring you linka the
world's first auto unlocking smart bike
lock linka can do a lot of cool things
but at its core it's a powerful lock
that's hard-mounted to your frame so
you're always ready when you're ready to
lock up just tap the button and a
hardened steel ring slides into place
making it impossible to ride away so now
that your bikes locked if someone tries
picking it up linka has a built-in
accelerometer that automatically
triggers a siren stopping the thief in
their trucks while simultaneously
sending a tamper alert directly to your
phone so you know what's up now what
makes lenka a smart lock is its ability
to recognize who you are and
automatically unlock as you approach of
course you can always unlock it with
your smartphone or for phoneless access
you can press your four-digit passcode
so if you want to lock your bike to
something add on a link of chain and
just lock up to an existing bike rack if
you already have a chain or you lock
then you're all set inside linka is a
really powerful battery you can get up
to one whole year before your next
charge and the link app notifies you
when your battery's low so you never
really have to think about it so about
the app not only does it auto unlock
lenka send tamper alerts and track
battery usage we're really excited to
introduce our theft indicator map the
app tracks reported stolen bikes in your
area and warns you of dangerous
locations will even recommend a safer
place to park so we packed linka with a
bunch of awesome features but equally as
important to us was creating a design
and form factor that you'd be excited to
put on your bike so why are we doing
this the more I kept riding my bike the
more I realize how difficult it was to
keep it safe after doing some research I
found that I wasn't the only one having
this problem and that's when linka was
born
I put my engineering and product design
background to work immediately and after
almost two years of research prototyping
and testing now we're ready to go to
production all that's missing is your
support please join us and let's make
linka happen together
you
where is the next generation of personal
mobility devices that offers both
function and sigh marry me Suki see on a
co-founder will a mission is to change
the negative perception on the personal
mobility device through the night and
technology it's all began with we change
the voice he said I gave up going to saw
even just to look away the lesson
because he was invited to be seeing
wheelchair that we create the device so
he could feel confident will has to go
computations so first one is a design it
looks completely different from any
other devices so second one at the
maneuverability so we invented a special
photo way it composed 24 small rollers
it can make it very tight angle layers
for inside use and also this is
four-wheel drive it can cover on the
snow pebble any chain you go so we
actually both small tight tank various
for the inside is a good ground cumin
again put outside things
when I first saw well I was amazed by
the design I'd never seen anything like
it before and I could immediately tell
that the way people looked at me was
different
what I really like about running wheels
it's a really enjoyable experience it's
fun as fast and it's also solution with
the same time unlike other devices that
are more cumbersome and larger the will
is compact agile and intuitive
operations very simple
in social scientists or become an
extension of myself people come up not
to ask me if I need help but because
they want to talk to me and also to talk
about the chair will allows made a
function of my active lifestyle without
having to think I just do it
our goal and where is to provide
independence and start to transportation</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
