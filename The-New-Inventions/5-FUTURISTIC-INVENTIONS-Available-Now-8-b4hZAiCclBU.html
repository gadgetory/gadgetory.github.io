we believe that our technology will
forever change the way you listen to
music I man enjoy the industrial
designer and user number design and use
it a part of my everyday life but I
really disappointed with the audio
products in the market products either
fall to interpret who design with good
sound quality or the prices are too high
out of bridge by most people so I
decided to build it myself with the help
of my talent II including experienced
acoustic engineers designers in things
from structure designed to attract think
elements that apply to the speaker we do
everything to achieve zero loss of sound
quality we have created Mars to surprise
the market with something really
interesting innovative we're proud to
offer your Mars to your opponent that

incredible I was super impressed with
how high quality it was and I can't wait
to get my own speaker I love Mars eight
