electric transportation Eon is the first
Bolton kit that can convert any
skateboard into an ultra light and
powerful electric vehicle it's simply a
matter of attaching our motor and power
pack to your skateboard and you're ready
to roll
Eon is a radical new transportation
solution it will transform the way you
move around the city you'll zip through
traffic and expand your ability to use
any mode of transportation as a grad
student at MIT I commuted on my
longboard and began to imagine what the
future of transportation could be like
when I moved to San Francisco and
created my first electric longboard I
knew I was on to something I then
connected a group of amazing designers
and engineers take this idea to the next
level forget about car payments gas and
parking with Eon you'll save money and
enjoy your commute in a completely
revolutionary way each motor can deliver
more than a thousand watts of raw power
and can push you to top speeds of over
35 kilometres per hour
by integrating with your wheels we've
reduced drag so you won't even feel it's
there when pushing our of√∂ see
technology makes the ride completely
smooth and silent so stealthy that it'll
be hard to even tell you're on an
electric board well besides the fact
that you'll be able to fly uphill our
kit is modular you can choose between
one or two motors and batteries to
optimize for range and terrain one pack
gives you up to 12 kilometers of range
which can be doubled with a second pack
installing Eon is a breeze just swap
your wheels for our motor and slide the
battery pack under your trucks if you
don't have a board we offer three types
to suit your riding style that will come
completely free assemble Eon is great
when you're learning how to ride you can
bomb down any Hill confidently with the
safety of regenerative braking that will
recharge your board while slowing you
down the Eon remote takes advantage of
the latest in advanced biomechanics
research to create the most comfortable
intuitive and ergonomic controller
available today
your Eon experiences can be controlled
by our mobile app fine-tune your board
review your stats and even connect with
other riders we've designed Eon to be a
platform for all your urban
transportation needs it's modular design
will allow you to swap the power pack
from your board to other electric
vehicles we are already designing Eon
for bikes

Zboard is a portable easy to use weight
sensing electrics capable to ride you
simply lean forward to go and lean back
to stop speed is totally variable so you
lean forward a little bit to go walking
speed then you can lean forward a little
bit more to accelerate up to the top
speed the Z board is great for all the
in-between commutes that all of us face
each and every day since you can just
grab it and go it's really perfect for
any trip that's too far to walk lets you
short to drive
we ship the Z board the customers in
every US state in over 50 countries
you heard what you've had to say we're
excited about all the improvements that
we've made to c4 - we've improved upon
our one-of-a-kind weights into control
by incorporating foot pads that are
larger and more sensitive the result is
a board that's easier to ride in a lot
more fun our new lithium battery is
lighter and slimmer greatly reducing the
weight while simultaneously improving
range and cutting charge time in half
our brushless motor is more efficient
faster than ever
finally our new motor controller is
rugged and splash proof and powers
features like headlights taillights and
regenerative braking
every day urban people spend over two
hours commuting at L wing we believe
commuting should be the fun and easy
part of the day we're proud to announce
the world's most compact electric
skateboard
oh we found on a market where electric
longboards electric long boards are
super fun but they're heavy and they're
expensive
I got a mechanical engineering back one
and I always fancy to make new stuff for
example new boards new motorcycles new
skateboards so this is why we decided to
create the air wing board the in wheel
motor is very powerful you can go up to
18 miles per hour and you can ride seven
miles in a single charge the sensation
you have a phenomenal this board is
actually for everyone from the beginner
to the expert level so it's super easy
to run it you would expect a lot more
weight that's pretty cool yeah it's
freaking awesome I'm sick I thought it
was pretty cool it was in pretty fast
it's easy and then the brake on pull of
the part that you can hit it with speed
let go this completely any freewheel off
I can give it a little go and then let
it go vote it was nice it was nice with
the big wheels on it
down the ride this it's exactly what I'm
looking
