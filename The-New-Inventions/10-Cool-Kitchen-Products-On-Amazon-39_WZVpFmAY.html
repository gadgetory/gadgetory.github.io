important with tape it's common
knowledge that food actually tastes
better when it's beautifully presented
you get a picture
hi I'm Beth the chef and welcome to get
cooking with fornia and thinking of nice
presentation take a look at the core
media mantle empowered I just love this
elegantly designed tool turns any cook
into a culinary artist there are five
color-coded stainless-steel blade
cartridges for various results the
cornea is the only one that slices and
dices just low the cartridge in the flaw
and you're ready to create turn it on
and feed your wash vegetables or fruit
into the chute the guys product is ready
to serve or transfer to a third
condition salad bowl or
you can just do a lot of it
the veggie chop is one of the most
versatile tools in the chef and line
it's one of my personal favorites it's
great for chopping nuts as we're going
to do right now to herbs to doing salsa
batches welcome Olli I mean you name it
it does the trick so you just take some
nuts here as inside take the lid place
it on top make sure it's locked into
place and then you just turn this pull
this you tie the amount of holes that I
do is how finely or coarsely chopped the
nuts will be we'll just do a few more
unlocks
within just a few pulls look what we've
done so you can actually put it in here
for storage if you'd like or serving and
let's show one other thing we can do
very popular item that the veggie top is
great for onions let's just throw a
couple in here and see how fast the
veggie chop can whip these into shapes
so once again lock it into place just a
few coals on the cord and how many poles
is that I wasn't counting but look at
this check it out
you could just throw some cilantro in
there tomatoes you know a little few
spices whatever you want to do you can
make salsa right there all in one batch
and if you don't want to use it right
now or you have a little excess it comes
with a handy lid you just pop on top and
just push down and you're ready to put
this in the fridge for later
Shepard has created the perfect popcorn
popper the pop top this great little
gadget makes homemade popcorn fast and
movie night fun for the whole family let
me show you how it works
measuring the right amount of kernels is
easy with the pop top to make a full 10
cups of popcorn fill the basin on the
bottom right to the edge to close the
pop top fold in the triangles one by one
like this then place in the microwave
for about two minutes
use the tabs on either side of the
popper to remove it basically from the
microwave then ask salt and enjoy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
