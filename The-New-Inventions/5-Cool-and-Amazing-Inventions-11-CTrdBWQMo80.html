that we've never made me feel it's a
mantle energy manson engines were
invented by some good ad madison 1952
maxon engine share some similarities
with Stirling engines that has some
fundamental differences in essence it's
almost like a simplest image last year
we ran a successful Kickstarter campaign
with our nano cannon sterling in here
while I was developing that engine I
came up with the idea to make a whole
family of different pods air engines all
based on a similar design so this next
project is our manson hot air engine and
we're calling it the nano disk engine
all manson engines rely on valve opening
and closing at the top and bottom of the
piston stroke for their operation for
this nano disk engine I have developed
that I think is a unique valve
arrangement I can't say too much about
this at the moment because there are
patent applications pending but tests
have shown a significant improvement in
performance one of the interesting
things about manson engines is the noise
they make which can be described as a
burbling purring noise this is caused by
the valves opening and closing 30 times
a second a motorized Bluetooth
controlled base that lets you take
perfect 360-degree panoramas you can now
surprised the world with 360° panoramic
images altering the storytelling game
you have the capability to reveal even
more ensuring that none of your
memorable scenes are ever lost because
of bad stitching through bumps and
shakes the orbit 360 solves this problem
working as a stable rotating base for
your smartphone it's easy to use and
come
hacked it comes with a remote control
which is the ultimate selfie enabler I
am cardboard has always been about
empowering creators and storytellers the
orbit 360 is designed to complement our
discover app discover takes immersive
and panoramic still images the discover
app has a three ring recording system
creating satirical images do you find
taking satirical images a challenge the
orbit 360 supports the 3-ring captured
by tilting your phone up and down making
the perfect panoramas turning your
viewers into explorers sharing your
content should be easy and immediate so
we introduced to super compact viewers
first off we have the flip 360 a
smartphone case with the built-in VR AR
headset and if you need something even
more compact there's our second option
the pocket 360 your big adventures are
now pocket-sized what if filming took
care of itself if you were able to swim
explore and dive while your camera
follow
hi I'm Ben and this is kevin well divers
went to exploring marveling at the
beauty of the ocean and bringing back
memories of our underwater adventures if
you're like us you know how call it is
to share your diving experiences with
people online you also know how filming
gets in the way of simply enjoying the
moment which is why we dive in the first
place that's why a year ago we had the
dream with imagine an autonomous
underwater drone that follows you during
your dad's lets you capture beautiful
footage hands-free so you can focus on
the diving now I will always in path of
becoming a reality this camera is
completely autonomous autonomous means
that you don't have to do anything at
all
we've created and patented an underwater
localization technology it enables I
bubble to know where you are and to keep
you or your surroundings in the frame
now you can record your diving
adventures with no camera handling
whatsoever I bubble comes loaded with a
built-in library of carefully designed
camera movements all you have to do is
choose your shot from the control
bracelet and I bubble execute the
results are incredible beautiful
underwater footage from completely new
perspectives you might wonder how I
bubble performs when you have let's say
a specific close up to shoot good
question you just call I bubble back
with your bracelet grab it and film as
you want when you're done let I bubble
go and it goes right back to follow mode
we've all dreamed of following a
telltale or month away while it swim
fast and far away so we've enabled I
beable to do just that all by itself
press the target locking button for a
few seconds and I bubble will recognize
the shape it needs to follow release it
and watch as it glides by turtles and
sharks capturing what's out of your
reach we've designed all the features in
close collaboration with the diving
community and professionals from the
underwater world unification pooja
bubbles affected una the vomit on
Japanese GCE
oh yeah boos one in Coon hunts read
under the community he does at the same
time she a mani hoga in that competence
cocaine is a talk to mesh 9k me Roberto
know he played four known earlier me do
this anymore seen everything it's just
expands usually the type of things that
i can create so how does a future prison
one portion in evolution policy analogy
see Davina I can't wait to have my own I
bubble today with the work we've done
and the team we've built we know we can
make above all a reality the last thing
we need is your help if we reach our
goal will access the whistles is needed
to deliver a bubble next year with more
fans will have even more features so by
I beable today thank you from the entire
I bubble team what if you could
customize your own remote control
heavy-duty track-type platform what
would you do would you use it for
landscaping projects move bulky and
heavy objects you can put your generator
on it rolled where you need it instead
of dragging by hand over rough ground
would you just ride it around or
something else the options are endless
this is the Caddy track precision
engineer using the latest computer aided
design software the candy track is a
platform both literally and figuratively
that allows the user to fully customize
its purpose beyond just moving the load
on deck or pulling other equipment with
spare power outputs enabled by the
remote you can activate auxiliary power
circuits to energize anything from an
extra-large wheelbarrow with dumping
action to electric log splitters or
anything else you can imagine it's all
up to you the tinkerers and makers out
there who if you can imagine it we're
here to help you make it
work our team worked through four
iterations of this product already and
we know it will change the way you work
with carrying capacities of over a
quarter ton and durable Motors tracks
and lithium-ion batteries it's built to
perform the cadi track has the potential
with the right attachments just help
with any number of back-breaking tasks
at a cost that's far lower than anything
comparable on the market today so the
real question is what can caddy track do
for you and what can you get done with
the Caddy track we all love to travel
whether it's discovering new places are
going back home to visit family and
friends however a long journey can
really do a number on your body even a
few days after you get to your
destination you still seem to be
recovering typically if you're traveling
on a long journey and want to get some
rest you can either use a neck pillow or
a mashed up sweatshirt or jacket we knew
there had to be something better than
this and after doing our research and
creating multiple prototypes we're
excited to introduce the nod travel
pillow
the not travel pillow is the ultimate
sleep travel solution it keeps your neck
and head at a 90 degree angle which is
the exact same position in which you
sleep in a bed the over-the-top design
keeps your head from falling forward or
leaning left or right that way you won't
wake up with a kink in your neck or a
bit of awkwardness from sleeping on the
person seated next to you the nod travel
pillow is simple to use and works on all
types of seats from plane seats car
seats train seats and even desk chairs
plus the memory foam pillow is super
soft and the exterior is a breathable
and water repellent PU fabrics you can
be asleep for hours comfortably we
promise you this is the best sleep you
will ever get while traveling in order
to produce the nod travel pillow at an
affordable price with a quality
manufacturer we need to meet a minimum
order quantity that's where you come in
with your support on kickstarter we can
make the ultimate sleep travel solution
a reality
