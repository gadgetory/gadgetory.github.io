introducing the latest advancement in
the field of fun meet Cody bot designed
by Meg block this smart robot teaches
kids the basics in computer programming
using a simple graphic programming
language similar to MIT scratch you can
give the robot a series of commands but
then immediately see the magic happen
this provides a safe and easy
introduction of the language and mindset
of computer programmers in free play
mode you can just start playing every
spin grin dance and silly voice
naturally teaches coding skills you can
customize code eva in so many ways or
care to cody bots together for battle
mode may the best Cody Botwin Cody bond
is an open platform to learn explore and
discover equip your child with the
fundamentals they need to thrive in the
age of robotics with Cody body let's
program the fun since when was coding
this cool
so y'see cookies this robot was designed
from the ground up to help developing
engineers learn about programming math
and electronics by solving concrete
problems that they can relate to you in
real life it comes in a flat-pack bundle
of wood hardware electronics and you
build and program it yourself when you
work with your zero beast you're not
just programming a box with a screen
you're building and controlling the
actions and behavior of the physical
thing that resembles a living organism
with beautiful kinematics and locomotion
inspired by tayo'y onsens genius leg
linkage design and unlike some of the
other kits out there it isn't a closed
in opaque system it's meant to be
tangible and tactile you're encouraged
to take it apart hack it build new
attachments and make it physically
interact with you in the world around
you we will guide you from the very
basics all the way to having a fully
fledged robotic pet companion we provide
lesson plans videos and even physical
copies if you'd like that will teach you
or your kid how to do all of these
awesome things with their Arduino core
array of sensors it's sound pack and the
full range of add-ons and you can tap
into what you can do with your super
beast is limited only by what you can
imagine it can free and welcoming when
you come home
I can fetch your slippers in the morning
you can bark at intruders coming into
your room or scurry away from bright
lights into the corner if you even go on
covert missions to the neighbor's
backyard
using his fpv camera or you can play
with your friends and classmates using a
pack of Zebedee's so you can play
capture the flag
let's rout a fittest Freeman race to the
maze we already launched one successful
Kickstarter for the ziggo beast classic
a fully mechanical version powered by
Springs using the equipment that we had
here at TechShop Pittsburgh along with
Autodesk fusion 360 3d design software
we successfully delivered all of our
rewards in fact we delivered ahead of
schedule what we found out was that
people loved the intricacy of the design
and they loved the aspect that zeger be
served wooden and nature friendly but
most of all they loved the fact that all
of our machines were made right here in
her hometown this is where we got
started with robotics after all that's
one of our primary goals to give back to
this community we've already started
working with the local public school
system to introduce more kids to
robotics with zebra beasts but we also
want to keep manufacturing inner-city
and contribute to the economic
development and innovation that's been
happening here we believe that robotics
is the future our dream was to create an
instrument that lets you make music from
nothing
just pick a sound play notes
and make loops we have revolutionized
the way to see music by putting notes
that sound good together next to each
other
an instrument you can play where you
want when you want and how you want no
need for computer everything is included
inside you can add your own sound
play life covers our original
compositions in your own style
learn how to play

echo is a revolutionary new audio device
that enables your existing headphones or
speakers to receive wireless Wi-Fi on yo
from any source each user simply takes a
battery-powered sound pop from the base
station and plugs in any pair of
headphones the result instant - a
wireless audio for the whole family most
wireless headphone systems are bulky and
expensive and often designed for only
one user we designed echo because we
believe everyone should be able to use
their headphones or speakers to enjoy a
phenomenal wireless listening experience
echo is specifically designed to
accommodate multiple users up to four or
more can listen together at the same
time it's built-in Wi-Fi technology
delivers high quality ultra-low latency
sound for a real-time listening
experience it's perfect for movies music
gaming and more echo delivers a highly
customized listening experience that's
designed to fit each user's preference
each sound puck has individual volume
controls while the smart mobile app
controls equalizer settings streaming
settings and more it even has parental
controls like volume limiting to help
ensure safe listening for kids
we designed echo because we wanted to
create a high quality social wireless
listening experience that our expensive
wireless headphones simply couldn't
provide we wanted something powerful
enough to create an audiophile grade
listening experience it's simple enough
for the whole family to enjoy something
that untether is you that allows you
more freedom and better range in
Bluetooth or our
and when we couldn't find it we decided
to build it over the past year our
in-house team is prototype 2 working
proof of concept created an elegant
beautiful industrial design and laid out
a development roadmap for finishing the
consumer ready device we've teamed up
with world-class designers and engineers
and lineup suppliers and manufacturing
partners capable of producing echo to
our high standards we designed echo to
complement your existing entertainment
accessories echo offers each user
individual control of their own
listening experience it was thoughtfully
designed to look great in any setting
fireflies are enchanting when I was a
boy I loved catching fireflies I would
go out into a field with a mason jar
holes in the lid and I catch a Firefly
put it inside and I have a chance to
observe beautiful soft leathery wings
not like the hard wings and most beetles
but I knew I had to let it go
it was trapped then I learned something
amazing
every Firefly species that flashes
flashes its own unique flash code and I
thought if I could emulate these flash
codes maybe I can talk to fireflies
so I created this Firefly communicator
you press the button and it caught the
fireflies they come right to you the
other night in my home in Brooklyn New
York I looked out the window and I saw
fireflies in the backyard
I went to the window opened it up sat in
the sill with the Firefly communicator
and I started calling to them it wasn't
long before one came right over it
dimmed its signal and then it even
landed on the communicator it really
works
I'm Joey Stein for my entire career
including six years at the American
Museum of Natural History I have been
creating interactive experiences that
connect all of us to science and the
natural world now after more than 18
months of developing and prototyping
I've come up with this Firefly
communicating device you can use the
communicator right out of the box it
comes with an app that allows you to
download Firefly languages or flash
codes you can even make your own flash
codes this is an exciting opportunity
because not all flash codes are known
with this device you can even advance
science all you do is place the Firefly
communicator directly on the screen
press upload in an exciting parallel to
actual fireflies the code is transmitted
by light from your screen to the sensor
at the bottom of the communicator
Lenna playing screen the upload was
successful and you're ready to speak to
a new Firefly species my goal is to
produce the first Firefly communicators
this summer when fireflies are most
active to do this I need your help
your funds will go to fine-tuning the
app and producing the first Firefly
communicators please join me with your
support we will all be speaking Firefly
for the first time ever in June for
those of you who don't know Edward o
Wilson is one of the world's most
prominent naturalist he's the Darwin of
our day and he endorsed the Firefly
communicator in fact he wrote me an
email I'm happy to endorse the proposed
Firefly educational tool to learn about
these amazing little beetles their lives
and their Morse code like communication
is just the kind of experience I would
have enjoyed as a boy first forming my
lifelong interest in insects and nature
we need these flashy beetles and they
need us to protect their habitats please
contribute when we first caught that
Firefly in a jar it sparked a curiosity
it began a relationship now we can
deepen that relationship we can talk we
can communicate</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
