addictive yes a team of Swedish
neurologists is currently searching for
a cure hi I'm Jordan and I wanted to
tell you about human gears new utensil
line the go by there's the uno duo and
trio we made the go bites from a
proprietary nylon material that's
virtually unbreakable while other
utensils may not hold up there's a
reason we bagged the go bikes with a
lifetime warranty the Uno's you shape is
ergonomic and we improved the fork and
spoon ends the spoon is deep enough for
suit and designed to scrape up every
last piece of food the fork times are
long enough for pasta and the tapered
splitter times easily cut out softer
foods
the duo has the same optimized fork and
spoon hands and add some neat tricks of
the tongue you can use the fork and
spoon separately or connect them
together for a tool that's even longer
than most extra-long utensils so it's no
sweat to reach into deep containers
without getting sauce all over your
hands
the trio packs a full sized fork spoon
and knife into an ultra-thin case the
tools feature the same optimized ends
and they're accessible separately just
grab the one you want the trio's knife
is sharp enough to cut chicken and it
even has a bottle opener we think you'll
like the toothpick too so that's the go
bites lineup super-strong
ergonomic smart in fact 100% by our
lifetime warranty the go bites
uno duo and trio the civilized tools for
eating on the go only from human gear</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
