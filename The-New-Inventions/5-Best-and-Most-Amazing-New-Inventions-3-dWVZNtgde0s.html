as your everyday writing and drawing
tools while offering advanced digital
features like flip to erase perfect palm
rejection hover zoom and more without
ever needing batteries buttons or even a
Bluetooth connection meet flip the
stylist that is as easy to use as the
pencil you grew up with flip uses an
incredibly simple and unique method of
communicating with any Apple device so
you can write on your iPad or iPhone
just like you would with a pen and paper
making flip the most intuitive digital
note-taking stylus ever developed it's
also a very powerful tool that digital
artists will love with flips
interchangeable magnetic tips the artist
in you will be inspired to draw sketch
and paint in all your favorite apps in
the past advanced smart stylus features
like flip to erase palm rejection and
others have required complex electronics
to improve upon this we powered flip
with magnetics our rare earth magnets
produce an exact invisible magnetic
field that is always on just like the
Earth's magnetic field flips patented
software algorithms developed by our
software partner why advantage use the
hardware already in your device this
sense and detect flips magnetic field
and determine the precise location and
orientation of the stylus so our palm
rejection flip to erase and other
features work perfectly want to erase
flip knows just flip it over and your
clip is now an eraser want to rest your
palm on the screen while using the
stylus clip knows since we know the
exact location of the stylus we can
perfectly reject any other object
touching the screen want to hover and
then zoom in to generate more detail
flip knows just enable the hover
functionality and we can even detect the
stylist while it is still in the air
want to take notes in a class or meeting
but don't want to reenter your password
and reconnect your bluetooth stylus
every time your iPad wigs up again flip
knows we sense when you stop writing an
automatically dim your screen to help
save power and then
instantly turn your screen back on when
you are ready to make your next note
flip comes with a free easy to use note
taking and drawing app called flipnotes
we also know many of our backers already
have their favorite apps so we've
developed an app developers kit that
allows any note-taking or drawing app to
quickly integrate flips features into
their apps we've already engaged with
several popular apps and we'll be happy
to keep adding to the list just let us
know your favorite apps and we will work
with them in addition to note taking and
drawing our software partner is
developing fun educational learning apps
for kids that can be activated by flip
these apps will be available on the
iTunes Store this is our third
Kickstarter project and we love that our
backers continue to drive our innovation
thank you for allowing us to turn your
ideas into products flip by link tech
smart intuitive simple we can't wait to
see what you create with your flip
traditional construction bricks are a
work of genius when it comes to building
rigid structures that when you add
flexor and the little creativity a new
door opens to a world of flexibility
flexo when added to regular construction
bricks changes the dynamic of building
and adds new functionality flexibility
strength and support we have seen but a
fraction of what the system can do in
the hands of master builders
my name is James and on the son of Mark
the creator of flick sir when I saw the
product I just thought you know this is
something pretty special pretty amazing
and really wanted to get on board with
it and be a part of what flex hours and
what it can offer win flicks I was
designed we wanted to give people the
opportunity to really unleash their
creativity and that in turn would just
absolutely maximize the enjoyment they
get out of their sets of construction
Brooks what led me to develop flicks
though was that I was enough physio and
I had a torn tendon and I was just
amazed absolutely amazed at the beauty
of the body and how our bones and
tendons work together it was a bone is a
very fixed construction and then
attendin allows a fixed construction to
move with elegance so how does flick so
work it's really simple the ends of the
flexor tendon fits snugly into the
openings of the flexor brick and when
you want to get really extreme you can
further secure the flexor tendon by
placing another brick flexo or otherwise
on top then you can twist Bend stretch
and flex to your heart's content the
only limitation to what you create is
the vast expanse of your imagination and
your flexor collection
so it flex those an add-on to regular
construction bricks it was designed to
add to the experience and the
opportunity that regular construction
bricks allow in terms of creativity as
well as design and ideas it allows you
to for very small investment basically
and twice if not three times the
functionality to the existing brick
collection you already have new ideas
and users are coming up every day with
flex oh and how it interacts with
construction bricks it can provide
rigidity flexibility stored energy
playability and even bling ability all
we need now is a little help from you
pledge today to get your flexor I do
into sports yeah I really like in liner
you know wind in hair my favorite song
the freedom
well except for those heavy shoes I've
got a hole in my backpack hmm and what
about hiking sure I love hiking being
out nature is where I can unwind and get
new ideas it's just really a drag
lugging around those heavy boots all day
then why don't we use Skinner's water
Skinner's Skinner's the most
ultraportable foot there in the world
also I mean they're like super cool
Skinner's in light get very durable they
fit into your pocket don't slip and have
a cooling effect and best of all get out
seriously yep you can throw them in the
washer
scanners were designed to be worn
anywhere anytime like at our wedding
okay well almost any time if you're
tired of carrying an extra pair of shoes
with you all the time try Skinner's
they're lightweight portable comfort
simply put its foot where to in to
perfection I get it so I can have
Skinner's with me all the time like when
we take a trip to Japan again we do know
that about a quarter to a half the
population in the United States and
other countries as well as trouble
sleeping the nice thing about the dream
pad is that it's doing something about
it it's really helping you relax and
fall asleep when you lay down on the
dream pad you're hearing sound in a way
that you're not typically used to the
vibration gets picked up by your head
and is carried to your inner ear it has
a very different sound and a very
different effect on the body
physiologically Columbia University did
a study with working adults that have
light sleep issues and found that the
dream pad was particularly helpful in
them sleeping through the night another
study that was done found in eighty-five
percent of the people that use the dream
pad within five minutes their bodies
relaxation response was triggered and
they saw this immediate call me
when I lay on the dream pad it just
takes me to this other realm really I
use it and I feel refreshed and as a
result i'm a better parent I'm dr.
Michael Bruce also known as the sleep
doctor I'm helping people reframe their
thoughts surrounding sleep one of the
top things that a lot of patients turn
to me and say is they can't turn off
their brain at night they're stressed
out there having a difficult time
sleeping even if you're just having a
mild amount of stress but it's not sleep
related this is a tool that I pull out
of my tool belt we're all different
types of patients it seems to trigger
the relaxation response if you are using
it your bed partner can't hear it
doesn't feel it although sometimes
they've been known to steal it the music
is really nice whenever my mind is
racing or I'm thinking a lot about
something it just kind of slows my
thoughts down and makes it easier to go
to sleep dream pet seems to be working
with a very high success rate with kids
that have hyper sensitivity as well as
night terrors my 12 year old gets
anxious in order to get him sleeping
again we tried the dream pad it calmed
him so much that he was able to start
sleeping on his own
it works like a charm the beauty of the
dream pad is how it is so effective as a
nonpharmacologic non-invasive approach
to improving sleep which has been
clinically verified decreased stress
decreased anxiety there are a few
different ways to listen to the music
and the dream pad app you can either put
your cell phone on airplane mode and
plug that directly into the dream pad or
you can use bluetooth it streams the
music wirelessly the sound is very good
it fits right in a little pocket of the
dream pad I try to take charge and shave
his back but he walks around looking
like a when you take your shirt off
