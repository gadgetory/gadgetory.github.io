the dock so there's no trouble turning
them on every night or off in the
morning and for all this ease you'll pay
just ten cents of energy for the entire
year and because they're LEDs not bulbs
the last four decades that's right

hey Siri turn the lights on in my
bedroom
okay the lights are turned on lighting
has been around for two million years
that's when our human ASUS actually
learn to control fire eventually evolved
into incandescent light we long with the
Industrial Revolution
nowadays with oiling with LED technology
and of course the human society has
evolved rapidly along with that you
could say commands like turn my lights
down to 10% or you could set scenes like
snuggle time right when you want to set
the mood for something it's not just a
matter of function it's it's so much
more about how we actually live our life
what we do how we do it when we do it we
take our design very seriously we work
really hard to take a lot of complex
technology and put it into the simplest
form factor to be able to create the
simplest conveniences like being able to
turn off your kitchen lights while
you're lying in bed we understand
lighting in the two years that we've
been around we have won multiple awards
in categories for energy efficiency as
well as product design and the light
quality of the product we design this
product to be future proof we do it by
allowing software updates as well as
using open protocols and the open Pro
course allows this product to work with
a range of other different products the
idea and the philosophy behind this
system we don't want this product to end
up on the landfill name in the next one
year it's going to be working with
existing technology with future
technology for the next 30 years at
least and give you great beautiful
lights when we started namma leaf our
first goal was to create the world's
most energy-efficient light bulb and our
technology has evolved lights on we
believe this is the future of lighting
