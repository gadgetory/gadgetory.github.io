single device that allows you to open
the doors of your office or your home be
sure that if someone needs your phone to
make a quick phone call or for whatever
reason you can restrict access to your
photos through text messages emails or
any application within that cell phone
without losing control of your privacy
how about accessing your medical records
every single time you go to the doctor
with just a tap go see a movie without
the need of physical tickets me not to
remember a single password to access
your accounts and forget about caring
around to your business cards transfer
your contact information or social
networks with a single tap directly on
the phone of that other person
preventing oversight or losses every
single day we have the need of
identifying ourselves for everything we
do think about it we swipe access keys
or tap Bob's to get it to work or into
our homes for our very own personal
security we must create and remember a
ton of passwords and pins in so many
different combinations of numbers
letters and symbols if you were to open
up my pocketbook right now you'll find a
mess it's embarrassing with dozens of
rewards cards my business cards once
that I've received credit cards and much
more and then instead of making our life
simpler all of this technology has made
it more complicated this is why we've
created on the site e hello my name is
Johanna and I want to present you unless
which will change your lives completely
unless ID is a unique and universal ID
which will allow us to replace our
passwords access cards and access codes
all in one simple device that we can
always carry with us and that of course
complies with the highest safety
standards to ensure that we are always
being protected we put a lot of thought
into the sign of our msid products
because we think the quality and
appearance of our products is just as
important as the technology behind them
that's why all of our products are light
water resistant and come in a wide range
of colors shapes and sizes did I mention
you don't have to charge them ever how
does endless ad work believe it or not
nsit works with the technology that we
use almost every day and that's been
around for years and FC or near field
communication it's the same one we have
in many of our cellphones credit cards
and key cards which allow us to use them
with just a tap the use of NFC
technology is predicted to grow
exponentially over the next few years
because it has proven reliable and
cost-effective each endless ad product
contains an NFC chip which identifies
you as a person wherever you go you can
have various and the safety devices
connected to that same unique ID each
associated with the same account we've
created an endless 18 mobile app so you
can manage all of your endless a
device's change their privacy settings
choose your security options block or
add access to different ethnicity
devices and of course program all the
cool features each of our devices have
to offer if for some reason you lose one
of your unless ID devices so worried you
can always use the app to block any of
your devices at any time and keep your
information and your privacy safe we
know that msit is unique this is why we
have designed an sdk software
development kits and ap is that are
available to any developer so they have
the chance to integrate endless ID to
their products and applications as
developers take full advantage of
everything LS ad has to offer creating
new ideas and features for them and for
our products the potential and the city
has in the near future is limitless this
is a potential endless ID has sounds
good right almost too good to be true I
promise you even though it may seem
impossible it's not with endless IT all
of this and much more as possible but
this is just the beginning with your
help we can make this a reality not only
our products affordable for all
consumers it will also get developers
the opportunity to make money with their
genius apps we are committed to giving
everyone an easier more enjoyable life
