making super-users
wood-burning backpacking and camping
stoves are unique patented design
doesn't require any bulky batteries or
fans all you need is a handful of twigs
or sticks
year after year we enjoy interacting
with the growing numbers so low so cute
we're grateful that they trust our
products enough to take with them on
their most memorable adventures we
believe that time spent outdoors with
family and friends can remain some of
life's most precious and meaningful
moments but with our lives becoming
busier and busier spending time with
those we care about is becoming more
difficult so we're making it easier for
you to spend more time with family and
friends outdoors
introducing the solo stove bonfire a
backyard fire pit like you've never seen
before
the bonfire uses the same patented
design and technology as our other solo
soaps but it's our largest model yet
it's designed with unique double wall
which allows air flows through the
bottom holes of the bonfire to channel
air to the bottom of the fire and up
between the walls this pre heated air
allows the fire to burn more complete
which results in a more efficient fire
with very little smoke a more efficient
burn means you'll get more fire from
your logs compared to an open fire pit
the bonfire is super durable made out of
premium 304 stainless steel and is
backed by a lifetime guarantee
we can't wait to bring the soothing
ambience the dancing flames and the
rustic smell of a glowing campfire
straight to your backyard we're excited
to play a small part in bringing you
together with family and friends in the
outdoors become a backer and be the
first to experience the solo stove
bonfire at our practical real of
high-voltage shooting spark and lighting

boiled alive we knew it was time to put
one in everyone's pocket
introducing the sparker a plasma lighter
and flashlights and one the flashlight
is a 1 watts interval LED second run for
four hours on cold rice the removable
lid doubles as a diffusers transforming
the light into a lantern the plasma
lighter uses electricity to create a
windproof solution that requires no
plain butane or fuel
the sparker is great for any of your
outdoor adventures

hi crowd for this I'm Jake and I'm a
founder of cinch two years ago the aisle
between a source most often Stan so I'm
a 30 countries worldwide and a response
was phenomenal you've proven the crown
from them the best way to launch an
innovative idea of your feedback we made
even more improvement I came through a
vision for exceptional campus without
compromising you bro my dream to life
all the benefits of regular temple funds
more is none of the hassles I designed
every singe 10 you can attach a solar
power pack this captures solar energy on
the roof of the tent cannot the inside
through a weatherproof or to a
pocket-sized power banks which we've
upgraded this year to have three times
the capacity of the previous model the
solar packing so versatile you pout all
of the USB powered gadgets and there's
two USB ports you can part two devices
at the same time we can see the power
bank with you on the move just unplug it
and slip it into your pocket there's two
entrances each with their own porch
spanning flows and functionality you can
tailor to your needs you need to cinch
each entrance have its own kind of built
in touchable poles and new to 2016 super
expanded country especially when you
live in space my next four square meters
all the kids have clearly arranged the
back this year pieces of to kill 30
moves attach the inside except since
comes in three sizes two three four
thousand each one in the last class the
format of a 6 square meters was
expressed the biggest concept in the
world every 10 inch double skin to stop
conversion music fans walk through
something three times the industry
standard in the extra profession really
wet condition you don't want to get to a
campsite that's been made is assembling
your tent to be able to enjoy yourself
straightaway met the most be an outdoors
I came up with in chapel years ago a
newly Festival championships never find
an attempt receive money I won three
dozens of tents the big manufacturers
always let me down they invented as an
admin of some goes out nighttime it just
as a Father's Day since it's fully
equipped to the dark every singe is
packed with LED Tampax to kill torches
return to long-term we now made the life
of the guyline glow-in-the-dark
we designed a blackout canopy also
regularity super reasons for and mattre
second in the morning complete an
attempt one key one source there cool
comfortable and fitted instantly took
less women
we developed this product for people
with an active lifestyle though to carry
a backpack those who ride subway those
who ride their bike commuting to work
those who are adventurous growing up in
Colorado I found the real passion for
the natural world I want to live healthy
I want to eat healthy I want to have
that food with me all the time we've
made a reusable container that you can
take everywhere with you it's super
convenient it's wonderful to have and
it's worth its weight when you carry
around the majority of trash that I
create is from food waste wax cardboard
styrofoam plastic things that get thrown
away it's all packaging I want to do
everything I can to prevent the natural
world for being stuffed with trash what
does it mean to live in a world where
we're conscious about the way we create
waste there are ways to reduce it we
developed a product that doesn't break
easily is dishwasher safe and food safe
is approved by all the science
foundations for food and it can clip
easily to your backpack that makes it
highly portable it holds 33 ounces
that's a big enough meal for any size
and shapes I look forward to how
convenient it can be to have home-cooked
food anywhere
I tried at first carrying food in for
instance Tupperware I constantly look
around for a container that won't leak
and none of them fit that bill they
always have some amount of liquid coming
out of them the green traveler allows
you to carry delicious healthy food with
you you can pack any food you want or
non-food items it won't leak it will
keep water out and you have four
compartments to choose from you get to
experience home-cooked food from
anywhere anyone who packs lunch for the
day needs a way to do that without
creating wait the green traveller is
food safe dishwasher safe liquid tight
and you can clip it to your backpack we
see this is the most convenient way to
carry food with you students can take it
to college
adults can take it to work it can be
used for food it can be used for other
items as well first aid supplies mothers
can pack all the things their baby might
need go to a food truck or hot bar

packaging we're providing a solution for
healthy and sustainable lifestyle we are
a team of engineers and MBAs we have
experience taking businesses out into
productions that we're confident if you
