what makes a luxury pen so expensive
the main reason luxury goods are marked
up by 1000% is the cost of distribution
wholesalers and retailers so our team at
infinity set out to disrupt all that and
bring you to world firsts in the process
last year we presented our pen from
space and delivered the world's only
meteorite pen containing a real chunk of
meteorite it went on to be selected by
the World Science Festival to be
presented to the world's top scientists
this year we are very excited to present
to you our new pen collection but before
we do that here's how we made it first
we took inspiration from the great
California Dream during the gold rush
great cities were born and pioneering
fortunes were made people just like us
were inspired by adventure and
opportunity we were inspired to design a
pen that captured this pioneering time
and entrepreneurial spirit our vision
was to design a beautiful luxury pen
centered on a pure gold nugget a design
challenge never attempted before
after months of extensive research and
development we achieved our goal we
created the exclusive gold rush pen
series each pen unique and with its own
character and story to tell to ensure
each pen is truly unique we select the
optimum raw gold nuggets
we teamed up directly with
world-renowned gold providers to help
source the best American gold and ensure
the highest quality possible-- we
showcase each unique nugget in a museum
quality miniature enclosure to display
exactly as it left the ground in fact we
are so confident in the quality of the
pens we offer a lifetime guarantee with
every order
there are form writing experiences
available for those of us that simply
love writing in great design we present
the gold rush fountain pen for
architectural and engineering precision
work there is the gold rush mechanical
pencil for those that like simplicity
the classic gold rush ballpoint with
twist action and finally our most
popular rollerball format featuring
super smooth delivery an ultra fast ink
dry a true everyday carry
you
it is incredible
how much we rely on weather forecasts
and so-called local temperatures the
truth is that those values available
online or through apps come from weather
stations that can easily be dozens of
miles away
nothing beats measuring the values by
yourself right where you are but that's
just not possible and silly so we have
created the world's smallest weather
station that can easily fit in your palm
simply plug weather point into your
device and start the app simple as that
it consists of four sensors for
temperature humidity atmospheric
pressure and ultraviolet radiation with
this information you can have the most
accurate weather forecast anywhere you
are also by measuring atmospheric
pressure you can know your altitude more
precisely than GPS devices you can also
measure UV radiation and limit your
exposure to these harmful UV rays the
housing is made from aluminium and
titanium and ensures longer life time
when you're not using weather point it
is safely placed on your keychain so you
don't have to worry about losing it
where the point doesn't use a battery
well who likes them anyway it doesn't
even require internet connection the
building hardware is costly we invested
a lot of resources into making weather
point possible and now we need your
support to make it available and
affordable for everyone thank you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
