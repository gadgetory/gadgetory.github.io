to keep the people we love safe and
that's why we made salt the first safe
gun for a safe home hi I'm Adam this is
Andy we're the creators of salt salt is
a gun but it's not like any gun that
you've ever seen it was designed around
the belief that a firearm shouldn't have
to take a life in order to protect a
life from that simple idea we started by
completely rethinking the bullet instead
of LED salt was designed to shoot a
specialized round filled with a powerful
toxin so instead of killing the target
salt opens up on impact in a cloud that
instantly causes respiratory and visual
distress so while an intruder or a
curious child will be incapacitated the
encounter wouldn't be fatal
this rethink also lets salt be used not
only offensively but defensively as well
so if an intruder is kicking down your
door salt allows you to shoot the area
around it before the danger is on top of
you this creates a protective cloud of
toxin between you and the intruder
before he's ever a threat to you or your
family our last big idea was to make
salt easy to use for everyone so we
replace the violent bang of black powder
with a silent power of compressed air
the result is a fear free user
experience so the only person that
should have anything to be scared of is
an intruder and that's all a safe gun
for a safe home so if your is intrigued
by the ideas as we are we'd love to make
you one just click our support button
and together we can make the world just
a little bit safer we are surrounded by
technology it's entering our homes and
helping us automate daily tasks but I
find myself thinking there has to be a
more natural and accessible way to
control the devices around us if the
goal of automation is to simplify our
lives why does it feel so complicated
our goal as a company is to solve this
say hello to knocky knocky is a small
elegant device that instantly transforms
ordinary surfaces in your environment
into remote controls using naki couldn't
be easier simply take it out of the box
pick a place to put it select a surface
to attach it to and then define all the
things you'd like Maki to do
naki can control a wide variety of
devices around us
but the true beauty of our technology is
that what it can do is only limited by
your imagination
put one in your living room or the
kitchen or even your bedroom
I mean imagine rolling over in the
morning and tapping a simple pattern
anywhere on your nightstand to snooze
your alarm and start the coffeemaker
without even opening your eyes
you just bought ten more minutes in bed
and you'll definitely want to put one in
your kids bedroom it's exciting to think
of how naki will spark their imagination
as they figure out all kinds of ways to
use it using Wi-Fi which is proven to be
far more reliable and would better reach
them Bluetooth you can enjoy using naki
from anywhere the number of devices and
software that naki interact with is
rapidly growing every day it currently
includes nests Phillips you live fax
smart things IFTTT and more but even if
you're new to the smart technology world
you can still use naki for simple
functions around your home
other technologies that rely on sound or
voice control can be unreliable and
confusing to use they can be triggered
accidentally and don't always work in
respectives our patent-pending
technology uses non acoustic sensors
it's able to distinguish deliberate tap
or knock patterns from random vibrations
in the environment the beauty of our
product is that it makes any regular
environment into a user interface think
about the surfaces around you so many of
them serve one or two purposes add an AA
key to them and you instantly have a hub
for automation we carefully chose every
material and finish Funaki we've gone
through a series of different tests and
prototypes to make sure that no key
blends in in your environment and also
looks beautiful on your surfaces we're
doing our first production runs here in
the USA because it's important for our
entire team to be there on the ground
floor ensuring that we're manufacturing
the best possible product we're excited
to bring Nike that Kickstarter it's not
some far-fetched idea we have finalized
our designs we have beautiful working
prototype and we need to raise funds to
actually get it into production and
immediately start shipping them to your
door we couldn't be more excited about
how this product is going to change
lives and bring joy to people everywhere
nike accomplishes what technology is
supposed to do instead of taking over
our life it enhances
allowing you to put more thought and
effort into the things that really
matter
tap into the world around you with the
magic of naki Orica came out of pure
necessity we wanted to travel with a
canoe and use it in a city but we
couldn't find anything right
it had to be something lightweight easy
to carry around that could be stored
everywhere so we decided to build
ourselves
we are proud to introduce ionic the glue
that folds to a suitcase of wheels it's
very easy to use and it bellows as great
as a traditional canoe so we designed a
new extremely tough composite material
that makes the canoe both durable and
syncable
ona can take you anywhere we actually
proved it
we've been on a trip across Europe using
only public transport
of the two years become this far and now
we're very excited to launch this pin
with your help we'll be able to get this
product into production and into your
hands now it's your chance to take part
in this adventure hi I'm Simon free PR
managing director here at Sarah's audio
Cyrus is a specialist British company
making domestic - so see these
amplifiers streamers and Dax the 30
years old and we've been winning awards
for our products over that time Sarah
sound key is a small portable in-line
headphone jack and amplifier so it's
designed to take the digital files from
your laptop or your smartphone and make
them sound much better to deliver a much
better musical experience for the
consumer we wanted to make it light so
it's almost really just part of the
cable but once you plug it in you should
be able to hear a significant difference
in the clothes of the users coming out
we're quite a small team here but we're
very passionate about music and what we
do as a business is we try and deliver
that passion to our customers music is
an emotional experience we listen to
music because it triggers some kind of
emotion in us whether it's something
that makes us want to get up and dance
whether it makes us wanna cry or whether
is just so beautiful that prepares on
the back of our necks stand up it's an
emotionally engaging experience and
everything we do at Stars is designed to
enhance that emotional experience if we
can't design a product that makes our
customers go WOW when they sit down and
listen to it then we go back to the
drawing board and start again a DAC is a
digital-to-analog converter so sound ki
takes the digital files that sit on your
laptop or smartphone but as human beings
our ears are analog so we have to turn
that at some point into an analogue
signal
the target audience is very much
overlaps with the kickstart audience and
therefore if you pledge for this
campaign you'll be giving us a thumbs up
to say that yes we think Cyrus can take
it's 30 years of engineering excellence
and put them into a product of this type
we are looking at raising 50,000 pounds
on Kickstarter which we fund for the
development of the tooling and Lilly
used to climb the highest mountains in
search of the freshest air with wind
she doesn't have to anymore wind is the
world's first personal air quality
system that generates fresh and clean
air that's portable and is simple to use
its built-in sensor monitors the air
quality around Lilly and adjusts its
power to filter more or less wind helps
Lilly keep the air around her clean and
fresh even when she's traveling wind
works by creating a bubble of healthy
air around it
dirty air is drawn in by vents pulled
through a medical-grade air filter and
clean air is propelled out of the top
wind can filter things like allergens
dust pet dander smoke pretty much
anything except that Lilly can adjust
the amount of clean air wind releases by
simply twisting the wind app allows
Lilly to check the quality of the air
around her gain insight about the air
she's filtered and check the air quality
of her friends and family Wynne knows
when Lilly's filter is used up and can
automatically ship a replacement filter
to her home and the air quality tracker
can even detach to keep Lilly aware of
the air she's breathing while she's on
the go
wind blends seamlessly into Lily's life
allowing her to breathe easy no matter
where life takes her
what we breathe matters we all have
experiences or know of loved ones who
have been affected by poor air quality
whether that's from allergens germs
smoke or industrial pollution I founded
win because I've watched for too many
years as my relatives in beijing
suffered from poor air quality the air
problem goes way beyond china and we
want to enable everyone no matter where
they live or where life takes them to
enjoy a healthy air environment wind is
designed not just to clean the air but
also understand the environment so that
can proactively take care of any
problems and to do both wherever the
user goes the past 18 months we've been
working hard with an amazing team of
engineers scientists and designers to
bring wind to life today we're proud to
come to you to get your support so that
we can launch the product spread the
word and grow the community thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
