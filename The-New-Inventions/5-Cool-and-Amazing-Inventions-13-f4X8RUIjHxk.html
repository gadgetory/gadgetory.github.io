the Cannonball is a fully submersible
floating speaker with 360 audio and
rugged durability cannonball is the
perfect speaker for any occasion hi I'm
Judah founder cannonball audio our
vision was to create a speaker that
could be used anywhere the Cannonball is
portable and made to withstand any
environment from boardroom to beach
string music hey calls whether you're on
the go or in your home
the challenge we faced was maintaining
an ideal size speaker that can float and
stabilize inside water without
compromising the sound level sound
quality and bass for that we use the
five watt speaker driver within a large
magnet which is connected to a 6.3 em
chip system the driver transmits out the
signals into an acoustic dissemination
dome that distributes the sound
with an ipx7 certified rating the gun
new sticker is protected from dirt sand
dust splashing water rainfall and can be
submerged off to one meter for 30
minutes this full-on protection means
that you can take it anywhere specially
designed in flip covers the auxiliary
and micro USB ports to allow the
campbell to be submerged and the water
and very high pressure the convo is
designed to float on water but when you
take it out of the water we wanted to
figure out a way keep it stationary so
it doesn't roll around while you're
listening to music flower patent pending
design we have installed the spring
block system that keeps the Campbell in
place simply push into log and push
again to unlock the Cannonball is your
everything speaker with 360 degrees of
audio in its ipx7 rating you can take
your music anywhere
you
