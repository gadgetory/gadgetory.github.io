water yet we've only explored 10% of it
we're about to change that the fathom
one is an easy-to-use underwater drone
that you control with your smartphone or
tablet we designed it to be the most
affordable most versatile underwater
drone ever made and after two full years
of prototyping and development were
finally ready to bring underwater
exploration and education to the masses
I'm John I'm Matt and I'm Danny we're a
team of outdoor enthusiasts scuba divers
engineers and travelers that had an idea
for an underwater drone that we could
take anywhere and use in any environment
I grew up spending summers on Lake
Louise in northern Michigan where a lot
of large logging operations took place
in the 1800s jump forward 200 years and
now every cottage has artifacts and
pieces of history on their walls that
washed up on the beach but there are
still legends of horse-drawn sleds that
fell through the ice and got stuck at
the bottom just waiting to be explored I
thought if I could control an aerial
drone from a mobile app to explore from
above why couldn't I do the same thing
from underwater that's when fathom was
born
underwater remotely operated vehicles or
ROV s have been around for a while but
they're mainly large expensive
industrial devices tethered to big ships
and early consumer RVs inspired by their
Big Brother's cost well over a thousand
dollars with no mobile app for piloting
and you need to be a pretty good hacker
to put them together
we knew we wanted an underwater drone
that anyone could drop into any body of
water and pilot easily using an app on
their smart device and it had to be
small and light enough to carry around
meaning a completely new compact design
it had to come fully assembled out of
the box including an onboard 1080p HD
camera and built in high intensity LED
headlights for clear viewing and it had
to be as affordable as lower-cost flying
drones with comparable equipment so that
every modern-day explorer could have one
we built the fathom one with all of
those features and thanks to custom
components in a streamlined design now
you can have it for under six hundred
dollars that's less than half the price
of the closest competition
above all we made the fathom one super
easy to use but that doesn't mean it's
limited this thing is fully modular our
patent-pending thruster attachment
system allows you to easily remove all
three thrusters for packing but it also
enables customization and upgrades to
specialized thrusters such as these ones
with larger fins for stabilization and
we're hoping our backyard community will
create and share their own ideas for
customization fathom 1 also features an
integrated rail system that makes adding
accessories like action cameras and
additional lights or other sensors a
breeze just slide it on click it in and
you're ready to go we put everything
that we have into making underwater
exploration and education more
accessible to the masses we built the
prototypes validated at our designs and
now ready to go on a full-scale
manufacturing all that's left is for you
the Kickstarter community to show us
that you want an underwater drone that's
affordable portable modular and
completely easy to use right out of the
box fathom is your chance to go deep and
see the world in an entirely new way the
possibilities are truly endless what can
you fathom
you

here's your smartphone and all of its
data some of it is important but a lot
of it is just noise we want to help you

hi my name is Tom Sam and I'm the
international marketing director for
life's worth it company that makes
software and hardware to make your life
more intelligent this is frame frame is
easy camera with motion detection night
vision internal memory and an integrated
battery we envision frame as the core of
your smart home with fast changing smart
home device market we wanted to create
something that you don't have to get rid
of after a year because innovation is
mostly in the software imagine facial
recognition motion detection object
recognition everything integrated into
the software platform after coming up
with the functionality of the camera
itself we knew that we needed to have
the best designers preferably in the
world to design something iconic there's
cameras out there really well known as
like like Dropcam toss that feels like a
security camera if we wanted to separate
the notion of security as kind of the
primary function and really start
talking about people living with this
camera and having it be part of their
lunchtime people's lives are pretty
hectic at the moment you get constant
text messages at a moment that might not
be the most convenient for you to
receive that message with the sticky new

devices let's say you have a smart light
bulb the camera sees motion it turns on
the light it's easy to use it's subtle
it's non intrusive and it fits in any
old ly smart is at the forefront of a
non-invasive smart home technology that
helps you interact in a more natural way
if you support us now you get an amazing
product for an incredible price and you
help us achieve our vision from all of
us at life smarts we thank</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
