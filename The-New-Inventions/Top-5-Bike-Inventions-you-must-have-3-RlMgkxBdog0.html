founder of a design company and we
produced that it will loot wheels our
suspension within the wheel so you can
fit one of our wheels to an existing
bike and you can have full suspension
so I thought the idea in 2007 and did
some sketches but since then the
designers come on and evolved
considerably luke wheels have been
developed for small compact bikes they
allow suspension where suspension can't
normally fit they like to go over bumps
easily they're low maintenance and
they're fun this is our own luke wheels
test facility where we can test our own
wheels in house on our own test machines
we have different machines for different
tests this one it's to testing the
dampening of the wheel we also have some
quite sophisticated machines for testing
the wheels riding over curves this one
we can drop weights from a certain
height make the wheel move out it allows
you to compare our wheels with spoke
wheels it also allows us to test into
destruction here we have our rolling
road where we can load the wheels up
with the force of the rider and then
test them over thousands and thousands
of miles to make sure the wheels last
the lifetime of the bike so as you can
see we've put a lot of effort and
resource into our test house but we
don't have the funds to take this to do
the tooling required to produce this
wheel in volume so we've come up with a
brand new concept and wheel technology
using conventional components our
special Springs and all we need from you
now is the money to tool it up to give
you affordable new wheels
it's rare for established bike companies
to collaborate on a new product together
especially to grow a new category that
is barely recognized by our industry for
this project we turn an extra cycle each
brought our unique strengths together it
was a natural partnership because we
share the same vision removing barriers
to urban mobility
I'm Josh Homme I'm a co-founder and the
team captain at turned lessons what I
love about Josh is that he's a brilliant
pragmatic doer who is deeply passionate
about bicycle quality and design these
days he runs turn an international
company based in Taipei that is devoted
to finding new and innovative ways to
make bikes fit better into our everyday
lives and they have the patents to prove
it
hi I'm Ross Evans inventor and founder
of extra cycle 20 years ago I set out to
make a bike that would change the world
as an idealistic engineering student I
landed in war-torn Nicaragua in a tin
and cinderblock shed i welded together a
bike that would alter the course of my
life and as it turned out the lives of
people worldwide
the city is full of incredible
opportunity and things to explore
designing a bike that can unlock the
hidden treasures of our cities is a
challenging design problem for this
project we at turn an extra cycle each
mod are unique strengths together to
build a special bike the cargo node
it had to have integrated lighting
robust smart and always ready a bike
with a passenger seat meet a friend go
out on a date it's a must quality parts
wide gear range it's good on the hills
and strong brakes stop you fast it even
has a pump hidden in the seat post carry
your laptop laundry kitty litter camping
gear picnic supplies you name it
if only bytes are important because they
allow you to take a product which is
incredibly efficient and it's one of the
best inventions ever the bicycle and
they make it portable whether that is
being able to fold it and bring it on a
bus onto the subway into the trunk of a
car so that it fits into your life in
this liberated landscape there is a new
opportunity if you could amok your city
what would it look like what would your
life look like
here's how you can support the vision
back us on our Kickstarter campaign page
and join us in the magical unfolding
landscape of an ignited life be moved
because life has a way of unfolding
beautifully when you follow your heart
hi I'm Stefan and I have one serious
question for you have you ever seen a
real amount in bike I don't think so
mountain biking is the most advanced
discipline in cycling so with 160
millimeter of suspension at 13 kilos in
weight are setting the bar right now
they define what's known to be the flow
so called a mountain bikes might help on
the climb but honestly you don't want to
ride those 20 kilo brakes on the trail
now let me show you the one only true
amount and bike of today the Edison Evo
Ihram it is both the best ski bike you
can think of and the best traditional
month bike to get here we design our own
engine the ERM weighs less than 1.5
kilograms and it delivers more than
enough power to climb longer unlike all
other amount bikes Ihram does not
interfere with the suspension it keeps
the bike Lively
we would never sacrifice the flow the
power supply is stored in the backpack
keeping the bike agile when you need it
just connect to the magic socket feels a
little bit like Avatar when you don't
need it just unplug it leave the battery
at home you won't even feel Ihram is
still installed in your bike just one
cable no displays reduce to the essence
because that's what mountain biking
should be and if you think it's time for
some purity again just take your em off
and put a standard set of cranks back on
I doubt you've seen this before and one
of the brains behind the rim is Markus
keeping his brains juice you will often
see Marcus munching countless poppy seed
pastries so mark is what makes things so
difficult so it's the size at 20 percent
of the volume and 40 percent of the
weight of a regular motor we have been
fighting over every millimeter for six
years this is now the seventh verse it's
like a chain reaction you change
something here and then you need to
change ten more things over there and
when there's no more space
you need to use your brain so I need
more sweets engineering is one thing but
guts and division to do it that's
another thing
Andy our boss is both and lots of it so
Andy Friday she started Ihram allows the
people to ride more it's the greatest
chance mountain biking ever head girls
can ride with the boys the younger with
the elder the amateurs with the pros the
physically disabled with the perfectly
healthy ones it's very social its
democratization of cycling more people
will go mountain biking so hopefully we
will see more tress and this is what I
want there will be many drive systems
engineer' to the edge perfectly matching
the different categories of bikes in
Europe and the US I guess more than 20
million bicycles are waiting to get
electrified a major chunk of them will
be mountain bikes so engineering driven
brands like us should have a great
future therefore we turn to you to the
crowd to buy more sweets for Marco's and
Psyche to make better and better Bionic
on-ear a mountain bikes we are ready
please support us and we will give you a
mountain bike experience you never had
before
I've always loved cycling and when I did
my first triathlon four years ago I was
immediately hooked
like most people I started out training
and racing using my road bike but after
my first few races I started looking for
ways to go faster I didn't want to spend
a bunch of money on a brand new
triathlon bike so I tried to modify my
road bike to get a faster arrow position
but all the products I tried required me
to completely abandon my normal road
setup I didn't want to have to choose
either a road position or a narrow
position and it turns out my friends
felt the same way as mechanical
engineers we knew there had to be a
better solution not only for triathletes
but for anyone looking for a more
comfortable alternative riding position
so we set out to design a system that
would allow us to ride our road bikes
let's switch back and forth on the fly
between a road position and a narrow
position after a ton of prototyping and
testing were really excited to introduce
the switch Aero system
the system has two main parts a set of
quick release arrow bars that mount to
your handlebar and a dual position seat
post that lets you change your saddle
position on the block the switch arrow
bars are different than any other
clip-on arrow bars they have a unique
quick-release mechanism that allows you
to attach or remove the Aero bars in
seconds without using any tools the Aero
bar is not securely and repeatedly so
you know they're in the exact same
position every time you attach them
they're also incredibly adjustable and
we're offering a choice of three
different extension shapes so everyone
will be able to find their optimal
riding position the dual position seat
post lets you switch your saddle between
a normal Road position and an arrow
position that's similar to the setup of
a tri bike you can move the seat forward
on-the-fly letting you ride more
comfortably and efficiently when using
Aero bars the seat post is also really
adjustable so you can dial in the
perfect fit in both positions the switch
arrow system gives you incredible
versatility with a single bite you get
the speed and efficiency of a triathlon
bike without giving up the climbing
maneuverability and comfort of a road
bike if you're going out for a group
ride or local Road rates you can take
the Aero bars off and ride a pure road
bike but if you're racing or training
for a triathlon put the Aero bars back
on you can hammer the flats in the arrow
position and still spin up the climbs in
the road position
many full-size folding bicycles are
often too expensive or don't fold smart
the quest have been to create a bicycle
that looks and rides like a normal
full-size bicycle yet can be easily
folded down to a tad larger than its
wheels
introducing foobie fixing booby is a
folding single speed or fixed gear bike
having the performance design and price
of a normal full sized bike it folds
easily and without the use of any tools
the folding locking mechanism has a
double action for safety the patented
design offers a stiff and cool frame and
that is designed to have the same riding
features as a normal fix II would the
bike comes with a flip-flop hub and rear
and front brake so you have the option
to use it as a single speed bike or as a
fixed gear bike sometimes you have to
lock your bike outside with foobie
folding locking your bike is safer with
wheels and frame lock together with one
you lock foobie uses only available
standard parts so if you already have
single speed bike you can turn it into a
folding bike just by buying the frame
it fits in the trunk of most cars and
can be taken on public transport where
folding bikes are accepted the bike is
designed on the existing foobie frame
technology that has been tested for many
years this frame design has proven
itself to be both stiff and safe
