awesome dude yourself robotic it with
both easy-to-use software and very rigid
hardware components it was designed to
give you complete creative freedom to
build whatever robotic application you
have in mind so whether you want to
build a solid GoPro camera rig or a
smartphone control vacuum cleaner cage
body is the perfect choice for you the
cage for team consists of professional
German developers based in Berlin and
Taipei we were frustrated with the
solutions on the market so now we want
to create a tool that everyone can use
software tools to start right away are
waiting for you and we will provide
future software development to support
and advance your ideas cage bot will
teach you more about the world of
technology you will easily learn how to
create your own system and soon you will
go beyond your limits we created the
software system with a user in mind who
isn't really an expert in programming
yet still wants to move beyond and a
look parts right into the digital age
therefore cage bot enables you to
incorporate sophisticated components
like ultrasound sensors was just a
couple of clicks and the best part is
you can use a smartphone and tablets
doing it because high multimedia come a
billet II who's one of our priorities
with catchable we use state-of-the-art
technology our construction is super
stable and will support all of the ideas
we use planetary gear motors so you will
never feel a lack of power and our
controller can manage even your most
complicated tasks
the design of the cage bot hardware
follows two main premises a it needs to
be extremely versatile to spark
creativity by freeing you from any
technical constraint and B it needs to
be very rigid to master even demanding
out their tasks we are ready to go after
a three-year development phase we hold a
finished product in our hands we have a
full manufacturing chain in place with
contracts to all the necessary partners
now we need your support to stop
production and make this a reality so
spread the word and help us to improve
the DIY sector with this great product
help us to make cage bud a success so be
part of it because cage bug growth with
your ideas
you
everyone enjoys listening to music on
their mobile device unfortunately it can
be really frustrating to do while being
acted the real problem lies in means for
me headphones were uncomfortable and
earphones would always fall out so I
made these these are decimals they are
easily and quickly molded to the exact
shape of your ears this way they will
never hurt and never fall out decibels
are perfect for any activity they are
comfortable enough to be worn for hours
while traveling and relaxing and secure
enough that they will stay in place
while being active they can even keep up
during extreme activities here's how
they work you heat the molds in a cup of
water in the microwave snap on the
earphones and shape the molds to your
ears the neat thing about our custom
molds is that they stay pliable at
slightly above room temperature for a
few minutes allowing them to be placed
into the ears and molded safely you can
get custom molded earphones made but
unfortunately the process is really
expensive really uncomfortable and
time-consuming so I made decibels it
easy and affordable but we didn't stop
there we knew that we had a great
product that people loved and we wanted
to make it even better we've combined
the knowledge and experience of
launching the first generation with the
customer feedback we've collected over
the past year we are now ready to launch
this next generation of decibels I've
already designed prototyped and tested
this new model it takes everything great
about the first generation of decimals
and goes even further this second
generation features an even better
custom molded earphone system I have
combined our unique molding material
with a specially selected silicone tip
this helps to align the earphone in the
ear canal and create a comfortable noise
isolating seal
the molding material also creates a
second seal for better sound and greater
noise isolation I designed the new
earphones to have a very low profile so
that they can be easily used with hats
and help we've also improved the sound
quality of the earphones we put a lot of
time in research into sound engineering
with the new design to offer powerful
bass and a crisp full sound the new
earphones will also have a flat tangle
free cable and a universal inline remote
with microphone for use with your
smartphone our final designs for the
second generation are in place and we
are ready for manufacturing all that is
missing is your support I set our
fundraising goal at forty thousand
dollars which will be used to pay for
the tools needed to manufacture the new
earphones and mold designs you can help
us bring the new generation of decibels
custom molded earphones to market and
score an awesome pair for yourself check
out the different levels of support you
can give to help us achieve our
fundraising goal and remember please
share this Kickstarter campaign with
everyone you know it would really help
us out thanks
you
hi I'm Ryan and Valerie thanks for
checking out subin's we all of our shoes
but don't the laces present some
challenges there's the time the
squeezing the floppy bows becoming
undone
the double naughty
and the untying to get them off
well with your support we think Zubaz
can help Zhu bits are small yet powerful
magnetic fits that you attach to your
own shoelaces making your shoes very
easy to put on so how do you really want
to put your shoes on would it be great
if there were no laces at all I mean
nothing to get in the way well this is
what zoo boots are like when separated
lubitz eliminate three rows of laces so
there is a huge mouth opening to easily
slide in
then just connect the magnets
and that's it
now go for a run
go to the playground
go to the gym
you
play some basketball
lubitz hold securely for most
recreational activities suivez the two
bits are not just for athletic sneakers
they're for your everyday casual shoes
with sue bits you have a clean looking
shoe no ugly bows and they'll never come
undone now how do you really want to
take your shoes off let's face it most
of us do what we are not supposed to do
we step on our heel and squeeze out of
our shoes this wears down the yield and
leaves you with a knot to untie later
but with zube it's stepping out of your
shoes becomes the right way to do it the
magnets will split as you step out and
now your shoe is open and ready for the
next time you want to slip in zubat SAR
not ordinary magnets they've been
specially engineered to concentrate the
magnetic forces toward the face of the
magnets this gives them incredible
holding forces in a small size this also
means there's almost no magnetism on the
outside of the zoo bits where you don't
want
the zoo bits you can wear shoes tight
outdoors then wear them loose at home
were around the office
lubitz are easy to install just thread
your laces through the zoo bits insert
your foot and adjust the tightness to
your comfort level then not or clip the
shoelace ends inside your shoe we will
provide some clips to help you secure
your license when you're ready cut your
laces off leave a little extra and you
can adjust the fit any time
so the idea for Zubat was actually born
out of the desire to help our own kids
get their shoes on here but along the
way we discovered everybody likes using
kids adults even the elderly we've
developed fully working prototypes we've
taken it this far but we really need
your support to make zubat Appa we need
the funds to pay for manufacturing and
production boss so please back our
project by choosing a pledge amount
basically you're just buying some Zubaz
I would help us a lot let's make soup
its app thanks

meet birdy birdy is an aerodynamically
shaped case for popular action camps
like the GoPro you simply insert your
device and toss birdy into the air we
wanted to create something that would
allow photographers to explore new point
of view in an affordable and simple way
using birdy feels like a game of catch
we'll sprinkle of engineering and the
concepts behind shutterstock of
badminton ball we have achieved what we
expected
once Barry reaches maximum altitude it
will settle start a fall with a camera
facing downwards
the resulting photos are candid
capturing authentic in the moment
expressions
