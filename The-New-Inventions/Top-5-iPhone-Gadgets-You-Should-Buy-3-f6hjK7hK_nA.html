imagine total control over your iPhone's
camera like never before with no less
than five external buttons just like a
real DSLR imagine a more comfortable and
safer grip for taking pictures
one-handed even with gloves imagine
connecting it to real camera accessories
unleash the power of your iPhone's
camera for better pictures
time after time picked our DSLR your
iPhone so let's take a closer look at
some of picked ours more exciting
features the first and most important is
letting the iPhones camera live up to
its full potential
Victor offers no less than five external
buttons for controlling the iPhones
camera the multi-state electronic
shutter button is calibrated for maximum
sensitivity just like high-end cameras
a half press on the shutter button locks
the focus and exposure to allow tracking
of a moving object or to compose the
perfect shot pressing all the way will
result in an immediate shot want to take
control to the next level just press on
the center of the screen and live the
circle anywhere you want to measure
lighting at the front of the grip is the
zoom ring turn it to zoom into the
subject or out pressing this ring will
let you toggle between the front and
back camera for the coolest selfies ever
and what's the most cool about picked R
is that it lets you take pictures with
one hand leaving your other hand for
other important things now let's move up
to the exposure compensation wheel which
gives complete control over the exposure
simply by turning it right or left
increments R by f-stop values just like
in any DSLR this button can truly open
up a whole new world of playing with
light the last button is the smart wheel
same as all other controls it's also
fully programmable with the picked our
app that comes with the device you
decide which parameters you want to
control in default mode the smart wheel
controls the photo modes such as sport
portrait snow and more but this can
easily be changed to manual mode and
many other options
viktor app is the turbo engine driving
Viktor forward develop it we teamed up
with a great app company which gave it a
maximum ease of use the app is operated
by a patented ultrasonic frequency
system which offers low power
consumption of both picked art and the
iPhone compared to standard Bluetooth
connection picked our design is inspired
by classic DSLR cameras when you hold it
you'll feel right at home thanks to the
ergonomic body coated with non-slip
material Viktor is designed for a steady
one-handed grip without compromising on
the compact feel of taking pictures with
a smartphone and it even works with
gloves Viktor comes with a comfy
wristband to keep it secured and also
have had in case to keep it safe in your
bag a standard 1/4 inch connector on the
bottom lets you connect any tripod for
extra creative shots and a cold shoe
connector on top is useful for many
lighting devices
picked our is compatible with iPhone
models from 4 to 6 s and is designed to
suit future models - when it's time to
upgrade it also makes sharing a single
picked R to be super easy and fun oh
yeah and there's us team Nico and this
is our third time we're on Kickstarter
after we brought to market thanks to you
more than 10 products that make
photography a lot more fun and simple to
develop picked R we put together a
winning team that includes product
designers app developers and techies who
works together for a year to make this
dream come true dear backers returning
to you again and asking for your support
to bring picked R to market join us
picked on DSLR your iPhone
our unique worlds are filled with
instances of wonder and delight what an
incredible feeling it is when you take
that perfect picture and share it with
the world we want to bring that feeling
to more people so we created blue lenses
the technology phone cameras is
advancing rapidly but the one thing that
mobile photography still lacks and no
app can achieve is the added capability
of lenses there are a variety of lens
attachments on the market most will
produce images that are obviously
degraded with varying degrees of
blurring fringing and distortion to
create a truly great lens with superior
image quality we need to think outside
of the box for the last couple of years
our passionate team of experienced
engineers has been researching and
advancing lens technology and we made a
breakthrough
we found that the best design for mobile
photography is one that you won't find
in any other camera it's called a
free-form lens and it's unique because
it's rotationally asymmetrical this
allows you lenses to optimize visual
information within the boundary of the
phone sensor the result is an incredibly
clear image from border to border a
crisper sunrise a clearer smile in
landscape a vibrant detail we are ready
to begin production of our first set of
lenses our 2.5 x telephoto will bring
them out of range into reach and our 15
millimeter wide angle will tell the
bigger story of your journey our case
attachment system allows you to use and
switch lenses quickly and securely if
you believe in the future of mobile
photography if you believe in the
feeling of that perfect picture we ask
for your support help us bring us high
quality lenses to market we have
finished our final prototype and now all
we need are the funds to mass-produce it
so bacchus hero Kickstarter share us
with your friends and digital
communities we can't wait to make us a
moola
could I get a medium latte please
hi I'm Sarah like many others around the
world we love using styluses they're
perfect for using on those tiny iPhone
keyboards so that autocorrect doesn't
right I hate you instead of I love you
realize that though everyone loved using
a stylus no one brought one with them I
mean let's be honest pocket and first
real estate is precious no one wants to
stick something big in their pocket so
for the past year we've been solving
that problem trying to find the balance
of ergonomics and practicality being
comfortable in your hand but
unnoticeable in your pocket the stylus
flex is the first stylist ever to have
its entire body be able to be user in
touch screen you can use it while you're
checking out because the person in front
of you sneezed on their hands or use it
as a stand while you're sitting at the
coffee shop watching funny cat videos
with your friends
use it as a selfie spam get creative
with it not only a mobile stylist but so
much more
so now's the time we need your help to
hit the minimum order quantity and
produce the first order of stylus flex
our manufacturers and our materials are
ready to go so please help us now make
stylus flex reality</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
