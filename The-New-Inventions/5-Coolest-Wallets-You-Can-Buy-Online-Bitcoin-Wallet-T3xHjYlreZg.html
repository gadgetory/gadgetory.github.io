hi I'm Chad Rick I've been investing in
cryptocurrency for the last five years
the recent Bitcoin exchange hacks
reminds me it's no longer safe to store
my bitcoins in other people's platforms
so I started to try using Bitcoin
wallets to secure my digital assets
I have tried both hot and cool wallets
on the market and this is what I found
most of the cryptocurrency wallets were
designed way back when digital currency
was invented which means they are either
out-of-date user unfriendly or lacked
basic functionality many do not even
support iOS and most importantly they
are not as secure as they claim so
that's why I invented who field the
world's most secure cryptocurrency
hardware lock gufu includes a waterproof
cryptocurrency smart hardware wallet
that secures your private keys and a
mother box that charges your wallet
wirelessly while storing your signature
in case your hardware wallet gets lost
or stolen as cryptocurrency owners know
your private keys are unique and must be
secured at all times for that theft of
your currency no matter how unprotected
your computer or internet connection is
as long as your private key is safe your
digital assets are safe existing wallets
can't totally isolate the signing step
from the Bitcoin network even USB
connection hardware wallets can be
hacked if your computer is connected to
the internet during the transaction pupu
on the other hand signs your transaction
completely offline to achieve that hoop
who sends the encrypted transaction data
via bluetooth 4.0 which makes the
transaction virtually compact for the
entire citing process only takes about
two seconds each wallet remembers the
unique Bluetooth MAC address that only
belongs to your cell phone and you first
created your wallet with hufo so your
wallet can never be paired with any
other phones most wallets are still
using the old generation chips which has
been hacked many times
phoo phoo uses a unique highly encrypted
security X chip to provide another level
of security to protect your trans
ditch the complicated password wallets
fufu lets you access your wallet using
your highly secure yet simple and fast
fingerprint and face recognition
meanwhile the two factor authentication
ensures only you and use the access and
in wallet app now let me show you how to
fool works
step 1 turn on your Bluetooth setting
pair your phone with your wallet step 2
login with your fingerprint step 3 put
in the address of the person receiving
your coins and the amount you would like
to send then press send step 4 now the
wallet signs a transaction in an
isolated environment and then send the
transaction data back to blockchain step
5
after the transaction being approved by
blockchain Bupa will tell you your
transaction has successfully gone
through as soon as the transaction
completes the Wallops Bluetooth
connection automatically terminates to
keep everything safe and the best thing
is your private keys are never held or
known by Hulu or any other third party
fufu is transparent backdoor free and
very easy to use it is a digital
currency wallet that supports multi
currency multiple crypto currencies
Bitcoin ethereum and litecoin with
who-who's real-time crypto currency
price monitor you can invest more wisely
pupu keeps your private key in the
hardware wallet and never exposes it the
mother box lets you recover your backup
private key even if your wallet is lost
or stolen the multiple levels of
security make it impossible for someone
to steal your digital currency now you
don't need to worry about your digital
currency disappeared with Hoopoe your
digital assets are totally safe
hukum the world's most secure wallet for
crypto currencies</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
