you have captured never let a memorable
moment pass in our quest to brew the
perfect cup we found even the best
grinders have trouble producing a
consistent grind leaving you with an
uneven extraction and tarnished flavour
that's why we created the Ruffino a
product that can make any coffee taste
better the Ruffino refines your grind
with micron level precision removing
particles that are both too big and too
small this results in a consistent grind
and the best coffee you've ever tasted
we experimented with a variety of
products but none could deliver a truly
even grind size especially at coarser
grind setting each brew method and
recipe requires a particular grind size
to deliver the best taste so when you
need a particular grind size you need
that size nothing bigger and more
importantly nothing smaller for example
you may want particles within a range of
400 to 800 microns particles that are
smaller than 400 microns known as fines
will get over extracted and tarnish the
flavor making the coffee taste bitter
even the best grinders on the market
simply cannot avoid four new singles
unwanted climb with the Ruffino you get
the optimal grind size every time no
matter what grinder you use our
patent-pending refining system uses
unique tears and separate the coffee
grime you desired grime side simply pour
your grinds into the rafino shake it
side to side and now you have a perfect
crime instead of just filtering out the
large particles the rafino goes one step
further and isolates your desired
particle size by removing the grounds
that are both too big and too small take
a look at this coffee grind from the
same grinder this one is we're fine and
this one is not notice how much variance
there is in crying softly so how does
this affect the flavor of your coffee
this coffee was made with her a fine
grind and his full-bodied and rich and
flavor this one was made without using
the rafino you can see the fines in the
coffee have all were extracted leaving
the coffee visibly darker and tasting
burnt the Ruffino works great with cold
brew drip pour over press stovetop
coffee or espresso we spent the last
eight months developing a beautiful
functional and economic product will not
only feel great in your hand but look
beautiful in your home to the Ruffino is
made from only the best materials to
ensure accuracy
each Rufino has precision
interchangeable sips made using a
high-tech photo-etching technology we've
been using the prototypes every day and
can't imagine going back to an unrefined
cup of coffee many have tried to perfect
the grinder we perfected the grind
