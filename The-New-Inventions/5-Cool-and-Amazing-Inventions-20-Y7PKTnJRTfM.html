what you're thinking you hear the music
see these amazing places on earth and
you think we're going to talk about
another big idea that might or might not
happen to save the planet well no we are
here to share with you something
practical that we have actually built to
bring what people say for years as a
future to right now food waste and
declining energy sources are major
environmental hazards biogas is the
solution it's a natural process in which
organic waste is converted into cooking
gas so five years ago we went on a
mission to bring biogas to every home we
group the best engineers scientists
designers and product people together
and now it's here home biogas home
biogas is the first family sized user
friendly affordable biogas system it is
the change and you can put it in your
backyard
home biogas comes in an easy to assemble
kit and its uses as simple as can be
just throw in your organic waste and
there you go a hot stove ready for
cooking a cycle of in-house energy and
it runs with no electricity your
leftovers provide you two to three hours
of energy a day any kitchen leftovers
including meat and dairy work even your
pets liver just toss it all inside home
biogas and the bacteria in the digester
will decompose the organic material and
release biogas
as a byproduct of the digestion home
biogas even generates an incredible
plant fertilizer it's the kind you pay a
large sum for in garden stores in this
manner home biogas creates an eco cycle
waste turns into gas and fertilizer
fertilizers used to grow food and gas to
cook it leftovers are more waste we are
way past the prototype things we've
already installed more than 150 units
that have been running for over a year
until now we've worked with
international organizations in
underserved communities now we're
bringing it to you you are in charge of
creating your own clean renewable energy
energy that you can trust we need your
help to make home biogas and accessible
household item and so if you want to
bring the change get home biogas let's
create a better future for our next
generation
you
as pets are such a big part of our lives
they're great companions when we're
hanging out and they always make us
laugh they really are part of the family
unfortunately we can't spend all day
with them you have to go up to work
travel run errands leavin them home
alone life just gets in the way our pets
get sad when we're not around yeah
lonely or bored or destructive despite
all the new technology to help us be
happier and healthier and more connected
than ever our furry friends seem to have
been skipped over what if we can
interact with them even when we're not
there it's this vision for a better
world for owners and pets and inspired
us play date lets you play with your dog
or cat from anywhere in the world via
our smart bowl and our mobile app
control the ball from your phone and use
the camera inside the ball to see your
pet as well as the environment around
them we've got some really incredible
engineering stuff with this product to
get a high-definition wide-angle camera
right inside the ball so you can see
wherever your pet is going we've also
added all the features like the ability
to talk to your pets hear what they have
to say and of course you had to have a
sweet girl our story started years ago
when I adopted a dog from a local
no-kill shelter I wanted to make sure he
was getting proper exercise lots of
socialization and sniffing a variety of
things so I built an activity tracker
and slapped it on him on our walks
around the city but looking at a sad
face every time I left for work I
realized he didn't need more tracking he
needed more time with his best friend I
can't be with him all the time the
playdate is the next best thing lady
isn't just another dog toy it's a great
new way for pet owners to stay connected
with a furry
we're excited to play date to the world
but we need your help if you believe as
we do that there's got to be a better
way to stay in touch with your pets when
you're not around then back this
projects and share it with your favorite
animal lovers as well thanks thanks
everyone hi I'm John and I invented my
phone the grab-and-go booster seat this
is a regular car booster seat and this
is my fold my fold is the most advanced
compact and portable booster seat in the
world it's more than 10 times smaller
than a regular booster and it's just as
safe how's that possible well a regular
booster seat lifts a child to be in the
position of an adult my fold does the
exact opposite instead of lifting the
child up it holds the seat belt down
it's that simple my fold is engineered
to protect children from the age of 4
all the way up to 12 the patented design
takes the seat belt off the stomach and
the neck making it comfortable safe and
easy to use car loads of kids and
parents already tried and they love it
when it comes to car seats for children
safety is the number one priority it's
crucial for us to meet the highest
regulatory standards and we've crash
tested prototypes successfully in
testing facilities all around the world
now people often ask me John where did
the idea come from to let me tell you
some stories about when my four kids
were little guys come on when you were
little thank you carpooling was a big
part of our lives we always had boosters
for our own kids but not for the extras
that came along my cold is so small that
kids can keep one with them
all the time when my parents visiting we
always had to juggle bulky booster seats
from car to car my fold is so compact
you can store one almost anywhere and my
fold is narrow so you can easily put
three in a row even in the smallest cars
do you live in a big city how often do
you jump in a taxi they never have a
booster seat and that's not safe and hey
by the way that is not a taxi thank you
last time you rented a car you probably
paid an additional forty dollars to rent
the booster that's more than my fault
costs and ours isn't covered in another
kids dinner or worse my soul's easy to
keep clean you can even put it in the
dishwasher so I thought if I could make
a booster that's mighty small and mighty
strong when you could take with you
everywhere then children could always be
saved no matter whose car though it
using super tough plastic polymers an
aircraft grade aluminium top designers
engineers and industry experts together
we've created my fold the most advanced
compact and portable safety seats ever
invented and we can't wait to start
getting my fold into the hands and the
bags of children all over the world
pre-order your my fold now at my phone
com soon we'll all be ready to grab and
go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
