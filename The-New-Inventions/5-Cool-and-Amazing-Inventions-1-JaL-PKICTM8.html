my name is Noah Noah I'm co-founder of
fly I'm really passionate about new
technologies and I naturally fell in
love with drones when I first met them a
few years ago I'm convinced that in the
future we'll have flying robots around
us helping us in our daily lives but
before that we must overcome a few
challenges in particular with respect to
safety and usability so what we did at
fly is to go back to the drawing board
and invent the flying robot of the
future it had to be safe robust and with
a great user experience we've been
hanging around in my attic for about a
year building prototypes out of balsa
wood and DIY electronics and after many
many trials fly eventually stayed in the
air and prove to us that it was all
possible so based on this we managed to
convince the AL West with a famous
Belgian entrepreneur also a talented
drone pilot he became really
enthusiastic about the project and
decided to invest consider California
for flight yet to fit complete pasando
beautiful shoes cekam this and the
windshield Spielberg keep on really
didn't wanna fly oh man even compare
pourquoi jvc de la vez de la soupe au
what makes fine design through
innovative it's made of a single shaded
popular and for control vin for
stability it has the same size and
weight of a soccer ball its back with
sensor a powerful on-board computer the
HD camera and a Wi-Fi connection we want
to try to be smart and autonomous so you
don't have to be always piloting it you
can select a simple mission to the
mobile app and just enjoy the live
streaming fly is a lot of fun to play
and interact with but it's more than a
time it's really a platform on which you
invent the future of flying robots have
to api's and an SDK which enable
developers to create applications for
controlling fly remotely of another
on-board computer it runs linux and
supports the popular computer vision
library opencv you can make right
autonomously dtec and we have two
entities like talking someone else in
the world we carry backpacks every day
those with smart organizations easy
access and sleek design there are tons
of them already but over the last 2,000
years there are some problems that have

I like my coffee black and strong I love
the outdoors and it's fresh clean air
and this is why I created the forever
flock the only fully metal back in class
ever I've looked everywhere for a simple
solid metal flask and I couldn't find
one so I decided to make one though you
just hate it when tea taste of coffee
and coffee tastes of tea or worse still
you get a horrible place dictates the
forever class puts an end to this
horrible experience the forever flask is
durable is built to last hence the name
they came up with its three-in-one
design that is made entirely out of 316
surgical steel without any plastic that
keeps the taste really clean and never
resists access corrosion the design also
contains a large upper month which holds
half a liter of liquid and turns into
either a thermal mug with the help of
the bottom lip or into a food container
it is the healthiest way to carry your
food or drink please help us fund this
project and make forever flask a reality
I've done all the research lots of
prototyping we have talked to over 30
factories in China and found the one
this comfortable making this complicated
product the biggest expense is actually
setting up the factory doing all of the
tooling the production process this is
where we need your help if you want a
flask that will give you the pure taste
and will never break make a pledge and
contribute to the campaign so if you
believe in this idea and you're going to
play
it's going to stop there share it posted
tell your friends about forever flask is
the only floss you really will ever need
tracks pack is the world's first luggage

go up and down stairs whether it be an
escalator in the airport they click
working or let's say you live in a
two-story home with restored home and

bedroom downstairs to the door so you
