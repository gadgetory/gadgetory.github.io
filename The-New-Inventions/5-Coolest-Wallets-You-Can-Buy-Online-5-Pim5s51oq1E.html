introducing the vank slim wallet
the first wallet we ever made to
simplify your wallet experience each
piece is handcrafted by the most
experienced artisan in the industry we
use the best materials possible and
source them from different countries
every single piece is made with a
highest grade of full grain leather
sourced from the Netherlands all lining
stitches and seatbelt grade elastics
were sourced from Japan combining the
best materials and our unique designs we
made this wallet possible the 3d design
was inspired by traditional leather
craftsmanship but integrates modern
functionalities minimalist wallets are
great the reduced fall can add style
however if there's one thing we hear
more often than anything else in the
slim wallet world it is where do my
coins go all minimal wallets ditch the
coin compartment in fact most regular
wallets do not have a coin compartment
we asked 50 randomly selected customers
where they keep their coins 90% of them
carry coins every day but just toss them
into their pockets we knew we needed to
change this after gathering this
feedback from our customers we spent a
few months designing the first slim coin
wallet we maximize the inner space
capacity but made the slimmest wallet
possible the wallet can easily fit up to
eight cards some change in cash all the
essentials you need yet it looks much
smaller than the regular wallets our
signature slide closure is our own
invention you just need one card to
close the coin compartment
our slim wallet comes in three colors
matte black dark gray and tanned yellow
leather
with a limited edition of 1,000 pieces
per color we will not over produce like
all of our products we offer 10 years of
warranty on the wallet and 40% off the
retail price for backers
didn't slip it's the most minimalist
wallet f-forget traditional minimalist
wallets it eliminates the wallet
altogether replacing it with a hidden
pocket on your phone or tablet
adding a secure method to store your
items to your devices just seemed like
the natural fit the materials were
chosen with comfort and security in mind
and each have their own special quality
to store what you need where and when
you need it
hidden slip get one to find out what
true minimalism feels like thanks very
much for watching yeah thank you
think about all the wallets that you've
owned throughout your life probably a
bunch of different designs and sizes and
styles well we spent the last couple
years designing an entirely new wallet a
wallet unlike any other introducing the
world's very first memory-foam wallet
when sat on the wallet compresses
through about half of its original
thickness making it the most comfortable
and softest wallet on the market during
our research and development of the
wallet we're able to test over 25
different types of memory foam some were
too hard some were too thick some were
too soft but eventually we're able to
find a perfect phone for a while so back
to my original question about all the
wallet seabone how uncomfortable relate
to sit on sure there's wallets out there
on the market that have plenty of room
to put all your cards but that comes at
a cost and cost of bulkiness and they're
just a pain to sit on
there's also minimalist wallets now
minimalist wads may not be uncomfortable
if there's just not enough room to put
all your necessary things our wallet
combines the best of both comfort and
functionality we've spent a lot of time
designing every detail to make sure that
you the customer love it now we need
your help your help to support this
campaign to make this wallet a reality
