light was textile I want to create a
wearable and good-lookin lamp why
shouldn't it be possible for everybody
to enlighten their clothing to be seen
at night we researched developed and
modified electroluminescence technology
for two and a half years we came up with
a completely washable boy proof hi
flexible and modern light technology we
call our lamp Luna flex my name is
Bridget we wanted to create a product
that combines the active ambient light
with a fashionable textile in a smart
way so we designed hoodies and jackets
where the light is completely integrated
and yet remains totally flexible we have
tested our product and technology in
detail so nothing can come back and bite
us
electroluminescence is the mother of LED
it is shining evenly it has a/c on at 60
degree blow the light looks much like
the moon light is visible in the dark
but not distracting luminate advertising
we have designed a battery pack such
durable lightweight and perfectly
fitting in your hand with a soft show
grip enlightenment with low native is
simple load a battery pack with two
rechargeable AAA batteries plug the
battery pack on the golden jet clock
inside a jacket or hoodie press the
button on the battery pick shine on
the giant unicrone laugh is a magical
lamp that enhances the ambience in your
living space a great companion for any
late-night browsing on the web no more
reading in the dark the giant unicom lab
can easily add an elegant and
sophisticated atmosphere to any living
space
it is also a multi color changing LED
lamp featuring wireless remote control
that can change colors with just the
push of a button but wait there is more
these gun mode unicon modes include
strobe mode flash mode fade load smooth
mode and a 16 color solid mode the giant
unicorn man creates an extraordinary
light ambience it helps to improve the
state of your current mood measure the
heat resistant polyethylene body a
portable version is also available for
your next camping trip we invite you to
this magical journey with us thank you
for your support
the swimming pool is the perfect escape
from the summer heat it is a fun and
relaxing place for family and friends
but maintaining a pool is not easy
balancing the water in particular can be
a huge chore it usually involves getting
wet and trying to understand obscure
numbers and color scales and then using
this information to treat your pool can
sometimes be a bit challenge
but it doesn't need to be this way
keeping your pool clean can begin with
one simple drug
drop continuously monitors your water
quality and provides feedback on what
products are necessary to keep your pool
clean and safe with the drop app you can
now monitor your pool wherever you are
it gives you access to all your pools
vital information such as temperature pH
and chlorine levels drop also provides
you with a custom maintenance plan
specific to your pools type size and
needs so that you know exactly what
products to use and how to use them
drops accelerometer also detects water
movement and alerts you of any
unexpected activity in your pool so
whether it's dad falling in while typing
an email or the pesky skinny-dippers
from down the street drunk will let you
know drop helps you keep a pool that is
clean and safe for your family and
friends no more red eyes no more dry or
itchy skin and most importantly no more
worries
this is the light pulse cable what makes
our products stand out is our patented
visible current technology in our
charging and data cables you're watching
real time the electric current powering
up your device as your device charges to
its full capacity the current will slow
down and the light will shut off when
your battery reaches a hundred percent
the idea for the light pulse cable was
born when we discovered a new technology
that allows you to visually see the rate
at which your device charges our team at
pilot electronics ran with the idea and
we went from merely a concept to
developing a final product in a matter
of months our initial line of products
was well received by our consumers but
as we're always looking to improve we
asked her community for feedback from
this experience one of our common
feedbacks was to create a longer cable
and one that works with your gaming
consoles whether you're playing on your
ps4 or Xbox on your phone charging by
your bedside on your mobile device in
the car then you electroluminescent
cable allows for more can be use
the light pulse cables are almost ready
to be in your hands we just need one
final push from the Kickstarter
community to keep manufacturing costs
down and in turn offer these to you at a
great price we're very excited about
this product and hope you guys can help
us make it a reality thank you for
watching
the nature by its wildlife can get a
Wildlife camera anyone can build to take
stealthy high-definition images of
wildlife beginner expert wildlife
enthusiast or hacker the Raspberry Pi
parrot kit is a fun way to develop the
digital making skills for an exciting
new insight into the natural world
nature parts of the community of
conservationists educators digital
makers and designers and we want to show
people how they can use technology in
new and exciting ways to connect with
nature so over the last few years we've
been developing the wildlife came here
to do just that learning skills and
computer encoding 3d design and printing
are rapidly increasing in importance but
fun purposeful activities to deliver
these are unfortunately lacking at the
same time people are becoming more
disconnected from nature in the UK only
one in five children are showing to have
a connection nature fights is taking a
new approach we're taking learning
beyond the classroom we're combining
cool new technology with the excitement
of wildlife inside the nature bites cam
kit will find a brass we've hired
computer-based the whole kit around this
this slots into the middle of the kit
and then we catch an array of sensors so
we have a camera PIR sensor mr. text a
wildlife when it walked past and we've
included a lithium polymer battery this
means you can charge it like a mobile
phone and have it on your kitchen table
try to lock in place in your garden take
the photos you need and when you go back
into your house you can plug it into
your TV you can look at the photos
you've taken then load them to the
nature bytes website that's a really
exciting Park that's our community
photos you upload to nature by its
website and then shared with
conservation organizations space
clasicos challenges such as how many
hedgehogs are in your garden of bird
species declining or increasing and
that's why it's so exciting user
community you can actually help answer
those questions
in order to design a trap we use the
latest product development tools and
techniques to make our ideas of reality
using 3d CAD software to create and
visualize the actual designs within 3d
printed working prototypes and tested
our concepts in different environments
final housings being designed from a
really strong plastic the clip and hinge
design also makes the internal
electronics pretty easily accessible a
lot of time and effort has also gone
into making sure that the case is
weatherproof the case has also been
designs that can be used in all
situations whether it's free standing on
a bird table or even strapped to a tree
if you're in Sonora is like out in the
forest or another added addition is that
you can hang it on our specially
designed bird feeder attachment in
actuality but now we need your support
to help fund the camera case toiling
with the wildlife cam kit everyone can
enjoy digital making and reconnected
while
