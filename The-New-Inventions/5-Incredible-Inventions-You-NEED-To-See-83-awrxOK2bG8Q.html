hi I'm Jason I've been inventing for a
long time now I started my comedy new
mentis as a way to get my inventions for
public you may have heard some of my
inventions like the solowheel and
hovertrax
a lot of news was generated around the
products called hoverboards but most of
the all of the products you have seen a
knockoff of mohabbat racks which was
funded in Kickstarter 2013
my team and I started to develop the
idea of iota because the feedback from
the solowheel and hovertrax users I
really enjoyed seeing people using and
loving my emotions I hope you liked this
run - hello this is what and this is
Darrell and this is Linus Linus is a
little drawing machine we hope you're
gonna love dinosaurs like you it copies
your motion with a real pen on paper
it's a fun little robot that makes
simple wobbly line drawings it comes
with an app that lets you save share and
draw them again and again and again
Linus only needs to be connected to a
USB patch for your cable and it's ready
to go it's magnetic and comes with a
metal plate so you can use it in your
sketchbook look it on the wall or even
hang it on your fridge linus also talks
Wi-Fi and this is where things become
truly magical

Android and tablets and we're
integrating simple tools so everyone can
have fun with it load of friends drawing
and play it backwards to see how it was
drawn and edit arrays and add to it take
a picture and trace over it
- work straight out of the box but only
you can really bring it to life our aim
is to build a community of users that
will develop new and exciting creative
ways to use it you want to develop it
together with you and can't wait to see
what you will do
attach a brush to it
go on windows or postcards if you like
to play code or make things you'll be
able to hook them up to Linus you could
connect it to a few pi or scratch get
several machines to work together go big
for the pantograph or playing groups
guessing that someone's drawing it's not
