performance as you cyclop with
supporting force without fear
hassle-free pikey this is one of our
first prototypes we had to do a lot of
innovations to come to this product
exactly and what's really good on this
pattern we can equip with different
magnet sizes so what you see here is our
standard panel this gives you a pulling
force of about 15 kilograms
click on solidly and you pull up
straight but as soon as you start to
shift your foot a little bit even in
case of critical situation you will get
up very easily in fact you will almost
not feel the magnet on the show we have
a metallic plate it fits on every SPD
comfortable shoe one of the big
advantages of this setup is that it is
totally insensitive to dirt
you will not stretch and floors because
this is all inside the sole without any
elevations it's a much lighter pedal and
we have a strong neodymium magnet which
is the strongest magnet that is
available in the market we have a summer
damper unit on it which gives us the
ability to adjust the magnet height to
fit the shoe and also to give you that
solid feel when you connect onto your
shoe and when you write

with QBO you don't realize it but your
backpack is straining your shoulders and
back and your neck and hips to a strain
is a stretching or tearing of your
muscles or tendons doing this day in and
day out causes serious damage so it's no
wonder that four out of five people will
suffer back pain and 45% of today's
office workers have neck pain pain that
totally disrupt our lives but it doesn't
have to be this way we've spent the last
year designing the perfect minimalist
and surprisingly effective solution so
today we introduce super straps the
world's first and only backpack booster
that instantly relieves shoulder and
back tension and lifts 27 pounds of
force off your neck super straps will
act as your super muscle literally
making your backpack feel lighter it
improves your posture when you walk and
instantly makes your everyday backpack
ergonomic we've tested super straps all
year long check out what folks had to
say Wow
what yeah it feels way more comfortable
it feels like I can actually like walk
around with this without any strain or
like I can run too if I wanted feels
lighter I don't feel as much wearing
care on my shoulders it feels a lot more
comfortable actually I can't really feel
like my back bucks on my back anymore
definitely feels lighter and more
balanced if that makes sense I feel like
it's like it's almost like doing my
posture for me don't feel slouchy I feel
a little more free in my back and my
neck and my shoulders as well there's
less strain it's great it's the magic
trick definitely made a difference when
you put it on so how does it work
super straps is minimal so when you're
not using it it's sleek behind your
backpack straps it activates in one
second flat and the arc distributes the
force of your backpack on up to five
times the surface area so you feel
instant relief in your back and
shoulders most of us use our necks to
counterbalance the weight in our bags
but even a 15 degree head tilt is like
walking around with a bowling ball on
your neck every single day
super straps fixes this our pulley
system joists the weight in your bag
moving it closer to your spine where you
can carry it ergonomically so you don't
need a slump and hurt your body every
step you take many of us carry two three
even four times the weight doctors
recommend in our packs each day if your
backpack ever feels heavy throwing on a
pair of super straps will give you
instant relief and long-term comfort
I've worn super straps every day for the
past five months and it's a total
GameChanger
so whether you're racing to a meeting
glass or the outdoors imagine feeling
pain free and light walking upright and
confidently able to truly enjoy the
moment
we carry gear that we trust because we
think adventure should be enjoyed until
the very last bite meals are an
essential part of being in the outdoors
and to us the sports on the market never
quite measured so we decided to create
one that does
introducing morsel a versatile utensil
for cooking eating and clearing a tool
designed to rethink the way we eat on
the go morsel has a unique rubber edge
that allows you to easily scrape every
last bit of food the ergonomic
asymmetrical shape its plates pots bags
and bowls all safety senses the extended
length is perfect for digging deep
without getting your hands dirty more so
also features a full sized fork and a
safe cutting edge for slicing through
tough foods
we've spent last year designing
prototyping contestant
the result is the best camping utensil
we've ever used
if you've been hungry for a better
utensil your search is over morsel for
every last bite</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
