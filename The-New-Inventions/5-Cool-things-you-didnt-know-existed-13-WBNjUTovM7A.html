a 9 axis sensor to allow a runner to
study their stride mechanics running is
one of those sports with an incredibly
high angie lee in any given year up to
sixty percent of runners are going to
have an injury is going to cause them to
stop running for some period of time
it's unclear in the research what are
the primary causes of those injuries
it's with run scribe we gathered
thousands of data points for every
stride that can help you run with newer
injuries such as criminal velocity
impact geez breaking geez pronation
excursion metrics that you've never seen
before in a product like this we believe
by giving runners coaches trainers
insight into the mechanics of how they
run people can make better training
decisions like shoe selection you're
able to study the differences between
two pairs of shoes is one have higher
impact geez does one have a different
pronation excursion proscribes really
easy to use is so small that you'll
forget that it's on your shoe just put
it in scrabble and I go and run I don't
think about until I get back run scribe
automatically uploads your data at the
end of a run we've spent a lot of time
developing visualization tools that make
all of this data very accessible so
that's my average I'm less than my
average on this particular run my
maximum pronation velocity actually does
change I can spend hours digging through
some of the deeper information and for
me with my work injury history the first
thing I noticed was how high my impact
geez are and I am I
generation velocity is relative to other
runners that we had tested at that point
by having this depth of information that
we can share with the research community
we can finally start to shed some light
on lots of lingering questions in the
running community
we're taking run scribe to Kickstarter
because we want to get feedback on our
data visualization techniques what works
what doesn't work also we want to create
a community of runners that are
interested in contributing to this crowd
source database of data that's just not
been gathered before Bacchus on
Kickstarter and together we can create
an amazing community in an amazing data
bank our biggest hope for a run scribe
is to be able to help you run with fewer
injuries run smarter run fast or run
longer just run
we are from an independent tech
collective and we're tired of the
corporate giants laziness regular
earphones have wires that tangle and
limit your movement and the few wireless
ones out there are two big run out of
batteries on top of that a useless while
you charge them so we took matters in
our own hands and developed pucks the
world's smallest wireless earphones that
you can charge through your phone look
at those puppies this self-guiding
magnetic connector is going to change
the game if the battery is out just
connect it to your phone and keep on
listening we designed it not as a square
nor a circle we call it the squirrel for
the best electrical conductivity our
connecting elements are made of 18-karat
gold our pugs earphones are not only
small they're also packed with badass
sound and come in two different models
depending on what kind of fit you prefer
they are available in four colors to
suit everyone and of course you can talk
in the phone with a full charge takes 40
minutes which gives you four and a half
hours of music and it only uses three
percent of a smartphone's battery
capacity if the batteries out just plug
it in and keep on listening
the development phase is done and we are
ready to go now we need your help to go
into production you now have two choices
you push the back button and the story
ends you'll wake up tomorrow with your
regular earphones and this project will
cease to exist or you push the green
pledge button and we start our journey
and explore how deep this rabbit hole
goes the choice is yours
we put a lot of energy into our days
what if we could get some of that energy
back ampe is a wearable device it
captures the energy from your motion
throughout the day and turns it into
power for your phone your movement is
your power and that's about it that's
that's all there is to it wait cut
that's it yeah you you move and your
plug this is supposed to be a three
minute video you're killing me tages
Mike and I met during our engineering
PhDs at Northwestern we all had the same
problem our phones would die before the
end of the day so many people have this
problem over the past year and a half
we've refined the technology inside NP
we have optimized the power generation
components to the point where you can
still produce significant power while
maintaining a small form factor you
don't need to be an athlete any motion
will charge it we knew we were onto
something when MP kept winning crowd
favorite prizes of business competitions
everyone kept asking if they could get
one people love the idea of taking
control over their charging habits it
frees them from the wall and motivates
them to get moving anthe is designed to
just fit into your life its shape
matches the curves of your body and it's
easy to slip into your pocket or pop
into your purse if you live in a city
you probably walk enough to extend your
phone's battery life by three hours if
you also go on a run or maybe go cycling
you can extend it by six hours the more
you move the more power you get or you
can use ampe to charge your wearable
devices or any other device the charges
via USB but you don't need to use the
power right away you can store it for
however long you want and use it when
your device is needed most now we know
that everyone's different and some
people move in some pretty creative ways
so we've designed an accessory kit that
lets you move just about any way you
want we can't wait to hear how you use
aunt bee if you want to know how much
power you're getting out you can check
the companion smarts on it it lets you
track the energy you've generated along
with the calories you burn with ampe
you're producing green energy we've got
fully functional prototypes being tested
by our pilot customers and they love
them we're continuously collecting
feedback and make improvements but now
we need your support for the final step
to move vampy towards full-scale
manufacturing we're so excited about
what's to come one day our technology
can be integrated directly into
smartwatches fitness trackers and other
crazy wearables that haven't been
invented yet so you never have to wonder
with but it all starts now so join us
and help us bring auntie to the world
that better yeah can I get one
constantly checking your phone because
you're worried about missing a call text
or email
missed calls because your phone was in
your purse and you didn't hear it ring
or worried about leaving your phone
behind that's why we created ditto
ditto helps people to stay connected
without always having to check their
phone get ova rates when someone
important to you is trying to get in
touch ditto is really tiny and super
lightweight so it fits easily even in
the smallest pocket it also has a
built-in clip so you can attach it
anywhere for example to your shirt
collar waistband or bra strap and ditto
is discreet you can wear it under your
clothes so you're still free to wear
your favorite watch or jewelry or wear
it on its wristband just clip ditto on
in the morning and go live your life did
it will vibrate when you get calls texts
emails and other notifications that
you've set as your favorites in the
ditto app and you can customize the
vibrations so you'll know exactly when
to check your phone
ditto has a digital tether so you'll
know if you've left your phone behind
and it has a silent wake-up alarm so you
wake up not your partner ditto is also
waterproof so you can wear that the gym
or even while swimming we made it Oh as
simple as possible there are no buttons
switches displays lights connectors or
even charging cables in fact you never
need to charge ditto after many months
when its power is low you'll get a
message notifying you when to replace
its low-cost batteries so put it on wear
it anywhere and be more connected to
what matters most
you
we walk every day no one remembers to
every step we made but the step that is
meaningful is remembered timelessly a
baby's first step was a divine challenge
and the step that share the same side is
a Bright Hope and the step towards each
other is a strong thrill and the steps
that share the time promises the
perpetual moment the step remember is
not remembered by a number of steps you
made that's why polity of walk is so
important people walk but remembering
about good locking posture is so hard we
just simply forget it's not easy to
recognize your bad walking habit in your
daily lives so that's why we came up
with our key a smart wearable band that
will help you to walk better and more
balanced we all have unique walking
patterns but with machine learning
technology we analyze our swinging
patterns such as size spark rhythms and
frequencies are key process the signal
and tells you if you are walking right
to look confident or walking bad such as
putting hands in a pocket watching a
smartphone or crunching your bag while
you're walking when our key senses
you're bad walking posture or habit and
gently vibrate to promote you to be more
balanced and to have well posture
walking style
our key allows to work more with
confidence and will be your junk gentle
coach every time you walk in this
project we focus to bring technologies
for everyone normally we are arguing the
preferred side once a week by just
wearing are you on the other hand you
will know how balanced your body's
because our key can analyze different
stream parents to rocky islands such as
amplitude frequencies and orientation as
we all know establishing a healthy
posture in Kasauli 8 is very essential
our key can be your kids walking trainer
I assisting auto watching habit and well
balanced body you can monitor progress
on your smartphone of course arcus
approach the basic functions of fitness
tracker like measuring steps calories
and even sleeping parents without a push
of a button aren't you adapt
ultra-low-power microprocessor bluetooth
low energy and uniquely designed hidden
display to stay longer with you your
unique walking pattern can also be used
as biometric identification to slide
your finger prints are key recognizes
you and enables to unlock your personal
gadgets and control your smartphone
devices are quisiera functionalities are
dedicated just for you our key is
design-wise basically not obtrusive is
the most critical part of the project
was to make it well fitted and we'll
match doing everyone's risk no matter
what you wear in the middle of the
occasion get to where we are today we
have tested out literally tons of photos
I models who sold out the hierarchy of
what's important and what's not
important in a pearl IRP
then we have settled on a design with
asymmetrical top which allows you to
intuitively control the device and of
course it also provides recollect event
last of all RK is basically waterproof
and it's available with a multiple
choice or straps
we have just completed our first working
prototype and now we are ready for mass
production we have been working with one
of the best wearable device contract
manufacturer to deliver our first are
key band to your wrist that's why we
need your help Kickstarter we are very
excited to deliver this technology to
you with our key take a better step live
a better life and that's why every
movement matters
you
