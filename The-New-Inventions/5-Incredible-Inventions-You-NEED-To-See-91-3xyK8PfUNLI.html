rely heavily on technology to keep it
connected and productive in our daily
lives and a dead phone battery could be
costing the you've old watch is our way
of solving this problem in a way that
also helps preserve the environment the
watch is equipped with a solar panel
that possibly captures energy from the
Sun that energy is then stored inside a
removable compact power reserve under
ideal light conditions watches power
reserve could reach its full capacity
within a day low battery just pull out
the power reserve from the watch and
start charging your mobile devices we
are also including a wireless charging
dock if you need to start your day with
a full charge simply place the watch on
the dock and it was fully charged in
under 45 minutes to save energy the dock
only uses power when a device is placed
on it and automatically turns off when
it reaches full charge our aim with the
you've old watch was to create a simple
yet highly functional object it's
minimal lines and analog interface makes
it an easy fit for any wardrobe it is
meant to be a comfortable and personal
everyday companion that supports our
values as well as our mobile lives we
chose a mechanical watch instead of
digital because it would draw less power
while providing precise time the watch
hands have a minimal width to maximize
the performance of the solar panel which
covers the entire face of the watch it
is also covered with a thin sheet of
anti reflective mineral glass to further
enhance the solar capacity the power
reserve combines a custom circuit that
handles the electrical flow of the watch
with a high-density lithium-ion battery
the reserve has an integrated lightning
port for Apple devices or micro USB B
and C for android devices it could even
go entirely Wireless the charging wire
stays inside the power reserve so it's
virtually impossible to forget
as a bottom it's the wireless receiver
for inductive charging through the
included dock it all fits in a durable
aluminum body and on top of that we
filled the band with batteries to add
more capacity allowing a second charge
after the power reserve has been used to
achieve this addition we develop the
custom hinge that lets current go back
and forth within the body of the you
gold watch today we need your support to
bring this project to life and together
step into a sustainable and accessible
future imagine how we interact with the
world but today we just mostly poke at
the screen fingers and hands are
incredible why are we so limited
introducing Vella an innovative device
that instantly turns any surface into a
smart interface the world at your
fingertips once connected you will be
able to control different hardware
devices or software applications by
using simple gestures
vela will make your life more convenient
use it to control music light
temperature or any other application you
have in your mind you are only limited
by your imagination and you only need
one valid device to control multiple
devices or applications you can use our
presets like letters so add your own
gestures according to your preference
simply assign chest years through
different scenarios and switch between
them just by moving your hands our human
hand is fantastic they can not only feel
the nozzle manipulate things in a
versatile way the current smartphone
technologies which is putting everything
into small tiny screen which highly
limits and constrained the interactive
areas of our hands velo works on any
surface so you can clip it anywhere you
like or even design your own control pad
unlike other devices Vela gives you
tracking and multiple texts to action
features so you are not limited to just
one action but if different patterns to
assign four different actions it is
super easy to use and really works for
everyone if you are a developer you can
try new ideas and figure out different
customized applications with our well
designed API to track the human gestures
Vela uses a special sonar technology
that is nowadays widely used to military
cars and drones it transmits signal
pulsar's collects the reflective energy
from your finger and then translates it
into the performed action our team has
been focused on sensing techniques for
couple of years now passionate about
making to us which is just human needs
by amplifying human communities turning
any surface around you into a remote
control enables many potential
possibilities in our daily lives well
there's been lots of products in the
market but we have not found any of them
capable to track and to recognize with
high credibility with Weller attracts
your finger with the finest position and
transform it in the customized action
well er where is Magic to a daily life
it all started with the idea of making a
physical version of pong one of the
first video games ever created early on
we realized the magnitude of the
challenge and that's how the table pong
project was born as the project evolved
we wanted it to be more than a table
with a game we started adding functions
like charging your cell phone listening
to music through bluetooth then
displaying the time when you're using it
as a table for the past three years
we've been perfecting the design we
tried magnets different surfaces motors
etc to build the prototype we have today
some months ago we decided to share the
project on social media to see what
people thought about it and it had a
wonderful reception this motivated us to
continue developing this project which
is where we're at right now the
simplicity of pong is what makes it
possible to play with kids and adults
it's fun for all ages I believe that the
table can be in homes but also could be
in offices in bars after all these
events we're very committed to move
forward and we want to bring the table
pong project to every part of the world
and for that we need your support ready
to run today we are a group of
passionate runners some of us run all
the time and some of us run occasionally
but coming for all of us is that we want
to run right that's how we came up with
the idea of shift IQ we've created the
world's first virtual running coach with
artificial intelligence that measures
the way you run and gives you a live
feedback while running straight on your
body and we forward from your uncle we
wanted to create a product that would
help runners from better faster and
without injuries we simply wanted to
give all runners the ability to learn
how to run right shift IQ is your
personal running coach that helped you
become a better runner one coaching
session at a time with shift thank you
you will get real-time coaching full
body metrics coach reports training
drills in the world's first of virtual
running coach with artificial
intelligence through advanced what
measurements and many other precise
running metrics shift IQ analyzes your
run and since this data into live
coaching while running all you have to
do is press star on to initiate your
coaching session
and shift IQ will guide you through the
rest of the process ready to run the
length of your stride the strike of your
foot the tilt of your body shift at you
takes in a hundreds of these readings
every second and uses them to give you
live feedback through your headphones
coaching you to make you a better runner
when you run right you will enjoy
running the longer distances at a faster
pace a more efficient running technique
will also keep your legs fresher for
longer a smarter technique will help you
focus your energy in all the right
places activate the complex combination
of intelligent hardware and
sophisticated software creates an
advanced virtual running coach that will
help you become a better runner and
after each run you'll be able to see a
full breakdown of your technique with
tips on which areas still need work with
improvements in your running technique
you'll feel happier about your runs and
continue to want to improve I have been
running professional since I was a
little girl and she blew me away even I
had some point to improve so I think the
shift to help all types of furnace many
runners will sustain an injury at one
point simply because they are not
running right with shift you may catch
bad habits before they become past
injuries and that enables you not only
to keep running but to keep running
right last year we launched shift pro
our solution for advanced runners and
now with crowds the lawn shift IQ for
beginners and intermediate runners love
life and now we need your help to
finalize shift IQ everything is in place
we just need to stop production so that
we can get shift IQ to the market as
soon as possible so the running rights
can become a reality for even more
people all over the world everything
from your Smart TV to your smarty look
at this guy he still thinks this car hub
is a way of the future there's nothing
smart about a bulky spendy orbital
what's each chunk of plastic that only
works when you're in
by range that's why I have can see with
can see I can control my entire home
from that snazzy device i have with me
everywhere every day my smartphone it
comes in four models so every function
you need relay for on or off dimmer for
mood lighting server to operate your
doors and windows in an outlet s1 really
for fast charging on all your mobile
devices all I do is add my places to the
free open IOT platform design my
schematic by customizing each floor and
room with the appliances and voila I am
in one hundred percent control of
everything I want with a simple
screwdriver you can insult can see
neatly inside your wall outlet no hub no
remote all the magical powers view wants
and no one to know where you got them
from can see is a standalone device so
long as you got Wi-Fi you got mojo you
use it to make all your dumb appliances
smart and make your smart appliances
better your life electronics stores
thermostats blinds oven coffeemaker
always it manages your daily task by
simply customizing your home to manage
it tilt the way you want you can track
your power usages and know what to turn
off or turn on at any time it also
notifies you when something is in use
even when it's not supposed to be see
you'll know what appliance is running
for how long and who's using it and just
think of it you can turn step off or on
to create a personal routine to minimize
power consumption at peak hours and that
saves you cash and we all like cash it's
also not limited to your home base you
can set up a profile for the office your
cabin even your grandfather's rickety
old rental property which is cool
because when I get new tenants I can
provide them access or deny it whenever
I choose
no more time wasted exchanging home keys
and to prove I'm king of my castle can't
see is equipped with a scheduled routine
recognition it activates my personal
routines and communicates with all of my
devices so when I leave my office my
home profile knows I'm on my way and
does precisely what I've told it to do
and because you're always connected to
the cloud you'll get notifications no
matter where you are if anything
important you're monitoring shuts off or
craps out the advanced sensor displays
real-time status so the notice is
instantaneous as your favorite
appliances or area from different places
to the one dashboard and voila you are
the man with the plan you'd even have
safety features to protect the little
text from making big mistakes and with
