encrypted your phone your iPad your
Wi-Fi your suitcase the door of your
building and of course your credit card
has a digit code for sure it's better to
be safe by the way how safe is your
wallet in your own home for example have
you ever realized you were missing some
cash or is it safe in your own bedroom
your credit card number never ended up
on the internet without your consent at
the office are you really sure nobody
can sneak in your wallet and violate
your privacy then we realized there was
one item that we don't secure enough our
wallets this is why we created and are
proud to present the many safe wallet
the first code encrypted pocket-sized
vault including a locking system with a
thousand different combination
possibilities and a choose your own
system it's amazing how much progress
has been made in terms of tracking
systems lately that's why we propose the
option to embed your wallet with a
tracking system to ensure you never lose
it again it's also guarded with RFID
blocking technology your contactless
cards will be kept safe and protected
from electronic pickpockets the lock is
made out of metal for maximum
reliability
it is extremely handy thanks to its fan
shape interior giving easy access to all
your cards which are stored and well
sorted it can hold US dollars and euros
and fit up to twelve cards we've been
working on this idea for the past two
years with professional engineers to
reinvent and develop the locking system
to adapt it to a wallet
it's very light and strong thanks to its
conception and high-quality materials
we've also been working with the
designer Eric Bertus and his design
agency in Paris to make this wallet
aesthetically beautiful and practical in
its use so if you think this is a great
product for yourself your friends or
relatives we would love to have you on
board as a backer and don't forget to
better to be safe
we set out to create the sexiest easiest
to use minimalist wallet in the whole
world and I think we've done just that
but it's time to find out for yourself
the Micra wallet was conceived as a
joint appreciation of minimalist design
as we grew frustrated with traditional
leather wallets only lasting several
months instead of several years as
designers we knew we could do better we
set ourselves a pretty challenging brief
to design a minimalist wallet that was
not only aesthetically beautiful but
functionally superior to anything else
on the market our years of industry
experience enabled us to quickly
evaluate our designs taking them from
initial concept through to sourcing
manufacturing partners mass production
our use of PVD coating would rival most
high-end watches this provides an
extremely high scratch resistant finish
we had concerns about our product
strengths so we decided to test it ready
we fitted our wallet with a low-friction
TPU strap this prevents it from sticking
to your clothes holding audio cards
securely you no longer have to remove
them to make a payment one of our
proudest achievements is full
functionality of a regular wallet
without the bulk believe it or not we've
even managed to find space for your
change we've sourced the suppliers
we've manufacture our prototypes we
tested them to their limits and this is
where we need your help
the Kickstarter community to help fund
this campaign and make the first
production run of the Micra wallet huge
success Thank You fortune
thank you technology has made our lives
more efficient everything we use is
smart from smart phones to smart watches
from smart cars to smart homes so why
aren't we smart with our money what if
our wallets were smart what if they
became something you never had to worry
about no more misplaced money credit
cards driver's licenses and no more
theft that was the idea behind cash you
wallet a fingerprint access GPS enabled
smart wallet that's going to
revolutionize and replace the
traditional wallets be used for
centuries
I lost my wallet twice in six months not
only did I lose my money
but then canceling my credit cards
waiting for the new ones to come and the
worst of all the fear of identity theft
so I began my research to see what's
available in the market and how I could
avoid this kind of a problem in the
future
there was no comprehensive solution and
that's when the idea of cash you wallet
came about the cash you wallet is
incredibly easy to use first download
the free cash app on your smartphone
then you use bluetooth to sync your
wallet to the app register your
fingerprint to the app and you're ready
to use your cash shoot the battery owner
cash you one is last for over nine
months the biometric fingerprint reader
and specially designed electronic latch
gives you exclusive access to your
wallet unauthorized users will be locked
out immediately for the times that your
wallet is out of your line of sight
whether it be under a car seat behind a
couch cushion or even under a pile of
clothes use the buzz my wallet feature
was in the app just follow the sound and
you'll locate your wallet in no time
your wallet is always connected to your
phone via bluetooth it has sensors that
work closely with our smartphone app
every time you leave cash and wallet
behind your phone will ring and send you
a notification keeping you close to what
matters all the time
and on the rarest occasions when you
actually lose your wallet you can mark
it as lost on our app crowdsource GPS
technology will put all other kashew app
users on alert for your wallet if any
cash you app user gets within range of
your wallet you'll be sent a
notification on your phone of your
wallets location the cash e wallet is
also scratch and water-resistant and
above all safe for the environment we
have a great idea and the right team
we've come this far with cash you wallet
but now we need your help to get this
product to manufacturing please support
us in our Kickstarter campaign together
let's create a new generation of wallets
the smart way
I really want to make this wallet just
because I was looking for something that
was generic easy to use
slim comfortable there's a lot of
different versions out there I didn't
really see anything I liked so I decided
to build it my favorite part about the
Bucks box is the streamlined design they
slide in and out of your pocket easily
it's easy to get your cards in and out
of them it doesn't wear your jeans like
normal wallets typically do it almost
feels like you don't have a wallet in
your pocket every guy at some point or
another I think has had the three-inch
thick leather wallet every time you sit
down hurt your back you never know where
to put it it's always bulging in your
pocket we're just thinking about how I
would do it differently and so it was
that night I just literally went out
into the garage and started cutting up a
piece of metal at that point I was
determined to make it I've been
machining for about 15 years started off
in the aerospace industry and recently
left that job a little over a year ago
actually to do this full-time the
success of the bucks box would help me
to continue my journey in machining and
having my own business and will be able
to expand on the bucks box line to bring
more designs that we've been working on
to life one of the things that was
important to me when I started this
whole project was keeping the
manufacturing in the United States and
keeping it local I'm born and bred in
Orange County and one of the things that
I liked about this was being able to put
together a whole project that was
designed manufactured machine and
shipped from Orange County so when you
support bucks box you're supporting
local business you're supporting a
couple guys at weld machining love
designing products and definitely want
to bring more stuff out to you I'm joke
as I'll ski and I designed the Bucks box
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
