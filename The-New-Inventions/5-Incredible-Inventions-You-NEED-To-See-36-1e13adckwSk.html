of how you live your life outside
connected to the things that matter to
you but if your skin could ask for
something it would ask for protection
because there are over 1 million cases
of skin cancer per year in the united
states alone the problem with sunscreen
you can't see if it's actually
protecting you sunscreen is like an
invisible armor so how do you know if
it's worn off how do you know if you've
applied enough to protect your skin hi
I'm Dave founder and creator of
sunscreen sunscreen ur is a special
camera that shows you the UV rays that
sunscreen blocks when you look through
sun screener protected stand appears
dark unprotected skin appears lightly
you can actually see the spots where
water sand or sweat has worn away your
protection whether you just need a quick
look at your kids skin or you want to
check your own protection sunscreen ur
has you covered I love spending time
outside with my family but I've always
been concerned about skin damage my goal
in creating sunscreen er was to find an
easy way for my family to protect
ourselves while we enjoyed the outdoors
so I took technology that was previously
only accessible to scientists and made
it accessible to all of us sunscreen er
is easy to use waterproof and durable
it's smaller than a granola bar yet as
powerful as a multi-thousand dollar
camera it's perfect for everywhere the
beach the soccer field your favorite
fishing hole even the golf course and it
helps us protect our skin and our loved
ones from sun damage your skin story
should be about doing the things you
love protect it with sunscreen ur
I came up with the idea for a translator
when I'm at a French girl that's really
where the story starts I was on vacation
and i met this girl it was difficult for
us to communicate because she didn't
speak English very well and even when we
tried to find a solution like using some
translation app to communicate it's
horrible but if you're never speaking
and our phones are in a face like this
forget it this is the wall we're out of
this real-world interaction but this in
your ear just right back in it Lil D put
this in your ear wish miss a memo hey
put in your concern yeah okay didn't
hear me French vive melt on the whole
closetful say yeah and I can hear you
talk Spanish and causes fists but this
is awesome but how you do it yeah it's
translating translating
this little wearable uses translation
technology to allow two people to speak
different languages but still clearly
understand each other simply put when
one person speaks the other here is it
in their language developing the pilot
has been an intensive process our tunes
been work on it over two years andrew is
original co-founder and overseas prior
development I'm an electrical engineer
and expert in manufacturing we also have
mechanical engineer software engineer
PhD in machine translation as well as an
industrial designer our wide breadth of
experts has allowed us to develop a
product from the ground up we wanted to
create something that hugs the curves of
the year without being obtrusive
something snug but fashionable to wear
in the process we just decided to throw
in an extra earpiece for wireless turn
your music that means the full system
includes two air pieces and its
accompanying app it's from the app
itself where all of the languages are
uploaded to the earpiece it's kind of an
end-all solution for the traveler or the
international professional that's what
we're doing here at Waverly laughs it's
simply the most advanced communication
wearable
this IndieGoGo campaign helps us finish
what we started we can get the ear
pieces along with this portable charger
manufactured and delivered within a year
the app works on its own if you just
want to use the app for basic
translation and we'll have the app out
by late summer first for our backers
here on indiegogo but for the full
experience you really want the ear
pieces too it's the dream you know a
life untethered free of language
barriers it's just that it's no longer
dream anymore it's real
you

from there the idea of cohorts football
the assembled team of the best designers

the double effort and set forth to make
a truly impact to our day-to-day life
karate is the first unbearable device
integrating amazon alexa allows you to
connect your smartphone and the world
around you through the power of your
wife it was a very important for us to
keep the door open to other developers
it's an easy-to-use interface for
creating a personalized experience on
your SmartWatch
we wanted to make it easier than ever
before to stay in touch with the people
you care about most
to share your achievement by living an
active lifestyle is your friend when the
chronologic team came aboard we knew we
are making something very special the
collage XO has became the backbone of
our own piece of art they have this real
clarity of vision a real discipline
around what they want the device to look
like and what they want the watch to do
there was a great deal of alignment and
with the kawatche team deemed important
and and what we've been prioritizing and
it's just been a real easy click we
haven't looked back since we started
working fela i'll go is to truly perfect
your mobile life so you know it a
fashionable product design and

what is most important to you that is
the magic of SmartWatch
we always like to change people's life
like a magician
we are all curious each child peeking
through a gap in the fence every
scientist hunting for an answer and all
the lovers staring up at the sky while
dreaming or while searching we have
always turned to the night sky filled
with the wonder of a billion stars and
the infinite space around us all of us
look up but how many of us can capture
it frame it bring it home and share it
now you can capture space in a palm of
your hand that's why we meet tiny one it
was smallest smartest and most social
astronomy camera is a tiny one you can
capture the nice guys never before you
no longer have to worry about expensive
equipment by advanced photography
knowledge just point and shoot p program
and augmented reality star map to help
you locate planets and constellations
easily the tiny one is also compatible
with all the lenses out there and even
telescopes
to be mentioned it takes selfies too it
connects seamlessly to your smartphone
and allows direct sharing to your
favorite social media so the tiny one is
not just about the night sky it's about
you like Neil deGrasse Tyson said when I
look up at the night sky I know that we
are part of this universe we are in this
universe but more importantly the
universe is within us</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
