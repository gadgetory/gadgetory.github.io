combines all of our favorite features
into an ultra low profile tool that we
call the titanium pocket tool this new
tool is made from aerospace grade five
titanium alloy
despite its minimal name and appearance
this new pocket tool is extremely
versatile and lets us do more careless
hi Kickstarter's I'm Joe
I'm Chadwick we're excited to be back
here with our news project the titanium
pocket tool it's a cool multi-tool that
combines our favorite tools in the one
and it doesn't take hardly any space in
your pocket thanks for checking it out
introducing tread the first multi-tool
that lets you be the one who gets it
done anywhere tread is 25 hard-working
tools you wear on your wrist
including Phillips and flathead
screwdrivers hex and box wrenches even a
cutting hook and a bottle opener so
regardless of the job the right tool is
always at hand tread features 11
interchangeable links each crafted from
injection molded 17 for stainless steel
there's an optional Swiss made timepiece
water-resistant to 200 metres with a
shock resistant sapphire crystal and it
all comes with a choice of two rugged
finishes
tread the go to go anywhere to from
leather the original American multi-tool
fasteners bolts screws claims all of
your outdoor gear has them and as your
gear has become ever lighter ever more
high-tech made from carbon contain iam
aluminum we've moved ever closer to the
limits of these fasteners and materials
that used a neat t ratchet and tied for
the first multi configurable portable
tool system with high precision torque
measure designed for use with your high
performance gear the solution for
lightweight portable torque is called
tied torque a five percent accurate
titanium torsion beam calibrated with
two four six and eight millimeter easy
links can simply insert the bit required
by your fastener and tighten until the
arrow aligns with a desired torque ride
it's that easy
tie torque even allows for fast and easy
step talking of multi fastener features
such as stem face plates which up until
now have only been possible either with
digital torque wrench is costing
hundreds of dollars or by using multiple
clip type torque tools the some of which
also cost hundreds of dollars one of the
most critical aspects of proper torque
control is position of the tool during
the tighten after looking at all
possible options for using the tight or
we couldn't decide between our two
favorite designs a ratchet or a tea
needle so we decided to do both the t
wretched is the first ratcheting
t-handle that magnetically transforms is
the world's most ergonomic mini ratchet
the t-handle allows for fast turning
during early installation and tightening
to lower torque settings in less than a
second the t-handle turns into a higher
torque capable ratchet its stabilizing
thumb control by adding a thumb
stabilization point on the ratchet the
user maintains tool position much more
accurately eliminating rounded or
damaged screw heads so common on
tradition
and multi-tools we even developed our
own forged hardest steel 72 tooth
ratcheting mechanism which has up to
twice the engagement points of other
small ratchets making it significantly
more effective in tight spaces which
limit accidents if you're like us you
love and trust your gear as much as you
love the adventure analyze together we
can better optimize and protect your
gear please become a back and help us
build tools that are beautiful
lightweight amazing to use and also
improve the safety and longevity of all
your high-performance gear
hi my name is Tony zento I'm from Laguna
Beach California
I grew up skateboarding surfing and
snowboarding and later on I got into
riding bikes and dirt bikes - keeping
everything tuned up as a crazy challenge
I got a bunch of tools in the garage you
know summer shop tools summer tools that
I travel with that I just throw in the
bag I started having ideas on how to
make these tools better I started making
some prototypes and what I found was
that something that worked well for a
skateboard tool could also work well for
a snowboard tool where there was another
detail that might work well on a bike
tool and what I found was that I wasn't
just making one tool I was kind of
making different tools for action sports
which then kind of really just warped
into this idea for a new brand I have a
snowboard tool I'm calling - powder
pliers it's got a number three phillips
for mount on your bindings number two
phillips a slotted screwdriver and a
four millimeter for your binding
hardware there's box wrenches for
replacement fighting bolts there's a
removable sleeve that you can use on the
number three phillips to lock it at 90
degrees which is killer for getting some
extra torque on your bindings there's
also an edge file if you need to do some
on mount the file work which is kind of
nice if you need to do an emergency to
it aero Attila is a Winter X Games gold
medalist he's writing for fix and super
stoked on the tool
we have assistant we're calling the
all-time belt and it keeps the tool
always within reach I also have a skate
tool I'm calling the board sword there's
a number two Phillips slotted
screwdriver and 1/8 inch hex bit for
your deck hardware there's even a file
to score grip when you're building a new
board so that's great if you're on the
road traveling or you're away from your
garage the sleeve has a safety blade to
cut your grip a 9/16 wrench for your
truck and a 3/8 inch wrench for your
deck bolts the wheel wrench has a nice
little bend in it so you can get into
deep wheel wells which is kind of nice
Steve Caballero is a skateboarding
legend and we're stoked to have him on
the team cab also rides Moto's and
mountain bikes
he works on custom cars and custom bikes
so he's always in need of killer tools I
have a bike tool called the wheelie
wrench it's 16 tools in one and it's
also one of the most compact tools on
the market you got all your metric hex
bit sizes torques and of course slotted
in Philips there spoke wrenches you got
a tire lever a couple box wrenches
there's also a 15 millimeter open-ended
wrench which is great for most BMX axles
Mike huh car is a top Pro BMX rider he's
pretty tough on his bike and he's back
in the wheelie wrench Hucker totally
sends it look at how nice the wheelie
wrench fits in his five pocket pants and
noticed that all the tools fit in the
all time belt oh and check out what else
the belt does</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
