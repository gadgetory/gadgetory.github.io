I'm audience I'm not a designer I
specialize in sign from devices last
figures and hi speakers
I discovered
and decided to decide upon to get design
naturally
to use a piece of art this is Symphonica
a totally acoustic horn speaker which
naturally amplifies the sound of your
smartphone Symphonica employs passive
acoustic amplification increasing the
sound without requiring electrical power
giving you extra volume for listening to
podcasts videos background music
FaceTime chats and audiobooks
Symphonica is made from sustainable
woods and is carefully and painstakingly
worked and finished to produce elegant
inspired pieces each with its own unique
character we first started talking about
this idea a few years ago the Freddy's
work involves developing premium
products for consumers at the high end
of the market and so the question became
how could we offer a product that
showcases the beauty of natural wood
with distinctive styling that
immediately catches the eye and commands
attention and yet still put it within
the reach of the average person so that
everyone could bring a little bit of
elegance into their homes and offices we
spent over two years refining and
testing designs and prototypes were now
ready to start production but to cover
the cost of the initial run we need your
support
we've got great part about pricing for
those of you who want to be first to own
these remarkable speakers whether you
prefer a lacquered finish the rich tones
of stained wood the simple beauty of
naked wood over wants to paint or stain
it yourself as a DIY project we've got a
version just right for you so please
pledge we know you're gonna love
symphonic as much as we do and we can't
wait to get them out to you
real hard moments moments that determine
what we do how we feel we become and in
those moments the lightest nudge the
channel list encouragement can make all
the difference
human potential is unlimited but
sometimes it can be hard to unlock
introducing people a smart light for
forming better habits and bite-sized
steps
we believe technology should make people
better peek is designed to help you
achieve your biggest goals
no matter what they might be
and Dan and I set out to create peak we
felt like technology was Thunder
delivering on the promise of making
people better in a world full of digital
distraction we wanted to make it easy
for anyone to make a positive change
so we researched and prototype for
months until we came across the unique
combination a smart beautiful objects
inspired by the latest and behavioral
research here's how it works
peak makes better habits easy with
out-of-the-box or completely custom
plans first it lights up when you're
most likely to take action second touch
triggers an encouraging message to help
you take a tiny step toward a bigger
goal
these little steps add up to a life that
makes you and those you love proud and
when you're done beautiful light show
creates a subtle satisfaction
builds mental
we hope you'll join us in this journey
find out what it's like when the world
around us inspires us to do the things
the matter monks
personal growth comes from within and no
technology can ever change that
but sometimes
a little reminder a gentle nudge
makes all the difference in the world
let's face it people aren't lazy if it's
out of reach it's out of the question
and I'm not just talking about houses
you know he's gonna get something and a
