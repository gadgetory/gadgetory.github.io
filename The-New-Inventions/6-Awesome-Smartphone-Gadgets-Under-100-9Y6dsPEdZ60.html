can be a handful when not feeling well
taking the child's temperature can
provide you with tremendous insight into
their health but accurately taking a
child's temperature can be a challenge
at wishbone we've created the world's
smallest and smartest non-contact
thermometer perfect for taking your
child's temperature in under two seconds
comparing to traditional thermometer
wishbone as much smaller works faster
and is less prone to user error and it
doesn't contain mercury wishbone can
also track past readings and offers
better ways to manage your data wishbone
is great for other things too like
determining how hot the milk is or
checking the temperature outdoors or
even taking your own temperature which
is especially helpful for parents who
are trying to conceive the most striking
feature a wishbone is its unique Y
shaped design on one end of branch is an
accurate infrared sensor pointing at an
angle so that you can view to display
comfortably and the other branch
contains a battery ensuring a consistent
and accurate reading while allowing
wishbone to work on both iPhone and
Android devices as a father and a baby
product store owner I know the hassle of
taking a child's temperature from my own
experience and for my customers I
created wishbone to make it easier for
parents to check temperatures and
monitor their health we have made great
progress and then finished with the
design what comes next is testing
prototypes before moving the full
production we believe wishbone addresses
an important health issue and we need
your support launched successfully
budge now and let's make wishbone a
reality
hey guys around here at Road microphones
and this is the videomic me
it's the latest addition to a video mic
range of microphones and it's designed
to help you get better audio in the
videos that you shoot every single day
on your smartphone
now the videomic me is a directional
microphone that's designed to help you
get better audio directly with any video
shot on your iOS or Android device it's
a directional microphone and it actually
cancels out sound that comes in from the
rear of the microphone and only picks up
the sound in the direction that you want
to record so whether you're mounting the
phone and recording directly in front of
you and cancelling out any sounds from
behind you or whether you're mounting it
in selfie mode and wanting to cancel out
any of the sounds in front of you like
crowd noise or traffic noise and the
videomic me is a perfect mic to get rid
of those sounds that you don't like now
in the back of the mic is a headset
output jack so that you can actually
listen to the audio as you record it and
make sure that you're getting exactly
what you want
now often what happens when you're
recording outdoors in a windy
environment you'll often hear the wind
reacting with a microphone making it
really rumbly and very hard to hear so
to combat that we're actually supplying
it with a wind sock which goes straight
onto the end of the microphone and it
means you can record even in very windy
environments outside and get totally
clean audio the video mic me is designed
to fit a wide range of different devices
including both iOS and Android devices
as long as the headset input on the
device is on the opposite side to the
actual camera itself purely so that you
don't see the microphone when you're
filming straight ahead now it comes with
a little adjustment on the back so that
it can be mounted on a wide range of
different devices regardless of whether
you have a case on or not that mount can
be simply adjusted by just twisting it
off and then squeezing it on against the
body of the device itself to get it to
the perfect thickness and keep it there
nice and secure so there you have it
guys that's the videomic me I think it's
time to all get much better audio with
the videos that we're shooting every
single day
you
I'd like to introduce you all to a very
exciting and interesting thing not put a
lot of thought and research into ways of
seeing small and delicate things with
the naked eye as you can see traditional
microscopes are big and heavy they can
only be used in certain places but now
the perfect microscope has been invented
let me introduce you to the new Google
microscope it's very easy to use you can
just mount on the back of your
smartphone there are no cords and no
additional batteries since it's a small
microscope you can utilize it anywhere
and anytime now let's take a look at
this small microscopes amazing
performance as you can see here well
can't be seen with the naked eye can
easily be verified with this product and
the image is a high resolution compared
to other microscopes
let's take a closer look it's
astonishing how this small microscope
can enlarge the target by up to 400
times its original size
the nurugo microscope
not only can it be use for research and
education but it can also be utilized in
fields that require a microscope such as
work and everyday lives the two key
factors for producing the
high-resolution image are the lens and
the lighting the lens is capable of
enlarging the target by up to 400 times
its original size and this lighting
technology has also been patented you
can also get video without any
additional batteries or cables
everyone had an amazing response when I
upload the videos and images taken by an
arugula microscope on SNS if you simply
and easily want the best results
anywhere and anytime
new Rubel microscope is the answer I
really like my new Rugal microscope new
Duggal microscope will be your new eyes
expand your horizon change your world
this tiny lens is the only one for
expanding your world
we depend on our smartphones more and
more everyday to conduct business to
connect and share to listen to our
favorite music and to watch our favorite
videos so how come we never seem to have
a charging cable when we need one
maybe it's because our phones are
portable but our long and bulky charging
cables are not well now there's a new
class of charging cable introducing
lifelink by plus us the world's thinnest
ultra portable cable finally charging on
the go is easy and stress-free because
taking lifelink with you as as simple as
tucking it in your wallet slipping it
into your purse or handbag or putting it
on your keyring
so wherever you find a USB port in an
airport or hotel room on your laptop or
gaming console in your car on the back
of your TV your life link will always be
there to keep you charged and connected
incredibly life link is the same link
there's a credit card and as thin as
just two cards stacked together but when
opened life link extends to more than
double its length so you can still
access a user device while it's charging
or syncing life link is strong too
engineered with durable Teflon
technology and reinforced with a metal
spring for extra security life link is
available for all Android devices and
for all new Apple smartphones and
tablets so no matter what mobile device
you depend on you'll never be stranded
without a charging cable again because
life link works just like your normal
charging cable but it's always with you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
