think we glide yeah but it's cool your
camera called the nympho
so first up if the bc18 down here I've
got come prepare Wlad drain some tools
I'm going to add in a little bit of rice
wine vinegar so the little good wave
yeah there no poke so we have tense
makes its own
this calls because your phone is in your
purse and you didn't hear it ring that's
why we created it Oh
dito helps people to stay connected
without always having to check their
phone
ditto vibrates when someone important to
you is trying to get in touch it also
has a built-in clip so you can attach it
anywhere for example to your shirt
collar waistband or bra strap and ditto
is discreet you can wear it under your
clothes
so you're still free to wear your
favorite watch or jewelry or wear it on
its wristband just clip ditto on in the
morning and go live your life
data will vibrate when you get calls
texts emails and other notifications
that you've set as your favorites in the
ditto app and it'll has a digital tether
so you'll know if you've left your phone
behind
and it has a silent wake-up alarm so you
wake up not your partner little is also
waterproof so you can wear it at the gym
or even while swimming we made it as
simple as possible
there are no buttons switches displays
lights connectors or even charging
cables in fact you never need to charge
ditto after many months like notifying
you when to replace its low cost battery
keep the floor of your car clean and
tidy with many hangers from maxsa
innovations the mini car hangers are
quick and easy to install simply slide
them around your car's headrests and
you're ready to hang anything from lunch
boxes to umbrellas and everything in
between each hanger holds up to ten
pounds they are also great for creating
extra storage space in the back of your
minivan or SUV never worry about
groceries rolling around your car again
many car hangers designed by Maxo cars
have had powerful computers inside them
for years but that hasn't really
improved the way that we drive them in
creating automatic we set out to unlock
our cars potential and redefine people's
relationship to driving making it safer
more efficient and fun we did this by
introducing your car to your smartphone
it all starts with the automatic link
just plug it into your car's data port
and follow the simple instructions on
the screen now your car and smartphone
will connect wirelessly whenever you
drive most people don't realize just how
big an impact their driving style can
have on fuel efficiency you can save up
to 1/3 on gas with only a few
adjustments to how you drive an
automatic helps you do that without
being a backseat driver
it learns about your driving style and
gives you subtle audio cues when you do
things that waste gas click accelerating
quickly the app shows your weekly Drive
score and trip timeline so you can track
your progress and see where to improve a
high score could save you hundreds on
gas every year when you drive automatic
monitors your car's health and more and
do something's wrong so if your check
engine light comes on you'll see a
description of the problem and possible
solutions you can even clear the light
yourself and save a trip to the mechanic
because Adam attic connected to your car
when you drive it always knows where you
parked your family can even access that
location for seamless car sharing
accidents happen and far too often there
isn't someone there to help if you're
ever in a crash automatic alerts 9-1-1
with your location it can even contact
your loved ones to let them know what's
happened and that help is on the way we
wanted to reimagine what driving could
be and I think we did that with
automatic we believe that cars should
live up to their potential and that
every driver can be a smarter driver
that's why we created automatic that's
smart driving instinctive
Oh
see
I
yeah
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
