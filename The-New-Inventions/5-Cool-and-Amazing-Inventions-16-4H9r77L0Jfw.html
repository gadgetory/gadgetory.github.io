Tyler and this is the coolest fitness
product you've never seen the torpedo
but first let me tell you how this whole
thing got started
this is Mike Mike's a husband father of
three a marine entrepreneur moderately
fit exercise instructor and he's been my
business partner for seven years
together we operate several group
fitness gyms a few years ago as we were
getting ready to launch our newest
concept album we decided that our
current equipment options were simply
not good enough we needed something less
clunky more original with greater
versatility and could enhance the
training experience for all of our
clients regardless of fitness level at
that point the problem was that only
three primary pieces of equipment
existed the kettlebell the dumbbell and
the barbell to own all three in a small
studio or in a home gym meant using a
lot of space spending a lot of money and
only being able to do a few movements
per piece of equipment so we went to
work on a solution and we worked and
worked and worked we tried things that
didn't pan out and we gave up a few
times and then we worked some more and
when all was said and done we knew we
had something special this is the
torpedo don't let the simplicity of
design fool you this is the most
versatile tool on the market blending a
barbell a kettlebell and a dumbbell the
torpedo allows people of all fitness
levels
press squat pull swing condition build
strength and have fun with unlimited
varieties dual outer handles allow the
comfortable two-handed movements
traditionally exclusive to a barbell the
center handle means transitioning to a
dumbbell style movement is as simple as
switching your grip the torpedo was
organ AMA CLE designed for perfectly
weighted swings seriously there's
nothing you can't do with the torpedo
one tool instead of three minimal
storage requirements the torpedo comes
in weight ranging from 10 to 50 pounds
and five pound increments with the
torpedo you've got no excuses and you're
only limited by your own imagination we
care about changing lives and as people
who love fitness the torpedo helps us do
that we know the torpedo can change your
life too so buy one today buy one for
your mom and dad buy one for your sister
or your son or your neighbor you can
take the torpedo anywhere the real
question is where will the torpedo take
you
