have it both ways
at we've we make custom 3d printed
bionic ear that you captured from a
smartphone we chose to do a custom
install first because we believe every
step you take is untapped energy
untapped potential we wanted to combine
the best of both worlds the
affordability and accessibility of
over-the-counter insoles and the
biomechanic benefit of a custom orthotic
that's why we started this company we
realized we could solve a universal
problem 8 and 10 people experience foot
pain at some point in their lives
throughout the day your arch is going to
go unsupported and why that matters is
the muscles are actually going to
collapse and that leads to foot fatigue
what we do is we offer custom arch
support which is going to lessen that
foot fatigue you can't get that off the
shelf because every arch is completely
different left to right person to person
customisation engine that we've built
really it's allowing the use of a
pervasive platform today which is a
mobile phone it allows us to take data
about the human body from a phone that
everyone has in their home so that
secret sauce that magic of taking that
data turning that into geometry and then
manufacturing it is really the kind of
magical leaf there's a range of
different 3d printing approaches what we
use is something called SLS selective
laser sintering roller spreads a fine
layer of powder into a really flat layer
and then it's passed over with a laser
selectively you can see it melting the
layers of plastic in a slice of the
three-dimensional object until you end
up with a 3d object embedded in a block
of powder that you then need to exhume
ultimate goal is to add ten active years
to people's lives and that's predicated
on people being able to be active that
starts at the feet we know the pursuit
we're taking on is not easy to build
software a of manufacturing platform and
a physical product you just have to have
that much more from
why this is important you know for us
these words keep going represent a
culture and a lifestyle we want all our
customers to embrace get out there live
enjoy the world and when you're done
something you're proud of then keep

our product by shipping thousands of
pairs to practitioners and beta users
