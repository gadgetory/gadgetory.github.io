I created the dat coin so I could bring
a multi-tool anywhere anyway
anywhere I'm Tom and creative to bring
anywhere tool or the bat for sure it's a
carry anywhere ten function multi-tool
the size and shape of the coin for my
company cobra products pool you can
bring the bat anywhere since it's barely
larger than a quarter as no moving parts
and does not go against any current
travel restriction
it's the ultimate minimalist multi-tool
that lives in your pocket so you'll
never forget it the bat can cut open and
ignite use it on your everyday
adventures to survive or even to escape
do more with less the bat has a modified
Philips head screwdriver a captured
cutting edge a hole punch inscribed
point a wire stripper to fire rod
scrapers a flathead screwdriver a saw
edge a keyring attachment point a bottle
opener a covert attachment point to lace
it through your boot laces and the back
comes with a small solace reflective
sticker but you can choose to attach for
emergency signaling or leave off herself
after a year in development all the
legwork is done now we need your help to
put the bat production end into your
pocket if you like what you've seen so
far be sure to check out all the details
on the page below thank you for your
support
hi i'm mike scully
creator of the lever gear tool cart I
founded lever gear to design products
that solve real problems look great and
will last forever we all have little
projects that pop up in life and they
don't always happen when our tools are
handy it's annoying to have to spend
time chasing down tools for a job that
should take ten seconds if you're like
me it usually ends up getting added to
your to-do list
that's why we created the lever gear
tool card
it's a multi-tool the size of a credit
card that has 40 different tools it's
always with you so you can get things
done I like to be prepared to handle any
task but I also hate the idea of
carrying around a lot of extra stuff the
credit card size tool that could
disappear in my wallet seemed like the
perfect solution we developed the tool
card with a simple premise the real
estate in your pocket is precious so you
should own stuff that's actually worth
carrying began our design process by
brainstorming all of the functions we
could pack into a credit card sized
multi-tool we also tested every card
that existed on the market we thought a
lot about the design and layout of the
tool card by nesting the tools we were
able to add tools and reduce weight
without sacrificing strength we kept the
edges smooth so it feels great in your
hand when you're using the tools we
chose not to have an exposed blade so
the tool card is TSA compliant and it
won't damage your wallet instead we
added a blade protected by the can
opener so you can cut cords but not your
fingers
the tool card weighs only one ounce and
slips easily into your wallet so you
won't notice it until you need it or
ditch the wallet all together innovative
money clip is designed to snap on with a
click and disassemble with ease no extra
tools required
no fasteners to lose so you can quickly
switch from wallet card to money clip
tool card is made in America from blade
quality 420 stainless steel which is
then heat treated for excellent strength
and hardness its then bead blasted for a
professional finish and laser etched for
rich permanent graphics the tool card
makes an awesome gift that will last a
lifetime and it's scheduled to ship
before Father's Day and graduation we've
put in a lot of time to make this tool
as good as it can be please help us by
supporting our campaign and sharing it
with your friends thank you
