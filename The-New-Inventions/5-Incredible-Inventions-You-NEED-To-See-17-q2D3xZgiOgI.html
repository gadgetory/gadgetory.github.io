the freedom of knowledge the freedoms
share freedom to dream freedom of
movement now it fits with linky
mobility is freedom with linky strong
patented folding mechanism its freedom
in your bag
it's a last mile mobility solution that
means no more traffic no more bus
timetables no more pollution
linky represents the new generation and
electric mobility with it we want to
improve the way we experience cities the
team behind linky is a group of
passionate travelers wherever we were in
the world we found ourselves wanting a
mode of transportation that is eco
sustainable easy to carry around and
really fun to ride with technical
engineering and sales backgrounds we've
studied last mile mobility and made
linky to fill a gap in that market but
also in our own lives nothing out there
is truly portable so that's why we need
blinky to fit in a bag
one thing that distinguishes link is the
incredible pride with taking attentions
to detail we have worked for two years
to perfect the patented mechanical
system that expands and contracts link
based on our experience in automotive
design our structure uses iler system
polymers and carbon fiber for a perfect
balance between likeness and rigidity
weighing just 4.9 kilos it's really
sturdy we have put 160 lasagna and we
have ridden hundreds of kilometers
my experience in the electric car
industry is the inspiration behind the
electronics and the battery of linking
we wanted to be able to bring linky on
an aeroplane so we've chosen a
fast-charging long life lithium-ion
battery that respects iata regulation
for air travel safety is our number one
priority in designing linkage powertrain
and battery management solutions we've
optimized for power performance and wait
linkage charges to eighty-five percent
of its capacity in just half an hour
with linky you can ride 15 kilometers
climb up ten percent slopes and reach up
to 30 km/h link is made by hand by one
person who follows the project from
start to finish we are ready to go into
production but we need a minimum number
of orders to make this possible your
support right now will have keep costs
down so we can guarantee a great level
of service and a truly exciting electric
longboard
we know you have places to go
you have things to do
you're busy
we get it we are too
that's why we've developed a headphone
that adapts to your active lifestyle and
will stay put even when you won't
a headphone maintains comfort every step
of the way
physically and mentally and a headphone
provides true natural noise canceling
without the bulkiness or cost of our
competitors
our audibility customs headphones are
designed to fit the unique shape of your
ear in just 10 minutes all you need to
do is take the two colored materials out
of the package you mix them until they
become one color put our headphones in
your ear put the molding material around
the headphones and in the grooves of
your ear and wait 10 minutes is just as
easy as that our customs headphones will
keep the unique shape of your ear print
for whatever your active lifestyle
demands
but it's not only about making your
listening experience better it's about
helping others as well I've had hearing
loss ever since I was two months old
when I got my first pair of hearing it
my world was forever changed an odd
ability we believe that everyone has the
right to enjoy sound this is why 10% of
every audibility purchase goes directly
to the hear the world foundation in an
effort to get the gift of hearing to all
it's a better fit better sound better
you it's audibility
have you ever tried to meet up with
friends or been running late for a
meeting only to realize that your phone
battery's about to die see charging your
phone is inconvenient so we've created a
simple and easy way for you always to
stay charged and how do we keep you
always charged with this because this is
your charger and it's just a sticker and
this is your power strip it's not a
block that you hide somewhere it's an
ultra-thin surface that you can put
everywhere and this this is how I always
stay charged thanks to a wireless tech
up to four times faster than induction
and 20 times more powerful than a
classic charger with no electromagnetic
waves and full charge efficiency with
classic Chargers you can charge one
thing at a time with energy square you
can charge all your devices at the same
time at the same power everywhere thanks
to our intelligent detection system we
make sure no energy is sent until the
battery is detected so the surface is
completely inert so all day long you'll
be charging your devices without even
thinking about it at work and evening
with friends or family and all night
when you're asleep we started this
project in engineering school when
charging devices was a real pain for us
so our team has been working hard for
the past two years to change that we
started from prototypes to a real
product that is tailored to fit all
units we are engineers designers
managers coders that really believe we
can reinvent the way we have access to
energy our vision is that at every
moment of your life you can forget that
you're actually charging and for that we
designed two different sizes to adapt to
all your usages for now any of the
square is compatible with smartphones
and
tablets but we've developed an
open-source standard so we can work
together with manufacturers and makers
to make more products energy square
compatible if you want to be part of
this adventure you can join the
community by backing our project on
Kickstarter and sharing it with your
friends and family in order to build
with us a wireless creature
Audio has always been a huge part of our
lives I remember ever since I was a
little kid flipping through audio
magazines and then we always had the
best speakers on the block later when I
was a teenager it was almost a daily
ritual for my dad and I the closest door
to the living room turn off the lights
and just listen to music of the soft
glow of the amplifiers led people rarely
listen to music with that kind of focus
these days and that's what we want to
bring back that magic sparked the music
that only a really high quality system
can offer that's why you founded Phoenix
why we created the essence and why we're
doing this campaign to bring back the
magic music long before we found in
Phoenix we've loved speakers always been
most passionate about them because
they're the only component in the audio
chain that actually reproduces which
creates audio weights from an acoustic
point of view it's the most important
component to get right from an
engineering point of view they're the
most challenging and as a design object
or the most dominant out of any of the
components
Phoenix was founded with the aim of
providing exceptional quality and the
best listening experience as many
customers as possible without
compromises with the shifts and
listening habits over the past decade
something true not just among regular
customers but audio files to a regular
speaker made no sense at all we known as
the same thing of ourselves we spent
hours each day on the computer listening
to music watching movies youtube videos
will have you so really had to be an
active computer speaker system
the problem we found ourselves in was
that there was no high-quality computer
speaker system available on the market
either you got little speakers that come
with your computer or a big high in
system that doesn't even fit on your
desk so we decided we had to do it
ourselves and that's how the idea for
Phoenix is going in the back you'll find
input and mode buttons to switch between
all of them a 24-bit 96 kilohertz USB
input for windows and mac computers and
its driver free so you don't need to
worry about installing any extra
software there's an optical input for
televisions and Bluetooth receivers and
many other digital devices and RCA and
3.5 millimeter analog inputs for
turntables your phone and just about
every other device you can think of
there's also a high quality amplified
headphone input and a subwoofer output
the speaker's themselves are connected
via a industry-first mini XLR speaker
cable
