need something fun cool innovative and
let's not forget green and great for the
environment
introducing the skewed Matic it's half
bike half scooter and fully electric the
scoop Matic combines a bike and scooter
to create something truly unique the
scoop attic is fully electric and
utilizes an intelligent recognition
output function that frees you from the
gas pump and provides you with an
improved performance at the same time
the schematic features the latest
technology all crafted to bring you the
best riding experience possible the
scoop Matic reaches speeds of up to 15
miles per hour and rides distances of 28
miles in only one charge
other features include LED headlights
LED electric screen german-engineered
brushless motor brake powered protection
device samsung LG battery cells
bluetooth speaker leather seat remote
control USB charging interface the scoop
Matic is engineered and crafted to
provide maximum safety design and
comfort the scoot Matic has oil pressed
brakes that have the same configuration
and safety as an automobile the scoot
Matic folds up to fit into the trunk of
the car or to slide easily through a
door just plug it in when you get home
be the first to ride the scoop neck by
purchasing it on our crowdfunding page
lock in your special price which will be
long gone after our campaign ends once
you've taken the scoop attic for a spin
you'll never leave home without it
we believe to run your best you need to
be injury free to be injury free you
need to listen to your body and regulate
training mix according to how you feel
that's never really been possible until
now different approach so we imagined a
world where machines inspired by nature
allowed runners to train without injury
a world where regular people can
rediscover the pleasure of running
without the fear of getting hurt
we call it Bionic running and it's set
to challenge conventional notions of
running training with this non impact
closed kinetic chain you can say goodbye
to awkward foot strikes say goodbye to
strains from over extension and goodbye
to impact fatigue in fact the Bionic
runner lets you train hard from day one
to rapidly reach your peak potential
while limiting the amount of actual
running you need to do with the variable
resistance from its 8-speed internal
gear hub you can perform the same
advanced training techniques like
resistance intervals threshold and
fartlek training by transferring high
risk training activities to our bike
when you do run you can focus on
improving the economy of your gait so
you arrive at events fast fit and
uninjured we began our design process by
asking runners what they love about
running first they said they loved being
outdoors so we decided it had to be a
bike next they said they loved the
convenience you can run anywhere anytime
so we made it a folding bike so you can
take it in your car wherever you run
most importantly they love the feeling
and intensity of running no other
exercise comes close so he studied
running but it wasn't easy we spent
three years we built six radically
different prototypes testing theories
using science we discovered that only a
mechanism with 60 40 swing stance
facetiming can replicate the feeling and
intensity of running this is why Bionic
running feels like one and this sets the
Bionic runner apart from all previous
non-impact cross trainers these insights
are groundbreaking and our results have
been published in peer-reviewed sports
it's journals then our kids said but Dad
you gotta make it look cool and you
can't let your kids down so we gave our
bike unique styling with a jet black
anodized finish red accents and fly cut
embossed lettering forged right into the
parts it also had to be strong so
regardless of whether you're an Ironman
or a weekend warrior our bike is
engineered to withstand the abuse of
daily use and it had to be precise all
the parts of 3d forged or extruded
machined to exacting tolerances he
treated for strength surface finish for
protection and bonded together for
precision so he got back our first
manufactured sample and we were just so
excited sitting here behind me and we
took it up to the new citt√† Australia's
largest triathlon and here's what
athletes thought that is saying I love
it it's a really good workout like a lot
better than being in a gym very easy to
operate easy to balance on balance very
good actually a bit of a workout on the
legs up push it up to about hits gear
down the main straight is pretty good it
works exactly what you want it to work
you can feel immediately that you your
muscles that you want to engage you're
being engaged feel very erect oh yes
sort of feel really the posture your
posture is right
it would make me think that when I'm a
runner I'm quite a lazy runner Fred this
made me probably use the proper vibe
maybe biomechanics will be the word just
in that little distance I could feel it
I think it's a great tool for someone
feeling up the business process is that
getting back into running after an
injury so this is where you come in
Kickstarter's the Beinecke runner is
real the molds are made and we're
assembling product at speed and athletes
are getting truly amazing results out of
training with it so we're offering you
an exclusive to be the first in the
world to train with a bionic runner the
first junior running community to get a
true training advantage where you can
train harder from day one but avoid
injury so click on the rewards on the
right because once you're trained with
the bionic runner you never want to
train without one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
