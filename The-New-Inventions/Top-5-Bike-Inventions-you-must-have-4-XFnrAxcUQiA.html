are go and this is the Brent you bite
meat are unwi the go e on wheel by motor

makes an e-bike out of your favorite
bike in less than five seconds using the
on wheel bite motor is unbelievable easy
snap the battery into the holder
clucking the motor switch on the power
and you're ready to go that's it
the go e on wheel bike network and
provide you additional power in any
situation the does not net and fear
cycling in flat area are going to climb
up a hill the go e on wheel motor always
gives you enough power to do that easily

you start pedaling when you stop it
falls down and does not touch your wheel
you can use the motor with nearly
everybody it is huge able for everything
you would do with a normal bike and can
be used under all conditions
with the NGO ebike f you can easily
control your bike and use cycling maps
for navigation you can set a speed and
power limits and Cardin's to the local
law
when you're back from your trip just
pull the motor from your bike if it got
dirty don't worry the motor is water is
a stunt and you can clean it easily with
your garden hose
three years ago one of our co-founders
Tony recycling a lot between meetings
and he realized that he just wanted
something of a fold flat go into his
briefcase we realize it was a huge
opportunity to change how harmless have
really made he took us thousands of drop
tests before we'd learnt enough that we
can actually make our own material and
encase and this material is genuinely
the world's first multi impact flexible
shock absorbing foam that passes the
helmet safety standards the new head
case bike helmet not only offers the
prospect of excellent protection against
hard impacts to severe injuries it's
also able to withstand multiple impacts
cheering the wearer from the cumulative
effect of their knowledge I think that's
a game-changer for cyclists and this
time this is a tractor tire unlike an
EVs which you would have to replace with
any kind of knock it's also folding
because it's flexible
falls flat it suits everyone its compact
shape that sharp modern lines just
complement the shape of your head it's
one size fits all this really will fit
from a six year olds up to the large
adult head first thing that something's
comfortable
it's nice to fit my head which is
another one that's plenty extra padding
in you have to take any bits away and I
should wear just so
this is reluck relock helps you easily
open your bike
it's very useful when your hands are
full because relog opens automatically
without using your keys
then when you want to lock your bike you
can lock it simply with just one hand
you
and when you're not sure if you've
locked your bike you can conveniently
check its status anytime and anywhere
with the electronic key
let relock make your bike locking and
unlocking easy so you can focus on the
important things in life hi I'm Hugh and
I'm Richard our whole life we have been
inventing products which makes lives
easier our latest development is relock
a lock that automatically unlocks
without using your keys while I was
visiting Amsterdam I saw a lot of people
getting frustrated because they couldn't
find the piece of the bike that was the
moment that I came to the idea for an
automatic lock without using your key
even though we live in a smartphone time
we didn't choose to use a smartphone
because it has some serious limitations
for instance if you have that battery
which is smartphone you cannot unlock
the other thing if you want to loan your
bike someone else you have to give your
smartphone away hey don't do that
no that's the reason we chose for an
electronic key a small device that
automatically react on your bike if you
come close to it you can put it
everywhere you can put it in your pocket
in your back
or in your speedo or wherever you like
it would be super great fabulous in
saying awesome if you could support us
in our crowdfunding thanks a lot thanks
our company began about seven years ago
is a hobby built out of frustration for
the available lighting systems on the
market none of them were LED at the time
it's gone from a hobby to a part-time
business and now a full time endeavor
the purpose of this Kickstarter project
is to increase our manufacturing
capacity so that we can achieve
economies of scale and get this product
into your hands so that you can enjoy it
as much as we do so notice that actually
follows the contour of the helmet
keeping it less than three quarters
event
off your helmet that's important
whenever you're going through obstacles
trees rocks roots branches if something
hits the light it snaps right over the
light you keep going for a lot of
experience 24-hour racers or night
racers or even those is just right at
night one of the biggest criticisms is
your helmet moves on your head backwards
and forwards as the light ships because
of the weight of it or the high profile
trail LED lights they don't have a high
profile the weight is centered and using
their own ring retention system it stays
in place my helmet does not move and as
a 24-hour racer that is a huge
opportunity for me to do better when I
have to worry less about my equipment
that leads us to our second point our
direct mounting system you'll notice
that there's no additional features to
mount to light that means that there's
no additional weight and there's nothing
else to break so what this does is gives
a nice secure mount to the lighting
system but whenever you need to adjust
it you simply pick up and move the light
forward or backwards to get slight
adjustment a very simple but effective
lighting mounting system teasing each
pin has a mounting point so that it
doesn't matter what helmets you're
running you can pick between any helmets
you've got we've tested over a hundred
different elements and it works on all
of them you can choose the fins that
work for you and the bands that work for
you so that it fits on your helmet
properly a lot of light companies have
their buttons integrated in the light
where you can't feel them we make ours
big on purp
when you're riding with gloves riding in
wintertime just riding in general you
don't want to be feeling around for a
button you want a nice simple click so
when you've got a trail LED light on
your helmet simply reach up and hit the
button go from low to high do battery
management and get upwards of three and
a half four hours of runtime simply by
pressing a button on your helmet not
having to worry about where it's at if
you hit it or not and what gloves you're
wearing finally we've got our battery
pack it's square looks like a lot of
other battery packs we've done a couple
of things with it first off it's got a
slight rubberized coating on it so when
it's sitting in your shirt pocket mainly
can fit in a hydration pack as well when
you sweat it actually sticks just a
little bit so that it's not moving
around on you so is it as you sweat it
actually sits tighter against your back
no rubbing no discomfort
again you forget about the battery pack
just like you forget up like second
thing of our battery pack is the
connector most lighting systems have a
simple plug in plug out connector so
what happens whenever you're right along
the trail it wiggles loose or you hit a
tree branch it pulls out then you're
left riding with no lightning we've
added a simple improvement to that so
that you don't have to worry about that
it's a simple border twist lock this is
now sealed to light so it's weather
tight so if you rain snow sleet mud
falling into a creek we've never done
that the light stays attached we are
looking for an issue around the funding
of twenty thousand dollars your
investment will be
the following tanks will be used for
improvement of our us-based
manufacturing capabilities and capacity
second for ongoing feature product
development and enhancement and finally
it will allow us to release this product
to the market sisters I'm for namely
off-road cycling motorcycles and ATVs
and in order to do that we've got some
great rewards for you from our awesome
trail LED t-shirt all the way up to a
custom hand-built personalized tailor
lighting system with your generous
contribution you can help us
revolutionize the night writing
experience for everyone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
