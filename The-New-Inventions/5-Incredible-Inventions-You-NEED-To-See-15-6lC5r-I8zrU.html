first thought of providing a way for
people to appreciate unlimited art at
home we knew we had to create art
ourselves we knew we needed an
intelligent solution for the power cord
to hide unsightly cables and plugs so we
found a way for a canvas to
automatically and quietly charge itself
at night or when you are away we then
worked to build a frame that could
easily be customized blind into and
highlight any homestake or you can even
control multiple frames at once and
further expand your decorating potential

effortless even second nature you are a
canvas should amplify the current mood

wheels slid on a sheet of ice and I
crashed a trusty mug and my hot coffee
hit the ground and the plastic handle
busted in a million pieces I did what
any other person would do I brought my
broken mug into the bike shop scrambled
around the parts bin and pulled out a
youth brake lever and attached it voila
coffee break was born a customers
started noticing it and they were
intrigued by it and asked me where I got
it and I told him hey I made it you know
right here I made 20 mugs and they sold
within the week I made 70 more and no
sold out too fast forward a few years

mugs and they sold all around the world
