hi I'm David I want to introduce you to
this bro the word first known electrical
wife amplifier with sous Pro you can
easily double and even triple your Wi-Fi
range it also maximize your Wi-Fi
quality just by mounting it on your
router antenna sous pro focuses the
Wi-Fi frequency to 180 degrees instead
of 360 degrees most Wi-Fi routers
nowadays have two or even more antennas
so when installing Zeus pro you still
can get 360 degrees Wi-Fi connection but
now with three times the range and
that's not all it could be your old
neighbor surfing on your Wi-Fi
five few dates but it can be an unwanted
guest Wi-Fi is highly easily hackable by
turning Zeus pro and aim it to your
private area you can secure your
wireless network from unwanted guests
Zeus Pro also increases your Wi-Fi
connection speed by reducing
interferences that block the Wi-Fi
signal and for the gamers between us it
reduces lights and disconnections elf
Emmet is an active non-invasive wearable
technology that helps us face the
challenges of our stressful lives

with so many things going on it's hard
to keep a clear and focused mind so you
can effectively learn out Emmett will
help you focus and concentrate when you
need to
most people have struggled with
sleepless nights all the stress of the
day just keeps you from resting Belle
femme it will calm you down and rock you
into a deep sleep elf Emmett works in
synergy with the natural rhythm of your
mind and body waves when you're active
and focused your brain frequency is high
when you're resting it slows down
however because of our busy lifestyle
our brain waves aren't always in tune
with what we need elf Emmett uses pulsed
electromagnetic technology to
non-invasively synchronize your mind
with the frequency of what you want to
do learn and concentrate while feeling
stressed
improve the quality of your sleep stay
awake when feeling tired relax after a
hard day we designed the technology
around a beautiful light headband that
is powered by your smartphone or tablet
and operated with a simple application
people have always used extremely low
frequencies to achieve altered states of
consciousness just think of meditating
to the rhythmic sound of drums gong
therapy or the steady flashing light of
a fire things that take us into a state
of thoughtfulness
even when the sound of crane is
different rhythms and music
they all have an effect on us we always
adapt to an external frequency our
entire biological system the brain and
the earth itself work at the same
frequencies mr. Nikola Tesla once said
that if we can influence those
frequencies electronically we can
directly stimulate the entire body and
mental system of humankind elf Emmet
uses the same power source as your
headphones to generate a weak
electromagnetic pulse between two coils
to demonstrate we can connect the coils
to a speaker and actually hear the
frequency that the application transmits
its music you can't hear the cerebellum
is the part of our brains that links the
brain and the heart depending on our
situation it suggests our performance
rhythm this is the spot that says slow
down there's no danger relax or it says
hurry up we have work to do concentrate
elf Emmet works directly on the
cerebellum and can influence the whole
system it tells both the brainwaves and
heartbeat to speed up or slow down
