information to us in a way that is
completely different
as an eyewear the solos is absolutely
revolutionary
I know a lot of cyclists get really into
that gear and into that technology and
how to improve and this is definitely a
tool to use to help you improve
we've an honor to be working with USA
Cycling for over a year now developing
this product there's no other competitor
out there that it started working with
Olympic team international team from the
ground up what do the top level athletes
what are they looking for what's
comfortable it's even before we had
anything even for the outlets to grab
and look at and I think that the project
is turned out to check all those boxes
and even be better than expectations the
question that they asked was what do you
want in order to win us gold her USA in
Rio the mission of solos is to really
empower the athlete with the critical
data that they need to perform at their
peak and this is accomplished through
state-of-the-art heads-up display and
audio technologies that will enable the
athlete to have access in real time to
the data that they're actually tracking
with our team as we prepare for Rio the
solos is getting feedback to the riders
instantaneously it's cool to have a dual
purpose like sunglasses and a pound me
to all in one you see it immediately
write that as you're riding along and
can hear it through the earpiece and
have anything you want on there your
speed of time anything you'd think it
looks really small but it's actually
quite a large display so it's like this
entire upper right quadrant but if you
just like look beyond it you don't even
notice it souls is perfect for the
casual commuter or the weekend warrior
now you don't have to worry about
dropping your phone or looking down at
your bike computer screen because our
virtual display is three times larger
than your typical by computer you want
something that that has that technology
and conveys that information but also it
needs to be a cool pair of sunglasses
too for myself the biggest thing i think
is safety you can fold a turn by turn
directions or talk on the phone
hands-free and for the hardcore cyclist
or triathlete you will never have to
leave the air position because all the
data that you need is right there in
front of your eyes it goes along with an
app that's really easy to set up and and
super easy to use with our app you use
that to connect to the headset over
Bluetooth and then you compare it to all
of the sensors you already have heart
rate speed cadence power all of that can
easily connect to the inn
and push things up to strava we already
have a GPS on the phone and you're good
to go with the solos you have the
ability to change the focus in place
that exactly where you want to see that
information for the solos you know it's
like they weigh nothing especially
compared to the other options out there
and what's so cool about these classes I
mean you can change the lenses it's
super awesome there's very very few
companies out there that can say that
they've actually paid the price that
they're on the ground with the athletes
that that they're doing everything
possible and following this journey with
the athletes you know for both the ups
and the downs and I think that's
ultimately why we've had such a
fantastic product come out of that
journey today you can be one of the
first people in the world to purchase
the solace for yourself on Kickstarter
souls will help you improve the
performance of your ride train smarter
and safer we are providing an exclusive
special pricing to you with all the
features and functionality that have
come to make solos a best-in-class
product whether you're having fun in
your cycling club or your USA Olympian

it will change the way you ride have
everybody by these if I could because
they're just they're amazing solos has
helped awesome team USA in so many ways
so help us by helping them

have you ever thought about how much
energy lies around you in a forest in
the woods and all the ways you can find
do you ever wish you could use the
energy instead of carrying uncomfortable
gas tanks or find AG not a bonfire
there's definitely charming but there's
also smoky and dangerous now you can
stop dreaming about it because we made
it real thank you still wild is a
revolutionary camp stove which could run
with any kind of dry biomass I'll needed
some branches small battery or even a
solar panel what makes all the magic
possible it's a well-known technology
named pyrolysis but unlike traditional
pyrolytic stoves we found a way to make
the process simple stable smoke free and
totally awesome take a traditional fire
it burns strongly but it wastes a lot of
energy and smoke while smoke itself has
a lot of energy what we do is transform
all the biomass into energy this way you
get a clean and reliable flame wherever
you want and for free yes free energy
I'm talking about a powerful and
professional flame you can use to cook
for real and grill as a pro do you know
which is the best part of all this using
your stove you're not only saving the
environment all the waste produced by
the gas tanks or the production of
charcoal you're also avoiding the
production of any pollution responsible
for the greenhouse effect the wait
there's more what remains inside your
stove when the fire is gone is a
wonderful biochar an incredible active
charcoal that makes the ground better
and more fertile we designed our stove
to be the best companion of your outdoor
adventure it is minimal this compact and
all the design features are strictly
linked to its operation we made it in
two sizes to let you choose between
portability and personal use or base
camp and a lot of power everything is
made in Italy using the best materials
to create a product that is really gonna
last forever thank you stole Wild has
been made to let you live your
adventures with a deeper contact with
nature environment is our greatest
treasure and taken care of it is no
longer a privilege or important duty

part in saving our planet by taking no
compromises

than four years to design a product
which let us live upgrade and put
properly as it is you know that we care
a lot about how to cook yet our
patent-pending technology reduces our
dependency on fossil fuels and our
impact upon the plan we need your
contribution to optimize our production
line to share the artists of Technology
worldwide with you and thanks to your
heart even with developing countries we
are thank you still thank you for your
attention if you've ever felt the
stuffiness of sinus congestion you know

act of breathing can be a challenge
whether it's allergies a cold or the flu
congestion leaves you dehydrated tired

limit the max temperature to 140 degrees
Fahrenheit to ensure that the mask never
overheats if you ever fall asleep with

four years ago I suffered a major stroke
due to birth defects
I'm Jason Harrelson inventor of momentum
you may think of momentum as a physics
toy or a gyroscope or even a spinning
top
this left me in the hospital with no
memory of my previous life I had to
relearn how to walk talk read write draw
design new things and events program my
machines work with my hands you name it
I even had to relearn how to play
trumpet and I build trumpets for a
living what I realized when I get out of
the hospital was that I was surrounded
with a great network of friends and
family and clients who helped me pick up
the pieces and start again they gave me
the momentum to continue on the physics
of momentum are the universal principles
of life find your balance reduce drag
and gain momentum
