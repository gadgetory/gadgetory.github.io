helvis ticks always had potential to be
a lot of fun growing up but the
technology just wasn't good enough to
let us do what we really wanted back in
1997 we set out to turn pogo sticks into
a whole new sport our concept was based
on the idea of having a portable
trampoline something you can jump three
six or even ten feet high on but also
take any where you want to go the v4 is
the portable trampoline we'd always
dreamed up with the v4 you have the
ability to add or remove air and
completely change the stiffness of the
ballot someone who weighs 300 pounds can
jump on the same exact v4 with someone
who only weighs 80 times all you need to
do is change the air pressure in less
than a minute
you can perfectly tune the v4 to each
riders preferences pumping more air in
to jump higher and taking air out to
jump lower this makes sharing it with
friends and family a fun-filled
experience that everyone can enjoy
you can also collapse the v4 to make
transportation a breeze whether you're a
pro or just stepping onto the v4 for the
very first time you'll love the wait
list flight like experience you'll get
the basics in minute and from that point
on there's no limit to how far you can
challenge yourself with the v4 you'll be
able to jump up onto ledges down stairs
and over gaps of all sizes while mailing
down some pretty awesome trips after
playing around on the v4 you'll never
look at your surroundings in the same
way again obstacles and features that
are too high for bikes and skateboards
are perfect for the v4 for those of you
looking for a fun way to stay in shape
the b4 willwerth most of them muscle
groups in your body and get your heart
pounding immediately it's a killer
cardio workout and the best part is that
while you're having fun bouncing around
you won't even realize how quickly you
build a sweat in order to achieve
superior build quality and maintain the
high tolerance is necessary for the v4
to work we manufacture and assemble it
right here in our Southern California
shop we work closely with our suppliers
to become a part of the build process
and as each component is made or right
there to test them this streamlines are
manufacturing and ensures that every v4
we make is up to our standards
if you're looking for the portable
trampoline that we always dreamed of
c4 is going to knock your socks off
whether you want to use it simply for
exercise or to jump eight feet high and
do crazy tricks on is up to you and we
know you'll love every second of it

learn more at Raji Oh calm my name is
scott boggy and i'm the inventor of the
goateesaver i wanted to do a
demonstration video for you today to
show you how guys around the world are
using the product to make their goatee
or VanDyke look even better i wanted to
first take and show you how to adjust
the goateesaver
to make it fit your size and your style
of goatee as you can see on the front of
the goateesaver there are three
different adjustments that you can take
and make there is an adjustment that you
can make for the top part closer to your
to the top part of your face and then
there's a middle adjustment that you can
make which will be closer to your mouth
or the bottom this will allow you to be
able to get the size and style of goatee
that you would like to have before I
actually shave with the goateesaver I
also wanted to show you that there's an
adjustment on the back for the
mouthpiece I will tell you that most
people will need to use the mouthpiece
in the default position but you can take
and twist and move the mouthpiece up
higher if you wanted to adjust it on a
different part of your face before you
take and shave with a goatee saver it's
important to use a trimmer to get your
goatee or VanDyke to the links that you
want to have it before shaving with the
goateesaver
on the top of the goateesaver there is a
place that will allow you to line the
product up with the center of your nose
that way you know that the goateesaver
is straight on your face once you have
the goateesaver placed on your face
and you begin to shave it isn't very
important not to move the goateesaver
until you're finished shaving after I
get through shaving with the goateesaver
I'll remove it and then take the
straight edge of the razor and use it to
shave right underneath my nose when you
shave with the goateesaver
one of the things that you'll notice is
there is still about an eighth of an
inch of hair that will stick out beyond
the goateesaver if you look at the
bottom of the razor you can see that the
reason this is the case is because how
the razor was designed there's about an
eighth of an inch between the edge of
the razor and the razor</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
