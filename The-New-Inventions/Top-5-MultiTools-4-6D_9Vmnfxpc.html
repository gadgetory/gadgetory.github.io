son Nathan I've been a engineer and
designer and inventor for about 14 years
now and I've designed a lot of knives
and multi tools that you might be
familiar with I came up with the idea
for the clacks last year over the last
six months I've been designing
developing prototyping and testing out
the clocks to end up with the floor
versions that we have here today the
clacks is more than an axe the clacks is
a multi-tool built into the head of an
axe it has a lot of useful features
carabiner thumb jimping this is the
bottle opener the axe blade the scraper
lanyard hole the hammer with a built-in
ruler five wrench sizes and a hex bit
driver the clacks has a lot of useful
features like wrenches hammer head and
scraper along with our innovative new
clamping system that allows you to take
the axe to the field and be able to
break it down for easy transport
relax is useful for people who are
involved in hiking climbing camping
survival experts people who do bushcraft
all sorts of things including emergency
preparedness I'm Mike peel for Mike Pihl
logging Vernonia Oregon and I'm a logger
the clacks it's a great tool this
morning I used it to wedge over a
Douglas fir tree and it did a good job
this is a clacks lumberjack it's our
most popular model because it includes
all of the features this is the clacks
woodsman the clacks woodsman has the
clamping system carabiner hammer the axe
blade but the more rustic version that
we've created is called the clacks
feller the clacks feller attaches using
the paracord bracelet by pulling the
paracord out and wrapping it around the
handle like you would a tomahawk this is
the tie clacks the tie clacks is a
titanium version of the clocks
lumberjack it is our top of the line
model and it includes all of the
features plus it has blue anodized
highlights and it comes weighing in at
half of the weight of the feller that's
why the tie clacks is our top of the
line model we've backed to dozen
projects on our own already we're
reaching out to you the Kickstarter
community to see if you'll help us by
backing us to get the clacks out there
thanks for watching we appreciate your
support kolaks
more than an axe hi i'm mike scully
creator of the lever gear tool card I
founded lever gear to design products
that solve real problems look great and
will last forever we all have little
projects that pop up in life and they
don't always happen when our tools are
handy it's annoying to have to spend
time chasing down tools for a job that
should take 10 seconds if you're like me
it usually ends up getting added to your
to-do list that's why we created the
lever gear tool card
it's a multi-tool the size of a credit
card that has 40 different tools it's
always with you so you can get things
done I like to be prepared to handle any
task but I also hate the idea of
carrying around a lot of extra stuff a
credit card size tool that could
disappear in my wallet seemed like the
perfect solution we developed the tool
card with a simple premise the real
estate in your pocket is precious so you
should own stuff that's actually worth
carrying we began our design process by
brainstorming all of the functions we
could pack into a credit card sized
multi-tool we also tested every card
that existed on the market we thought a
lot about the design and layout of the
tool card by nesting the tools we are
able to add tools and reduce weight
without sacrificing strength we kept the
edges smooth so it feels great in your
hand when you're using the tools we
chose not to have an exposed blade so
the tool card is TSA compliant and it
won't damage your wallet instead we
added a blade protected by the can
opener so you can cut cords but not your
fingers the tool card weighs only 1
ounces slips easily into your wallet so
you won't notice it until you need it
or ditch the wallet altogether the
innovative money clip is designed to
snap on with a click and disassemble
with ease no extra tools required
no fasteners to lose so you can quickly
switch from wallet card to money clip
tool card is made in America from blade
quality 420 stainless steel which is
then heat treated for excellent strength
and hardness
it's then bead blasted for a
professional finish and laser etched for
rich permanent graphics
the tool card makes an awesome gift that
will last a lifetime and it's scheduled
to ship before Father's Day and
graduation we've put in a lot of time to
make this tool as good as it can be
please help us by supporting our
campaign and sharing it with your
friends thank you
picture this you wake up a 5mm 509 hurry
up get up get your gear can go road trip
two hours later you're off the road and
on the trail towards the secret spot
bring out the shovels build a jump a
perfect jump make it bigger land all
your tricks best day ever
don't you hate when you have problems to
the gear on the mountain I know we do
hello Kickstarter I'm Alex and I'm Nate
and this is our solution
and here he percent you the hex Lex
multi-tool check it out
and here's why we need you Kickstarter
to liam manufacturing costs our biggest
obstacle that's why we've set a goal to
raise $10,000 thanks for taking the time
to watch our video don't forget to share
with friends and family
