when you're away it's easier to live in
the moment knowing that everything is
okay at home but if you had the power to
always know for sure butterfly is a leap
forward for the connected home it's more
than a next-generation security camera
it's a whole new way to experience and
interact with your home inside butterfly
is a technology to know what's going on
around it but at the heart of butterfly
is something unlike any other home
security a powerful computer then learns
and makes decisions based on what it
sees and hears that way it only record
when there's something going on that you
need to see it can learn a unique rhythm
of your home and realize when something
is out of the ordinary it can also
detect familiar faces and tell the
difference between humans and pets
but if I becomes an extension of able to
know what's normal and what's not that
way you only get alerts but it really
matters
with the top of a finger will instantly
in two places at once the butterfly app
is a portal into your home when you're
away and sorts the moments into an
interactive timeline that's like a
curated newsfeed of what you missed when
you were gone but if I was designed to
look like a natural and elegant part of
your home and it's wire-free so it can
be placed where you need it instead of
where your power outlets are traditional
home security systems are just not
practical they're expensive complicated
to set up and difficult to use so we
reimagine what a security camera could
be and then set out to make it our team
has been developing butterfly for the
past two years building a powerful
device that's reliable and easy to use
right out of the box when they're using
it to protect your family pets or
property but if like keeps you in touch
and helps keep them safe we're excited
to share this new technology with you
join us in bringing simple home security
everyone be one of the first to
experience butterfly and a whole new way
of connecting with your home and loved
ones</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
