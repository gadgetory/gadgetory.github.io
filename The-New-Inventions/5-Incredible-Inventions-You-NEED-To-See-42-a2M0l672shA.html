creator of snap stick the next
breakthrough in the evolution of the
selfie snap stick is a beautifully
designed cell phone case and selfie
stick in one it's the ideal solution for
people that love to get that perfect
shot but don't want to carry around
extra mounts cases or bulky sticks
simply take your snap stick cover mobile
device out of your pocket or bag extend
the patented telescoping stick to
capture your perfect photo or video and
quickly and easily retract the stick
back into place and go on your way the
first snap stick case is designed for
the iPhone 6 and samsung galaxy s6 the
stick on the case can be extended up to
11 inches and pivots both vertically and
horizontally this allows you to get the
best angle in either portrait mode or
landscape mode unlike traditional selfie
sticks snap stick has a stylish and slim
design and can be properly stored away
while remaining easily accessible to use
at the appropriate time and with the
snap stick case you'll still have easy
access to all of your phone's ports
microphones speaker and controls
with the Bluetooth enabled button on
your snap stick case you'll be able to
control the shutter of your mobile
device to capture your photos and videos
quickly and easily using your device's
front or rear camera this button also
powers on your snap stick and the device
will automatically power off after 30
seconds if not used we have teamed up
with incredible mechanical and
electrical engineers to ensure that snap
stick is both fully functional and
sturdy

stick is fully engineered the molds have
been created and we're ready to bring
snap stick to market for everyone to
enjoy and that's where you come in with

stick into the production stage and as a
Kickstarter backer you will be among the
first group of people to receive your

card-sized foldable smartphone and
tablet stand out of prototype and into
production bringing to the market
aluminium laminate folds into the
perfect stoned machine at the old flat
base back in your
no these people are more than more
mobile device so whilst developing
standard easy option we look to create a
convenient lightweight stamp that would
work for a wide variety of tablets and
smartphones in both landscape people say
that the best camera is the one that's
in your pocket we believe the same is
true for your phone or tablet start with
improvements in technology our data is
increasingly being leaked to
advertisement agencies third-party data
collectors and monitored by agencies all
in the name of national security
ranging from phone logs personal IDs
contacts SMS and location tracking our
data is increasingly being stored on the
servers of unknown companies with no way
to know who will access them
third party apps on platforms such as
Android give us daily headaches
requesting more and more ridiculous
permissions with each update claiming to
enhance user experience
all the while containing hidden security
flaws and violating your privacy there
are a few apps available which claim to
keep your data secure from third-party
software and even fewer secure phones or
other solutions available plus how can a
private phone manufacturer ever claim to
be private when it ships with the Google
Apps suite package infamous for being
the most notorious spying apps package
on the markets apps may not be foolproof
because they cannot stop system
processes that come with the phone from
operating remotely in the background
welcome to Yuna OS welcome to our world
we are team of mobile development
professionals with a passion the
security freedom and we believe in the
human rights of privacy we are very
proud to present to you the UNIFEM an
Android smartphone revamped with
security and with privacy measures
operating on a whole new level securing
all data that leaves your phone with
strong encryption securing calls chats
text emails our secure installation
block prevents man-in-the-middle attacks
also known as hacking and OSA blocks
third-party app installations
we developed the uniform in line with
our beliefs so that a secure smartphone
could be reality for everyone who wants
it
finally a phone that won't lie spy or
cheat on you you can afford to lose your
mobile games not your personal data to
avoid unauthorized intrusions into your
security or privacy you must separate
work and play Yuna phone is designed to
suit your communication needs such as
emails text messages or voice calls not
your gaming these oh excuse me
