Treadway and I am CTO and co-founder at
Acton accident is a company that designs
and manufactures personal transportation
we are introducing a longboard the likes
of which the world has never seen
carbon fiber pressure cast aluminum
extruded aluminum can see cut we are
using 4 hub motors all wheel drive
people all wheel drive the ones that
will get you up most of the details in
America and around the world
but wait there's more
if you're looking for something a little
more affordable we got you we have two
more models what we call the blink F and
the blink s - it's a different
construction than the Quattro it's made
of wood but it has an aluminum extrusion
on the bottom and the lumen emplace on
top to kind of sandwich the batteries
inside of the desk so there's actually a
hole that goes clear through it the s2
version of this board is a little bit
longer than the end and that's because
it has the extra motor it goes a little
faster and just needs to be a little
longer for more stability so you get to
choose from three boards you get the
Quattro or The Bling guest for the blink
now we're releasing three products at
the same time here so of course this is
why we're on IndieGoGo but we have
finished the development on these and we
have of course factory minimums that we
need to meet and that's why we're here
and that's why we need your help help us
out and get yourself onto an action
board and glide uphill into the future
of personal transportation thanks
how much freedom can you fit in a bag
the freedom of knowledge the freedom
share freedom to dream freedom of
movement now it fits with linky
mobility is free with linking strong
magnets bowling mechanism that's freedom
in your bag
it's a last mile mobility solution that
means no more traffic no more bus
timetables no more foolish
linkie is the first portable electric
skateboard the team behind linky wants
to improve the way we experience cities
wherever we were in the world we found
ourselves wanting a mode of
transportation that is eco sustainable
easy to carry around and really fun to
ride we've applied our technical
engineering and sales backgrounds to
fill a gap in the market nothing out
there is truly portable is that why we
need linkie to fit in a bag
we are ready to go into production but
we need a minimum number of orders to
make this possible your support right
now we let's keep goats down so we can
guarantee a great level of service and a
truly exciting electric longboard
with a first production across world off
the assembly line and we took them for
right and our favorite s rock
so like freedom was given back to us and
our feet we felt like a dream come true
we came out with the idea of the odd
voice the goal are giving freedom back
to the people who are stucked
and we did waiting for the bus the train
or in a car call it a traffic jam
we wanted to help you people go faster
further and faster
hi confessor meet a devotee and today we
are excited to be back on Kickstarter to
share with you a brand new
high-performance electricity for you
want one be a killer on the one to one
another on is the world first your
cupboard light with performance electric
skateboard and we represent a perfect
balance between with complex and agility
the 30 inch pure carbon fiber deck
provides a great riding experience
providing a stable comfortable ride but
you give you the greatest thrill when
you need it just over four kilogram the
other one is the lightest electric
skateboard in its class we have not
sacrificed on the performance of the r11
as well you can take you up to 25
kilometers per hour and a range of 1800
meters so that you know you can go far
and go back thanks to the Kickstarter
community we are now in production and
for putting all those Volvo's locally as
we have repairing the outboard point the
national shipping we've had opportunity
who won't be fried and his team at
one-to-one people hi I'm Ryan alia
founder of 121 3 we make the world's
finest carbon fiber skateboard right
here in our Southern California factory
121 see up cycle carbon fiber scrap from
the Southern California area
this means we rescues valuable material
from the landfill and turn it into
Austin product
recently hung me from heart reach out to
us with a few idea of building an
electric skateboard around our a long
day after a little bit of back and forth
design work we developed a customized
cut for the area on deck that
accommodates the arc for dressing the
result is it really true looking
electric board it our plants produce
this thing for this pixel we're very
excited about the potential of the art
product and wish them the best of the
Kickstarter campaign I can't wait to get
my hands on one of these boards in the
dumb idea what is hand you buy the pink
in our mobile shop here in Singapore we
really attack every unbought that comes
off as a beeline to maintain the high
production quality we want for customer

people and as for me we have photo

journey again to do you believe the
electric embodying can be more than just
an extremely hobby and that it can
