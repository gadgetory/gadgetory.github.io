where you go in the world there's always
a bike waiting for you the idea for air
donkey grew from a dream of a world
where commuters tourists and also people
just enjoying the city choose the bike
before the car hello my name is Arden
and I'm Alexander we are from air donkey
to make the dream come true we sat down
and developed an ecosystem that we felt
could motivate people to use the bicycle
as a main means of transportation the
Airbnb model for bicycles the air donkey
air donkey is not just a product we
bring together the simplicity of uber
the sharing economy the air B&amp;amp;B and the
benefits of a bicycle the idea is if you
have a bike that you're not using share
it all you need to do is sign up to get
a donkey kit you can now turn your spare
bike into a cheap to rent mean of
transportation that anyone with a donkey
app can locate and rent the donkey lark
is easy to mount and is completely theft
rain and possible you can recharge the
battery with a USB cable and will last
for about a year attach the instruction
panel to the handlebar
to provide an easy-to-use guide for the
system
you can also play Stein through public
stickers on your bike frame and it will
be easy to locate for any user that's it
your donkey is ready to roll
for bike owners the system gives you the
chance to earn money on having a spare
bike while sharing the good values of
biking you can set your own rental price
and define the zone where the user
should drop off the bike if you need
additional security you can use a leash
or a chain to lock your bike to
something if you want to use your bike
privately
instead of renting it out you just turn
off the rental function in the app and
the bunkie lock works as a regular lock
you could also get a few donkey locks
and run it as a part-time business for
bike users you will never be without a
bike again when going abroad you can
locate and book a donkey in advance you
can also check up on bikes individual
features like a baby seat or a cargo box
the app makes it easy to find a donkey
and it enables you to pay and unlock
within seconds the only need internet
connection for booking and payment but
the donkey lock works offline every year
hundreds of millions of people travel
the world and visit new cities just
imagine all of them on a bike in January
we launched the first donkeys on the
streets of Copenhagen in our system is
reliable we already have more than
10,000 trips and 500 users and this
summer we released over 150 of our own
original donkeys on the streets now it's
time to make donkeys available
everywhere both for bike owners and for
users with your support we'll be able to
improve the software with additional
features and gear up our production so
we can release donkeys all over the
world thank you so much for your time
and support
v-line cycling device that will change
the way you think about city navigation
and putting the fun and adventure back
into your ride with beeline simply click
a destination and you're good to go the
device shows you the distance in the
directions ahead in the rest is up to
you know turn left turn right no route
you choose your turns based on the
direction of the arrow you're quite used
to being told go this way go that way
goodness we go that way and you actually
don't enjoy the journey you're just
trying to get to where you're going
whereas I think when you just know the
bearing and you're just cycling you
actually think oh that grows more
interesting I'm gonna go down here or I
fancy weaving through these roads it
just makes it a bit more relaxing but
more than adventure so I like the fact
that you're sort of involved in the
navigation you're actually trying to
allowing you the route you're taking
exactly with the VLAN area and when you
get that sub spot on it's actually quite
fun you never feel like you missed a
turn if it's dangerous you don't have to
take that turn just takes the stress out
situation having lived in London for
four years I was very fixed on stat
routes in an hour
beeline has opened up the city for me
let me discover new areas in your past I
wouldn't use before this morning and you
will once you come over London Bridge I
like the fact that I can add that as a
waypoint on yeah this didn't even start
an idea for products we're just getting
lost and for which sticks and compasses
on our bikes to help that then we call
cremate that better obviously this
compass idea is a little bit different
to conventional navigation so we weren't
sure if it would work
we made an app to test that and we were
just like whoa this is way better than
we're doing with me we thought we might
get stuck down little streets or
whatever just didn't happen everywhere
we went it just seamlessly got you
through there in a really nice fun way
where you're exploring the city we had
this idea about a year ago and since
then we've brought into the team all the
expertise that we've needed to get
beeline to where it is today we made
beeline visible under any conditions by
giving Annie page screen and the back
line its shockproof its rain proof and
that a normal usage is that she lost
around four weeks the next step is to go
into full production and that's why
we're there on Kickstarter so if I cuss
you want for the fun back into your ride
base today to get your be life with you
out we're going beeline to the masses
thank you very much
I'm mark he stopped oh yes I lost it we
may be like
at relight we are designing the future
of bike lights we will change your
perception of how modern bike lights
perform function and appear we bridge
energy-saving innovation with
performance driven design to create the
perfect long-lasting powerful and
beautiful bike lights
relight have years of experience with
bike lights and technical innovation in
collaboration with renowned design
studio kilo we bring you neo
where high performance meets
forward-thinking design battery free neo
six neodymium magnets are powered by
magnetic fields generated by the
rotating aluminum rim on your bike
when driving two high-powered LEDs light
up the road
when stopping the backup systems
low-power LEDs keep you safe from
traffic
this advanced friction-free technology
is wrapped in a bold design enabling
easy mount and adjustment
we are ready to bring this iconic new
typology to market securing your future
visibility on wheels
you only need one more light neo
cycling through the city is an amazing
experience but there's one problem that
all cyclists share and that is
navigation we are very active cyclists
ourselves and we've often experienced
how using your phone while cycling is
both awkward and sometimes even
dangerous and having headphones in your
ears telling you where to go just makes
you lose some of the sense of freedom
that cycling normally gives that is how
the idea of Heisei was born we wanted to
create a simple affordable and easy to
use product that will help find your way
through the city high scores like a
magic compass but instead of pointing
north it points to your final
destination in that way you are free to
choose your own routes for the citizens
just open the app set your location and
attach Heiser to your bike the leds of
the outer circle show you the direction
and the central LED indicates the
distance to your goal so now you can
find your own way through the city
without being in danger of getting lost
and who knows what amazing places and
experiences you can find by not choosing
the route most travel
Heisey is made out of machined aluminum
making it sturdy and waterproof and when
you're not using the device you can
simply hide the rubber band within the
device and put it in your pocket that
way you can always bring it with you be
it to find that new restaurant after
work or to discover when cycling abroad
if you have a day where you feel more
like sticking to the Main Roads highs of
course also offers turn-by-turn
navigation we haven't spent the last
year developing the simplest possible
product to find your way through the
city and now we're very happy to have a
working prototype and we need your help
to develop the first production brand so
please support our campaign and make
sure you will be one of the first owners
of this magical compass that will change
the way you navigate the city forever
imagine a brighter world for cyclists
where intelligent lights adapt to
command attention when you need it most
I'm Philip Alamo bike commuter and
engineer I've spent years cycling to
work on busy Singapore roads
my dream is to create a light that helps
you be seen
that's why I've spent the last two years
working with hundreds of cyclists like
you to design build and perfect a
revolutionary responsive cycle item
you've helped me create C sense the
first cycle light that could respond to
your situation it adapts to every ride
flashing brighter and faster when you
need it most C sense helps make you more
visible it uses advanced sensor
technology to monitor you the bicycle
and your environment in situations where
it's important to be seen like a road
junction or filtering and traffic it
flashes vividly to help people see you
it also reacts to approaching car
headlights and too badly lit areas this
intelligence lets see sense use its
power efficiently so it doesn't need a
large external battery pack making it
compact and convenient it brings you
performance and runtime in a tiny
package you asked for simplicity and
elegance so C sense is controlled
through movement it has a fuel gauge so
you can see your remaining runtime and
you can recharge it from any USB socket
C sense is weatherproof
and its mind is easy to use dependable
and really strong and of course it's
bright really bright it's highly visible
even against other traffic lights and
even in daytime just like a good light
should be help us fill up to make one of
these tiny intelligent powerful lights
for everyone with your help we can
create a brighter world for cyclists
get a light with road sense
