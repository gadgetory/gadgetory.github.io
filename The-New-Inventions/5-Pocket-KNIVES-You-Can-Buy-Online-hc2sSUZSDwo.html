this was that's perfect okay hi I'm
Robert Young Pelton and I'm the owner of
DPX gear DPX gear makes high quality
survival tools and knives we began back
in 2008 we began back in 2008 with the
addition we began we began back in 2008
with my original design which I called
the hostile environments survival tool
it was a very simple knife made out of
1090 spring steel
I was maiden Idaho and it did very well
and it still sells today it's called the
DPX hest original but one thing that's
eluded us is the ability to make a
all-american folding knife something
that's completely sourced manufactured
and of course supported in the US now
we've made a lot of folders like the DPX
hest F folder which are made in northern
Italy same place they make Ferraris and
other fine things I've always wanted to
make a knife that was uniquely and
totally American and also one that
lasted a very long time what I would
call an heirloom quality knife that can
be handed down generation to generation
so we put ourselves to work and we sat
down and we said okay what is the most
popular knife what is the most popular
application and what are the best
materials so we came up with the DPX
hest
backslash F urban now the urban is
designed for everyday carry in urban
environments that means it has a blade
under three inches but yet it's a very
stout thick blade
it also has solid titanium alloy frame
and it has pivot bearings a hex drive
wire stripper jimping and a glass
breaker it's also got a deep carry clip
and you carry it around all day long
that work out the bush whatever you want
in the last reason I know it last
because I warranty it for not just your
lifetime but the lifetime of anyone who
owns the knife that's part of DPX gears
commitment to customers so to recap
we're bringing this knife to you direct
and that means you're going to get the
best value we're going to make it in
America it's going to use all-american
materials it's going to be sold in
service by GPX gear which is an American
company and we want you to enjoy this
knife we want you to use it we don't
want it to be a safe clean you want you
to take it out there use it sharpen it
use it the blade quality is exceptional
it's s30v steel and once again all
american-made designed for high-end
knives pivot bearing is found usually in
very high-end or midtech knives the
quality of the titanium alloy is
aerospace quality which means it'll last
a lifetime developing beautiful patina
comes to you the heavy lead blast finish
which is a dark battleship gray color
and all the hardware like the screws in
the clip we're all made out of stainless
steel that means you've got a corrosion
free lifetime
so all you have to do is make sure you
get one because we're not making that
many and the beauty of doing it this way
the beauty of doing it this way is that
you are guaranteed of getting this knife
if you purchase one if you can't
purchase one that means you won't get
one as you know from other DPX gear
products our products move very quickly
and then of course we get around to
restocking and remaking them but we take
our time we make sure that all these
knives are built to the highest
specifications and we don't ever let our
customers down if you have any problems
about anything related to your DP X gear
project let us know and either will
repair it or replace it and that's my
promise to you
as someone who is tired of being treated
by other corporations who seem like it's
my fault because I wasn't happy with the
product so if you buy a product from us
we'll make sure that you're happy
hey I'm Nate bar creator of the pocket
monkey here today to tell you about my
latest creation wild card the pocket
knife needs to a halt it's an essential
tool but it's bulky it's one more thing
to remember in the morning and it easily
falls out your pocket and is lost I
wanted something better
I asked why not put a pocket knife in my
wallet it'd be easier to carry and
harder to lose so I set out to design a
knife that be as thin as possible and
the result is wild carry it's only two
millimeters thick
only slightly thicker than a credit card
I was able to do this by reimagining the
blade pivot most knives have a pin
pressed through a hole wildcard has a
pivot unlike anything in the world
I call it fly off technology the three
wings of the pivot allow the knife blade
to remain rigid to the body a necessity
when wielding a sharp tool for safety I
designed the blade to lock open and to
lock closed the blade tucks neatly under
two blade bugs and it angles only on one
side so users can't accidentally cut
themselves when carrying a closed knife
and here's the best part about this
design the blade is detachable I
designed this with the forgetful
traveler in mind when you go through TSA
with your traditional knife on you you
lose your knife but with wild card you
only lose your blade and on our website
you can replace it for only a few
dollars with pocket monkey I used a
monkey to represent the personality of
the tool with wild card I kept that
trend going wild card as a wolf cut out
that doubles as a bottle of the wolf and
body is the nature of the tool agile yet
powerful I wanted to pack as much
functionality as possible into wild card
many people misuse knives in place of
other tools like screwdrivers and pry
bars harming themselves of breaking the
knife so I added these tools to the
night I always wanted to challenge
convention because of that I spent the
last six months trying to reinvent how
this product is manufactured every
manufacturer I talked with was hesitant
to produce such an aggressive design the
solution I kept hearing was take this to
China but that isn't something I'm
willing to do I want to create products
that embody the American spirit of
innovation and my solution was to create
a manufacturing
in Maine now we control every aspect of
production from laser cutting to
packaging and shipping so we can
manufacture the highest quality product
while creating jobs in our community
help us make wild car to reality and
help us continue the American spirit of
innovation</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
