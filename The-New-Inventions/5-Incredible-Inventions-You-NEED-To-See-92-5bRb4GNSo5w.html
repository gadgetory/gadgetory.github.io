foldable origami canoe traditional
canoes are cumbersome and nearly
impossible to travel with in a small
vehicle we wanted to experience the joy
of canoeing wherever our travels take us

solution my canoe is practing carries to
any location easily without sacrificing

my canoe is easily assembled at any
location in 10 to 15 minutes every piece
in the kit is used in the bill just
really simple couple of clicks and it
was all done
it was important to us that my can you
not sacrifice um quality and durability
just to fit into a box
we tested my commute to exceed
professional standards
developing our whole from a proprietary
polypropylene with a UV treatment that
has been rated up to 20,000 sold
while ensuring quality it was important
to us to make sure that we kept the
experience true to traditional canoes

any other to know of ever paddle my
canoe has already come a long way we
just need your contributions to add
finishing touches and scale our
production to get my canoe into your

explore your world with my canoe many
golfers work very hard to improve the
driving distance and the hike but a lot
of people find it difficult to practice
and golf-links
indoors nevertheless they never give up
on the swing in fact some big
tournaments gold swinging trainers which
allows the display more places but
swinging training becomes boring after a
while people well they just give up on

with Michael wonderful device passion
golf is like human have enjoy go fight
home Fievel that's all you need
there the most convenient piece of
footwear we own we all have memories
wearing them out of the beach on
vacation out on the hot sunny day my
channel is not some of you unaware all
day because they're really bad for your
feet they're mass manufactured made for
no one in particular and they use the
cheapest materials they can find just to
get something you can put on and off the
ones that do offer some kind of support
really falls short because they're not
actually custom and we just said well we
can fix that
introducing the world's first custom fit
sandal captured from your smartphone
using a photo submitted through our app
our technology digitally mapped each
foot with over 200 points in the arch
the heel and the top of foot this data
is used to create a biomechanical
enhanced sandal that is truly custom to
your Anatomy in every way the leading
feature of the sandal is the custom arch
support leveraging 3d printing
technology every arch is completely
custom person-to-person left foot to
right foot one of the biggest complaints
of Santa wears is how annoying the toe
song is we've completely reinvented the
telephone construction making it ultra
durable and more comfortable and based
on the width of your foot we know where
to place the toe phone within 2
millimeters of accuracy one of the
things that helps us take advantage of
the custom arch support is the deep
contoured yoga use a triple density foam
and a really soft drop in the footbed
that helps contour the foot and absorb
heel strike another feature that makes
this sandal custom is the
interchangeable straps the ability to
adjust the strap position based on foot
volume helps ensure perfect fit every
time
the straps are also interchangeable to
fit your taste and personal style making
the same delay you can wear for any
occasion with celebrating what makes a
stand out easy and comfortable while
also factoring in sustainability we've
sourced a premium material that feels
great the moment you put it on and it's
100% closed-loop recyclable by 3d
printing and assembling in San Diego
California it allows us to reduce our
carbon footprint and deliver to your
doorstep faster we were done a variety
of studies with our customers also we
found a dramatic evidence that custom
makes a huge difference for running
economy a maximum pronation angles your
ankle stability and so on the science
we're going to the insole project is
being applied to the standard weave end
to end technology Zach represents
probably the biggest leap in Footwear in
the last 50 years we've got a software
system which can not only take foot
shape but it can also take their
preferences their size their shape we
mix that in with a system which allows
us to have conventionally manufactured
pieces that integrate with those 3d
printer parts to make it the best shoe
possibly one of the things I really
enjoyed about working with weave is the
bigger vision that they have for what
could wear can be they combine
technology 3d printing with solid
innovative design in an interactive way
that no other product on the market does
right now
it kicks our community's been great to
us we launched our first product at
custom 3d printed insole not knowing
what would happen and we became the most
funded 3d printed product ever people
love having the custom support in their
shoes but they can't get it with their
sandals the thing they wear all the time
and as we started to talk to more
customers we kept hearing a theme hey
can you make a custom flip-flop my
insoles are awesome oh so it was kind of
like okay it's a no-brainer we're going
to go to a sandal by having an entirely
unique product that ensures that your
body moves correctly loads itself
correctly we significantly reduce the
strains and presses that you put on your
body and that can prevent you from
incurring injuries in the future but it
can also improve your performance today
Kickstarter we're coming to today
because we need your help we spent the
last 15 months creating the sandal we
have material source and process is
defined and we need the funds to get
first units out to production like last
time we'll ship on schedule with the
first pair is arriving this summer we
believe this will be the best sandal
you'll ever wear
okay
