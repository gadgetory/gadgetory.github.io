years we've kick-started for products
that expand your camera's capabilities
and now we've built the best remote
trigger we can imagine this is pulse the
most powerful way to control your camera
from your smart
also lets you take a photo without
having to touch or shake your camera so
you can get sharp images in any
conditions or capture moments where you
can't be next to your camera the pulse
isn't just a trigger it gives you all
the functionality you expect from
shooting with your DSLR or mirrorless
camera but remotely from your smartphone
you can change all of your camera
settings through the app or just check
your histogram and make sure everything
is looking good
unlike other triggers pulse lets you
start and stop video too and because you
can control up to 3 cameras at once you
can get all the right angles for your
shot even if you are just a team of one
pulse is also the most powerful
time-lapse trigger on the market so if
you are taking your very first time
lapse or getting the holy grail of time
lapses a day-to-night transition we've
designed pulse to give you maximum
control we started Alpine labs because
Kickstarter backers like you believed in
our ideas initially we were inspired to
make better tools for time-lapse and
this year we started focusing on camera
control and remote triggers the products
out there were either chief or lacked
functionality and some solutions just
wouldn't fit in our camera bags we
wanted a product that was sleek fit
beautifully with your camera and gave
you complete control wherever you
worship so we got to work and design all
your support gives us the ability to
build the best products we can emit and
to continue to work on new ideas from
all of us at Alpine labs
back on Kickstarter to present the
daguerreotype ahkamaat art lens
this is a reinvention of the world's
first photographic optical lens from
1839 it's aqua Mott optic design allows
a highly versatile lens shoot
razor-sharp details or wrap your world
and luminous soft focus create rich
textured backgrounds rarely achieved in
photography the ahkamaat lens is a
powerful tool for modern-day
photographers and cinematographers to
push new boundaries and master light
diverse foods and dramatic special
effects it's compatible with almost all
digital and analog cameras this one is
for the dreamers
our inspiration this time comes from
1839 from the very invention of
practical photography in France
history shook when the first photograph
of the human was taken in Paris with the
daguerreian side camera this pioneering
camera used the first optic lens ever it
had aberrations in its image forming
system which caused light rays to split
and disperse drenching images in a
powerful natural glow we rework the
Aquanaut design into a bold brass lens
compatible for the 21st century the
daguerreotype ahkamaat lens that works
with the Waterhouse aperture plate
system which allows full creativity with
depth of field and variation in bokeh
effects we've given the lens to tests to
photographers and videographers around
the world we can tell you all about it
when you think the results speak for
themselves
we want to make the daguerreotype
Aquanaut lense available to you and
image makers everywhere to revive a
long-lost aesthetic and keep the magic
alive and 21st century photography dare
to dream
bakasana kick started today fast easy
awesome
those weren't necessarily the first
words you'd use to describe speed light
modifiers two years ago but they are now
thanks to these and to this guy neat
Spencer one day he woke up with a sweet
idea
take durable silicon and combine it with
freakishly strong magnets to make a
system of magnetic modular flash
modifiers Spencer took his idea to
Kickstarter and with support from an
amazingly loyal community of
photographers like you magmod started a
worldwide revolution in flash
photography thanks to Kickstarter magmod
has gone from a one-man operation to a
small but mighty team who are constantly
looking for ways to make awesome
photography easier today we're proud to
present our latest creation the mag beam
the mag beam is the most unique and
versatile tool ever created for speed
light flashes Fornell lens modifiers
were designed to increase light output
but they typically came with some pretty
sucky limitations their flimsy clunky
and not very intuitive that is until
today the mag beam geniusly incorporates
special lenses designed to increase
light output while introducing new ways
to creatively control and shape your
light and like the rest of our modifiers
it's compact durable lightning-fast to
set up and best of all super easy to use
portrait wedding and commercial
photographers will dig using the mag
beam as an ultra portable spotlight with
three stops of additional light output
but that's not all this is a mag mask
why do you care because you can create
this this and this just collapse the mag
beam add a mag mask and boom ninja-style
light shaping for wildlife and bird
photographers the mag beam is the best
and most practical Fornell lens modifier
period the Magnum gives you the extra
output you need without weighing you
down or cramping your style
oh and one more thing magmod reinvented
the way photographers use gels and now
we raise the bar even further with
labels yep we did it and we've got a few
extra colors - hello my name is Edwin
thuja and this aesthetic speak this new
device will solve all of your video
stabilization issues with any kind of
video tonight the way it works is very
simple you just have to plug your static
space behind your camera and that's it
you are ready to shoot your video as
usual but with a video stabilization
quality very close to the best that it
can see say anything
boss Kalina have you know hunting a
satiny effects on food instead of speed
JT I didn't know Sydney and that might
entail the design a participated a
technique to said capsicum and they'll
keep the engineer not a mistake in
Virginia Hawaii active nor at the
various one PCR presentation no cigar
sir Integra to repeatable cavity in the
dispensation of a met with miss from
Russia not the one condition
the principle is very simple the static
speed is recording all of your movement
during the shot then you just have to
have flowed an additional file from the
static speed to a post processing
software that will sterilize
automatically all your videos
we have two batches of static speed one
is made specifically for GoPro cameras
and it works with GoPro Hero two three
and four
second is compatible with almost any
other camera including DSLRs more or
less and even high-end cinema equipment
both versions of static speak will help
you feel smooth shots in any conditions
and with any lens but for the most
dynamic moves it is best to use a high
resolution camera with a wide-angle
optics the static speed software will
first remove the geometrical deformation
of the lens second it will correct the
rolling shutter and third if you
calculate a smooth trajectory correcting
shaky shots
hi I'm Jeremy from Rollo cam and we're
excited to introduce you to the Hercules
Hercules is the world's smallest motion
control camera system and allows anyone
to capture stunning cinematic video
footage with virtually any camera
conventional motion control systems
create beautiful shots but they're huge
bulky expensive difficult to use what if
there was a way to have a device that
captured the same type of footage as
those enormous expensive rigs that was
small enough and light enough to fit in
your pocket and take with you anywhere
just like your smartphone what if it was
easy enough to use that anyone from a
professional photographer or
videographer all the way down to someone
who's only experienced with photography
is their smartphone could learn to use
it easily and intuitively we took all
those what if questions and answered
them with the Hercules
the Hercules easily gets traditional
slider moves
curve moves
motorized dolly shots motion control
time lapses automated panoramas
all in the palm of your hand the
Hercules is incredibly tough
the hercules is durable and living up to
its name the hercules is strong able to
support pretty much any camera out there
from the smallest actioncam smartphone
DSLR all the way up to a full-size
motion picture camera the hercules can
go from being in your pocket to being
assembled programmed and shooting within
30 seconds the hercules on its own is
incredibly versatile and can be used
almost anywhere with the optional rail
you can use it as a traditional slider
or elevated shots
or for even more dynamic moves
it's easily programmable with a single
button we won't have the Hercules to be
small and we also wanted to make sure
that it wouldn't require some
specialized rechargeable battery that
would be difficult to find in a pinch so
it runs off of a single triple-a battery
we're looking to the Kickstarter
community to raise enough funds to allow
us to meet our manufacturing minimums
which allows us to offer it to you for
the lowest price possible and to deliver
it in a timely fashion thank you so much
for your support</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
