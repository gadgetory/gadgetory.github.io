the barrister combines ultimate
convenience with a century experience
wake up to the invigorating aroma of
freshly brewed coffee or tea at your
chosen time before going to bed for the
blast boiling vessel with enough water
for your chosen morning drink place the
bung in the top of the boiling vessel
securely if you take milk with your
drink for the specially designed milk
vessel next we're ready for you to add
the good stuff it's bring the freshly
ground coffee into the filter on the
sealed storage compartment set your
alarm time then set the brute um for
your drink before at the alarm or after
the barrister can be used for tea as
well as coffee charge your phone off the
USB port located in the base my research
was inspired by the psychology behind
sleep and relaxation I learned that
adopting a nightly routine can encourage
a more restful night's sleep whilst
gently stimulating one sensors can lead
to better awakening
another branch of my research was
looking at function versus aesthetic my
aim was to design a beautiful product
that people can proudly display in their
home but that also engages the user
physically the barrister uses induction
heating for maximum safety and
efficiency the induction coil induces an
electromagnetic currents that heats the
content of the vessel when the vessel
balls it creates steam which pushes the
water out and into the coffee simple
science however this hasn't been a
simple process it has taken a year of
hard work and dedication to get it right
the barrister has been endlessly refined
for manufacturing purposes the induction
heating element has been the biggest
challenge to overcome there are no
off-the-shelf parts that fit the
required specifications on the product I
have been working with an experienced
team of electrical engineers to design
code and build an induction heater that
produces the output required whilst
keeping it small enough to integrate
into the product what we have refined
and developed a built-in pelletier
cooler to ensure milk is kept cool
overnight the filter arm has three
magnets to keep it in place for your
convenience we've redesigned a higher
quality filter for more efficient
brewing the boiling vessel has been
redeveloped with a stainless steel base
for improves connection to the induction
coil a max line has been integrated on
the boiling vessel
the LED display now includes a light
sensor to regulate the display
brightness adjusting to your environment
why we need you gearing up for
manufacture means huge resources and
financial support we are a self funded
startup and have funded as much in the
project ourselves as possible now we
need your support with the barrister
quality as our main concern and we
refuse to make any compromises we have
been working with the top safety experts
to ensure that we meet all the health
and safety requirements we have
world-class sourcing companies with
years of experience lined up to a
standing by to coordinate all stages of
production and logistics meet cycling
the world's first bluetooth-enabled
portable cycle look at this guy he's
exercising alone but with cycling he can
race against his office his friends a
family or even the whole world to get
moving simply sync your cyclic to your
smartphone in start cycling cycling's
built in touch screen shows you
important metrics like reps calories
burned and time spent exercising in the
cyclic you can track your progress in
set personal goals if you're feeling
social you can race against two other
people by joining public or private
groups cycling also has a high quality
magnetic resistance system for smooth
and quiet operation a rechargeable
battery for portable use a low profile
design you can use at your office and a
smart resistant sensor so that it can
accurately measure how many calories
you're burning hi i'm neet son i'm danny
and we've spent the last seven years in
the medical industry creating fun new

cyclic turns routine exercise into a
social experience you can share your
progress race against people you know or

whole world please help us make cycling
a reality thanks for your support
we all have a bedtime ritual for most of
us it's an effort for clear healthier
skin but then we thought about what
happens afterwards why are we laying our
fresh faces onto a pillow case that
hasn't been washed in days it turns out
the average pillow case is a breeding
ground for bacteria in fact studies have
shown that the bacteria found on
pillowcases is no different from that on
a toilet this bacteria builds up over
time and can be harmful to your skin and
overall well-being dermatologists
recommend washing your pillow case every
two or three days but who has time for
that we sure don't and we don't know
anyone who does introducing the Sylvan
pillow case Silvan provides you with a
clean sleeping surface each and every
night here's how it works Silvan uses
pure natural silver through bent
bacterial growth under pillow case
advanced technology now allows us to
weave silver coated thread into our
fabric these silver threads are up to 99
percent effective in controlling
bacteria on your entire pillowcase the
average pillow case continues to
accumulate bacteria over time Silvan
shows a ninety-nine percent reduction
pathogens within the first hour and
continue to prevent bacterial growth
night after night let's take it back to
high school chemistry silver carries a
positive charge and bacteria is negative
the silver is attractive the bacteria
breaks its cell wall and the bacteria is
destroyed before it has a chance to
reproduce silver occurs naturally in the
earth and it's been used for centuries
of purifying agent today this technology
is used by healthcare facilities and
even NASA for its antibacterial
properties no harsh chemicals no
nanotechnology those were our guidelines
we've partnered with an american-based
antimicrobial technology company that
uses natural silver to prevent bacterial
growth on
their proprietary process completely
covers advanced fibers with silver while
allowing them to remain extremely soft
flexible and comfortable similar
products use harsh chemical treatments
in their antibacterial effects weaken
over time but because the silver is what
would right into our fabric you will not
wash out a degrading straight even after
200 washes acquittal case will be just
as effective as day one but a pillowcase
isn't much good if it's not comfortable
that's why we combine our technology
with long staple supima cotton one
hundred percent of this cotton is grown
in the US and it's among the softest
most durable cotton delivery with
holistic skin care and overall
well-being in mind we've created a
pillowcase that's part of the solution
not the problem we wanted to bring
textile innovations to the bedroom and
believe that Silvan is a product that
everyone can benefit from we are
creatures in motion with bodies made to
stretch me to grow compelled to move
creators workers and collaborators
