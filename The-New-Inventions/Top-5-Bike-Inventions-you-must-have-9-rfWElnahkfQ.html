strong
how strong what's it made of
so definitely not breaking
doesn't look like it's even scratch them
it off a lot lighter than my clocks that
I have on my bike right now
hmm I like that it's really flexible I
would love to be able to use something
that's disliked seems great it's really
light most cyclists understand that
locks are determined it's about having
enough durability to slow it down for a
racer like me
the huge considerations are weight the
sizer bulkiness and ease of use we all
know how stressful it is so we have our
expensive bikes sitting in public but no
one I know is gonna carry a chain or
your lock when training it's just not
gonna happen
so the challenge was to create a
security solution that's light enough
for training easy to stow and your bike
for your pocket and still strong enough
to prevent that and that is when I
started working with Auto design works
this has been no small design challenge
locks generally fail the weight and
security trade-off
most are clunky weak or both we figured
out how to keep the way to lock under
115 grams by holding up to the most
rigorous theft attempts it is able to
quell up into this compact and portable
package we achieve this with a
patent-pending product design which uses
multiple reinforced bands high tempered
steel this allows the strap to remain
flexible without sacrificing cut
resistance the result is a secure
compact and lightweight lock with broad
application for the outdoor enthusiasts
it's brilliant everyone I ride with
who's seen my auto lock have been
bugging me to get one we're pretty lucky
to have a world-class pro racer like
Jacob collaborating with us the auto
lock concept was born from the needs of
cyclists first but it didn't take our
team long to realize there were many
more uses it's not even out there yet
and the people with our beta prototypes
are already raving it's showing us many
other uses both on and off the bike
it's just so simple and we're excited
about our new cinch luck changes things
strange or what you spend so much time
every year in traffic jams and moan
about it because you're not getting
anything from life but that doesn't help
at all you don't want to get to the
office all sweaty that's for sure
you have no time for exercise because
you waste your life in your car hey your
life is outside not in your car you just
have to reach out and get it leave your
car in the garage because your bike can
be electric with my mouse if more people
had more fun on bikes and things would
be better on the roads for our
environment and for you too and if more
people switch to bikes the better off we
will be
Deimos has the power that you don't have
in the mornings you're a gateway drug
you're strong ally and the slopes and
against headwinds your trainer if you
want to ride up mountains went on the
flats
it listens to your heart when you're
training you and your bike become one it
shows your friends where you went and if
you want you can do something good for
others by describing your routes and
sharing them with your friends
my mouse is not heavy not complicated or
expensive how can this all work well
because the BIOS is a smart direct drive
the most incredible stuff can be done
with a little intelligence and it fits
almost any bike in a few minutes it's
ready child's play
remove crank put on the battery pack put
on by mos
put on the switch
ready any other questions
it goes where the power on the bike
needs to be not on the rear or on the
front wheel but in the middle where it
should be no transmission no gears no
gadgets oh junk we do not need any
machine noises to get up a mountain and
it works if I must turns you into a
super hero because by most gives you the
feeling that the power comes from your
legs somehow between a tail wind and a
slight downhill on the mountain but only
if that is what you want without the
drive your bike is your bike you can
ride it like your bike and on the whole
it looks just like your bike you can
remove the battery you can charge it at
home before bike rides weren't truly
shareable you can only look at
screenshots of a map or out of context
GoPro footage now

it also provides an accurate video recap
of your trip so you can have another
layer of security in case there are any
incidents Michael is not just another
gadget it's a completely new way to
enjoy
a journey is more than just getting to
your destination it's about enjoying the
right
what if you could cycle taking
everything you wanted with you but
without compromise introducing tailfin
here in the UK I've worked with some
brilliant designers and manufacturing
specialists we've completely reimagined
both a humble bike rack and the pannier
bike
I wanted to create a rack that
complements your road bike beautifully
and is so light you don't even know it's
there a rack that can attach to any road
bike without tools and settings the
pannier bag needed to be equally light
robust and waterproof a pannier that can
take it all and connect effortlessly to
the rack
historically bike racks are made from
welded metal tubes the tailfin rack is
manufactured from carbon fiber we've
shaped two aerodynamically to seamlessly
blend with your road bike tailfins been
designed with some breakthrough features
it ships with a custom skewer which
permanently replaces your existing one
and allows tail frame to attach to
almost any road bike
the tailfin raccoon pannier worked
perfectly together
you can also attach existing panniers
biking is the fastest way to get around
the city
the downside of urban riding is that
millions of bikes are stolen every year
and many go unreported when you arrive
at your destination you'd lock up your
bike for something like this or even
worse this at outdoor we believe that
cyclists deserve a higher standard of
security and that's why we designed the
560 G the world's lightest high-security
bike
hey my name is Luke as a kid I used to
ride my bike everywhere and to be honest
not much has changed whether I was in
competition or just trying to get around
town every second on my bike is pure joy
when I got older I moved to the city and
started commuting by bike at first
everything was great I could get where I
was going quickly and for free but then
I had my first bike stolen I was forced
to use a heavy steel lock which me and
my riding experience painful I thought
to myself if bike step carbon fiber and
titanium components and it had these for
years
why can't walk through the same luckily
for me I met someone who agreed hi I'm
Dylan after talking to leek about the
problem he was having with his bike lock
we agreed there had to be a better
solution
he began researching materials designing
locks and testing prototypes after about
a year development we came up with the
560 G the world's lightest high-security
bike club weighing 560 grams or 1.24
pounds
after having my bike stolen I had to
make sure that the 560 G was different
than other bike locks I use in the past
that's why we designed the five six eg
the handle sustained attacks from the
strongest of theft tools the 560 G is
different from the bike locks because it
has made a grade 5 titanium a super
alloy used in fighter jets and
spacecraft this material has a very high
strength to weight ratio allowing the
560 G to be lightweight and secure
the components of the 560 gr percision
machine to ensure the highest possible
quality after machining they are
anodized giving the lock a beautiful
finish unlike any other lock the 5 6 e
G's patent-pending folding design allows
to be conveniently folded up for storage
in or on a bag if you don't have a bag
you can clip it on your belt the files
of G's 3-piece titanium joint design is
different from other folding locks
because it was designed of solid marine
grade stainless steel rivets
lastly the 5cg is designed up a
high-security disc lock mechanism so
that you can lock up your bikes to push
the button
this versatile mechanism allows you to
combine locks for extra reach or extra
security</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
