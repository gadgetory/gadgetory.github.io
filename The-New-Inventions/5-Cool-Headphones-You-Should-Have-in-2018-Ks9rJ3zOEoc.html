design allows you to interact with your
environment while you're listening to
your audio this is the first pain-free
bluetooth headphone it doesn't press on
your ears which can cause discomfort
instead the 3d geometric frame sits
around your ear with minimal body
contact this allows airflow and makes
them comfortable to wear for long
periods of time B shares core audio
technology comes from Yamaha smock five
module one of Yamahas most advanced
codecs and enables us to provide
superior sound quality our headphones
have an onboard 3-band equalizer that
works with all your music apps and
allows you to customize the sound to
your own personal taste
it's important that you and only you can
hear the sound of your headphones V
share is designed with directional flat
speakers that produce amazing sound
quality and yet focus the sound directly
to your ears to keep what you're
listening to private the airframe keeps
you in touch with the sounds around you
so you notice when other people approach
or want to talk with you and without
removing your headphones or adjusting
your audio you can carry on a normal
conversation when you want to be
undisturbed that VCR headphones have an
interchangeable closed frame as well for
when you want to concentrate or when
you're in a loud environment each
headset is able to broadcast or receive
from other headsets so you can use V
share to share your audio with your
friends without disturbing others around
you we hope you can find places where V
share fits your lifestyle
this is what I designed this year
artichokes bought headphones sit
comfortably in front of the ear and
utilize patent-pending bone conduction
technology to deliver stereophonic sound
to the listeners cheek bones to the
inner ear this enables anyone
participating in an activity jogging
biking skateboarding hiking skiing to
stay connected to both what they are
listening to and the outside world with
aftershocks listeners are able to hear
ambient noises such as oncoming traffic
car horns ambulances or other warning
noises potentially preventing accidents
that can be caused by headphones and
earbuds blocking out these sounds
in addition aftershokz headphones are
far more comfortable and stable Ania
bucks especially when used over extended
periods of time
aftershocks makes listening easy with a
small inline controller that allows the
user to power the headphones on and off
adjust volume and on sports m to
Louisville make and take phone calls
from your sponsor after shark sport
headphones are lightweight sweat and
water resistant and feature has standard
3.5 millimeter connector that fits all
smart phones iPods iPads and mp3 players
after shock sport headphones the safe
comfortable way to stay connected
movement this is where it all begins
waves of air particles moving at various
speeds
they are called sound waves and we have
found a way to reproduce them better
than ever before we are Mora a team of
scientists engineers and entrepreneurs
with a shared passion for high fidelity
audio
and we have developed a new material
that will change the loudspeaker as you
know it
first let's go back to some of the
basics a sound signal travels through a
voice coil vibrates a thin membrane
called the cone and voila music to your
ears the quality of sound all depends on
this little guy the cone this is the
actual part of the speaker that's
responsible for converting mechanical
motion into sound and it needs to be as
light as possible
most lightweight materials will bend in
vibrate in ways that are not intended by
the music to create an ultra fidelity
experience we needed a super light
material that's stronger than anything
we know graphene is a new material
isolated in 2004 and has been dubbed the
wonder material it is the finished
material possible and 200 times stronger
than steel basically the ultimate
material for a speaker cone now we just
had to prove it first we had to come up
with an industrial process to form
graphene into cones and we needed to
acoustically optimize the material for
use in loudspeakers that's how the team
came up with graphene cue our
proprietary nano composite formulation
which is 95% graphene by weight by the
way we noticed one of the smoothest
frequency response curves ever recorded
for a headphone driver and an impressive
reduction in power consumption this was
our answer to the perfect loudspeaker
membrane it was now time to turn our
proof of concept into the ORA graphene
cue headphones we worked with product
designers engineers through many
iterations to make sure we weren't
compromising on anything we wanted them
to be practical for everyday use with an
intuitive user experience so you could
have incredible sound quality on the go
we incorporated a gesture control
trackpad on the right
so you can control your music without
taking your phone out there's wireless
Bluetooth connectivity but we also made
sure you have the option of using them
wired so you can always enjoy the best
possible audio experience Vinci 2.0 is
