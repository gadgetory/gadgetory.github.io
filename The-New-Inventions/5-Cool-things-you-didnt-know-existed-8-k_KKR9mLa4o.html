remembering to floss your teeth is hard
you practically need your own personal
dentist to remind you on a daily basis
wouldn't it be awesome if you had
someone who could not only remind you
but also encourage you to floss your
teeth regularly well now you do meat
floss time your personal philosophy
reminder floss time is the first smart
floss dispenser designed to help you
build daily flossing habits it simply
mounts to your bathroom mirror and acts
as a visual reminder to clean in between
your teeth with the push of a button
floss time automatically dispenses the
perfect amount of floss dentists
recommend you floss at least once a day
so if used regularly floss time lights
up with a fun smile for a job well done
but if a period of 24 hours passes with
inactivity floss time frowns at you with
a reminder light we know we're supposed
to floss but most of us forget
traditional floss designs are built on
century-old technology and are dependent
on us remembering to use them which
means they don't get used enough floss
time is a habit-forming device that will
make flossing easy yet nearly impossible
to forget the device comes with an
entire years worth of floss has a dual
user mode and includes colorful animal
snap-on's to make flossing fun for kids
as well so we all met at a Stanford
Biodesign course and wanted to address
the problem of how do we get people to
floss on a more consistent basis the
lack of flossing can lead to build up of
bacteria and between your teeth and gum
appeared on two diseases these have been
linked to heart problems diabetes and
other serious medical conditions a
research shows that the biggest problem
is simply getting the floss into
people's hands once it's there almost
everyone flosses their teeth
we wanted to marry form and function
when we first started thinking about
design plus time may look deceptively
simple to use and in fact it is but
truth be told it took many sleepless
hours and nights to develop the product
today there is a great deal of focus on
treatment instead of prevention we
believe that good health starts with
small daily habits if you realize that
those of us who floss every day can live
up to six years longer at floss time we
set out to build a device so good you'll
want to use it every day and so
beautiful and elegant that you'll never
want to put it away so we have the
design finalized the engineering
completed and we are ready to
manufacture floss time to move to the
next stage requires money to pay for
tooling equipment and to purchase key
components at a volume discount with
your support floss time can help
millions of people with better oral
hygiene be one of the first to own this
great new product floss time time to
floss
listening to music is always a joy
looking at beautiful art is always a
pleasure to truly fulfill these two
experiences we introduce you to
pavillion combining striking design and
innovative sound system design as a
design startup based in los angeles
california we have some of the best
designers engineers and art specialists
developing new extraordinary ideas for
pavilion our team took a different
approach to achieve a beautiful piece of
art great acoustic quality our design
team studied materials from beautifully
built modern architecture in depth to
integrate each of the unique elements in
our design expose concrete pure metal
fine wood finish which are several
numbers of sketches to blend each unique
feature into one harmonious design after
a long period of concept development we
finally converged to a single point
pavillion the cylindrical design is
simple yet beautiful copper spiral
inside the clear glass is breathtaking
and makes it attractive from 360 degrees
smooth elegant concrete base holds the
speaker sturdy and subtly warms up the
space precisely handcrafted from the
master o tops at the classic design
every part is beautifully designed with
remarkable input pavilion can fill any
space with your favorite music we spent
the last 11 months engineering this new
speaker that significantly distinguishes
itself from other speakers that are out
in the market during the development
period brass instruments beautiful
curved and glossy finish caught our eyes
our engineering team shared the pipe
resonance concept with the design team
and merged it with our new speaker D
spiral is our new patent-pending
technology the technology is based on
the Helmholtz resonance principle to
boost low frequencies to improve bass
sound pressure level
for the best audio performance we
mounted full range peerless transducer
proven audio performance will not let
you down
with easy capacitive touch control you
can simply touch the oak top to turn it
on change track and adjust volume
pavilion uses the latest Bluetooth chip
with apt X codec support you can play
high quality audio anywhere in the room
wirelessly there is also a 3.5
millimeter aux input behind the speaker
to connect devices without bluetooth
such as classic CD players product
reliability was one of the highest
priorities we built a number of
prototypes in various forms our
engineering team and the factory staff
tested internal parts and speaker
components numerous times in order to
verify the product reliability the
result of all of these Pavillion sets a
new paradigm delivering amazing
performance and fascinating experience
filling up rooms visually and aurally
Pavilion is not just a speaker it is art
yeah

hi I'm Tyler and I'm blaze
and we are carbon fight and we've
successfully completed one Kickstarter
and looking to move on to the next we're
moving up in the world we've got
ourselves a green-screen
we've got professional video equipment
we've invested our money in great ways
and we are now ready for round two we
invested the money we got from
Kickstarter number one into product
design materials add some other things
and we're proud to announce matrix
carbon fiber the reason why we like
working with carbon fiber is it's a
super cool material it's lightweight
it's strong all the cool stuff is made
out of it and we wanted to be able to
put it on your finger so that you can
wear it we'd like to introduce matrix
carbon fiber it's very similar to the
original carbon fiber product that we
did for our first Kickstarter however we
beefed it up with innovative it we take
the money from our original Kickstarter
to make this even better so now what
we've done is we've infused glow resin
into the carbon fiber to make it glow at
night as you can see here it's very
unique we don't know of anybody that's
made something like this quite yet and
we're very proud to introduce it but we
need a little bit of your help the
reason why we're doing this Kickstarter
is not only to show off our matrix
carbon fiber ring but also because we
want to automate our process by buying a
CNC machine we are super stoked to get
these rigs in your hand and we cannot
wait to make them for you but please
pledge so that we can make this dream a
reality go to our Kickstarter today and
pledge to get a ring
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
