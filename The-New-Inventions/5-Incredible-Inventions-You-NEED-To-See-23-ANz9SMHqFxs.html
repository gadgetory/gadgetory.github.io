gun you must always be prepared have to
be trained
you are your gun safe when it's not on
you you want to know it's secure and
accessible safes are not always
accessible or easy to open especially in
the dark and locks are nuisance to
operate as for smart guns well smart
guns are a dangerous concept taking an
unreliable technology and embedding it
into your gun is not a smart decision
our mission is to bring you the perfect
solution introducing sorex
the new generation of gun storage sorex
is calibre specific it has two modes the
first mode is awareness if someone tries
to tamper with your gun you're
immediately alerted and when you need
your gun charging it will eject zorax
and chamber a fresh round the second
mode is when your gun is locked when
Zoras locked
no one can charge your gun if someone
tries to charge your gun the locking
mechanism will immediately expand
preventing the gun from being loaded
special polymers in the locking
mechanism prevent any damage to the
barrel
soraa's developed a revolutionary
unlocking mechanism rapid dial rapid
dial is a simple mechanism which counts
clicks while you turn it you don't need
to start from a specific point even the
direction that you turn the lock doesn't
matter these two factors allow you to
unlock your weapon without looking at it
even in the dark you can choose a simple
code or any length code you wish you
won't believe how fast and simple it is
until you try it you can also open zorax
from your phone but you can only lock it
by physically pressing the lock button
zorax normally communicates with your
phone directly through bluetooth it also
comes with a zorb bridge a Bluetooth 2
Wi-Fi router when plugged into the wall
near your gun you'll be made aware from
anywhere in the world if your gun is
being tampered with now if your home is
your safe and you don't lock your gun
but you still want alerts we have a
solution the zone watchdog the door
watchdog is not a lock but rather a
notification device its sole purpose is
to notify you if your weapon is tampered
with
zorax was invented by veterans of elite
IDF technological in combat units we
worked on it for two years bringing it
affection sorex allows you to be ready
aware and safe more than ever before
join the zuhr revolution own your gun

is really hard for me I can't do it
every time I will pass out
that's why we'll take forever I saw you
wanna go to camp today yeah a true world
pump like this in the car
below house all the powers for this you
need to carry we're air mattresses as in
influence and most importantly you can
never go to any real nice places with a
car a pump like this need faulty cell
batteries with that much more money you
can even take your girlfriend to the
movies twice so far there are no perfect
gadget

quality air mattresses with the next
home you can have it ready to go in just

yes this is the max pump smoke the
powerful we're in the wireless future
Wi-Fi Bluetooth LTE so why don't we
charge our tech the same way we use it
charging has been left behind this is
fly charge other wireless charging
systems typically require proper
orientation specific device
compatibility and usually don't charge
as fast as standard outlets plus they
definitely don't look as cool as why
charge fly charge is wireless charging
done right it uses conductive technology
which means it charges on contact
this means it works with virtually any
device and you don't have to worry about
device orientation it emits no
additional radiation and is safe to
touch the Flyway 40 is a 40 watt
high-speed charging pad that can
simultaneously charge all of your
devices at the same speed as a regular
outlet the fly case seamlessly
integrates with your smartphone take the
fly cue for the fly coin plug it into
your device place it on the fly way and
charge away
the flag cube gives you the flexibility
to charge your device while in use and
the fly coin lets you charge any USB
powered device connected to it fly
charge is awesome
you don't have to worry about placement
or any of that stuff you simply take it
out put it down and charge up it's that
easy
I have flied charge everywhere I've got
in my home hand in my office and so does
Martha keep crashing to Martha it's
common for people to put their phones
down on whatever surface they're in
front of so why not be charging it at
the same time fly charge can charge your
devices your friends devices
that guy's device is all at the same
time without losing charging speed clean
up your space and have easy access to
charge all your stuff
no more cord searching wire tripping or
outlet thievery use fly charge join our
movement and together we can change the
way we power our lives
we think things should be easy and you
shouldn't have to waste time on every
demonstrations like this so we designed
nimble
nimble is the world's first one finger
cutting tool you can use nimble to open
almost any type of packaging made from
plastic a nimble isn't just opening
packaging it can be used to cut out
vouchers for crafts present wrapping and
more I believe solution should be simple
and that's what we've achieved with
nimble we made countless prototypes of
nimble during development and tested
them with over 150 volunteers around the
country to make sure that nimble does a
job better than anything else out there
it's rubber body especially designed to
be one size fits all so you don't have
to worry about choosing the right size
you can use limb but with either hand
left or right a safe blade design means
that although or packaging should be
afraid of nimble you needn't be nimble's
blade is made out of ciconia serac a
special material which is much harder
than steel so you won't need to worry
about finding replacement anytime soon
nimble it's bright color means you could
be confident that you won't lose it in
kitchen or desk drawer it's compact and
possible size makes that deal to have
around the home or on the go we believe
nimble can save you time and frustration
on a daily basis we've worked really
hard to get nimble to the point is up
now and now we need your help to take a
last big step and get nimble produced on
a larger scale so please backers and say
goodbye to rapper H with a swipe of your
finger</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
