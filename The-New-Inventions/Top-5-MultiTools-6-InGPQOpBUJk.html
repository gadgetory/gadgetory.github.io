into the situation of needing to fix or
adjust your bike on the road but since
the tools were too bulky you do not have

the bicycle industry for a good 20 years
never afraid of buying a specialty tool
when I need it for the job this tool has
everything that you could possibly need

attachments you assemble it for whatever
it is that you're working on slip it
into the carabiner
turn it over walk the carabiner down on
it and it's ready to go
this tool is made out of chromoly steel
they use the same materials in axles and
gear fabrication what I have here is the
15 millimeter open end wrench when
you're holding it in your hand it fits
really nicely if you could definitely
put legitimate full-on torque on this
wrench you pretty much could disassemble
anything on a bicycle on the road side
and put it back together more
importantly
weight is extremely important to
cyclists and I won't get weighed down by
this tool you can take it anywhere you
can forget about it even because you can
clip it to your belt biking in the Napa

pocket
