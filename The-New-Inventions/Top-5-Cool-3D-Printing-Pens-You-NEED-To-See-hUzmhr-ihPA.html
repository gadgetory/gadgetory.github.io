asked the world to imagine a pen that
could literally draw in the air two
years on we've made the world's first 3d
printing pen even better with a new and
improved version that's slimmer lighter
quieter and even easier to use the
3doodler heats then rapidly cools
plastic allowing instant 3d creation and
with no software or computers the
possibilities are limited only by your
imagination we've shipped over a hundred
and thirty thousand first generation
three jewelers and our community has
used them to create amazing things from
jewelry to RC planes fully three doodle
dresses architectural models and even
writing Braille it was because of the
support of this Kickstarter community
that we were able to make the 3doodler
dream a reality
to say thank you we've decided to bring
3doodler 2.0 to you first completely

smart pen that does not require paper
we are excited to share this amazing
experience with you
hello my name is David and I'm the CEO
of 3d Simo here's our new product the 3d
Simo mini it all started in 2013 with
our first product the original 3d Simo
it's the very first multi-material 3d
pen in the world you can set the speed
temperature and also choose from the
default material profiles you can draw
with a variety of materials including
flex fluorescents lay wood transparent
thermochromic decomposable materials and
so on but that wasn't enough for us
we've created a tool that would allow
you to create anything you wish the 3d
Simo mini is a smaller and smarter
version of the original 3d Simo
it can also solder burn and cut things
and you can operate it manually or
through your smartphone so don't be
limited by materials take full advantage
of 3d drawing draw fix and create new
things each extension is equipped with
an automatic detector so you only need
to insert and start to create with the
soldiering nozzle you can fix or create
any electrical component the tip can
reach a maximum temperature of 490
degrees
are you a creative person who likes
original items using the extension for
burning you can decorate for example
wooden spoons a belt wallet or your
leather shoes at the same time you can
shape 3d models and printouts if you're
a model maker or handyman you'll be
interested in our extension for cutting

mp3 and so on and if you use our phone
app you can enjoy more fun with a 3d
Simo mini
hi I'm andreas peernock and I'm here at
our labs at the National Design Centre
in Singapore to tell you about Korea pop
and really cool 3d pen that we are
working on we came up with the idea of
using light-sensitive ink that is
solidified by shining ultraviolet light
on it in the industry this is called
photo polymers with Korea pop you get a
3d pen without any hot parts without any
melting plastic and without any bad
smell with Korea pop cooling pops are
magically
people just love to create things we see
this all the time with artists and with
designers we also see it with kids who
love coloring books Lego and playdough
Korea pop is the perfect tool for anyone
who wants to create their own designs in
different shapes and different colors I
could have just imagined my daughter 4
hours to a whole new level well you can
make a drawing in 3d you can make
customized
clothes for your doll you can make
jewelry we have been following the space
of personal fabrication for quite some
time and the evolution has really been
amazing just think about what has
happened with 3d printers and 3d pants
however there are a couple of problems
specifically when you look at 3d pants
all of the pens out there melt plastic
too dangerously hot temperatures just
think about what would happen if someone
gets melting plastic onto their skin or
into their eyes it would be really bad
in addition you get a quite unpleasant
smell when you use pants that melt
plastic it's simply not nice in a home
environment that's how we started
thinking wouldn't it be possible to do
things in a different way
couldn't we make it 3d pen without hot
plastic and without a bad smell with
Korea pop you can use some really cool
ink we have inks in many different
colors so you can create multi color
designs we have ink that is elastic so
you can make a dress for a Barbie doll
there is magnetic ink that you can use
for making fridge or whiteboard magnets
we have aimed that glows in the dark if
you want to make objects that radiate
light in a dark room
you can use our aromatic aimed to make
items that smell good for your car or
for your bathroom we have got ink that
changes color with temperature so you
can for example paint a teacup and see
how it changes color when you pour in
hot water and since Korea pop is using
cooling we have gotten body paint ink to
make tattoos and henna designs we
started working on Korea pop last year
and this is what a first prototype
looked like and this is what Korea pop
looks like today as you can see we've
gotten rid of the cord and we made
improvements to the design over the next
few months we'll make further
improvements to the design and to the
functionality until Korea pop is ready
to be shipped
unlike other 3d printing pens on the
market poly s utilizes light curing
technology photosensitive polymers are
exposed to ultraviolet light at the same
time this allows the poly s to avoid
disadvantages found in other printing
pens that use abs or PLA materials we
have completely eliminated all high
temperature parts so that drying no
longer means having to work with high
temperature 500 degrees Celsius tools
our goal is to provide users with the
safest experience possible we believe
that one point two inches is the ideal
diameter for hand operated tools this
provides users with the greatest degree
of control when holding the tool with
one hand from the LED battery indicator
and ink level port to the pens elegantly
designed concave pen tip every aspect of
the poly s has been designed with the
needs of everyday users in mind so that
drawing is an enjoyable experience the
world should be colorful poly s is
beautiful exterior should come Institute
poly yes say yes to a polychrome world
poly s is not only car from the outside
it's filled with color you can mix and
matching in every color of the rainbow
we all self-centered inks pigs a
transparent glow-in-the-dark inks to
change colors with different
temperatures and many other fun options
poly essence wide variety events provide
users with a feast for the senses that
goes beyond just 3d the most colorful
pen is also the safest blue LED
developed at fiercely big future may can
be solidified using lights from the
normal visible spectrum which makes poly
s safer for children to use the nanny
other 3d printing pen our researchers
put significant effort into developing
blue LED technology which was recently
awarded a Nobel Prize in Physics this
technology can achieve the same
solidification effect as ultraviolet
light but without any danger to eyes in
addition the poly esketh a tilt sensor
and safety switch which is not only a
pickle improvement but also a way to
make sure that the Paulie s is
completely safe for child used</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
