set or change a capsule on the diffuser
the app will instantly detect which one
it is in this case I've plucked the
clear head capsule in oh and look it's
already on my screen voila bye-bye
headache Oh haven't I told you I can
also control you Mia from my SmartWatch
but even better it can start spreading
automatically that way when tebow comes
back from work he doesn't even need to
think about his relax capsule Lumia
mobile app learns from you to automate
the diffusion matching your mood and
schedule it also asks the volume of your
rooms to spread the perfect amount of
oils as well as contraindications to
always guarantee absolute safety
beyond their benefits on well-being

perfume that you can use just to set up
