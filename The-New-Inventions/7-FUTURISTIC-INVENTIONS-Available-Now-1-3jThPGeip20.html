brothers from Austin Texas who are
passionate about hydration as athletes
we've often needed to track our water
consumption but solving that problem let
us do a more important question how much
water should we be drinking drinking too
much or too little can be dangerous and
the reality is that everyone's optimal
level of hydration depends on a bunch of
different factors that are unique to you
your workout schedule age gender
location your sweat rate and even the
weather are all key to the equation in
the past only elite athletes had access
to the tools needed to dial in optimal
hydration that is until now introducing
trago the world's first connected smart
water bottle
the chaga cap fits on any standard wide
mouth water bottle and connects to an
app on your smartphone using Bluetooth
Low Energy it runs on a commonly found
replaceable battery because the last
thing you need is another device to
charge it uses patent-pending ultrasonic
technology to measure how much you drink
with the chaga cap you know exactly how
much you should be drinking each day
more than that the app automatically
builds an adjust your profile by
seamlessly connecting to other wearable
devices so there's no extra work for you
imagine recording a long workout on
another app or device and then
immediately understanding how to hydrate
for proper recovery or using the app to
know just how much water to drink
leading up to a marathon or football
game the trago cap also allows you to
monitor teams groups and multiple
bottles coaches and trainers can keep an
eye on all their players because proper
hydration happens long before the game
starts with our experienced team we've
already solved most of the challenges
and bringing the trago cap to reality
we're ready to take our product into
manufacturing but we need your help
please spread the word and help us
support our mission and changing the way
people think about hydration
