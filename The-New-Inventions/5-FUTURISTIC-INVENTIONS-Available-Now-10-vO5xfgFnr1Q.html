gotcha
he's probably properly dressed
hurt the song
he's probably a doctor wherever you
action come you know these guys
has this happened to you when you get
home after working all day you simply
want to relax and enjoy some good music
but sometimes your stereo just won't
cooperate the audio cables not long
enough and in the Bluetooth it's either
difficult setup or the connections
unstable or maybe you can't even connect
your home stereo to the Internet
problems like these often happen when
you want to enjoy music with your
friends and family for music lovers like
us those notification sounds are
annoying they're tiny little problems
that don't have a simple solution right
why can't we just listen to music
without all the fuss so for your smooth
listening experiences we've created a
tune box too we want to create a whole
new home stereo environment for you
where all your audio devices are
connected to Wi-Fi through tune box -
and they're always at your command tune
box - provides you with a wireless and
flexible listening experience it
connects to your bedside stereo DVD CD
player the home theater system or any
speaker you have so that you can play
music with any software or system and
spend all that complicated what we're
doing is giving you a very easy and
convenient way to enjoy music with tool
box - you simply push one hotkey when
you go to a room and the music will
follow you there so let the on and off
Bluetooth connection play music through
Wi-Fi instead where there's no more need
to hear those annoying notification
sounds you can even stream and play
vinyl music select your most cherished
music join the ride lock technology
hasn't improved in almost 100 years who
doesn't have a lock that's completely
useless because of a forgotten
combination or lost key at best we waste
time searching for the right key or
fumbling through the combination we
thought it was time for the padlock to
enter the 21st century so we created the
no key
by using your smartphone in the no key
you can effortlessly protect your
belongings in doubt whether you're
protecting your bike your locker or
anything else all you need is your
smartphone and your no key and you're
good to go
the no key uses wireless Bluetooth
technology when clicked it automatically
looks for a phone with a compatible key
and unlocks you don't even need to
remove your phone from your pocket or
purse the nokia Liao's you to easily
share your belonging safely and securely
while maintaining total control with the
no key sharing keys has never been
easier or safer with the nokia app you
can quickly give access without the
hassle or risk of giving up your key our
iOS and Android apps allow sharing to be
done on a one-time basis multi-use basis
or any other customized schedule you
need giving access to your pool is just
a click away giving access to your
storage unit is just a click away
product design is our passion
form and function complements each other
in an attractive and simple design we
made the Nokia with a water-resistant
shell devoid of any external buttons and
built with a user replaceable battery
that lasts over a year when it's time to
replace the battery simply unlock the no
key and replace it no tools required
what if your phone dies or is not with
you we thought of that too by
incorporating our quick click technology
you can create your own access code to
use when your smartphone is unavailable
making sure you'll never be left
stranded again we know many of you will
want to use your no key on your bike so
we created a custom cable and bike mount
to neatly and securely attach your no
key to your seat post the peace of mind
along with the convenience you'll gain
by incorporating the no key into your
life makes it a great investment for you
and a great gift for friends and family
no key no problem
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
