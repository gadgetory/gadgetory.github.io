hasn't improved in almost 100 years who
doesn't have a lock that's completely
useless because of a forgotten
combination or lost key at best we waste
time searching for the right key or
fumbling through the combination we
thought it was time for the padlock to
enter the 21st century so we created the
no key

belongings in doubt whether you're
protecting your bike your locker or
anything else all you need is your
smartphone and your no key and you're
good to go

done on a one-time basis multi-use basis
or any other customized schedule you
need giving access to your pool is just
a click away giving access to your
storage unit is just a click away
product design is our passion
form and function complements each other
in an attractive and simple design we
made the Nokia with a water-resistant
shell devoid of any external buttons and
built with a user replaceable battery
that lasts over a year when it's time to
replace the battery simply unlock the no
key and replace it no tools required
what if your phone dies or is not with
you we thought of that too by
incorporating our quick click technology
you can create your own access code to
use when your smartphone is unavailable

want to use your no key on your bike so
we created a custom cable and bike mount
