we're in Copenhagen in Denmark and we
are on a mission to make the perfect bag
for any given situation biking is a huge
part of our culture so we know what
fighting is all about and how it should
feel to write we also love technology
and thought of a way of how to combine
these two things and still keep cool
functionality in mind after many
prototypes and thousands of powers we're
happy to finally say we created what we
believe is the perfect bike let us
introduce mate mate is no ordinary bike
it's an electric foldable and affordable
bike made for any journey any rider any
situation got enough with the talking
let's take it for a spin
mate is our answer to bring people on a
bike again
it makes distances shorter and Hills
more flat so you can focus on what's
important to you like your friends we
design mate to be your everyday
companion for better easier faster and
finally a personal transportation it can
ride up to 50 miles on a single charge
it is built with the finest components
has a six speed computer and comes in a
variety of cool colors
it will never let it down and allows you
to charge any mobile device thanks to
its built-in USB port
we build mate with an integrated carry
handle so you can lift it easily on your
way up but down the stairs
and thanks to its all-terrain tires and
shock absorbing suspensions hot pedro's
fulfill gentle and smooth
mate is this great when you want to beat
the traffic and go places fast without
breaking a sweat
but if you want to exercise choose the
level of assist you want with the six
speed settings on the computer the
choice is yours go further or go harder
mate comes with smart this breaks for
quick and effective stopping power
we also edit front and back suspension
so you don't have to worry about
obstacles along the way it spills
durable so give it your best shot it is
always a fun and easy experience for all
ages and riding styles for adventure
Alysha you can use the pedal assist or
you can go full electric just sit back
relax and enjoy the scenery at 20 miles
per hour there might be times where you
won't need your mate so it's great to be
able to fold it for storage or
transportation knowing you can always
take it out on your field urge
we're just at the beginning our dream is
to kick-start the biking evolution and
you can be a part of it once we get made
funded we can start production and
together we can rethink what a bike
should be able to do
this bike can do virtually anything hey
mate pick up Julie
oh well we're not quite there yet but
together we can make it happen
every day 80% of Americans driving on
our roads can't see behind them when
they're parking so we decided to look
into why more people then have parking
sensor solutions available on their car
and what we found was that it was too
expensive
or is much too difficult to install you
practically had to be a car guy to
install it yourself so we made the
world's simplest and easiest solution
yet to hit the market introducing Ben
cents the world's first smart parking
device the embedded ultrasonic sensors
can detect any object within three
meters of the car's front or back blind
spots we use an accelerometer detect
when the car is backing up and then use
bluetooth to automatically launch the
app on the drivers phone we've designed
a completely seamless experience that
requires no interaction on behalf of the
driver
the device itself installs in less than
five minutes with absolutely no wiring
and only four security screws to prevent
that
it's so easy your grandma can do it
the device itself knows when your car's
backing up
and immediately launches the app on the
drivers phone cladding audio-visual and
vibration alerts for optics and your
client spots
as you can see 10 cents is the simplest
and easiest parking sensor solution
available on the market today and we
need your help to make this product a
reality we have a ready for
manufacturing prototype and a trusted
manufacturer to go into production
pre-order yours today to get it for only
$99 saving $50 off the MSRP of 149
please spread the word and tell your
friends let's make parking safe and
simple together
we love our smartphones we take them
everywhere we go
they help us plan our day keep in touch
with friends and family and for most of
us they even support our work day but
all these fun functions come at a cost
battery don't you just hate it when your
phone runs out of battery
our current solution includes carrying
around our power bank plugs cables and
everything else we need to ensure we
don't run out of juice imagine if there
was a smarter way to save your precious
phone battery from running out all the
time something lightweight and easy to
use
say hello to cube it's the world's first
revolutionary power bank that combines
three features in the one compact device
power bank memory card reader sync and
quit charging cable you don't even need
your USB flash drive anymore cube turns
into a memory storage device and it's
compatible with any laptop via the USB
port there's no need to carry around any
other accessories ever cables are often
messy but not Hugh simply wrap it into
this tuck away slot and you're good to
go
how really does the cube work well it's
a simple concept just plug your cube
into your phone and into the power
source it detects when your smart phone
is fully charged and redirects the
charge to its internal battery unlike
your power bank that must be charged
separately cube automatically charges
itself while charging your phone so you
always know that cube is there for you
and will never let you down hi my name
is question as every busy person I was
often on the road and almost every day
my phone was running out of the battery
in black tea instead of messy wires and
power bank I wanted to have only one
small device that can replace the number
of home accessed
have to carry everything when we started
to think about the cube look at the
existing technology on the map and we
quickly noticed that most of the
available devices were not completely
and not user-friendly
together with fear our head designer we
developed the cube we went through
several prototypes to find the best
design for a designer this elegant
compact and practical it was so
challenging with all those
functionalities together into a small
and cool design with a significant
battery capacity it was something that
had never been done but we made it and
we're so proud and excited to bring it
to you cube is the world's first compact
and lightweight device that combines the
functions of a power bank a memory
storage and a sinking quick charging
cable you'll also agree it's one of the
coolest looking power banks around
simply put it's an amazing piece of
technology that we can no longer live
without let's bring it to the world so
