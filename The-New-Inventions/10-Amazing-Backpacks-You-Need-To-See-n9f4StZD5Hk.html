backpacks is the sleek all-around
backpack for today's urban commuters
I'm a frequent traveler and it always
bothers me how my backpacks can't keep
up with me it can't charge my dead cell
phone and they all look pretty
embarrassing in the office I need a bag
that's gonna keep up with my day-to-day
lifestyle I need a bag with unlimited
possibilities and I'm just not going to
be satisfied until I get one we need a
solution for the problems we've had and
for the problems we will have a smart
docking system is that answer but we
need your support the bag now has a
finished design and a prototype but we
need your support in order to make the
smart badge system we really appreciate
the wus and whoa is on Facebook and
Instagram and so please pledge today and
let's build a better bag for tomorrow
when we designed the ellipse motion pack
we incorporated a streamlined
wedge-shaped silhouette to create
natural compression and guaranteed
perfect weight distribution a large
zipper opening on the main compartment
enables easy loading an internal
compartment fits laptops up to 15 inches
and hydration systems up to three liters
the flexible floating pocket allows
direct access to your essentials in any
packing situation the stretchable front
layer adds a whole new dimension to your
organization while the main compartment
is protected from water the stretchable
layer design allows for a wet jacket to
dry it's the perfect place to store
whatever needs to be easily accessible
an integrated y-shaped reinforcements
provides structure and allows
flexibility whenever needed our
signature pattern is used to create a 3d
foam panel and ensures better airflow
and reduces pressure points the same 3d
pattern is also applied to the shoulder

if you're a human being you've probably
found yourself on a train walking
somewhere riding a bike someplace or
traveling but no matter what your
situation is when you're on the go
you've always encountered the same
dilemma which device should I charge
first electronic devices are great but
we always seem to lack enough power
outlets to satisfy today's charging
demands we here at Moss have found the
answer to life's greatest question we
give you the moss pack the perfect
solution to charge your devices on the
go at first it just looks like an
amazingly beautiful backpack but once
you get to know her you'll realize that
what's inside is what really counts here
at Moss we've always strived to solve
problems of cable management so we have
these channels on the side so that you
can route your wires down and plug them
into the moss reach which is one of the
biggest features that makes the moss
pack different than any other backpack
the Moss reach is stored at the bottom
you can plug in a laptop and two USB
devices the magnets inside the reach
attach the metal plates sewn in at the
bottom of the backpack to keep it in
place the cable for the reach is stored
in this side pocket that way you can
quickly plug it in as soon as you reach
a power outlet and let your devices
charge inside without ever having to
take them out with the two USB ports and
power outlet on the reach you have
enough porch to charge all your devices
at the same time while you sit back and
relax then when it's time to go you
simply unplug it and leave you've
probably seen battery backpacks before
but the truth is most of the time
they're way overpriced and they come
with heavy bulky batteries making them
very inconvenient for everyday use
that's why instead of having a heavy
battery the MAS pack has a special spot
where you can use your favorite power
bank such as the Moscow power bank which
should be available soon the laptop
pocket can fit a 15-inch laptop and the
tablet pocket can fit most standard
tablets the front vertical zipper is
meant to house anything that's nine
inches long like a boarding pass the
next pocket has a couple different pen
slots and other compartments that can
fit things like your keys or wallet this
next pocket is surprisingly large it can
fit a typical binder or two this pocket
was designed for your passport and you
can also store your phone or wallet in
this next ribbed pocket the top pocket
is actually designed especially for
sunglasses it's lined with microfiber
fleece and cushioning on both sides to
make sure your sunglasses
protected to make sure this backpack has
a sleek design we put the water bottle
pocket on the inside it has an elastic
pocket on the inside for support and
it's completely waterproof to keep your
device's safe in case of a water leak
the built-in magnets on the straps can
be neatly hold your earbuds whenever you
need them to Moss pack the easiest way
to charge all your devices on the go are
you looking for a backpack with your
vault with you literally means we
present to you an easy sack a backpack
that transforms with every facet of your
on-the-go lifestyle energy sack is an
effortless synergy between design and
