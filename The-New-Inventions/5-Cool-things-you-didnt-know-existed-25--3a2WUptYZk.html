up a skateboard for the first time all
of them want to start landing awesome
tricks if you land one you're hooked the
early tricks are very hard for most of
us just like any sport with the kids
don't see progress then quit that's why
I created skatertrainers most tips tell
you to start out in the crack or some
grass but it's not enough you don't land
back in the crack and the grass doesn't
quite feel the same there are a lot of
great how-to videos out there but many
skaters give up too soon on their
skateboarding dreams skater trainer is a
simple tool that you slip on the wheels
of your skateboard to keep it from
rolling it's an intermediate step that
slows things down so you can learn the
moves and commit the landing tricks like
a nollie or a kickflip my name is Roger
I'm an engineer an inventor and the
creator of schedule trainer I spent 25
years not skating and then decided that
I wanted to get back into it easier said
than done
it was tough I felt like a beginner all
over again only this time with a lot
more fear of falling and busting my 40
year old ass having spent the last 20
years as an aerospace engineer my mind
instantly went into figuring out a
solution to this problems
I built a prototype out of things I had
around the house and learned a few
tricks I knew I was on to something so I
made the $200 youtube video created a
manufacturable design and started
testing I was blown away by the response
I got
skaters across the world were sending in
their praise of skatertrainers on Monday
and I learned
by the end of Monday I think you guys
are totally gone there
Turner's it's totally worth it their
testimonials validated the concept but
they also highlighted some key issues
they were hard to get on with slip off
when used eventually wore out and we're
pretty ugly I took that feedback and
created version 2.0 skatertrainers it's
waser to install fits on almost any
skateboard wheel won't slip off is
lighter and more durable than the first
version
this is John while his neighbor is
yelling about how his dog ate his paper
this is John in the same situation using
brick so what is brick so it's an
awesome version of building blocks that
makes your designs come to life with
electricity sensors and Bluetooth let's
see some prototypes from our testing lab
closing a circuit this is Bluetooth
sound sensor light sensor proximity
sensor how amazing is using brick so
this is cake making her morning coffee
while discovering Roy used all the milk
for his cereal this is Kate same
situation with brick cell brick so has
three types of locks connectors action
blocks and trigger blocks use the
connectors to make a circuit then embed
the action box to give your design light
or movement now you can use trigger
blocks to control your design with sound
proximity and light Rick so can also be
controlled remotely which means you can
connect your design to your phone and
even to the Internet and automate stuff
if you're into that sort of thing but
who likes to automate stop right oh and
there's a battery block which well is
the battery here's Mike while his
coworker turns off the air conditioner
even though it is 90 degrees outside
this is Mike same situation with brick
so you can use brick so to operate
designs made with regular building
blocks which will make them like a
hundred times cooler no wires needed all
bricks or block components are built in
brick so is also an amazing educational
tool for your kids but know that they'll
forever mock regular building blocks
buzz and Amir have been working on brick
so for a long time they're both
physicists so they know a thing or two
about electricity so if you like
building stuff and don't mind getting
addicted support them and get your own
brick so it'll change your life or just
make you happy
bricks
hi there we're playful nature the folks
behind the Willow Walker Willow Walker
is a super simple device that mimics the
natural way of parents teach their baby
to walk it lets a grown-up stand upright
while assisting young walkers it allows
a parent to do less bending over while
their toddler is learning to toddle and
him beyond
yeah we're just some dads who like that
fun and we came up with this idea for
the Willow Walker and right now we get
together and after work and we just make
them in our garage late at night
the purpose of this campaign is to raise
$12,000 to take our company out of our
garages we want to employ people to
finish the rough product and we want to
pay them a good wage for that work
so we can put this product that we think
is fun and positive but it's also really
important to us that it's good for the
earth we have two amazing environmental
charity partners Eden reforestation
projects and the lonely whale foundation
and proceeds from every sale go directly
to them we plan to use laser edging to
produce custom designs inspired by our
partners to generate additional revenue
for them we know that our idea is really
simple and one of the downsides to that
is that as soon as we get a little
momentum someone can come along and
start making them out of plastic so we
want to complete our pattern and do our
small part to keep things green
Willa walkers are made from sustainable
hardwood heavy-duty cotton strap an
organic coconut oil that's all a Willa
Walker is it's simple small and portable
no harness no buckles just a ring
instead of a parents finger here's what
you get you get a willow Walker you
plant trees via Eden reforestation
projects and you support the lonely
whale foundation to advocate growth and
youth awareness of the oceans thanks for
checking us out we hope you're as
excited as we are about the Willow
Walker please consider supporting our
campaign
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
