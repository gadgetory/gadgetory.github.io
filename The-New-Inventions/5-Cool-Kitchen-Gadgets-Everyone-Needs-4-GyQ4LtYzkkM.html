I love good rice but often when I eat
rice at other people's home or even at
some restaurants and disappointed I put
it nicely it's not cooked the way to get
the best out of it I discovered cooking
in ceramics during my trips to Japan in
China it was then learn to appreciate
well cooked rice so inspired by the
traditional Chinese and Japanese ways of
cooking rice I designed the assumed a
ceramic rice cooker my name is Ben
Austin I'm a product designer from the
Netherlands and I love cooking cooking
any rice you should first rinse it
thoroughly then let it soak for a while
cook it for a short time turn up the
heat and keep it covered the rice will
continue to steam until it's done
Ceramics hope to eat very well so the
rice won't cool down too much while
letting it sit the glaze on ceramics is
very in herbs so it won't give up any
taste like metal offered us we added
some extra benefits like these rims in
the lids these wings make sure that any
steam the condensate will recognize me
on the surface of the rice and the top
layer of the rice won't dry up
sure cooking rice in an extra rice
cooker works too but then you have yet
another kitchen appliance with a plug
the assuming is much more practical
sustainable beautiful but exact bill is
filled with Lee Iacocca so committing an
electric rice cooker Marvello hood in
dedicating tonight's over us we shall
meet and see how a town mini th in court
do it now because we only have 30 days
to accomplish our goals thanks for
watching this video okay guys let me
let me tell you a secret
this piece wasn't made in a wood-fired
brick oven it wasn't made in an oven at
all I made it in my kitchen stove in
just three minutes
Pisa is the original fast food and I
really love to share with my friends but
making people at home is very time
consuming and the results are never the
same it's in my favorite pizza plate
nothing kills to move faster than hungry
guests so why are we still making pizza
at home an oven would take forever to
preheat that's not bad food and the
party will be over before you even make
one good time when I went on a mission
to make the best possible pizza in the
shortest amount of time
I earn ate was born iron ate is designed
to skip and up and all together so you
can make your peace so spray down your
kitchen stove or raise
in under 10 minutes ironing can heat up
to 800 degrees Fahrenheit
just like commercial pizza oven no more
waiting 30 plus minutes for your oven to
preheat heating up your apartment and
wasting all that energy the cover is
designed to quickly soak up the energy
from your stove and radiate intense heat
into the crust and hopping to ensure
evenly cook pizza in just three minutes
the bottom end of ironing is made out of
special feel that can hold it much
energy as for Govan and it conducts heat
way better so you get those perfect char
spots on the bottom of your pizza you
can come even a frozen supermarket pizza
into a star of your party with irony
irony is handmade in Europe it's made
out of heavy-duty steel which prevents
wrapping and is virtually indestructible
it's all-natural code is only with
vegetable oil to prevent it from rusting
and provides a nonstick surface it made
to last a lifetime thanks for taking a
look at my new project the titanium here
are some different ways you can use it
I've also included my old project the
titanium cheese slicer we found there's
many ways you can slice all sorts of
different vegetables here are some
examples
all the details below thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
