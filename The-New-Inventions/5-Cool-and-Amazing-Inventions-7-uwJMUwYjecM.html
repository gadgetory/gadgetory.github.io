business traveler after 12 years of
working in the advertising industry I've
had to fly a lot for work and like
millions of people out there I can't
sleep on planes travel pillows could
help if only they fit into my small
carry-on which they don't and to be
honest I've always thought they kind of
look ridiculous like wrapping a life
preserver around your neck in the age of
sleek stylish accessories I wondered why
travel pillows have yet to evolve and
then one night at hip I was suffering
through yet another cross-country red
eye and I realize you don't eat a
doughnut wrap around your neck to get a
little comfort introducing the bull rest
the first travel pillow designed to meet
the needs of the modern business travel
it's eighty percent smaller than
traditional travel pillows or about the
size of a pair headphones or ski goggles
for a gold bar except it's much lighter
and less expensive of course basically
it's small enough to fit into any small
carry-on it worked by using an ergonomic
design that cradles the back of the head
keeping it from shifting side to side
but without having to wrap around the
entire neck and with memory foam inserts
it doesn't sacrifice comfort over form
it works great with noise cancelling
headphones and is designed to fit both
men and women we created an opening in
the bag not just for structural and
design purposes but it also provides
airflow to the neck keeping it nice and
cool with three unique colors to choose
from there's a style for everyone
and we are proud to announce that the
whole rest will be made right here in
the USA our seattle-based manufacturing
partner will make sure the bull rest
lives up to our high standards we've
even established a distribution
infrastructure so that we can quickly
scale up to meet high demand after a
year of development my team and I are
finally ready to bring the full rest of
market but to make it happen we need
your help your contribution will finance
the first production run of the bull
rest to provide us with an initial sales
inventory we hope you add your support
and help millions of travellers finally
get the rest they deserve
this is what happens when you snap your
fingers next to regular dice and this is
what happens when you snap your fingers
next to boogie dice
boogie dice for the world's first sound
activated motorized gaming dice
whoo you guys can be used with any of
your favorite games adding a new element
of fun and excitement
the dice are activated by the sound of a
clap click bang or by throwing them like
standardise the diester program to come
to a stop after a few seconds inside
each die there's a microphone a
vibration motor a tilt sensor three LEDs
and a rechargeable battery hi my name is
the warden of the creator of rustic and
I'm sorry creator of the games the
agents looking down I was inspired by
the cool features of booby dice to
create a fast pace to achieve a card
game that utilizes the dice to its very
best effect we're proud to present bots
battleground the first game that we've
designed around boogie does
hey seven six five four three two one
in bots battleground the dice determine
which bots go to battle it acts as a
timer and we've designed the charging
station to act as the battleground arena
boogie dice are programmable and come
with your own app so you can easily
switch between different programs and
games
wats battleground is our first game this
is an exciting new platform for games to
play along and share your ideas of
what's next remove you guys ready go
you
hi I'm Kevin and here at I go technology
will be looking at personal
transportation in a whole new way and
we've created something really exciting
it all started with my friend Marcus is
a very active paraplegic it'll still
seen them struggle with everyday
activities that able-bodied people take
for granted and I wanted to help so we
set to work on a self-balancing base
unit and we've come up with the oh go
with its unique act of moving seat
control system that makes it really
intuitive to use completely hands-free
as we watch people using it during our
public test program we've come to
consider that the ogo is nothing short
of revolutionary it's just so easy to
use after winning our first innovation
award in 2015 we released a video
showing some of the features of the yoga
and the response was just incredible
it's clear the ogo is going to
dramatically change a lot of people's
lives for a person with a disability and
those around them it means freedom it
adds elegance performance practicality
and just a bit a call as skill and
conference prize many things become
possible with this machine I can lead a
more active fulfilling and productive
life socially and a work with my family
and my friends but that's not all by
simply changing to these much larger
all-terrain wheels it becomes an
off-road monster that'll go just about
anywhere so now Marcus has the freedom
to cruise along the beach he could carry
bulky objects or even mowers lon we've
been testing the oh go on a wider range
of end-users and we're amazed at what
they've been able to achieve each time
we post a new video from our test
program with flooded with social media
feedback confirming we're not the only
ones you can see the life-changing
possibilities of this machine we could
build an exclusive product and charge a
lot of money but what we really want to
do is to help change people's lives and
the way that would see Alice's life
change so we committed to do everything
we can to keep this groundbreaking
technology to everyone so we've come to
indy gogo for your help to build 10 new
prototypes with your support we can
optimize the capabilities of the yoga
making sure we've got the ultimate
machine before we hit into production
later in the year in this campaign some
of those prototypes for sale so check
out our perks below and remember it's
only with your help that will be able to
keep the ogo at an affordable level and
get this in the hands of the people who
really need it the more we get the
quicker and further that we can go
imagine a system that can replicate
environments this is BioPod the world's
most versatile microhabitat
tell BioPod what you want it to grow and
watch it happen replicating the most
precise seasonal fluctuations year-round
BioPod is space-age technology in your
own home as a young biologist I was
researching the conservation of frogs in
the tropical rainforest frogs are one of
the world's most sensitive creatures
they're often considered the canary in
the coal mine for the entire planet and
because their habitat is disappearing so
rapidly it was necessary to develop new
technology in order to preserve a copy
of the pristine rainforest that these
animals enjoy in nature and then came
the question if we can make a system
that can replicate this environment why
can't it do more BioPod has numerous
applications use it to grow organic
fresh herbs to house your favorite
reptiles or as a beautiful addition to
your home decor biopods and vance
sensory feedback system measures crucial
data from your bio pod and sends it to
our cloud for analysis our algorithms
then send back data to your BioPod so
that it can create an optimal
environment we've packed a considerable
amount of advanced technology into each
vaio pod the Wi-Fi connected app and HD
camera allow you to control and view
your bio pot from anywhere in the world
lack of oxygen can be catastrophic for
delicate environments our bio pure
system allows for continual o2 injection
oxygenating the substrate and keeping
your bio pot pristine just as it is in
nature this means that your plants and
animals will require minimal maintenance
which is great for novice users the
built-in LED panel automatic irrigation
system and integrated heating ensures
that your plants and animals have
everything they need to thrive our
vision is to bring a community of plants
and animal lovers together in order to
solve some of the Earth's conservation
and sustainability issues</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
