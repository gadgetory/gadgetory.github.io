in 3d printing we had supports to ensure
the stability of the print model but
after removal of these supports there
can be many surface defects left behind
marring the finish of the model the
traditional way to repair these defects
is to draw some resin with a syringe
injected into the defects and then cure
it with either sunlight or a UV lamp
however it is very difficult for
beginners to control the release of
resin from the syringe manual repair is
time-consuming it is difficult to get
the desired effect and you could
accidentally ruin the whole print after
experiencing various levels of success
in repairing models we decided to
develop a professional product for resin
model repair the fixer the fixer will
control the amount of resin extruded
accurately be a programmable syringe
pump tiny resin drops of the proper size
will be injected into the defect area if
you inject too much resin you can use a
fixer to suck resin back into the
syringe after you have the right amount
of resin injected you can cure it
immediately afterward using the
integrated UV LED light the long live UV
LED light has a tightly focused beam to
ensure rapid curing of the resin how
does it work the fixer uses a micro step
motor and a replaceable syringe to
release the desired amount of resin
either by individual drops or a
continuous strains the three buttons on
the body control the movement of the
syringe an activation of the UV light
besides repairs the fixer can also be
used as a glue tool so you could print a
large object in multiple pieces and glue
them together using the fixer other
possible applications for the fixer
include one insulate fix electronic
components on a circuit board to
high-precision extrusion head for DIY 3d
printer project three programmable mini
syringe pump for other liquid materials
the applications are limitless because
the fixer firmware is open source so you
can easily customize it according to
your needs there are four predefined
ejection speeds through the switch
is inside the fixer you can also
customize the injection speed curing
time or the operating sequence by
modifying the open source firmware the
fixer is very compact and can be held
and operated comfortably with a single
hand every single mechanical piece of
the fixer is manufactured by high
precision cnc machines using materials
with the highest quality and durability
it is cordless and powered by lithium
ion battery that is USB chargeable
included with the fixer as a kit
containing syringe needles of various
diameters as well as an assortment of
standing paper to help you get the best
finished quality tired of countless
repair failures excess resin spills and
general unhappiness with a whole repair
process try the fixer and you will see
how it can make the repair process
easier and help you improve the quality
of your models</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
