explore the amazing place around the
world and most importantly shopping we
all want to pack every souvenir wear
anything we've bought into the luggage
but we all face the same problem when we
pack no matter how you organize the size
of them will still be too much in the
end we cannot put everything the luggage
but make ourself tired oh and the dirty
clothes that's kicking off during the
trip we don't even want to mix it with
new clothes or maybe there is no space
for it already and after our research we
found out clothes bags and other sort of
things occupy more than fifty percent of
the luggage for a five-day trip
you
now we only need to do is to put our
clothes in tobago back think about it
put on bago plug in power and push the
bottom bago will automatically she and
Greg close
you can enjoy your time in the hotel or
any other place while they go is doings
job don't worry this intelligent Vega
will automatically stop when the process
is finished the only thing you need to
do is putting their strong vacuum back
into your luggage we can also use
printable battery to recharge bagel we
believe this convenient designed to make
chocoholic to buy more remember those
dirty clothes bagel vacuum back to
prevent smelly smell and urine so you
can keep luggage playing and use more
space efficiently in the same time to
make your overall trip even more
convenient so we use the general micro
USB cable for the recharge design create
extra space for your luggage to like
every space count currently Vega will
have four color and we'll have more
color collection in the near future each
bego will come with vacuum back for
clothes and soft stuffs
I know what I'm up against
the fitness industry is massive and
crowded
but I like being the underdog
because no one sees you coming we live
in a dynamic world twisting turning
Swain heaving why don't we trained that
way
the majority of us working on two
dimensions up and down forward backward
which is good but neglecting lights
movement patterns exposes our untrained
muscles to injury and poor function so
goal number one was designing a product
that would allow people to train how
they really move in life goal number two
was infusing the function of various
workout tools into one product at a
price point that people could afford I
wanted something that I could lift I
could try it slam
and drag something durable like it
withstand intense usage
I envisioned an all-in-one training
system so people could easily vary the
weight loads they wouldn't have to
purchase multi products but they could
also use the shop bell filler weights
like a dumbbell kettlebell barbell and
slamball
in one year I went from this to this
final had accomplished my two girls
an affordable versatile real world
training tool that can be used anywhere
but I wanted validation from experts in
the field so reached out to a master
level colita strength coach that has
trained over 300 All American athletes
45 Olympians and 150 plus pro athletes
like Peyton Manning and Jason Witten to
name a few it's unbelievable the things
you can do with it we use it every day
for lifting for our power for our
explosiveness it's just a well thought
out design
and the beauty of it all is that people
can train how they really move in life
which improves performance and optimizes
the human experience of how we work and
how we play
