we need to drink it sure we know it's
healthy but just Anastasia's exciting is
all those flavored drinks which means we
drink a lot less water and a whole lot
more that job hey and that's a problem a
very big problem so we decided to put
some fun into drinking water with the
right code it's the world's first ever
fruit-flavored cup designed to get
people drinking more water sure it might
look simple but it actually took six
years of research and patented
technologies to get where we are today
and we believe it's going to be a real
game-changer so how does it work well
for starters our brain identifies flavor
using two main sense of taste and smell
that's why we inserted innovative
fda-approved fruit scent and flavor
directly into the right job so when you
drink water from it your nose picks up
for fruity aroma your tongue senses the
hint of a sweet taste and your brain
yells what in fact you're only drinking
natural water oh wow great but doesn't
work well we asked ourselves a very same
question so we put the right cup to the
test with an orange flavored prototype
whoa okay wow you're kidding me right
what's in this not just a lot of taste
like something out just water crazy
brilliant
mmm
this is sacrifice the world's first
digital desktop back informer now
