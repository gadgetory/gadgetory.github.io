we need to drink it sure we know it's
healthy but just Anastasia's exciting is
all those flavored drinks which means we
drink a lot less water and a whole lot
more that job hey and that's a problem a
very big problem so we decided to put
some fun into drinking water with the
right code it's the world's first ever
fruit-flavored cup designed to get
people drinking more water sure it might
look simple but it actually took six
years of research and patented
technologies to get where we are today
and we believe it's going to be a real
game-changer so how does it work well
for starters our brain identifies flavor
using two main sense of taste and smell
that's why we inserted innovative
fda-approved fruit scent and flavor
directly into the right job so when you
drink water from it your nose picks up
for fruity aroma your tongue senses the
hint of a sweet taste and your brain
yells what in fact you're only drinking
natural water oh wow great but doesn't
work well we asked ourselves a very same
question so we put the right cup to the
test with an orange flavored prototype
whoa okay wow you're kidding me right
what's in this not just a lot of taste
like something out just water crazy
brilliant
mmm
this is sacrifice the world's first
digital desktop back informer now
everyone can shape in for plastic like a
seasoned pro with vacuform smart
efficient and easy to use features such
as they exclusively design
high-performance hybrid vacuum system
that delivers extremely detailed shape
and part a computer-controlled heater
and thermal probe the monitors of
plastic temperature in real time and a
built-in library of heating profiles for
Barris material so you're sure to get
perfect results part after part after
part just select a correct profile from
the menu right start and wait for the
vacuum to switch on once it's gone all
you have to do is lower the handle bar
and begin vacuum forming with a vacuform
you get a compact professional-grade
vacuum former without the hefty price
tag allowing you to finally get that
full rolling on that business idea of
yours or simply make things for your own
personal enjoyment whatever those things
might be whether it's one of designer
toys custom packaging for bespoke
gadgets or one-of-a-kind art pieces
like bison my project I'll be able to
produce the first batch of vacuform and
put them in the hands of makers
everywhere helping them bring their
awesome idea supplies i'll also be able
to do further research on new raw
materials and develop vacuform software
even more continuously expanding its
library of feeding profiles so bachy
form actually gets better with time now

investment looking for more details feel
