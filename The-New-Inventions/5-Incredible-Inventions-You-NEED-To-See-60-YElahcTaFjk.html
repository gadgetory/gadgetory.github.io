think better look better we just are
better level is not just another fitness
tracker it is the first and only
wearable to measure your hydration
letting you know precisely how much
water you need to feel and perform your
best level also measures your heart rate
sleep quality calories activity and mood
and can integrate all of that
information to show you what kind of
improvements you can see both in your
sleep and during exercise almost all of
us at some point during the day are
dehydrated and those little gaps and
staying up when your hydration needs
have consequences you can lose
concentration and can have an effect on
your mood it could affect your sleep
when you first wake up in the morning
your first thing should for you to go
grab a glass of water you'll find that
maybe you'll need as much coffee and you
definitely want me too much food water
will level set actually just how hungry
you are so it prevents overheating by
drinking more water you suddenly have
more energy what do you have more energy
for working out and when you're working
out you have better endurance your
joints and your muscles don't hurt as
much and you don't feel as much pain the
effect of that workout is continuing on
throughout the day you're wearing more
calories now that you've done the work
out studies have shown if you were
hydrated throughout the day it's better
for you sleep and you're going to be
more rest in so you have to see all of
this as part of a whole what I like
about level is it gives you the data and
says this is how much you need to get
balanced in life level was designed for
twenty four seven where and can learn
your activity and hydration habits not
only trending them but identifying
patterns that are keeping you from your
best
most consumer wearable devices can only
measure a fraction of the metrics that
are important to us so we focused on
research we turn to the world of medical
devices where accuracy and precision are
tightly monitored now we've developed a
revolutionary red light technology that
can look ten times deeper into the body
measuring 10 times when any other sensor
can all with industry-leading accuracy
we're excited to return to Kickstarter
with level our mission is to
revolutionize wearable health and
performance no matter if you live to
train or trying to live we can't wait to
see what you'll accomplish by measuring
what really matters
we are a team of Silicon Valley
engineers we have created the elusive
cap which means now you can capture 3d
videos wherever and whenever you want
everything you capture with lucid camp
you can either relive that moment or you
can live stream in real time and be
there each of these lenses lets you
capture 180 degrees in all directions
fully immersive complete 3d content and
the playback is just amazing it's
durable sleek compact you can share it
put in your pocket you can be able to
match on your chest you can put it on a
hat you can take it anywhere and capture
the content you want to create new suit
Kim has a personal meaning for me i was
born in China raised in Germany I was
always far away from my family the most
important person for me was my
grandmother I always wanted to capture
and share experiences with her as close
as I was seeing them pictures and videos
on the 2d screen just didn't do it for
me because it feels like you are
observer but now with Lucy camp she can
see the experiences through my eyes and
can walk with me into an experience you
want to share one it connects other
people to the experience you had reduce
it cam can only capture 180 degrees to
us copic audio and video but can also
live stream this data across the
internet or imagine scaling up a model
from 180 degree 2 3 16 by using multiple
cameras you can use whatever favorite
video editing tool could be anything you
want and you can touch it up you can
edit it however you want for those who
doesn't have the ocular device we could
use a very simple cardboard place your
device inside the cardboard select your
video and start playing but if you don't
have a VR cardboard then you can switch
that into a 2d screen and it still feels
like you are seeing exactly what your I
saw that
so the awesome thing about virtual
models and it takes away limits to life
if you mount the lucid cam on to the
front of a VR headset you can see the
world through the cameras lenses then
you can create overlays and add 3d
objects content creation and virtual
reality becomes unlimited
