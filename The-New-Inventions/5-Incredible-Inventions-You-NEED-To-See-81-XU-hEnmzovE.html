made a while back it's like that it has
a certain feeling to it it was an era
when people had time to pay attention to
every detail and things were made to
last inspired by the old headlights
we've collected over the years we
combined our skills to create something
useful really amazing we would be proud
of having around
we wanted it to have a personality
the stance had to inspire confidence
just like a superhero stance the
footprint is large enough to keep it
balanced the size was chosen souls be
tall enough to provide light for the
entire office the head rotates in any
direction and at any angle it's even
large enough to be used as a headphone
stand we fitted it with LED light
sources to have the perfect light for
any situation a clear one for reading
that you could easily turn on or off and
set the intensity just by touch and an
RGB controlled by mobile turn it on or
off change the color or intensity while
sitting comfortably on the couch this
light can even be safe to music so we'll
flash to the beat when you're having a
park
look some functionality weren't enough
the materials had to be top-notch as
well the head is made out of old tractor
headlights it's all metal and glass so
it would last even in the toughest
conditions the neck the only exposed
part is made from aluminum so it won't
rust body is made from recycled
polyurethane to help the environment a
bit we wanted everyone to be able to add
a personal touch to it so starting from
day one you can choose a color to match
your room style to match your
personality to have full body coverage
each lamp so we'll have two layers of
non-toxic water-based paint and two
basic layers of clear coat to protect
the paint job from wear and scratch over

own course to be who we are and to
determine our own way when you think
about the Internet why should it be any
different
shouldn't technology make us more free
in today's digital world you might think
that your cloud service gives you
freedom but the big print giveth and the
small print taketh away whether you know
it or not our search for convenience has
led us to give up certain freedoms
freedoms like ownership privacy
permission when it comes to cloud
services we've essentially uploaded all
of our belongings to someone else's
computer so that person or business can
then turn around and rent those things
back to us all for a monthly fee our own
stuff stuff that we paid for why are we
ok with that
maybe or not that's weird applet comes

being lost
her moments her memories the music that
shaped our lives we want to help take
back the power to choose how when and
where our digital lives unfold it's why
we created cloud by dadly it's the first
personal home cloud that gives you back
the keys

more using your data to size them
because we believe convenience shouldn't
come such a cost

life join us become the master of your
dad like oh yeah
