experience of riding we combine the
motion sensing technology from a
smartphone the motor and battery
technology like you find in a Tesla
create a self-balancing electric
skateboard control simply by leaning
your body we started with a dream of a
hoverboard the smooth feeling of flying
over pavement
inspired by this vision in the future we
created an incredible ride that feels
like a natural extension of your balance
one wheel is designed to be intuitive
whether you're a pro are never been on a
board you can learn the basics and under
a minute and there's plenty of room to
challenge yourself by riding more
aggressively or inventing new tricks
there are no hand controls you just lean
toward your front foot to go faster and
your back foot to slow down or even
reverse regenerative braking kicks in as
you come to a stop at the heart of one
wheel is a state-of-the-art direct drive
brushless motor in the hub of the
movement and balance are achieved by a
custom controller the read zero and
accelerometer sensors thousands of times
a second the high speed charger gives
the lithium batteries maintenance
we made one we like a youthful and
dynamic experience unlike skateboarding
where you feel every little crack and
pebble in the street one wheel feels a
lot more like surfing or snowboarding a
large tire and carefully tuned
algorithms allow you to carve the
pavement as if it were water or fresh
powder we've invested five years and a
lot of money building countless
prototypes to get one wheel to where it
is today
everyone who rides it loves it and with
your help we want to make one wheel
available to the world
we've worked with all kinds of
manufacturers on other projects and we
believe the u.s. is the best place to
build an advanced products like one
wheel that kind of quality cost money so
we need backers like you who share our
vision of creating amazing electric
vehicles with your backing will pay for
tooling costs and build the first ever
one wheel production join us in
revolutionising the experience of ride
X Kate released the first wireless
electric skateboard in 1997 the patented
design was truly revolutionary as both a
skateboard and an electric vehicle for
the past 16 years we've been at the
forefront of the electric skateboard
world once just for extreme sports
enthusiasts and skaters now surfers
snowboarders motocross riders BMXers and
eco-friendly commuters have each found a
place for lectures skateboards our
newest platform the proline 600 v3
launched in 2012 with new tooling
stronger and lighter materials us mate
electronics the lithium batteries it's
lighter faster smoother more powerful
more reliable and more efficient than
any board before it but the biggest
improvement is our modular design the v3
is the first fully customizable electric
skateboard and can fit any riders
preferences from daily commute to hard
packed dirt adventure motor and battery
technology have advanced rapidly in the
past few years but upgrading motors and
batteries isn't revolutionary being
state-of-the-art requires more than
taking high-end off-the-shelf components
and bolting them to existing hardware
our incredibly loyal customers have
provided amazing feedback over the years
and we've listened in response our
boards are designed to offer the perfect
blend of performance and affordability
based on each rider style and needs tens
of thousands of boards sold and
incredible customer feedback that
brought us here the next revolution
Electric skateboarding the proline v3
dual sport the d/s isn't just an upgrade
to our already top-of-the-line flagship
it's the only electric skateboard that
can slash a carve on asphalt and offer
all-terrain performance off the pavement
in a single platform but the altered v3d
S offers more than just - more than one
it blends the joy of surfing the carve
of snowboarding and the freedom of
skateboarding with the excitement of
mountain biking and the thrill of a
motocross race all while offering more
affordability and all around
transportation convenience
segue our patented torsion truck design
offers fast and easy transitions from
Street to off-road with two nuts in a
plug you move from sidewalk to
all-terrain or back we found that
there's no setup that works for every
rider with modular Dex wheels trucks
bushings batteries and motors you decide
what you want out of your board now or
anytime in the future want to cut weight
and range for short distance commutes
swap out to a lightweight lift the
impact want to go off-road and do things
never before done on the skateboard in
less than two minutes you can move from
Street to off-road the proline D s lets
you do both in the same package
hey guys I'm Josh this is Milton and we
designed gnarly Electric skateboards
electric skateboarding has been around
for quite a while but I think we'll do
fine
is it mostly electricity before it's
available or underpowered one wheel
drive and they really lack that fun
factor so an attempt to bring fun back
there back to electric skateboard and
I'd like to introduce you guys on our
boards now roads are the most powerful
electric state words they're the fastest
electric skateboard they have the
longest range they have the most
traction and they have the shortest
recharge time
I designed our boards during my senior
year studying industrial design I
started off by designing this hand
controller the green part of this rocker
accelerates the skateboard and the red
part applies the regenerative brakes the
rocker pushes on planetary gears which
spin the potentiometers for a linear and
smooth acceleration after I designed the
hand before I built this prototype for
my dad oh yes precise control I got to
walk manic and after I test drove it I
knew that I wanted to make one for
myself so spent countless hours
designing parts talking to awesome
people and visiting a local
manufacturing shop to come up with this
this and this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
