what inspired us to create something
everyone can use to capture the Flies in
and around their home you might not
realize but flies carry the Eco matter
from your pets waste or your neighbors
pet waste into your home and deposit it
on food prep services and food where
they excrete digestive enzymes and then
slurp it up yep the garbage can fly chef
works because flies are naturally
attracted to your garbage it doesn't
require a chemical attractants unsightly
flypaper or chasing a fly around with a
swatter the trap also includes a
disposable cartridge and a quick release
button that allows for hands-free
disposal directly into your garbage can
and it also works for those annoying
little fruit flies so interesting let
Dennis show you how it works
the garbage can fly trap is a device
that is installed in the lid of a
garbage can lies being attracted to the
set of your garbage to seek the easiest
route to gain access we have designed
the garbage can flytrap to let flies
think they have found Oh No they enter
through the center of the trap on the
exterior of the garbage can under the
quick release button and follow their
nose to a disposable cartridge below
located on the interior of the garbage

with white paper which prevents their
escape to replace the disposable
cartridge simply press the quick release
button allowing the cartridge to fall
into your garbage and snap on a new
cartridge and you are ready to capture
more flies after seven prototypes and
