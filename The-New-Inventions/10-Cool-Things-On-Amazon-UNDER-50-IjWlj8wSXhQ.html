little disc that's completely sealed so
you can put it away in your bag a
backpack your pocket and take it out
again to use later a couple years ago I
was sitting with some friends having
coffee and we had this idea a few days
later they sent me these 2d drawings and
from there we kind of just went I knew
that we could make this thing we made it
a point to keep the design simple three
main parts are made from food grade
materials you can easily take them apart
and wash them in the dishwasher or by
hand and when they're put back together
they create a liquid tight seal

have you ever been bothered by a fly or
had one land on your sandwich we have
and having to throw food at ourselves is
what inspired us to create something
everyone can use to capture the Flies in
and around their home you might not
realize but flies carry the Eco matter
from your pets waste or your neighbors
pet waste into your home and deposit it
on food prep services and food where
they excrete digestive enzymes and then
slurp it up yep the garbage can fly chef
works because flies are naturally
attracted to your garbage it doesn't
require a chemical attractants unsightly
flypaper or chasing a fly around with a
swatter the trap also includes a
disposable cartridge and a quick release
button that allows for hands-free
disposal directly into your garbage can
and it also works for those annoying
little fruit flies so interesting let
Dennis show you how it works
the garbage can fly trap is a device
that is installed in the lid of a
garbage can lies being attracted to the
set of your garbage to seek the easiest
route to gain access we have designed
the garbage can flytrap to let flies
think they have found Oh No they enter
through the center of the trap on the
exterior of the garbage can under the
quick release button and follow their
nose to a disposable cartridge below
located on the interior of the garbage
can the disposable cartridge is lined
with white paper which prevents their
escape to replace the disposable
cartridge simply press the quick release
button allowing the cartridge to fall
into your garbage and snap on a new
cartridge and you are ready to capture
more flies after seven prototypes and
receiving valuable feedback from product
testing we are finally ready to
introduce this innovative device to the
market

people together with the touch of a
button it would now you can

in mind to replace wasteful single-use
plastic bottles with insulated bottles
made from stainless steel bottles that
can keep your coffee steaming hot and
bottles that can keep your water icy
cold

concept our idea was to create a brand
that combines modern styling with
exceptional performance life moves fast
and you need something to depend on a
bottle that goes everywhere you go a
brand that suits your lifestyle no
matter what it is or where it takes you
but we're not just a lifestyle brand
