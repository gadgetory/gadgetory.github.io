hello my name is Yvonne and I invented a
dream me don't worry this has nothing to
do with me before I reveal what it is i
would like to start my story from the
beginning and hereafter lead you to what
Jimmy is all about well I have a
tendency to wake up in the middle of the
night and when I do I would have mad if
you check the time this often annoys my
husband as he's a light sleeper so I
have to be very discreet not to disturb
him while laying in bed one night
checking the time males Twitter etc
similar to what most of us do on our
smartphone I thought to myself why not
have this feature display of time and
date on the ceiling integrated directly
onto my smartphone now that would be
truly smart and so the idea was born the
longer I think about this idea the more
I liked it because so many things came
together I usually have my smartphone
laying on my nightstand anyway
recharging for the next day why not
maximize its usage the darn thing is
loading anyway the first question that
came to mind was is a possible to use a
display of my smartphone for this idea
and if yes how can this be done for
several months we I shared my idea with
some friends and they liked it very much
examined a lot of designs and techniques
to achieve this idea finally the
combination between the display settings
and the usage design with special lens
comes to a breakthrough we decided to
call it dreaming after overcoming the
obstacles surrounding the hardware the
fun part began us we were experimenting
with the smartphone we thought we should
extend the features and that only just
short time and date but what else would
be nice to have well first we can
integrate other time zones and weather
at local destination or other places
most definitely and alone would make
sense of
worse okay how about a text to my
husband splashing on the ceiling which
kind of demands him to stop snoring oh
and yes this is cute and effective why
now let us count sheeps a falling asleep
method for both me and the kids the
application for iOS and for Android is
nearly finished at this minute we only
have to produce the dreamy hardware so
it's all up to you if you also like that
