my name is Tom divest oh I've been
building consumer electronics products
for most of my life trying to bring the
enjoyment of music to music lovers
around the world there's millions of
products around the world with my name
on them they've been bought mostly
because people really like the way they
sound and like the way they look so i
started a new company called como audio
and the first product is here called
solo this product was conceived to take
all of the forms of content delivery
available today than the music clever
and make them all accessible without the
use of a nap or a remote control by
simply touching a button so one can set
these presets and have a choice of their
favorite delivery systems whether it be
Spotify FM in DAV countries digital
radio I listen to the internet radio
Bluetooth there's two high-resolution
auxiliary inputs so that one can listen
to the best possible music available
today and you can access and use this
product completely without the use of an
external app or remote control so that
if you listen your music and you want to
make a phone call your phone is not
going to be occupied by playing the
music for you that said we do provide an
app we think may be one of the best
music playing apps on the market that
allows you to control many of these
products around your home so that if
you'd like to think the music together
all over your house for a party or
something it's rather easy to do with
this
the idea here was to make something that
first and always sounds very very good
we built this like a true hi-fi by
starting by taking a very robust box
wooden box building a four-layer voice
coil woofer and they don't tweeter the
way you would build any real high five
product and the box needs to be robust
because we have a 60 watt rms amplifier
to get true high fidelity sound and an
impressive amount of output solo was is
intended to be the benchmark for the
minimum amount of space in a hardware
necessary to deliver a room filling
amount of sound that said should someone
have a rather large room are rather
demanding output needs we've designed
duetto the wet though does exactly what
solo does except does more of it it has
more speakers and has a greater output
so for a large room for very demanding
listening levels duetto is the product
that we think people will like and we
also have a hard remote control that we
provide with the product so that if
you're sitting across the room and you
simply want to turn down the volume or
change stations you don't even have to
walk back to the product itself to do it
so if you're a music lover who would
like really great sound like to have all
the content available to you today and
have it at the touch of your fingers
without using a device or an appt solo
and duet so are the products for you
growing up our boards were our only
means of transportation and expression
that never changed for us even later on
in life but one eminent problem remained
throughout commute a lack of unity
until now writers are left of untimely
and inconvenient options the
inaccessible to strap system and the
dreaded hand carry through the use of
uni velcro grip our backpacks unite the
board to the writer itself writers
simply peel and apply the pre-cut design
onto their board which allows them to
quickly stick it onto their backpacks
my supporting us on Kickstarter will be
helping us fulfill our first production
room allowing us to continue uniting the
skating community we have created
solutions for the feature community and
we can only make it happen through your
support please help us achieve our goal
by sharing and contributing in any way
you can so from the union family to
yours we really hope that you see our
vision and can embark on this journey
with us
we brew a lot yeah that's that's it
my favorite memories of the first year
ciara moonshine we would gather with our
friends with invite customers in the
community Anthony would bring his
barbecue grilling food and having fun
Sharon beers drinks and we we proved we
had so many batches overlapping every
brew day we were doing multiple transfer
from primary to secondary for dry
hopping from secondary to third vessel
for clarification finding and from there
and carboys or kegs for carbonating and
bottling with that many projects
overlapping we were continually
frustrated and disappointed at how
poorly the cheap plastic tools we were
using we're working that the current
siphon tools weren't good enough that's
when we decided to make the best
siphoning tool we could our pro Brewers
siphon is the answer to that dream the
world's first and only full ed
constructible cleanable and totally
sanitized eval homebrew siphon starter
it is the most consistent and reliable
transferring tool making the perfect
rack convenient and easy every time made
entirely out of stainless steel and
silicon any concern of harboring bad
bacteria or creating cross-contamination
is eliminated with an hour in the oven
we continually hear feedback from our
customers friends brew club members that
there was a real need for better home
brewing essentials we wanted to make
something of lasting value something
that would stand the test of time the
first installment from our pro brew
essentials series our pro brewers siphon
is one tool to Rack them all our plunger
gasket has three times the sealing
surface to guarantee no oxidisation and
our revolutionary removable check valve
can be easily cleaned and quickly
reattached in the event of clogging over
the last year we've gone through many
revisions we've tested many ideas you
had in
put from our friends and our customers I
think we've arrived at a design that
solves all of the questions that we were
looking to to solve throughout this
whole process we're now confident that
we have reached ultimate pro Brewers
siphon awesomeness and now we need your
help because turning ideas into reality
is an expensive process with your pledge
we will be able to contract with the
manufacturer of our choosing get the
tooling made and purchase our first
minimum order
on behalf of Sierra moonshine we thank
you for your continued support
