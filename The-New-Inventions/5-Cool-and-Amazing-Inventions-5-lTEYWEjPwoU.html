when companies were constantly pushing
the boundaries of innovation and design
putting out products so we're sometimes
even considered wacky we needed to
design a device that was not only an
incredible phone but also an amazing
wearable I used to repair a lot of
phones I had cracked screens or water
damaged and did it quite frequently and
when I took apart a lot of these phones
I noticed that a lot of the brands
shared similar construction and design
techniques and oftentimes used materials
that were obsolete like screws and using
rigid and fragile materials like glass
and even steel and thought to myself
there had to be a better way we first
started with a lot of different types of
concepts and designs and after a lot of
iterations and testing and vetting we
really kind of narrowed it down to two
designs which was a large and a small
and before you knew that the portal was
born
we needed to ensure that it was not only
waterproof but also flexible
shatterproof and where we needed to
build a team of incredible people with
the wide range of skill sets who are all
unified to pursue our mission and break
the mold in the mobile market the
problem with the mobile market right now
is that the phones are all the same and
what little differentiation they have is
that some are less user-friendly and
some are less durable things like this
still happen so we're here to change
that with the vibrant palates clean
typography and easy to understand icon
set the portal UI is experience it
cannot be missed why be stuck with the
same old design when you've got a new
refreshing interface to play with an
interface that hurts to interact that
knows what you want and works with you
in the way that you want it to work the
portal not only has all the features you
would expect such as Wi-Fi Bluetooth and
NFC but also has a waterproof Kevlar
infuse polyurethane body a 6 inch
flexible display wireless charging an
unlock network and so much more
you
you
we believe the technology should be
seamless and it should give you more
from the experience as you will our
technology fundamentally enhances human
call from Sarah turn left in 20 miles
it's just the new evolution the story
then I think this is hot that feels like
tomorrow it really really does it feels
like tomorrow you've taken all that can
electronically high tech cars and just
put it right here honestly it's gonna
change everything when you put on a
skully helmet you get an essentially an
ecosystem assuage it generally insulting
into a platform yeah then suddenly he
got a level of innovation that you had
then fold of that before being a
professional motorcycle racer takes a
lot of fun away from raping from riding
on the stoop but this could make it fun
again it will make your riding safer
with its high-speed microprocessor and
operating system it's the smartest
motorcycle helmet ever imagined scully
is the future

introducing an open SDK to enable
developers to add and roam IAM
optimization to the apps we've already

hundreds of thousands of downloads and
extremely positive reviews we've been
developing the Superbook Anand Rome iam
for over a year and we're excited to

our prototypes are complete and we're
ready to move into full production we're
looking for your support to help us make
this new kind of computing a reality the
