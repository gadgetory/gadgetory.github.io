wallet which is slim and completes can
hold up to ten cards yet has enough
pressure to secure only one can hold up
to twenty bills that are easy to access
thanks to the integrated separator my
name is Mihai i'm a co-founder of design
and progress makers of Adisa i used to
have a huge wall at full of bills cards
and all its papers didn't have business
cards in it
I tried leather sleeves but it was
awkward to use with cards and bells in
it at the same time and the only limited
me to a few cards are bills we went out
there to explore the needs we wanted to
understand how do people interact with
wallet and what can we do better for
them or is all surprised us mostly
people carry seven to ten cards and
around seven bills on a daily basis
today it's all about carbs and bills we
pay with cars white and to buy ourselves
with cards we even use them as keys
as for rebels well cash is stoking
pretty much everywhere you go and since
you will carry these items every day we
wanted to make it simple
hi I'm max co-founder of design in
progress
makers of Odessa as a mechanical
designer I've always been into making
everyday life easier
when we set out to reimagine a
conventional wallet we determine the
essentials and sketched out possible
solutions
we tried different designs 3d printed
prototypes and tested different
materials we wanted something minimalist
and elegant that can stand out with its
design carbon-fiber make that possible
and it looks pretty awesome why carbon
fiber well it's got an incredible
strength to weight ratio it's even used
by NASA in Formula One it's very light
and resistant that's exactly what we
needed for the c1 in addition it
protects your cards from RFID detection
that means you won't get conned ask for
the shape we wanted harmony between form
and function so that's what we did with
the c1 we took out everything
unnecessary we input a modern look of
carbon fiber with a touch of classic so
we added breaths after months of
research and developments we have a
byproduct a totally redefined wallet
that fits your needs I've personally
used one of the early prototypes of
Burgesses you want for a couple of
months already and it is amazing all
monkey wallet is gone every time I pull
out my Siwan people around get
interested as what is it what is it made
from where can they buy it so the
interest is there we are now ready for
production all we need is you to make
this possible we can't thank you enough
for your support and we are really
excited for you to try you at Asus you
want
you
we set out to create the sexiest easiest
to use minimalist wallet in the whole
world and I think we've done just that
but it's time to find out for yourself
this is a regular wallet it's thick it's
heavy and it's filled with too many
things that you don't need at kisetsu we
believe in simplicity
meet Haru it's 98 millimeters long 73
millimeters wide and 3 millimeters then
oh and it's also RFID protected
here's how you use it the haru comes
with two quick access lines
front and back perfect for your two most
used cards
the hobby wallet also comes with a
utility compartment ideal for your less
used cards just fan it out and pick the
card that you need
now let's talk about the cash flow let
me take you through slides accessible on
both sides allowing your cash to be
taken out with ease
carry what you need
Carrie freedom
