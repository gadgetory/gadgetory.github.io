that slight headache or wooziness that
you feel at the end of your workday or
why your eyes burn when you cross the
street do you wonder if this is going to
cause a long-term problem for you or
your kids air pollution both indoors and
out is a global problem today you can
join us to challenge it this is Admiral
to a wearable air quality tracker that
measures real time air pollution
temperature and humidity it's the most
affordable and most compact air quality
tracker on the market today people don't
realize how what's in the air might
affect our health unless we have asthma
or allergies we don't notice any
immediate impact on our bodies and never
really care about the air around us but
during the day the concentration of
volatile organic compounds carbon
monoxide and carbon dioxide indoors may
increase dramatically if the ventilation
is not good enough with akma tube it's
easy to track the pollution around you
and understand what you can do to
breathe better in the big cities we are
often exposed to air pollution outside
too but we are always too busy to pay
attention to it add mo tube will
immediately alert you about potential
danger so you can prevent negative
health impacts add mo tube can sense
environmental changes in real time to
help to make the right choices every day
and live healthier we have been helping
other companies to invent and develop
hardware and software products for years
we finally decided that it's time to
solve our own problem we've been working
on at mode tube for over a year to
achieve the most accurate readings from
the sensors craft it's beautiful and
durable titanium body and create the
best user experience from the data that
the admiral tube detects now we're ready
to share it with you pre-order your add
mo tube now and be smarter about the air
that you breathe I came up with the idea
for a translator when I met a French
girl that's really where the story
starts I was on vacation and i met this
girl it was difficult for us to
communicate because she didn't speak
english very well and even when we tried
to find a solution like using some
translation app to communicate it's
horrible look if you're not speaking and
our phones are in a face like this
forget it it's the wall we're out of
this railroad interaction but this in
your ear just right back in it ludie huh
put this in your here is my Symon oh hey
i put in your concern yeah okay didn't
hear me french leavin me I'll tell the
whole thing yes I can hear you talk
Spanish of course miss but this is
awesome but how you do it yeah it's
translating translating
this little wearable uses translation
technology to allow two people to speak
different languages but still clearly
understand each other simply put when
one person speaks the other here is it
in their language developing the pilot
has been an intensive process our team
has been work on it over two years
andrew is original co-founder and
overseas prior development I'm an
electrical engineer and expert and
manufacturing we also have mechanical
engineer software engineer PhD and
machine translation as well as an
industrial designer our wide breadth
experts has allowed us to develop a
product for the ground up we wanted to
create something that hugs the curves of
the air without being obtrusive
something snug but fashionable to wear
in the process we just decided to throw
in an extra ear piece for wireless
trimming music that means the full
system includes two ear pieces and its
accompanying app it's from the app
itself where all of the languages are
uploaded to the ear piece it's kind of
an end-all solution for the traveler or
the international professional that's
what we're doing here at Waverly laughs
it's simply the most advanced
communication wearable
they say Nikola campaign helps us finish
what we started we can get the earpieces
along with this portable charger
manufactured in delivered within a year
the app works on its own if you just
want to use the app for basic
translation and we'll have the app out
by late summer first for our backers
here in indy gogo but for the full
experience you really want to get a
pieces too it's the dream you know a
life untethered free of language
barriers it's just that it's no longer
dream anymore it's real
I've always been a night owl I was a
kind of guy who would who dis news
button repeatedly they got to a point
where I started reading mornings I felt
unproductive and lethargic all the time
I tried everything i did a sleep study i
downloaded tons of apps then I heard
about padlocks alarm clock as soon as a
device arrived at download the app the
next morning I felt the device vibrate I
was feeling groggy and tired so I didn't
get up then it beeped but I still didn't
get up and then I felt this app and I
was up for the first time in a long time
I felt energized I put it on again and
when it went off in the morning it felt
different as soon as I felt it vibrate I
jumped straight out of bed it's been two
months since I tried padlock
everything's changed I no longer have
the feeling of waking up stressed
exhausted or rushed i used to be a night
owl now i'm a morning person hey me go
go last year you helped us exceed our
fundraising goal to develop Havelock the
first wearable device that uses a mild
electric stimulus to break bad habits
when our supporters receive their
devices they all asked us for the same
thing they wanted an alarm clock so we
built a very simple app the pavlik alarm
before i got my padlock i tried having
people call me setting my phone on the
other side of the room alarms that go
every 15 minutes for three hours
different ringtones I've tried setting
my actual alarm clock last semester I
almost failed a couple of my classes
because I slept in you're my 8 and 9
a.m. classes and I couldn't wake up to
my alarms even with that many I'm
actually nearing the end of the spring
semester now I've had my padlock for
almost the duration and I haven't missed
a single class so it's really like
impacted my life and a great way I would
set 20 different alarms and I would just
use through all of them at one point I
had my friends calling me at certain
times but then I somehow would just
ignore their calls but it was just
pretty bad so ever since i've been using
padlock all i have to do is just set
that on and I pretty much get up right
when it goes off and it's awesome so I
don't need
50 million different backups like I
always had before killing the habit of
sleeping in has changed my life in a
many different ways in the morning I can
do whatever I want I can I can exercise
I can meditate I can watch the videos I
can read I can trade all these are many
different things that I couldn't do in
the past and right now that I can't wake
up on time I can be much more productive
than before so we're back on IndieGoGo
because we want to create the world's
best alarm clock with your help and
support we can add three new features
first snooze lock I'd luckily use motion
tracking know when you get out of bed
and it won't let you cheat to
accountability the padlock will let your
friends know as well and three sleep
cycle analysis the padlock will use
motion tracking and accelerometer data
track your sleep cycles and make sure
that you are woken up at the perfect
time now we're not like every
crowdfunding campaign usually are
worried about if the product is real or
if the team can deliver unlike other
projects we have a proven product we
have a proven team we just need your
help to help us implement the features
that will convert our breaking bad
habits padlock into the world's best
alarm clock make sure to check out our
campaign page take a look at our awesome
perks and help us build the alarm clock
that really works

we spend about ninety percent of our
time indoors and the air we breathe in
here is two to five times more polluted
than outdoors imagine all the chemicals
dust and toxic gases trapped in a room
nowhere to go and the worst part is we
do nothing about it simply because you
don't know
you who is a smart indoor air quality
sensor that detects and alerts you of
allergens and toxins in the air you
breathe think of the places you and your
loved ones spend the most time in do you
know the quality of the air in your
office at work in your hotel room when
you travel how about in your own living
room or your child's bedroom these are
important because VOCs are found in
paint and household cleaning products
dust can accumulate unseen in fabric
around us and humidity encourages the
growth of bacteria and mold all these
cause respiratory problems skin
irritations and overall poor health in
the long run you who lets you know when
something's not right and what you can
do the simplest and easiest things to do
make the biggest difference cut down on
chemical cleaners wash your child's
favorite toys air out your living areas
and check on possible gas leaks don't
leave it to chance or guesswork you who
keeps track of the air you breathe round
the clock so that you and your loved
ones get to live work and play in the
best and safest possible environment
it is the most comprehensive indoor air
quality detector on the market today
with eight dedicated sensors that detect
volatile organic compounds dust carbon
monoxide carbon dioxide ozone air
pressure temperature and humidity hi I'm
Dustin co-founder of you there's a very
simple reason why we created you there's
a real need for the air we breathe
affects all of us why do we spend so
much energy and money on nutrients and
supplements and yet ignore the air that
we breathe we spoke to numerous
professionals who are otherwise healthy
with almost fatigue we heard from asthma
sufferers we have persistent symptoms
and travelers who fall ill because the
air quality in their hotel rooms are not
at optimal levels we also heard from
parents who always worried about what
their kids are exposed to both at home
and in school and the thing is we can't
fix what we don't know and there has
never been an easy and affordable way to
find out until now
with you who your world just got a
little safer and you and your family
just got healthier
