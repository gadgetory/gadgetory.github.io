we'll put his dream into that box
this is ming dokis dream a perfect chair
made from 60 loose elements that you can
put together any way you want but the
beginning of min doga stream didn't
start here you cannot make anything
beautiful without making your hands
dirty as always say for every architect
it's a dream to create a church in the
same way for every designer in the world
it's a dream to create a perfect chair
spin d consists of 1260 pieces of wood
put together by hand each element is
treated with natural oil which makes it
strong enough to stand both inside and
outside the spin da is simple but the
process is super complicated actually
it's the human spine built into the
perfect chair very flexible and very
very strong I spent many nights building
prototypes improving the technology
finding the perfect locking systems and
this is the hardest part of process
making it smooth pitch all handmade and
needs a lot of patience the first time I
saw spending it was during the
exhibition I touched it and I couldn't
believe it it felt like silk from that
moment I just knew is going to be a big
journey we went international
exhibitions we want international awards
we were showing it not as a simple chair
but as a unique piece of furniture wood
endless possibilities spin d comes with
a manual of 25 detailed instructions
showing that you can build any chair
it's just long an armchair or well even
your sports equipment one thing endless
possibilities
to produce this year it just takes too
long so that's why we're asking for your
support to simplify the process and to
bring this chair from exhibitions to
reality into your home during this
crowdfunding campaign we're offering a
very special edition of spend each year
with the proper endings for everyone
that buys finger on this crowdfunding
campaign would give lifetime guarantee
the cost is perfect we are ready please
help us to make our dreams come true by
sharing our campaign every bit helps
thank you
introducing knit bar the main hub is the
brain and it's Wi-Fi enabled it tracks
and monitors electricity usage at an
outlet level you can plug it directly
into an outlet or use it as a power bar
where you can add many different modules
like smart outlets USB chargers a Wi-Fi
repeater and an environment sensor that
tells you about the temperature humidity
light and sound level in your ambience a
surge protector keeps everything safe
and the extension cable well it makes
things easier all the modules beat with
the main hub and the main hub speaks
with your Wi-Fi this allows the main hub
to send your outlet level electricity
usage to the NIT app you can view your
usage historically and in real time the
app also enables you to remotely control
schedule and set smart rules to automate
when things turn on or off the
possibilities are endless through the
NIT app you can easily see the
consumption of your different appliances
and electronics so that you can better
understand your electricity usage and
wisely manage it to save money Nick bar
monitors your electricity consumption in
real time so it will know when a
specific task has completed and will let
you know about it it will also remind
you when you're being forgetful
and don't worry everyone has done that
nip bar is not just about power it's a
platform that knits everything together
the environment sensor lets you know
about the ambient temperature light and
humidity in your home or business
helping you use your appliances and
electronics in a smarter way please join
us on this exciting journey of helping
us bring that bar to the world two
minutes three times a day for your whole
life have you ever thought about how
much time in your life you spend
brushing your teeth how many other
wonderful things could you do in this
time
I'm Aldo de Medici let me expand in my
ten years experience as a dentist I got
clear evidence of how prevention is the
key in oral health but you would never
imagine that most of the problems
originate from an incorrect tooth
brushing technique today for us it is
unacceptable that children can make
mistakes brushing their teeth the adults
still don't dedicate enough time to do
it properly that the elderly lack an
effective device for prevention we want
everyone to be able to brush their teeth
in a simple fast but mostly an effective
way that's why we invented glare smile
glare smile is the first toothbrush
which thanks to three brushes
automatically removes dental plaque the
correct way what you need to do to brush
all your teeth is to simply slide it for
10 seconds along your dental arches
using glare smile you won't risk
mistakes and you'll save a lot of
precious time in your life
I believed in this project from the very
beginning as I wanted to be the first
one to try glare smile so creating a
device which could improve our everyday
life was a fascinating challenge we
engaged in the development of the
product by addressing the problems of
hundreds of patients and by studying the
correct brushing movement with several
laboratory tests and we developed a
brand new unusual design one hundred
percent of made in italy forget your
usual toothbrush it is absolutely
user-friendly you can start and stop it
with a single button but also select
many functions with a large touchscreen
display such as four different preset
brushing modes it comes with
interchangeable brushes with the size
for adults and a size four children and
has a countdown which alerts when it is
time to change them a UV LED to kill
bacteria automatically activates when it
is switched off and the removable cap
provides a mechanic cleaning mode for
brushes with rechargeable batteries a
USB charger and a docking station it
will always be ready to use furthermore
glare smile is also eco-friendly thanks
to recyclable materials and a solar
charger you can connect glare smile to
an app which shows you the usage
statistics so that as a mother you can
be sure that your children are brushing
the right way we want to create a true
revolution in oral health you have to
make sure that everyone from children to
adults to the elderly can have
guaranteed oral prevention always we've
already put a lot of effort in research
tests and in developing many prototypes
to create the final product our need now
is to build the critical mass to face
the investments of mass production
reaching the campaign goal with your
help will enable the manufacturing of
the first batch so that you could be
among the first to try glare smile glare
smile will let you discover how simple
and fast it can be to brush your teeth
the right way
Claire smile the simplicity of your
smile planet is suffering humanity waste
billions of disposable everyday products
yearly most of them end up in dumps and
ocean burning liquid fuels has great
impact on global warming 2015 was the
hottest year in recorded history climate
change is real and is happening right
now involved we have a solution once
great man said small step for man gently
prevent crime involved we believe that
small things make a big difference on
each one of us lives responsibility for
future generations and the help of our
ecosystem today we're proud to present
all world's most eco-friendly lighter
that will make the change in our
everyday habits supporting the help of
our planet unlike plastic liners vault
is made to last for years vault lighter
is simply charged the USB cable it is
made from recyclable products and it's
not used any liquid fuel vault is
powerful enough to light up just
anything you can think about from kettle
to bonfire vault is win
and waterproof bulk lighter will hold a
charge for more than a month depending
on usage frequency another amazing
feature of fault is that it has super
fast charging system and it takes only
about five minutes to fully charge the
ladder while average lighters last a
couple of months bolt will serve four
years everything is ready for production
please supported by making a pledge to
me it is time to recharge</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
