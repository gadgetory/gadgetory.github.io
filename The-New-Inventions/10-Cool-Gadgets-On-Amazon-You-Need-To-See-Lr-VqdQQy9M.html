the case is very easy all you need to do
is slide your phone in and then attach
the bottom piece and screw it down
looking at our case we have a very
screen protector friendly design we have
cutouts so you can have access to all
your original ports and buttons and we
also have a flip-out kickstand on the
back that allows you to set it down and
watch your movie the unique part of our
case is the removable disk on the back I
can take this disc off which opens up my
case to a world of possibilities one of
our attachment is our revolver lens you
can attach this to the back of the case
and this gives you access to four
different types of lenses on your phone
here we have a circular polarizing
filter which allows you to cut glare on
windows or even make the skies blue word
here we have a fisheye lens which gives
you that really distorted fisheye
wide-angle look next we have a
wide-angle lens which gives you just a
little bit wider field of view if you
remove the wide-angle lens this is our
macro lens a macro lens allows us to get
really close to our subject and really
magnify it

flip the lens back in the case and all
the lenses are protected by the case

return the case back to its slim profile

friends let's try the selfie stick
strategy still can't fit everybody in
annoying situations am i right we've all
been there buddy that's how our selfie
was born a perfect team gathered
together working in London Milan and
Shanghai to combine micro flying
technologies ultralight HD cameras

selfie can travel in a 20 meter radius
and hovers for up to three minutes it's
easily controllable from both iOS or
Android smartphone apps it's only 52
grams and it's locked into his phone
cover and recharges so what if the guys
had an air selfie with him they'd make
it hover find a perfect angle and leave
the controls finally snap an amazing
photo with the selfie delay timer mode
while it is autonomously flying and
keeping its position in the air awesome
what about the two explorers they select
the classic flying mode from the three
options available control layer selfie
through the app by holding the phone
horizontally and take both memorable
photos and videos
and what would have happened at the
barbecue enough with the squeezing just

buttons to find the right distance to

again respond more than 40% of our lives
are spent in habit for most of us that
time is wasted the secret to
transformation is not to try harder it's
to replace bad habits with the habits of
excellence if you wanted to transform
yourself now would you start first
identify the habits that hold you back
paired them with a negative stimulus
like electric shock
each surge of voltage trains your brain
and weakens the neural connection until
the bad habit is severed next replace
the bad habit with a positive one reward
yourself when you complete your daily
goal commit to a penalty if you fail the
fear of loss stimulates your basal
ganglia while the chance of reward
motivates your prefrontal cortex in
fewer than 30 days the action becomes a
habit

help you build good habits and break bad
ones earn rewards when you succeed paid
the price when you fail and experience
