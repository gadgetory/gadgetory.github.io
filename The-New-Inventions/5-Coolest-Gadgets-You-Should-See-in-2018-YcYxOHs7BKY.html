way you like it wouldn't it be great to
do the same thing with a router
absolutely that's why we developed MUX
mock's is the first model more outer you
can put together according to your
expectations
plus it's powered by a secure self
updating operating system from omnia
your perfect router can consist of these
modules basic extension Ethernet and SFP
the basic module is powered by a passive
cooled marvel armada processor has a
micro SD card slot USB 3 and a gigabit
WAN port with the Wi-Fi card alone it
can serve as a pocket ready router or
you can connect it to your router for
example omnia as an access point if you
need faster wireless speed just connect
the extension module with a 5 gigahertz
Wi-Fi card connected to the M PCI
Express slot or you can switch the Wi-Fi
card with an SSD to make an ass or you
can insert a SIM card to the slot
connect an LTE modem and use this module
as a backup connectivity solution
you can also connect the ethernet module
with four gigabit ports
maybe you are lucky enough to have fiber
connectivity so you will find use for
the SFP module we are constantly
developing so you can look forward to
other modules that will be available in
the future hi welcome to tourists what
can I get for you

please okay they're out the primary goal
of C's ethnic is maintaining the Caesar

I believe we're all looking for
happiness and success it's the little
things like headaches tension and stress
that pile up and slow us down
when we spend a lot of time sitting
whether it be at work driving or even
doing too much exercise we tend to build
up a lot of tension my Chi can help
release that tension to increase blood
flow and oxygen and bring us back to
balance and bring us back to our best
achieve my Chi is a portable massage
unit so you can use it on a day-to-day
basis just about wherever you go I
created my Chi because I needed
something that work and wasn't a
pharmaceutical so we have two of our
body's main meridians that run through
the back of our neck and these do become
blocked based on the physical demands of
our day-to-day lives applying pressure
to these meridians releases the tension
and therefore increases the flow of
oxygen blood and life force energy
having something that can release these
blocks to relay our energy flow freely
between the body and head makes a
connection and clear the stuff out the
way so you get on through that
it's not something you have to wait for
you know within a couple of seconds you
automatically feel yourself drop in to a
state of relaxation it's just a matter
of taking long deep breaths to release
unwanted attentions and emotional
build-up
so my Chi is just the way the people to
start using these natural therapies and
moving away from the old ways of
pharmaceutical medicines
I've been studying and practicing
massage and bodywork for a couple of
years now so many people suffer from
tension headaches and emotional build-up
and stress throughout their days so I've
started having people come to me just to
have these specific pressure points
applied simply for the release of
headaches and migraines so pressure
point beliefs is a technique that's been
around for thousands of years I've only
created device that allows people to to
access this on a day to day basis my Chi
is a ninth year that I had 18 months ago
if I could make something that could
push this specific Meridian points in
the neck and it was affordable it could
be a highly beneficial tool to help
people in their lives thank you
everybody for watching something the
world needs it's meant to happen please
share the page jump on board and support
us mochi is an incredible product it's
going to help a lot of people if we can
just get it out there so much gratitude
to everybody we can't do this without
you let's make it happen thank you
meet Herbert your very own vertical farm
for fresh chillies mint basil chives
strawberries you name it Herbert can
grow it we created Harvard for you
because we wanted to make it possible
for everyone to grow their own food
doesn't matter if you don't have a lot
of space time or even if you don't have
a green thumb in Herbert you can grow up
to 15 plants at the same time and you
can harvest them whenever you need it
this way you can reduce your food waste
too and the best thing is you know
what's in your food no GMO no pesticides
no herbicides because you're growing
everything at home plants in Herbert
grow directly in water growing this way
is called hydroponics and it makes
planting less messy and consumes around
90% less water than growing plants in
soil and with our in-house develop LED
technology which mimic sunlight you can
grow fresh vegetables herbs and
strawberries all year-round and with a
simple swipe in our app you can change
the light settings to suit your own
needs in Herbert you can produce around
80 to 90 heads of lettuce every year
growing hydroponically yields 40% more
harvest than growing with traditional
farming methods that's a fresh head of
lettuce every four to five days for
three years we've been installing in
optimizing hydroponic systems into
restaurants and offices because there is
nothing better than sharing a dinner
with family and friends a dinner that
you're not only cooked by yourself but
that you harvested as well
