sizer to support various functions likes
my hand gesture control 3d movies
commercial Lolly's picture
synchronization and the keystone
correction
there's not always a perfect place for
your projector so we built the Aurora
with keystone correction software you
can get a straight on image even if
you're projecting from any angle most of
us used to work for traditional cubic
happening below that the widescreen
innovations in the market are too heavy
and too expensive so we went to produce
simple smart under football widescreen
TV which is just a man after two years
developing and more than hundred atem of
15 we finally make out the day for a
ruler we have already received not
positive feedback because that more
people a John asked to change the way we
watch and since and you are part of our
team project what are you our
imagination
around four years ago we started
development on mo geez Pro a small
device that can turn anything into a
musical instrument mochis is now used by
professional musicians and deejays all
over the world to bring unique sounds
and performances to life but this got us
thinking could we create a device that
could be used for a range of
applications from making music to
playing games something simple to use
something fun a device that everyone
wants to play with that also feels right
at home in the classroom we thought so
so we came up with mo geez play because
with it you can play the world mo geez
plays senses vibrations in the objects
it is attached to when these objects are
touched in different ways mo geez play
interprets them into sends or actions on
screen you can use pretty much anything
around use the software we've made is
extensive Jam makes you the artist
giving you accessible tools to instantly
build rhythms melodies and loops using
the acoustic properties of the objects
ranch
pulse is an addictive rhythm game it's
fast fun and unlike anything you've
played before it teaches the building
blocks of rhythm by stealth from simple
dance beats to afro-cuban patterns at mo
geez we want as many people as possible
to use mo geez play so we will be
sharing our technology with everyone
allowing developers to invent new ways
to inspire entertain and teach with mo
geez play with your help mo geez play
will be super affordable we will include
software as a free service our
Kickstarter backers will get new
features and apps in the future as we
develop them and will also offer special
mo geez play plans for educational and
therapeutic organizations with your
support we want to help a new generation
of musicians students gamers and tech
pioneers around the world to start
playing and creating with this unique
technology we need your help to achieve
our ambition of bringing a truly unique
device for gaming music and education to
life help us to launch more display as
an affordable product by supporting this
campaign thank you
