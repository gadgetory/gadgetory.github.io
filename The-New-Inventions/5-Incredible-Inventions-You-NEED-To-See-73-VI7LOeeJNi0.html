this is X Fighter X fighter can go where
you can't under the desk around
furniture and more
ex-fighter is as powerful as it is
beautiful it can be programmed easily to
perform all sorts of robotic tasks
point-and-click in an object on screen
you see ex-fighter navigate to it
automatically we've open sourced all of
the X fighter 3d models you can easily
modify and improve your ex fighter in 3d
print anyone not only connects fighter
reprogram it could also be trained
thanks to the powerful neural network
inside Intel Curie you can make
ex-fighter even cooler at a hat add an
art take the case imagination is the
limit as X spider hello everybody this
is Max and very happy to introduce
yourself sing we have been working out
for the past nine months it's powerful
and a beautiful robot is like spider but
before we get into the details we'd like
to show you the team behind the dike
spider and the how it goes to the idea
to start with Project X fighter was
created by the Robo if team the Robo if
team is passionate about making robots
most of the team members came from Team
water one of the top college robot teams
in China we won four championships in
RoboCup one of the top robotic
competitions for college students in
November 2015 we got the team back
together to create a robot that is as
beautiful as an anime figure and
deserving to be put on the scale it also
has to be powerful just like a program
of competition for nine months we worked
hard and went through dozens of designs
and hundreds of 3d printed parts per
testimony we made several iterations of
X fighter and publish the month
we got such a good response that we got
invited to the Frick shouts and forms we
went back to refining and improving our
ideas again and again going through more
than 26 redesigns 100 manuscripts and
over 500 3d models proves our passion
and persistence for robotics and our
ex-fighter project hi my name is Tapia
and this is a story about me and my
family hope you enjoy it it's already
evening lee
today weather is good temperature about
81 good day to work you only slept for
our last night not good so get home
early today take some rest and do you
need coffee latte as usual or espresso
espresso
how about sure
yeah you get a lipstick with you last
time
Lux number seven reorder Lux number
seven lipstick thank you definite
detector but Papa but but I thought
about that bow but thought I thought I
thought I thought I thought I thought I
thought I thought I but it's been two
weeks since last time you call you mom
don't you miss her maybe it's time to
stop barling with each other
happy I'll call my mom yes working for
you tobia dog robot companion
we've all gotten busier the pace of life
is changing around us every day with
constant access to screens we're losing
track of time ironically as we've become
more mobile we continue to spend our
lives sitting down static the seated
position remains king and what most
people tend to forget is how closely our
bodies and minds work together as our
bodies lack movement so to do our minds
you
yeah I lived in Vail for 16 years skiing
and riding my bike 60 80 days a year got
a corporate gig in Austin sit on my butt
60 80 hours a week and body starts
changing you know I need to start
feeling yourself kind of caving into
itself and I said feel right and like so
many I moved to a stand-up desk and
which was great it helped me and I just
felt more energetic like so many other
people that are doing it but I you know
start standing and my hips really hard
and blocking my knees out and I'll
sudden I started feeling pain and no it
started to think about how do i create
motion in life it's not just about
standing standings been great but I
really want to move
our product is called a level it's
designed to work with you you don't have
to think about it you just step on it's
just enough motion to get your heart
rate up a bit and simple enough that you
can multitask well on board so we
designed the level to create subtle
instability underneath your feet so when
you're working that you get out of your
joints when you're standing hard like we
stand like you're standing hard right
now yeah but when you get onto a board
like this it allows you just to flow
through it and get you into your muscles
so step on it and just see how it feels
everybody goes to the twist it's that
playfulness that you get to have you
know at a desk or places where you're
just gonna and then it just gives you
better positioning
there's a time to sit there's a time to
stand and there's a time to flow whether
you're in a cube a common meeting space
or in your living room it's time we all
get moving we hope to provide you the
shift where you need it most physically
emotionally or intellectually and
hopefully change the way you move
through work we've spent the last 18
months getting the design engineering
testing and now the tooling in place
help us get a little bit of motion in
your day and everyone stay around us</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
