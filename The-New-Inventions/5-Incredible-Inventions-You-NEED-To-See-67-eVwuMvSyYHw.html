lived without this just to see oh how
their lives might change
I just wanted ten things I can do with
it when their devices how is it floating
could float in midair introducing sky
float the world's first revolutionary
midair hands-free adjustable mount for
your phone or tablet watch read even
fall asleep or tuck it away when you're
done you can easily move sky float from
one room to another your sky float comes
with two small plates to a fix anywhere
straight out of the box you simply peel
and mount the plate then the neodymium
super magnet holds your sky float firmly
in place until you're ready to remove it
stick it back or stick it someplace else
patent-pending sky float is designed to
hold the weight of up to ten tablets or
possibly the weight of a man in a
hardhat or if you'd like you can
permanently affixed it to the ceiling
where do you put your device when you're
looking at a recipe use your counter for
cooking your recipes are at eye level
with sky float you no longer have to
hold your phone while face chatting with
friends simply mount it here and voila
the innovation lies in its lightweight
precision cut durability strength and
visibly appealing design sky float is
versatile safe and easy to use
convenience like never before
sky float fits any phone
kayuu sir no case and if it's your
tablet on its own with a case and even
with the bulkiest of cases chiropractors
everywhere are praising sky float
revolutionary design to relieve back
pain and reverse the effects of Technic
a neutral position at weighs 10 to 12
pounds when we're looking at a device to
text or stream the head weighs
approximately 50 pounds this can mean to
a lot of problems look at yourself right
now you're watching on what your phone
tablet computer joining the technique
generation wouldn't you like to watch it
the perfect eye level for comfort
hands-free for ideal convenience watch
your step hands-free without even
mounting a TV I use this thing for
Facebook live I think it's phenomenal
for youtubers it keeps you a
broadcasting ability on YouTube at eye
level I don't even need a TV take it you
stick it in your smile that's it start
form that is sky float
today we want to introduce you to the
phantom air the world's first tunable
wireless in ear monitor we've all seen
lots of wireless in ear monitors come
through these hallowed halls or
Kickstarter so let's face it how many of
them sound good so that's why we've used
our own titanium 7 millimeter dynamic
drivers that have been award-winning
since we began we've been working on
this project for a year to make sure
that when we release this product is
ready and you can use it straight away
so this is the phantom air 2 little tiny
wireless earbuds sync to your phone via
bluetooth you've got three hours of
uninterrupted CD quality audio but
surely the most important thing is how
it sounds
is it really portable does it stay in
your ear properly do you have the
ability to recharge it on the go and
when you do have the ability to recharge
on the go how many times can you do that
the phantom air solves all of those
problems but first and foremost above
anything else these are the best-selling
wireless inin monitors you will ever
hear so with all things within our
product range these days we're for a
filter system so if you're a base set
there's a filter for you if you like
things more neutral there's a filter for
you and if you like things with more
emphasis on the high frequencies there's
a filter for you
the reality is is there is no other
purely wireless in a monitor that allows
you to customize the sound to your taste
all we're concerned about is three
things with this product first it must
sound the absolute best that it can the
absolute best secondly it must connect
with your Bluetooth device flawlessly
and thirdly you must have a good battery
life to make it usable but when the
battery does wear it you have your
little tiny charging station plug them
in and you're good for a day twos worth
of use everything's there everything's
built our designs are done our PCB
boards are done our batteries are done
everything is ready to go they'll just
need your help to make it a reality
please join us on yet another journey
with Trinity Audio and let's make this
the greatest wireless in ear monitor
available today thank you
hi everyone my name is Hong Wang I'm the
founder of clutch accessories one day my
dad and I were driving in his car and
his suction cup phone holder fell from
the windshield to his feet and when he
leaned down to pick it up we almost
crashed into oncoming traffic that's
what inspired me to create a better
phone holder the clutch it this is the
safest hands-free phone holder available
clutch it magnetic phone holder only
uses the highest quality 7000 series
aluminum that are found in iPhones it's
a double faced magnet with two ball
joints in the center now it has crazy
degrees of flexibility and the beauty is
that not only is it for your car
utilizing these small plates you can put
these anywhere that's not already of
metallic surface you can clutch it right
next to your computer while you're
working your office you can clutch it
right in front of you while you're
cooking reading your recipe you can
clutch it in front of the treadmills
while you run you can clutch it in your
garage while you're working on your car
this is for social media you just have
to clutch it and shoot your own selfie
video hopefully you see the values that
this product can help you make your life
easier and I hope you are interested in
participating in our Kickstarter
campaign with their pledge of twenty
eight dollars you get one clutch it
magnetic foam holder three metal plates
and three sticky films we are looking
for the Pioneers to be the first ones to
hold the clutch it in your hands before
rest of the world does
sleep it's one of the most important
things to our lives a lot of wearables
track sleep but tracking sleep doesn't
necessarily mean improved sleep but what
if we could change that what if we could
create a wearable which not only tracked
your sleep but improved your sleep at
the same time at them we're doing just
that and we want to work with you the
Kickstarter community to bring this
project to life we sleep for one third
of our lives but it affects us around
the clock the benefit of falling asleep
faster is that you can get more out of
every day I think the most exciting
thing is that we can change people's
lives them helps you to fall asleep
quicker and this will ultimately - more
sleep across the night the development
of film is really based on a lot of
excellent university research that has
shown a better way of improving sleep
but for the first time now BIM allows
this to be translated into the home
environment we start by placing them on
any of your fingers before you go to bed
Bhim will then accurately determine when
you fall asleep to the nearest minute
the algorithm then implements a
retraining program to allow people to
fall asleep more quickly that has been
used by researchers for the last 10
years this is a simple behavioral
approach to improve your sleep but for
the first time then allows this to be
carried out in your own home this is a
way to teach people to sleep better and
from our own research we know that it
works them is about more than helping
you to get to sleep quicker tim can also
help you take the perfect power nap
research from nasa down that their
astronauts perform 34% better having
taken power naps the secret to a perfect
power nap is sleeping for exactly ten
minutes five minutes
won't do much for you and sleeping for
20 minutes will leave you feeling groggy
once you wake up the incredible accuracy
of thim of knowing when you fall asleep
to the minute allows you to take the
perfect power nap for the first time Tim
also collects your sleep data and
provide you a sleep score so that over
time you can see how your sleep is
improving
you're at them we've been heads down
building for some time we're a team of
researchers designers and engineers we
collectively have built products that
people around the world use and love our
most recent invention was the retailer
which received worldwide acclaim at them
we've reinvented the wearable for sleep
our research is based on a peer review
evidence base this is more than a step
forward this is a quantum leap for how
we you sleep technologies we wanted our
design to represent the ability to
disconnect and dream we wanted to
engineer something that you forgot
you're wearing we've done just that
putting the components into such a small
and light package has been a challenge
we've gone through hundreds of
iterations we've given our 3d printer a
serious workout with every iteration
we've learned something new and it's
definitely improved our design the
journey so far has been thoroughly
rewarding I'm really looking forward to
seeing what's to come we would love to
work with the Kickstarter community as
we go through final design
considerations for this wearable this is
your chance to be part of something
where we change the face of wearable
technologies forever we'd love you to be
part of it and you can do that by
clicking the green button thank you
