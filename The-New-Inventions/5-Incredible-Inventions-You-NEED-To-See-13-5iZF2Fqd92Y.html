bring energy everywhere in 2014 you our
community helped us make the BioLite
base camp one of the most successful
Kickstarter campaigns of all time you
know us for fire now get to know us for
life introducing the BioLite based
Lantern the world's first flat pack
lantern that creates your own personal
smart grid completely off grid hi i'm
anton and i'm mike and where the lead
designers on the base lantern when
you're away from an outlet lighting
large spaces generally means turning to
some form of lantern to get the job done
and it turns out most lanterns out there
could really use an upgrade with that in
mind we designed the base lantern to
meet three core energy needs big light
without any bulk shareable power so you
choose what gets a charge and smarter
control giving you real-time feedback on
how to make your energy last longer
here's a closer look at the base lantern
in action utilizing advanced edge light
technology the base lantern maximizes
brightness while minimizing space
fitting 500 lumens of light into a
compact packable form and unlike old
single-function lanterns as a hub this
can extend even more light with the
integration of bio light site lights
creating easy overhead lighting to light
large spaces or create multiple it sites
with the use of phones and other digital
tools playing more and more of a role in
off-grid life we need energy to keep
them going the baseline turns internal
rechargeable battery is paired with two
USB ports so you can power your weekend
with up to 50 hours of light or four
phone charges depending on what you need
grab the base lantern excel and add even
more power to your system when energy is
scarce making it easy to monitor and
adjust your usage is critical so we're
bringing the controls and analytics
right to your pocket turn on/off and dim
and if you've got site lights what's up
you can control those two full color
spectrum control allows you to engage
night vision calibrate the warmth of
your light or even have a little fun
with your surroundings set sleep timers
or alarms to wrap up your night or start
an early day without fumbling in the
dark enable proximity activation and the
base Lantern will automatically turn
itself on
based on your location so you can find
your way back home safely and easily oh
and the app itself it barely uses any
battery from your phone thanks to
low-energy Bluetooth settings we've
spent the last two years researching the
intersection of light energy and
off-grid means both in the outdoors end
in homes were access to an outlet isn't
so easy with your support you're not
only helping us create lighting that can
change your experience outdoors you're
creating the foundation for energy
solutions that will change the way
families live after dark worldwide we've
got some great award lined up including
special kits that include some familiar
faces from the BioLite family of
products it's time to reimagine the way
we look at what a landrum can be and
where it can fit into everyday life back
us today and experience the power of a
personal energy hub that's designed to
keep up with your life outside and off
the grid wherever you are from all of us
here at BioLite thanks for helping us
bring energy everywhere
everyone loves outdoor activities but
with all that fun comes all that cleanup
that's why I created the rinse kit it's
like having a hose to go my name is
Chris Crawford and after countless hours
of developing I've created something
that is truly revolutionary rinse kid is
super easy to use to fill it simply
attach the Quick Connect adapter to any
sink or hose bib turn on the water it
will fill in 30 seconds attach the
nozzle and it's ready to go there's no
pumping or batteries required to use as
no moving parts and it will hold the
water pressure for months okay so right
now you're probably asking yourself how
in the heck does this thing work inside
the rinse kit there is a sealed chamber
when you connect it to a hose bib the
water pressure from your home simply
compresses the air in the chamber the
best part about this design is that it
essentially uses the air as a spring
there's nothing to wear out we
specifically designed the rinse kit to
be easy to carry and travel with it
holds two gallons of water which will
spray for over five minutes on the
center setting and for over 30 minutes
on the mist setting the lid detaches so
you can clean up and change on it you
can also use it as a cutting board or to
sit on as you rinse off your feet rinse
kit is bpa-free so it's safe to drink
out of and it's extremely durable you
really can't hurt this thing
throughout the years mankind has pursued
their outdoor passions and has suffered
unnecessarily we've always felt that the
rinse kit could be the ultimate portable
shower if it could make its own hot
water but our early attempts to heat the
water and the rinse kit were a little
impractical finally we figured it out we
developed a heating probe that drops
into the tank and runs off a
rechargeable battery it quickly heats
the water in the tank to a nice
comfortable shower temperature I even
included a smart USB port for charging
your device's we've had some help from
friends and family but we're essentially
still a startup company we need your
support to help develop the engineering
tooling and production on this
game-changing heater accessory by
backing us on Kickstarter I promise that
you're going to be one of the first
people to receive this ultimate heated
portable shower system and I'm
absolutely sure that the rinse kit will
make your life easier when it's time to
clean up
our brains emit waves that are natural
measurable functions that indicate
levels of focus stress sleep and steep
relaxation we've been able to measure
that brain activity for years but only
by strapping on helmets or equipment
that isn't very portable or practical
but today United sciences has developed
a new wearable product that is about to
change everything introducing aware he
rebels Custom Fit bluetooth headphones
with brain and body senses by adapting
our air scanning technology to a
wearable platform that's already
ubiquitous we have what we believe is
going to be a device that changes the
way we interact with technology that's
around a where he rebels will not only
connect you to your music or your mobile
phone it will also connect you with your
mind and body in ways that haven't been
possible on a consumer product ever
before and since the hair bows are
custom fitted for your ear they won't
fall out you won't need to constantly
adjust them they're just so comfortable
you will hardly feel them through an app
that we are currently developing a where
hair bows will provide you with reliable
biometric data and brainwave activity so
you can become more aware of yourself
and how your mind and body responds to
the environment around you these custom
fitted he rebels will sync with an app
that will track display your focus
mindfulness and stress levels in real
time it will track your sleep patterns
it will track your heart rate while
exercising as well as calories burn
speed and distance travel so help us get
there please
is now let's start this here of a
revolution together
3d printing is great but often
unaccessible until now 3d printers have
crossed over a thousand dollars and
that's just for the most basic versions
at anvil we've set out to change all of
this our 3d printer is easy to use and
add a two hundred ninety nine dollar
price point it's affordable enough that
any family component but most
importantly the print quality is
incredible we've sought out to provide
the best user experience of any 3d
printer unlike other tricky and hard to
use 3d printers anvil is ridiculously
user-friendly for example it's
incredibly easy to load no more
complicated and inconvenient insertion
processes like traditional 3d printers
even better all you need to do to
operate anvil is press a single button
we've designed our printer with an
enclosed compartment so you're protected
from any heat related injuries
we've designed every feature with you in
mind so that you can create anything you
can imagine without any training or
previous knowledge of 3d printing our
printer allows you to design anything
using our app we've built the software
to look like Legos you put your design
together on an iPad using blocks and
then print your design our app is the
key to turning your ideas into reality
and we've made sure it's easy enough for
everyone to use without any prior
experience as long as you have access to
the internet you can control your anvil
3d brick now you don't have to wait
until you get home to make your great
idea come to life it's as simple as
opening up the app and clicking print
you'll never be caught unprepared again
if you're thinking of something you're
missing just print it the world is at
your fingertips with the anvil 3d
printer watch your imagination come to
life
