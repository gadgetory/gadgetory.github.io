much Sun can be harmful UV rays damages
skin and eyes and lead to skin cancer
this is preventable as experts in
analyzing weather data we found that
people care about the immediate
environment around them information the
current weather apps cannot provide what
if everyone could have a personalized
weather station that's why we decided to
create one so we set a goal develop the
idea assembled a great team conducted
breakthrough research talked to a lot of
experts and made several prototypes we
collaborated with the best engineers and
have begun manufacturing to provide a
one-of-a-kind device this is cute M a
remarkably precise weather station built
to fit on your keychain it tells you the
temperature and UV index right where you
are based on the measured UV
environmental situation and your skin
type q temp alerts when you need sun
protection q temp tells how much time
you have before getting sunburned based
on your skin type it helps create a
comfortable space it notifies you to be
safer whenever you want to go to the
beach explore nature or enjoy a day in
the snow say hello to the Sun again
start your day off smart learn about the
weather wherever you are and wherever
you're headed get ready for your
productive day with real time
environmental updates either inside or
outside even track and share weather
info to personalize and customize the

this is Luksa for an LED indicator that
lets you control your work daily how it
shows you notifications at the speed of
light helps you productively plan your
day and let your co-workers know when
you're free to chat and when you're busy
our goal is to make your work
environment better by eliminating the
common problems of today's modern
workplaces you know like those moments
when you're on a roll with a project and
suddenly everybody needs to talk to you
or at the end of a hectic day when you
realize do you miss some important
emails or just being distracted and
unable to focus these are all things we
struggle with at grey nut and we can't
be the only ones so we created Luksa for
a simple tool to make work days more
productive Luksa for is available in
three different models
Luksa for mini Luksa for flag and Luksa
for Bluetooth Luksa for mini works as
your personal assistant it notifies you
about incoming emails and other
notifications so you never miss any
urgent information luck support flag not
only notifies you about incoming emails
but it also signals your availability to
everyone at the office a red light shows
that you're busy and can't talk and a
green light shows that you're open for
conversation plus with the built-in RGB
LEDs you could experiment with a huge
array of colors to code any information
you'd like Luksa for Bluetooth displays
alerts notifications and information
remotely wherever you place it you can
use it to indicate if a meeting room is
free or occupied place it outside of
your office to show whether you're
available or put it in any room to see
if you receive any new emails messages
or other notifications Luksa 4 is a
gadget that's designed to help you reach
your goals without interruptions without
missing anything important and without
all the little distractions that may
come up today everything is becoming
mobile we live in a world that people
are constantly
and arriving there tourists everywhere
but there's one office tool that is
still stuck behind and hasn't changed in
the past decade and isn't mobile we're
talking about the printer we looked at
printers today and we saw big bulky
boxes with a printhead inside moving
from left to right then we thought why
not just take the printhead out and put
it on a robot when I first started
thinking about creating the printer the
most important thing fast was that it
should be small we knew we had to
utilize every single inch we wanted a
pocket-sized printer that can print on
any size of paper precise images long
people can take it everywhere and use it
not only in the office or at home the
printers cover is made of polycarbonate
with a glossy finish we have two options
one is in Mars black the other is
titanium white I started working on the
mechanical configuration how it will
look inside and how to configure the
motors so it will be as small as
possible
and as accurate as mass we had to keep
it small everything was designed prior
to building on computer we have initial
mechanical prototype we have our initial
code is about 10 by 10 by 8 centimeters
our initial prototype is aimed for
grayscale images and text the prototype
aims were printing a page on under a
minute we are using a special Bluetooth
protocol which allows us to be able to
print from any device it means that no
drivers will be needed
it will print on a regular a four paper
if you have multiple pages it will hold
and it will tell you to change a page
were you aware that hackers could gain
access to cameras and other devices not
only have hackers been spying on people
they have also been sharing hacked
footage there are hundreds of millions
of web cameras that can potentially put
your privacy and security at risk this
is why we came up with an innovation to
provide you with the thinnest most
ergonomic and seamless mechanical webcam
privacy cutter solution is CC
intelligent security camera cover is
eight percent thinner than a credit card
at 0.7 millimeters enabling you to close
your laptop seamlessly it fits on most
smartphones tablets and computers it is
easily installed and easily used back us
now to get your is CC and protect your
privacy advanced privacy you deserve
intelligent security
do you have the same problem I do you
arrange the furniture in your home just
the way you like it but you can't move
the light switches I also have a toddler
and I would like to switch lower so he
can reach it and I can turn on the
switch like this you used to think I
need to tear out pieces of the wall and
run additional wires but now this is no
longer necessary you just need to open
the package no setting replace the
existing light switch with this base
switch then you can put the gecko switch
wherever you want
and it's done you can place an icon lets
you know what the Gekko switch controls
here
there are many icons to select from the
LED behind the icon lets you know when
the light is on or off makes a bedroom
light gradually brighten to wake you up
or make it to turn off with a time delay
3 2 1
if you can't find the Gekko switch use
the search function and it will beep oh
here it is hey do it now switch it up
with the Gekko switch and make your home
and life exactly the way you like it I
have been interested in available
technology for a long time now
I mean who hasn't I've tried just about
every smart glass there is and the smart
glass effort has been so unfocused
overpriced impractical and over
complicated I wanted to create something
that is simple useful and affordable the
works with the technology you already
have
I'm Goro kohsaka CEO and founder of view
fine and this this is beautiful view
fine is a high-definition clip on
display that can connect to anything
with an HDMI output your smartphone
tablet laptop GoPro drone and much more
we've gone to great lengths keep you
fine as simple as possible it has one
button and two ports it has no internal
operating system requiring proprietary
applications it can attach to a wide
variety of user glasses using an
incredibly stable magnetic docking
station then I was review fine to be
both easily adjustable and easy to put
on and take off and those are only
consumer applications view finds utility
in the workplace is equally diverse with
potential across countless fields and
because view fine is so streamlined the
possibilities for its use
are virtually endless with view find
product value is user generated because
instead of dictating use it facilitates
it if you find users can easily
interface with crucial information while
stained handspring use it as a
viewfinder for your GoPro to make sure
you're capturing exactly what you want
to capture use it as convenient at a
glance GPS or a way to watch videos
privately on a crowded train use view
fine as a rear-view camera for your
motorcycle or bicycle or simply to
display fitness goals best of all
because of its incredible simplicity if
you find is affordable and will retail
for around 149 but to take it a step
further to help get it out of the office
into the real world we need your help
and we believe that the wearable
technology that is simple useful and
affordable is the future and we need
your help to get there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
