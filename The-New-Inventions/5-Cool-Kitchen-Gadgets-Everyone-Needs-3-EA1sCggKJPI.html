for any kitchen trouve is a
one-of-a-kind edge holder and dual
trivets all-in-one the DVD you meta-
clutter and is heat resistant to 500
degrees Fahrenheit better still it helps
to minimize burn the spread of germs and
damage the surface of wok cooking
travail is made of durable cast metal
and non-slip silicone pads that combine
an ergonomically sweet and modern design
simply click travail into one of three
set positions the Z shape is perfect for
holding hot lids of any size while
cooking for presenting finished dishes
in a unique and eye catching light
easily closed travail to use as a
classical trigger this position also
allows for compact storage anywhere
expand survey for larger casseroles or
for displaying multiple dishes weighing
less than 2 pounds surveys still
incredibly strong and durable than any
dish of the 10 pounds
we've spent a lot of time thinking for
every detail Pastrana considering
different materials and various model
for the kidneys before arriving at final
product for example in the fully open
position to find the shapes of our
Chilean dishes and min my contrast
without services review shapes not only
supports the risk of all shapes and
sizes but also easily accommodates any
users handles with any pic booklet
handle but enormous finds control the
rotation of the range between functions
and their smooth and easy to operate the
bottom of the training is lined with
small rubber pads which prevent creation
sliding ultimate links this is a product
that is very reliable it's easy to use
and it has an intuitive design
besides being functional we want to
survey to have a beautiful aesthetic
with strong the graceful curves for it
to be durable but not people fear we
ultimately opted for an asymmetric
design X mind all of those factors to
create a sleek and modern look survey is
perfect for use when cooking in your
kitchen and serving at the dinner
student whether it's a formal dinner
party or casual barbecues its appealing
and a variety of settings it works great
for chefs and professional kitchens and
it's also perfect for catering or in a
restaurant setting for elevating dishes
like a pizza because this product is so
versatile we're still coming up with new
uses for it

hello snakes Darwin what if I told you
that there was a delicious savory treat
that you've never had before or maybe
never even heard of what if I told you
that it was probably already in your
refrigerator it's the egg well okay so I
exaggerated a little we've all enjoyed
eggs at some point in our lives when
have you ever tasted
or ever even seen what's known as a
golden egg golden egg is an egg that was
scrambled inside of its shell and its
unique preparation that has been
relatively unachievable until now
introducing the golden goose we've
carefully designed and engineered a new
kitchen tool that allows you to create
golden eggs yourself
it's the goose that lays golden eggs the
goose features economic handles abrasion
resistant nylon cordage tough scrambling
chamber a securely locking ring and a
soft egg cradle designed to fit a
variety of egg sizes and shapes inspired
by the motion of Victorian era
children's toy the goose is a low-tech
kitchen appliance designed to take
advantage of what are known as
specifical forces it's been carefully
designed for performance and can
thoroughly mix an egg while protecting
it from breakage the way it works is the
hold egg safely in its cradle
while the spinning motion evenly mixes
the egg white with the yolk over the
past year we've carefully designed in
develop the goose following a thoughtful
design process we started with loads of
ideas and sketches created different
geometric prototypes 3d prints and
rubber molds building and testing rough
CAD models and performance testing a
variety of materials we tested our
prototypes in a variety of situations as
well and took the best design to
finalise it with sophisticated computer
CAD models we've refined every important
aspect and we prepared the goose for
manufacturing our next step is to
purchase the actual production tooling
and materials we secured competitive
quotes from several manufacturers both
domestically and in Asia we've crossed
our eyes and dotted our T's we finalized
the design and engineering details and
we've had fun inventing new and tasty
dishes now we believe that we've created
an end of
and novel to teens as well that's easy
to use fun and effective oh and do we
mention that it's easy to assemble that
it's stood safe made with recyclable
materials and it's easily disassembled
so it doesn't end up in the landfill
and this is where you come in it just
costs too much for bootstrapping startup
to fulfill we love the goose and we
think you will too but in order to make
things happen we need your help please
help us share the goose with all the
creative cooks home chefs and kick
started with the world do you have any
idea how much pesticide you could be
eating every day we do indeed have any
idea how much water you waste every time
you wash vegetables and a strainer the
truth is is that you need to submerge
fruit and vegetable for 10 to 20 minutes
in water to remove the majority of
pesticide then you need to rent the
fruit and vegetables again even if you
do this correctly you could be wasting a
lot of water that is why we invented
this Anton strainer bowl the bowl allows
you to soak the produce rinse the
produce and then drain the produce don't
you hate it when you spill tomato juice
everywhere when you're making salsa we
do too and that's why we designed a
beautiful funnel handle so hold the
strainer comfortably to direct the juice
into a small glass and use it later
don't you need it when you have to place
a strainer in a sink full of dishes with
the Anton strainer you can bring your
posture safely and away from the
bacteria at the bottom of your seat and
away from the other dirty spoonful you
can use it as a bowl to serve your pasta
and avoid washing even more utensils
while also saving more water we also
designed it so the Anton strainer can be
used to eat from if you're really hungry
the handle is designed to be a natural
extension of the bowl it fits the palm
perfectly allows you to tilt the bowl
easily and keeps an unobstructed view of
your fruit and vegetables
the higher ed that the back also helps
contain the produce when draining the
Anton strainer bowl if you're like me
you like good food but cooking takes too
much time and energy the result is not
always amazing is it hot enough is it
done yet can't follow and video is
online recipe or just got distracted
time for take-out again real chefs spent
years mastering your craft and that's
great but you don't have years you want
six like now you need a way to stop
guessing and just cook things right
every time you need pen television this
is ten Kelvin
it's a frying pan you put it on a stove
and cook on just like any other frying
temp no buttons no sources but once you
get the pant elephant death on your
mobile device it gives you the skills of
a master chef you see intelligence as a
temperature shun right at the center of
a pan and some state a wirelessly to
your phone while you cook what's for
dinner tonight
baked salmon bacon mushroom risotto
bacon I'm in the mood for Center let's
cook pant elegant wants to know how
thick the feminine so it can adjust the
cooking time and temperature just like a
real chef would pretty smart there's no
pairing or setup just tap the phone to
the handle pant elegant tells me when
the pan is hot enough to start if the
heat is too high or too low and
everything else flip the salmon
thank you series how's that looking it
does that every time
if you can follow GPS instructions when
you drive you can follow up intelligent
instruction points cook our lawyers say
you can't do both in the same time ha
the secret ingredient is temperature
control intelligent recipes are
programmed with the ideal time and
temperature and intelligently adapt to
cook your food perfectly you wouldn't
try baking in an oven without a
thermostat so why guess on the sofa
don't worry if you get a little
distracted the heat is still too low and
elephants always got your back
so you can do other things while you
cook and if your hands are busy and
telogen will send alert right to your
smart phone the pen telogen cooking
system has four parts the interactive
software the intelligent recipes Japan
and the integrated electronics this is
the future of boots and it's practical
affordable and a list so put away the
ramen noodles lose the takeout menu you
can have healthy delicious
restaurant-quality food at home whenever
you want this may be the best salmon
I've ever had
really I wish you could taste it and we
can have it again tomorrow and so can
you intelligence it cooks everything
perfectly hey what's that make it better
my name is Graham and they add on fresh
check them out I often find myself
infusing tea with the same old boring
tea infuser or tea bag or one a good cup
of coffee and I have to pull out my
clunky old coffee machine I decided to
do something about it and after
sketching out some initial concepts I
teamed up with a close friend and mentor
of mine GM odorata we took a close look
at the art for rituals if you will of
drinking tea and coffee and we threw in
a little edgy attitude for good measure
the result is a new breed of infuser we
call sunfish
these little characters add a little
unexpected to fun and excitement to the
daily task of brewing a hot beverage we
went through many concept interations
built something to play and then we can
see the care to engineer the final
design
using CNC prototyping the phone model
was made to validate the design followed
by short-run production using the same
materials that you will find in the
final production briefs the top half of
the fish is made from third grade
silicon to the exceptional color
characteristics and a temperature rating
in excess of 500 degrees Fahrenheit the
lower protective ribcage is made of a
marine grade stainless steel which is
designed to protect the inner mesh
basket this particular model is designed
for tea it has a stainless steel mesh to
allow the best possible water flow while
flipping tail is designed so you can
include tea and hot water without fear
of scalding fingers the opening
mechanism is designed with no moving
parts and makes use of the natural
flexing characteristics of silicon so
there is no way equals a great break
with extended use
so why pics are the top of darkish may
use an injection molding while the lower
half uses a process called progressive
dye expanding this along with the first
production run is going to cost in the
region on fourteen thousand US dollars
and that is why we need yours
