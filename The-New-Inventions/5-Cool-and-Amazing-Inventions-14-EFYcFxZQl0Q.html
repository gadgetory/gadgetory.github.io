you
this is Expo a portable home theater
system that gives you the power to
unleash a surround sound effect at the
touch of your fingertips this gumstix
eyes device simplifies the complex
equipment for ditional II needed for a
home theater system and gives you that
same high quality audio experience with
just a pair of stereo speakers unlike
conventional techniques that deal with
two dimensional sounds x-pipe is able to
reconstruct a three-dimensional
soundstage how usual listening
experience with stereo speakers is to
hear the sounds coming from the left and
right channels in both ears but with
expan we process the overlapping audio
signals that reach the ears with an
algorithm in real-time dynamically
reconstructing the south stage for
surround sound effect this enhances the
depth and width of audio details for
sound accuracy creating a sound field
expansion up to two hundred percent of
the regular stereo X pump not only
upgrades the cinematic entertainment
brings the sounds of instruments human
voices drum beats and footsteps to your
ears but also restores the directional
source of sounds for an immersive
experience the powerful audio algorithm
runs every microsecond to detect analyze
and reconstruct the sound source in real
time for optimal presentation more
details are unlocked than the average
surround sound effect allowing the
listener to experience the power of
sound coming from all directions not to
mention we've also developed a headphone
mode for you to enjoy a live audio
experience on the go you'll be able to
hear music with rich details even from
your phone yeah so what I thought was
amazing was just with two speakers I
could hear every single little detail
was almost like it was in a movie
theater I definitely like to have
something like this in my home
yeah amazing
sound stage that I'm already about my
nose day
real surround sound it was really great
I started off I heard an immediate
difference as soon as I hit the button
when I turned it off the sound
disappeared it was not clear anymore it
was not great it was perfect your scent
like sitting in a movie theater aim was
to redefine the sound experience no
matter what the users are listening to a
clip from youtube or Spotify enjoying a
movie with Netflix or playing their
favorite games the experience is
upgraded by simply plugging in X pump
we've spent years working on adjusting
and optimizing our audio processing
algorithm and we finally come up with a
device that is designed to be convenient
be portable and that eliminates all the
complicated settings of a sound
processor to make the listening
experience better for everyone drop the
beat an experience sound like never
before with X pump
hello world I'm 33 years ago I had this
big idea I wanted to build the nail by
the smartphone nail art printer and
after hard work and perseverance we did
the nail bot uses your phone to print
art directly onto your fingernails and
it's instant here's how it works first
pop your nail you have to manually paint
your nails with a light colored based
code we recommend white because it
really makes that artpop next
personalized choose the images you'd
love to print whether it's pictures from
your camera roll of your best friends
your dog your cat or one of our 3,000
free emoji is an icons and our mobile
app and eventually your own art designs
finally tap print and about 5 seconds
that art will appear
I'm a product manager here prima donna
I'm a coder but I'm also an artist and
then developing the nail bot we have
created a product that truly needs art
within community
it's fast it's simple I can print my
school mascot on my nails I can wear
them to all the football games all the
spirit weeks and all my friends say how
would you get that I said that I did it
I created it myself with the nail pot so
I'm in college and I'm really busy and
I'm always studying but I also want to
go out and have my nail for good too um
so the nail bought just gets it done for
me in like five seconds like in and out
and I'm out the door and it's way better
than I could ever do so thanks no but
the real MVP I'm Brandi Olson i'm laura
nelson we're from palo alto and we love
a nail bot I think the nail bot is
really awesome because it integrates
math science technology art and you can
print whatever you want on the nail bot
on your nails and that's just super
awesome i realize that idea we built the
nail bot for you for the engineers the
hackers the coders the artists the maker
girls so three percent of this nail bot
campaign will go towards teaching the
next generation the tech behind the nail
bot you're a partnership with nagar girl
our ambassador program and our art and
coding tutorials if you want your nail
bot we need your help today early
backers will get a significantly
discounted price and access to beta test
our mailbox the nail wat is powered by
smart and dynamic technologists
we call ourselves prima donnas and
together with your support we can build
seriously fun technology with the next
generation of girls thanks for watching
go nail bye
the challenge first began three years
ago when we saw that many BR products
were being released but each product
kept getting larger and heavier there
were no companies focused on creating a
lightweight dr product that allowed
users to experience virtual reality
anywhere without being tied down to
computer desktops
so the magic happens and connecting the
v1 glasses to the d1 that's what allows
the VR experience to become completely
portable
the d1 you have a full-size computer in
your pocket it comes with 2 g's of ram
into touch screen that has summit to
sensory functionality that enables easy
control of the glasses
the v1 and d1 have taken years of
extensive development and research
leading all the way to our current
product a single pair of lightweight
modern VR glasses that give our users a
complete VR immersion experience what if
a stylist could work as easily as your
everyday writing and drawing tools while
offering advanced digital features like
flip to erase perfect palm rejection
hover zoom and more without ever needing
batteries buttons or even a Bluetooth
connection meet flip the stylist that is
as easy to use as the pencil you grew up
with flip uses an incredibly simple and
unique method of communicating with any
Apple device so you can write on your
iPad or iPhone just like you would with
a pen and paper making flip the most
intuitive digital note-taking stylus
ever developed it's also a very powerful
tool that digital artists will love with
flips interchangeable magnetic tips the
artist in you will be inspired to draw
sketch and paint in all your favorite
apps in the past advanced smart stylus
features like flip to erase palm
rejection and others have required
complex electronics to improve upon this
repowered flip with magnetics our rare
earth magnets produce an exact invisible
magnetic field that is always on just
like the Earth's magnetic field flips
patented software algorithms developed
by our software partner wide Vantage use
the hardware already in your device this
sense and detect flips magnetic field
and determine the precise location and
orientation of the stylus so our palm
rejection flip to erase and other
features work perfectly want to erase
flipnotes just flip it over and your
clip is now an eraser want to rest your
palm on the screen while using the
stylus clip knows since we know the
exact location of the stylus we can
perfectly reject any other object
touching the screen want to hover and
then zoom in to generate more detail
flip knows just enable the hover
functionality and we can even detect the
stylist while it is still in the air
want to take notes in a class or meeting
but don't wander we enter your password
and reconnect your bluetooth stylus
every time your iPad wakes up again flip
knows we sense when you stop
writing and automatically dim your
screen to help save power and then
instantly turn your screen back on when
you are ready to make your next note
flip comes with a free easy to use note
taking and drawing app called flipnotes
we also know many of our backers already
have their favorite apps so we've
developed an app developers kit that
allows any note-taking or drying app to
quickly integrate flips features into
their apps we've already engaged with
several popular apps and we'll be happy
to keep adding to the list just let us
know your favorite apps and we will work
with them in addition to note taking and
drawing our software partner is
developing fun educational learning apps
for kids that can be activated by flip
these apps will be available on the
iTunes Store clip by link tech smart
intuitive simple we can't wait to see
when you create with your flip
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
