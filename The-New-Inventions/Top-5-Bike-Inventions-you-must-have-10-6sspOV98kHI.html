we're gonna Copenhagen in Denmark and we
are the mission to make the perfect bike
for any given situation biking is a huge
part of our culture so we know what
fighting is all about and how it should
feel to write we also love technology
and thought of a way of how to combine
these two things and still keep cool
functionality in mind after many
prototypes and thousands of hours we're
happy to finally say we created what we
believe is the perfect bike let us
introduce mates mate is no ordinary bike
it's an electric foldable and affordable
bike made for any journey any rider any
situation but enough with the talking
let's take it for a spin
mate it's our answer to bring people on
a bike again it makes distance is
shorter and heels more flat so you can
focus on what's important to you like
your friends we design mate to be your
everyday companion for better easier
faster and funnier personal
transportation it can ride up to 50
miles on a single charge
it is built with the finest components
has a six speed computer and comes in a
variety of cool colors
it will never let you down and allows
you to charge any mobile device thanks
to its building newest people
we build made with an integrated
carrying handle so you can lift it
easily on your way up but down the
stairs
and thanks it's all-terrain tires and
shut up solving suspensions hard paved
roads will feel gentle and smooth
mate is this great when you want to beat
the traffic and go places fast without
breaking a sweat
but if you want to exercise choose the
level of assist you want with the six
speed settings on the computer the
choice is yours
go further or kohada mate comes with
smart this breaks for quick and
effective stopping power we all said its
front and back suspension so you don't
have to worry about obstacles along the
way
it's pills durable so give it your best
shot it is always a fun and easy
experience for all ages and riding
styles for adventure Alysha you can use
the pedal assist or you can go full
electric just sit back relax and enjoy
the scenery at 20 miles per hour there
might be times where you won't need your
mate so it's great to be able to fold it
for storage or transportation knowing
you can always take it out when you feel
the urge
we're just at the beginning our dream is
to kick-start the biking evolution and
you can be a part of it once we get made
funded we can start production and
together we can rethink what a bike
should be able to do
this fight can do virtually anything hey
mate pick up Julie
oh well we're not quite there yet but
together we can make it happen
electric bikes let's escape the typical
hassles of committee traffic jams
parking lots and gas stops and make it
easy to cover long distances on hills
battle headwinds and still arrive at the
office with interview disparity your
mouth breaking this way so electric
bikes really come a long way in the last
few years but they still have a few
critical thoughts heavy bulky and
difficult storm and because you have to
leave them outside
it's a powerful electric bike which
Bowls in ten seconds or less to go on
trains in cars and under desks put the
Vectron you can cover long commutes and
skip the traffic by using multiple modes
of transportation you can outsmart bike
these are taking your bike with you when
you go inside the storm rolls in or if
you have a change of plans
you can just stash your bike in the back
of the taxi or a friend's car you can
even fit a few veterans in the back of a
car or a weekend adventure the backbone
is designed specifically for commuting
with kids
for we're specialists in urban
transportation blessings and our real
expertise needs folding bicycles and
what we did is we went out and we look
for the best electric bike drivetrain of
world and that comes from Bosch and so
that combination of our folding
expertise the Pasha's electric
drivetrain expertise results instantly
community watch is the leader in this
field for a very good reason with
experts motors experts batteries experts
with recharging
it is really important for safety and
critically the experts in the software
to type all of this very complex at the
turn we love bikes we love creating
bikes we love riding bikes and we love
designing the back run we setup take all
of our collective knowledge and bring it
together is the ultimate commuter bus
with all the bells and whistles it has a
state-of-the-art pulling joint super
stiff folding handle posts that
minimizes flex while you rocket a
powerful wide beam front light inside of
the road visibility hydraulic disc
brakes for all weather stopping power
and of heavy duty adjustable wrap for
mounting pennies it was wrapped up bags
and baskets one of our favorite features
the backdrop
visit it rarely resizes to fit small and
tall numbers of your families
butter for wood 10 4 6 foot pool thanks
to the low step bring a quick adjust
seat post and the adjustable handlebar
stem
it just takes seconds to resize the bike
the Vectron rides amazingly well we
started off designing the bike around
small wheels small wheels accelerating a
lot faster so that's great
stop and go traffic stop lights the
other thing that we did was we put the
weight really low and
and when we have that really low center
of gravity like it's incredibly stable
and it really handles just like a
regular bunch from the team of truck we
want to thank you for taking the time to
listen and we really hope that you join
us our goal of making sustainable
transportation hi I'm Richard and I'm
the designer of the award-winning go
cycle electric bike some of you may
already know a bit about my story and
have followed our progress in Europe to
all of our early customers and
supporters thank you for getting go
cycle this far for those of you that may
have just discovered us on Kickstarter
welcome this is our story
in 2002 I left the dream job at McLaren
cars and from my one-bedroom London flat
I began to design the best folding
electrified in the world I traveled the
globe pitching go cycles to all the big
bike companies and they all said it
couldn't be done so I started a company
and in 2009 we launched the iconic go
cycle g1 followed by the award-winning
go cycle g2 and now the best go cycle
yet the amazing go cycle g3 but it's not
been easy slowly we built up our team
and we worked hard to establish
ourselves in Europe but my vision for go
cycle is global and that's why we're on
Kickstarter we want to break into the
North American market with a new model
the go cycle GS making stuff is hard
making the best folding ebike in the
world is really hard you've got to do a
load of tests French and I mean a load
of testing because mother nature's
rulebook is tough and there's no undo
button in engineering
when you're developing something new
failure and progress go hand-in-hand and
we've developed decades of experience
designing lightweight bicycle parts at
NGO cycle we cook with different
ingredients like our high-tech injection
molded magnesium frame and when it comes
to innovation nothing compares to our
clean drive which keeps oil and dirt off
your clothes performance is in our DNA
our drive system is light and compact
it's four times the power density of any
other ebike on the market
I designed go cycles should be two-wheel
drive the motor powers of front you
power the rear that's the lightest
possible ebike configuration you can get
and it means the go cycle is balanced
and easy to handle but I've saved the
best for last our patented pitstop wheel
this cool side mounted design not only
looks great but it means the wheels are
quick and easy to remove of course go
cycle is portable modular and compact
this is hands-down the most versatile
ebike you'll ever own
well bike lighter smarter and more
compact than any other electric folding
bike on the market unique technology
unique you in the past 15 years electric
bikes and electric folding bikes on the
market haven't changed much we have
looked at what's out there and took the
latest technology for electric bikes to
develop something new the midas smartest
and most compact electric folding bike
it is lightweight has a sleek design and
folds extremely small introducing fellow
bike plus I'm Valentin votive and I'm
Valerie both the founders of Bella bike
develop bikes takes advantage of the
next generation of regenerating electric
bike technology that has the ability to
charge the battery while pedaling so you
can write forever without having to
recharge it connected to your phone via
bluetooth to select different power
modes track your wrote or lock your bike
motor with the up and make it difficult
for thieves to steal it
furthermore Vela bikes a
high-performance floating bikes that
feel and fight like a full-size bike a
shock absorber and provides for safe
ride use it for multimodal committing
Fulton draw in a second thanks to his
patent self locking magnet system and
then wheel it around everywhere
at the same time it can be folded
extremely small
millions of Americans commute less than
10 miles every day but the tree from
home to the office is usually very
inefficient we thought we could do
better
the CMYK 4.0 is the next evolution and
electric commuting lights it smart
technology and sensors help you bypass
beat-up streets traffic jams
construction sites so you can get to
work easier and faster but the tree from
home to the office is usually very
inefficient and we really thought that
we could better design the bike
commuting experience today we are
launching an IndieGoGo campaign to fund
production of this smart folding
electric bike the CMYK 4.0 is a bike
that thinks one step ahead of its rider
the CMYK 4.0 is loaded with features for
the urban biker
including advanced Hardware built in
brains and mobile integrations the
brains inside the bike are a processor a
gyroscope and accelerometer it also has
a cadence sensor and heart rate monitor
the mobile integration built into CMYK
4.0 crunches all of the data collected
by these sensors and displays it on your
phone through built-in Bluetooth
connectivity
the mobile apps direct integration with
the bike tells you stats like speed
cadence right duration temperature heart
rate band distance
we started this project about five years
ago designing the first version of the
CMYK today we're introducing CMYK now
before we learn a lot along the way and
we want to bring all these good things
to you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
