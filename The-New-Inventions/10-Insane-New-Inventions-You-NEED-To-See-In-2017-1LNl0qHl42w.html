occasion would be spent that's special
someone happy Anniversary babe they're
beautiful I miss you so much I wish we
could be together but we know life gets
busy bidding in time together gets hard
open it now we've made it possible for
you and your loved one to come together
perfect try it on pray now yes
introducing the fleshlight launch pad
for you tablet
idles consists of two pieces of
experimental equipment one for sight and
one for hearing we found that while we
experience the world as many overlapping
signals we can use technology to first
isolate and then amplify the one we want
our first device surplices approach to
the way we see motion achieving a
similar effect to long exposure
photography but for live experience by
detecting an overlaying movement it
allows us to see hidden traces and
patterns in real time it features a
camera and head mounted display and
works by sending captured video to a
computer where it is processed by custom
software and then displayed to the
viewer
our second device lets us hear speech
more selectively
distracting background noise is
neutralized
while the speech you want to focus on is
sent directly to your inner ear so can
you hear me now yes good I can hear you
it uses directional microphones to
capture audio input that passes through
the software before being outputted
through speakers and transducers unlike
standard headphones that have two
channels left and right our device has
three the two earpieces plus a central
mouthpiece for speech in sport post
match analysis is often used as a tool
to enhance player's performance by using
idols vision we could analyze motion
live letting the player or coach
visualize performance as it happens this
could also enhance the action for
spectators with the evolution of our
software idols can be applied to fashion
or ballet bringing a whole new feature
to arts and life performance
not only a sight in hearing our most
important senses they are also our least
stable declining earlier in life and
touch taste or smell we see applications
of idols in strengthening signals
weakened by aging and disability being
able to hear more selectively which have
benefits for children and ADHD by
helping them to concentrate in busy or
distracting environments
people try to lose fat in different ways
some exercise
some diet and some do nothing
but are they happy with the results yeah
except for these thunder thighs
well this mommy tummy is impossible
these handles don't get much love let's
face it we all have those stubborn areas
of fat we just can't get rid of meet
Silk'n lipo the first targeted fat
reduction device for home use that
really works no diet no exercise simply
use Silk'n lipo for just 15 minutes a
day and get results no diet no exercise
only 15 minutes a day that's right just
eight weeks targeting stubborn areas
will reduce fat and strengthen
underlying muscles so you can give your
body the shape you've always wanted I
don't know if Silk'n lipo really works
Silk'n lipo uses the same proven
technology found in a large professional
light therapy machines found in the
world's most advanced and expensive
beauty clinics we've simply shrunk that
same technology into the first-ever
affordable easy-to-use home device to
make it even better we've combined the
low level light therapy with electrical
muscle stimulation technologies EMS to
optimize the fat reduction and
strengthen underlying muscles
low level light therapy is a proven
technology for the permanent reduction
of fat with years of clinical experience
when I first heard that they've been
able to compact lower light therapy into
a simple little home device I was
understandably skeptical but when I
reviewed the basic science and the
results I have come to realize a Silk'n
lipo is as effective as some of my large
body contouring logotherapy systems I
use in the office that the patient can
use 15 minutes a day and deliver the
same kind of permanent fat contouring
and body slimming results I've been able
to achieve within office treatments how
does it work that is accumulated by your
body and stored in fat cells under your
skin Silk'n lipo uses specifically
calibrated frequencies of light to
perforate fat cell walls releasing their
fatty contents and harmlessly causing
shrinkage in the region once outside the
cell your body's natural processes flush
the fatty acids out of your system in
the same natural way regular dietary
fibers expelled to accelerate this
process and to help build strength and
muscle tone so can added EMS technology
this stimulates muscle activity and
circulation in the treated area speeding
up the rate at which the excess fat is
flushed out of your system leaving your
body looking it's bad
say goodbye to stubborn fat
now you can clean every floor surface in
an entirely new way unlike those
expensive water injection cleaners that
leave your carpets soaked for hours Pogo
removes embedded dirt and stains safely
without abrasion and without buckets of
water saving you hours of drying time
the rechargeable batteries give you 45
minutes of cord free Pogo power while
the lightweight low-profile design
allows you to clean everywhere dirt goes
unlike similarly priced steam mops Pogo
is safe and proven effective to work on
tile plus hardwood and even carpet and
unlike superficial scrubbers have just
skim across your water tile surface
leaving dirt and bacteria behind Pogo
delivers an amazing 66 oscillations per
second of high speed harmonic vibration
activating 75-million dirt grabbing
micro fibers to get deep into the cracks
lifting away and trapping the dirt
within the fibers so nothing is left
behind</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
