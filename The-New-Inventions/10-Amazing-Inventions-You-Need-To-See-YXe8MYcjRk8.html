I'll see you in a bit so you might not
been able to hear that but using Ori I
was able to have a call and that's
because Ori is a voice assistant bring
that turns your finger into a smart
phone all through just a touch of the
ear but why that's because the way in
which we're using our devices is
changing changing from a world where we
use screens and touch to one where we
talk now Ori uses a bone conduction and
bone conduction has been used in many
medical grade devices we package it in a
way that ascends by Britain's through
your finger directly into a year so only
you can hear and that allows you to hear
and talk to just your finger amen
that's music lovely thanks to bone
conduction and the dual noise cancelling
microphone you can hear and talk even
and loud places

agent Inori is more than just a neat
gadget for taking and making calls

artificial intelligence our friend Siri

exactly where you need them think about
all the different things that you can do

we have to do is just motion up words

different flavors Ori comes in three
different colors I guarantee you there's
