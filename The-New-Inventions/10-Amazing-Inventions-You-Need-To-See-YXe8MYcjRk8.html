I'll see you in a bit so you might not
been able to hear that but using Ori I
was able to have a call and that's
because Ori is a voice assistant bring
that turns your finger into a smart
phone all through just a touch of the
ear but why that's because the way in
which we're using our devices is
changing changing from a world where we
use screens and touch to one where we
talk now Ori uses a bone conduction and
bone conduction has been used in many
medical grade devices we package it in a
way that ascends by Britain's through
your finger directly into a year so only
you can hear and that allows you to hear
and talk to just your finger amen
that's music lovely thanks to bone
conduction and the dual noise cancelling
microphone you can hear and talk even
and loud places
so check this out
or is perfectly private and discreet
using it mixing futures like a secret
agent Inori is more than just a neat
gadget for taking and making calls
because behind it is powerful voice
artificial intelligence our friend Siri
and Google assistant it puts them
exactly where you need them think about
all the different things that you can do
and one of my favorite translation all
we have to do is just motion up words
and you say Ori how do I say where are
the burritos in Spanish understand lost
burritos and just like burritos come in
different flavors Ori comes in three
different colors I guarantee you there's
an Ori ring for every outfit and every
occasion and even better Ori is splash
proof to look guys I know how popular
you are and that's why you have the Ori
app because it helps you filter out
everything else and there's four LED
lights that tell you what kind of
messages are coming through come on
let's hit the streets to see what people
think of all really

you naturally with light and reinvents

lights speakers and sensors are embedded
beneath layers of premium memory foam

when designing the sunrise pillow we
went through many iterations to make
sure it was not only the most intuitive
smart alarm but also the most
comfortable we use soft breathable
fabrics and integrated coin technology

shouldn't be eating while staying active
