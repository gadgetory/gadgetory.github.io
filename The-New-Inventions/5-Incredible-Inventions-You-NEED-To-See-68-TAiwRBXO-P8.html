hi I'm Nikki and I'd like to introduce
you to hide away the bottle you'll
always reach for because it's always
within reach
experts suggest that for optimum health
the average active person drink / 10
glasses of water every day but for those
of us who are always on the go it's
nearly impossible to stay hydrated
without reaching for disposable bottles
of water or sugary sports drinks bottled
water may be convenient but it's not
cheap it costs more than 2,000 times
more than tap water even though it's
less regulated for help and quality then
there's the bottle every minute US
consumers throw out 90,000 plastic
bottles and less than a quarter are
actually recycled the rest end up in our
landfills and in our streets parks and
beaches we need a convenient solution to
disposable plastic bottles that fits our
active lifestyle so as a freelance
product designer I'm traveling a lot
visiting clients visiting factories
going to trade shows I was looking for a
water bottle that would not take up a
lot of space in my carry-on and I
started looking around for a product
that would work that would still be
functional and it wasn't out there as
I'm going through airports I'm seeing so
many travelers probably with the same
problem and I figured this is a problem
I could solve myself you know once i had
a solution for business travel i
realised this had a great application my
personal life especially in the outdoors
going backpacking or just on hikes I
could bring water with me and when the
bottle was empty it it collapses and
goes away and takes no extra space in my
back
no one loves buying disposable water
bottles it's it's merely out of
convenience and The Hideaway makes a
reusable bottle more convenient in fact
in some places disposable water bottles
are are being banned so we're all gonna
move towards the reusable water bottle
model and that's why I feel like this is
kind of the next generation and
hydration this gives you an option to
have a water bottle all the time without
having to throw anything away I'm really
excited to share the hideaway bottle
with with the world and Kickstarter is
an amazing opportunity to do that to be
able to show you the backers what this
is all about so please check out the
rewards we need to raise a significant
amount of money to get this into
production to get it on the shelves this
year and just as important please share
it with everyone you know tell them
about this great water bottle The
Hideaway we are the new general magic
creating technologies that surprise at
general magic we love to do things that
seem to be impossible with an
experienced team of 40 engineers we have
created an independent competitor to
google and apple maps magic earth
features elevation and satellite maps
turn-by-turn navigation with HD traffic
public transport and downloadable maps
that allow you to use magic earth even
when you're not online magic earth is
available for download now
today we're announcing nothing less than
a revolution in car safety we are making
advanced driver assistance features
available to iPhone for less than ten
percent of the price of existing systems
introducing safety lens the world's
first advanced driver assistance system
for iPhone safety lens includes a
beautiful small magnetic car mount with
a mount disc in case you wish to install
it on your dashboard a transparent
protective case for your iPhone
featuring a small metal plate and smart
advanced driver assistant software
integrated with turn-by-turn navigation
and although an Apple watch is not
required to use safety lens if you
happen to have one you can receive your
advanced driver assistance alert as a
vibration on your list using the iPhones
rear camera safety lens features forward
collision warning
headway warning keep distance
pedestrian collision warning
lane-departure warning keep your lame
traffic sign recognition
and stop and go assist
moving traffic
safety lens is incredibly easy to use
place the mount and put your iPhone on
the mount you could do this with just
one hand that's it when you start
driving the software will automatically
calibrate an advanced driver assistance
will be enabled like magic according to
a study by a DAC the price of lane
departure warning varies between 390
euros and 2490 euros and that's just one
out of the six advanced driver
assistance modules in safety lens a
full-featured aftermarket ad air system
costs almost a thousand dollars so
safety lens is like getting a
one-thousand-dollar advanced driver
assistance system for less than a
hundred dollars in fact safety lens is
priced so competitively that you could
even buy an entirely new iphone 6s as
well as an Apple watch and still spend
less we ask for your support here at
Kickstarter to make the roads a little
bit safer okay so all of us on a few
phone accessories right and some of them
can actually do some really impressive
things but right now if I asked you to
get one you probably say I don't have it
with me so most of the time you end up
leaning your phone against some random
object instead of actually using that
expensive tripod that you left at home
so because there weren't any real
solutions we made our own and back in
2013 we launched our first Kickstarter
campaign for the pocket tripod a fully
adjustable stand for your iphone and
hold sir device in both portrait and
landscape without covering the screen
best part is that it transforms into the
size of a couple of credit cards and
hides away in any wallet or purse until
you need it again
people loved it we raised more than our
funding goal by almost double and even
Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak the was
said why didn't someone do this before
what a great idea that I wish I thought
I put one of them in my backpack which
is always with but then a few of our
very clever backers realized something
that we missed and told us I've got a
case on my phone I'm not going to take
it off every time that's just too much
work and someone else said so what you
guys some kind of Apple fanboys you know
some people rock Android right back got
us thinking you can't make a pocket
tripod for every phone case bottle out
there there's at least a million
different combinations who knows so as
soon as we shift all rewards to our two
and a half thousand backers we started
working on a universal pocket tripod
instead of limiting it to only bear
iphones for months we studied cases us
got feedback from our backers and tested
ideas once we had a universal opening
shape we made it in a range of sizes so
that it fits as many case in phone
combinations as possible
this is the new universal pocket tripod
does it work with the Apple silicone
case perfectly how about the Galaxy Note
yep works fantastic and landscape and
halfway in portrait does it work with
every case almost unless it's gigantic
we've also created this guy that lets
you know exactly what pocket tripod you
need just by knowing with case and
device combination you have okay but
what if I like it bare but also
sometimes with protection do i need to
pocket tripods nope because whenever you
swap your case or your phone you can
also get the adapters to match their new
sides good to go the pocket tripods been
used and tested for the past two years
by thousands of people worldwide they
use it as the primary tripod every day
to take amazing timelapses
for making video calls
and even to create light paintings we've
made the pocket tripod with the highest
standards of engineering materials and
manufactured they say the best camera is
the one that's with you and the same is
true when it comes to tripods the pocket
tripod is now a proven product and with
your help we want to make one of the
most practical smartphone accessories
for as many people as we can we hope you
join us thank you mint is the world's
thinnest yet most powerful anti-lost
