we've we engineered movement to
implement not one but two motors inside
the wheel this makes me that more
powerful and safer than ever before
combined with a beautiful and clean
design
we took the time to do what we do best
we design you repo tote Aiki
re-engineering basically reinventing so
we could bring back to you our best
product yet with our exclusive app you
will be able to connect your phone
wirelessly to move back and with a new
built-in speaker and mic you can speak
to move pack directly like asking for
directions straight and since move pack
comes equipped with a powerful speaker
why not connect to your favorite app and
listen to your favorite playlist while
on the go
Motech provides a built-in USB charger
that can charge your phone over 10 times
on top of that move pack will now have
built-in tracking capability for
security in case your move pack gets
stolen or lost every little detail is
important such as internal lighting that
will come in handy when looking for
something in the bag and as far as the
backpack itself goes not only is it
swappable with different colors and
styles but now you can wear your
favorite backpack independently of the
mood paddle move pack is one of the
easiest vehicles to master and you don't
have to be a skateboarder to write just
stand on the board using the backpack
for extra support and use that
remarkably small remote for speed and
braking and in case of an emergency
move pack is pretty easy to get off so
there you have it a backpack a personal
transportation a smart luggage and a
personal assistant if you were to buy
all that separately you would spend well
over two thousand dollars but with move
packs you'll save over fifty percent of
it through this exclusive crowdfunding
campaign
