best way with a robot we'd like to
introduce you to Marty a fully
programmable and customizable walking
robot for kids for makers and for
educators Marty's not your standard
smart toy he's designed by roboticists
to be a real robot that you can do some
really cool stuff with while being as
fun as a toy you can use Marty to learn
about robotics programming electronics
and mechanics or you can build your own
stuff with a walking robot that will
hold a Raspberry Pi and which you can
customize with 3d printed parts Marty's
not like other walking robots his unique
three motor and spring leg design lowers
costs but also makes him easier to use
and his battery lasts longer he can walk
turn kick a ball and of course do funky
dances marty is Wi-Fi enabled so you can
remote control or program him from your
phone or computer you can also download
apps or games other users have made from
our robot App Store Marty lets you learn
real programming on a real robot start
off with scratch where the coding is as
simple as clicking and dragging blocks
you can make a dance routine or start
interacting with the environment when
you're ready you can move into Pikeville
a powerful but easy-to-use programming
language but robotics is way more than
just programming Marty lets you learn
about all kinds of things motor control
balance sensors mechanical design and
more mighty is really customizable and
upgradable the electronics make it easy
to add all kinds of sensors and motors
and they'll even support the whole
computer like a raspberry pi add a
camera and you could even program him to
play football all the parts are 3d
printable so you can make whatever you
can imagine Marty started out and has a
side project during my PhD I've got
nieces and nephews who are starting to
get to the age where they can play with
robots but I couldn't see a walking
robot Tori there was more than a novelty
or at least not when I could afford so i
made one we could actually use marketing
to help teach robotics at university but
this is easy to use as any other time
also as a maker i wanted a walking robot
that i could use as a base to build cool
stuff with I've spent the last year and
a half working on this little guide and
now we're ready to go from functional
prototype into a real kit that you can
buy we've spoken to manufacturers and we
know how to do it but we need your help
to make it happen please help us make
Marty a reality
the future is here and with it robots
but building your own robot can be
overwhelming and unintuitive not anymore
these are the guys from zero you I their
dream is to make robotics easy and fun
for everyone their team created the zero
the world's first hand gesture
controlled robotics kit for every 10
consists of three parts the motorized
modules the smart glove and the
smartphone app zerros modular design
enables freeform robotics construction
enabling you to build virtually anything
modules can be animated in a hinge or
360 degree rotational movement pair your
glove to the modules with a smartphone
app and bring your robot to life
whether you're a robotics enthusiast an
aspiring superhero evil genius and
training or someone looking to expand
their creativity zaro is for you zero is
for all ages and all genders there's no
limitations you can design and build it
from scratch or use a premade starter
kit design-build rebuild zero can be
used over and over again making new and
different robots each time with the same
modules learning should be fun and
engaging unleash your creativity and be
at the forefront of robotic technology
with zero back us today and receive an
exclusive IndieGoGo discount on your kit
0 let your imagination come to life this

clinical grade accuracy by using a
three-electrode design that measures
your heart's electrical pulses this
gives us precision down to plus or minus
one beat per minute
we design sense onto the extremely
comfortable and to flex with your
movements since on is compatible with
popular fitness apps on your mobile
devices
