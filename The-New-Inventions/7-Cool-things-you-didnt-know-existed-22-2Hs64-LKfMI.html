was a kid my family fulfilled his dream
my daddy and my granddaddy they created
the first mechanical burned it was not a
plane twas a wing flapping machine today
my dream is to create bionic bird for
the 21st century it will be connected
it's a flying up here is my own iqbal
this is the prototype the egg is a
portable charger you can charge a bird
in less than 12 minutes bionic bird is
only 8 15 grams it has a electric motor
of 0.8 wat rotation speed of 55,000 fpm
an aluminum heatsink and a lithium
polymer batteries it also has a great
design inspired by nature plus you can
fly as high as 100 yard finally I add my
friend up
Oh
and what really makes this so exciting
is how versatile it is and this is
because it's a full-featured portable
microscope that's simple enough for a
ten-year-old to satisfy the curiosity
but also powerful enough to satisfy the
needs of a professional with three
different levels of optical
magnification 30 50 170 x + 1.5 to 2
micron resolution you can use this as a
macro view or as a microscope and in
combination which responds to digital
magnification you can magnify something
several hundred times over plus with new
lenses capable of 340 times optical
magnification you can get a better
picture than ever before all pledges sa
power up will receive this new lens set
with 3170 and 340 times magnification
plus it successful not only in terms of
size weight and cost it's also just
really easy to use I just turn on the
light on the microscope and switch the
camera app to help mine up then I like
to give it an extra press down to make
sure it's secured and zoom in a little
bit then I put the sample on the stage
which works with or without a slide and
finally I use that white not from
earlier at the folks in it and there you
go not close to look at what's row in
front switching the little magnification
is also quick and easy and just clicks
into place in terms of compatibility it
work straight out the box with pretty
much any kind of smartphone tablet with
autofocus and other exposure also the he
said backing is reusable just wipe it
down to damp off if he displayed
and even after everything we put into
this it's still pocketable this is truly
a next-generation microscope ask
yourself have you ever really loved your
desk I mean really why our office desks
