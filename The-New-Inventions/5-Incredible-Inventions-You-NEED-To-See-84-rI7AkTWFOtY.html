one in five Americans are disabled what
comes to mind when you hear the word
disability why hearing impairments so
accepted that we don't pick the source
of the problem a decent hearing aids day
cost around two thousand dollars or more
people don't wear hearing aids as a
fashion statement like they do glasses
only Union was founded to combat the
true interment price and social
perception and eliminate hearing
impairment how the first barrier price
here's how much of decent hearing aids
cost today four thousand four hundred
dollars and here's the breakdown cutting
down significantly on the materials and
research expenses we don't use expensive
machines for testing and diagnostic we
kept our margins as low as possible and
after cutting out as many costs as we
could we were still at five hundred
dollars the second barrier is social
perception we approach hearing aids from
a totally different design perspective
not as a medical device but as an
accessory
we designed always benchmarking the
latest earbuds bluetooth earpieces over
the past year we develop the next
generation hearing aid using a smart
sound algorithm and Bluetooth technology
we will also revolutionized the hearing
test and feeding process to make it
quick easy and acceptable we don't get
tabs on the oldest tab you can set up a
customized hearing profile with sound
frequencies optimized for your ears you
don't need a funky-looking medical
device or amplifier to hear better you
just need on olive but in order for this
to be truly acceptable five hundred
dollars it seems too high our goal is to
bring the olive view at one hundred
dollars flat this season's of the
crowdfunding campaign it's called rnt
campaign in order to reduce RND cause I
need all of you to help us that has the
only and providers with the proper
feedback so that we can create the best
hearing experience for everyone left
