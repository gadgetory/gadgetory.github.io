in plants my dad was a botanist so he
wrote a lot about plants and worked in a
botanical garden and as a kid I would
look at plants and and see them as like
many universes and there's so much we
don't know about plants about a year ago
I began exploring these concepts of
levitating plants
what's so cool about magnetism is a
force that we we can't see but we can
feel we're levitating the plant from
ground in midair and rotating so that it
gets sunlight from all different
directions the idea of a plant not
needing soil to grow really fascinates
me and that's when I got interested in
air plants air plants are plants that
grow from the air they don't require any
soil they they literally take particles
from the air and get nutrients from them
I wanted to create an experience for
people in their homes where they can
enjoy plants but in a new way house
plants don't always have to be the same
what happens if I levitate this planet
air will it grow differently will grow
more who knows maybe we're gonna
discover a new way of growing plants
introducing the biggest breakthrough and
Wi-Fi in 15 years with access to triple
the spectrum enabling up to 300 times
faster performance than a typical
consumer router n state-of-the-art
internal radios active my mobeen forming
and 9 powerful antennas for amazing
range in coverage all without
compromising design and style portal is
we believe the fastest strongest Wi-Fi
able to adapt to changing environments
able to adapt to congestion and traffic
something that you've never had to
manage because it was smart enough to
manage itself you'll get faster Wi-Fi no
matter what the condition is you'll get
a much more reliable connection imagine
if you will six-lane freeway but for the
last 15 years everybody's really only
driven on one leg or maybe two if you're
lucky you ask yourself why are these
four lanes not reduced well we solve
that problem totally uses all of those
ladies and it does it intelligently you
can change lanes predictably to avoid
interference and to avoid traffic a big
part of the life I spectrum actually is
reserved for radar Wi-Fi is allowed to
share on it but to share it you have to
make sure radars not present and that's
a very delicate and very highly
regulated environment we've received
certification for doing that the way we
achieve that we've been working with the
FCC for quite some time all of our
products are now authorized to work
within the radar dance so one of the key
applications we develop
gaming what we want to do is create some
special channels but often both high
bandwidth and very low latency and we
control the access to those channels so
that if we know you're gaming and we can
detect that automatically will give you
the best gaming experience positive
we're looking to build a community of
people who are serious about improving
Wi-Fi and want to work with us on
development of the product our goal is
to make it a platform so that has Wi-Fi
grows and develops into different areas
that were one of the first guys who can
support that but we need your help and
support to do that there's no other
robbery in the world they can do one
mean this is the solution please help us
fund our Kickstarter we think we can
change Wi-Fi forever hi we are team pal
we love our pebbles c pepper can do
almost everything thanks to team pal
your pebble can have gps and seven more
days of battery life that's right gps on
your wrist have tracks and saves gps
data it works seamlessly with various
pebble watches including the latest time
to and can even charge its battery and
does it off right from here it's sweat
proof water resistant and can handle
anything you throw at it hi my name's
Eric migicovsky i'm the founder of
pebble we're really excited to back the
new pal gps smart strap on kickstarter
we've been working with them for just
about a year now it's really exciting to
see the first gps smart strap come from
pebble and about our customers and users
have been them to be interested in this
and it's wonderful to see them come to
market with a gps spread strap let's see
how how does it your phone's GPS can be
cumbersome first you need to find a
place to put your phone then as you know
gps sucks battery power
how eliminates that problem by
eliminating a need for a phone since it
works with your pebble you can have GPS
info right on your wrist and in South
help you'll find a 250 million hour
worth of battery life that's enough to
charge you of pepper for a week and it
uses the same charger as your pebble
what kind of GPS data can you really get
from your wrist well pal uses the latest
qua conserved platform and it stores up
to 24 hours worth of tracking data right
inside the location half x feature can
be activated within seconds so yes it's
highly accurate it's also light twenty
percent lighter than other gps watches
it's durable and gives you real-time
tracking info as you exercise and when
you get home download your data to your
companion app on your Android or iPhone
from the app you can upload and store
your trips view your glutes and even see
your GPS traces on Google Maps yes we
design power to look good and work well
but we know that it's just scratching
the surface of what it can accomplish
that's why we release our API to
third-party development this matches
Patos philosophy and leaves room for
developers to make pal even more
exciting how could change the way
everyone thinks about GPS tracking for
exercising it saves your battery from
being drained and your phone from being
dropped to make that happen how it needs
your help we are testing and refining
our design perfect in our manufacturing
processes and making our electronics
even more compact
with your support power can help you
track your excursions while your
mountain bike ski run cycle or just
about anything how can help your pebble
do so much more for so much longer join
us as a pot power and pebble and change
the way we resize
can I get a medium latte please hi I'm
Sevah like many others around the world
we love using styluses they're perfect
for using on those tiny iPhone keyboards
so that autocorrect doesn't write I hate
you instead of i love you realize that
though everyone loved using a stylus no
one brought one with them I mean let's
be honest pocket and first real estate
is precious no one wants to stick
something big in their pocket so for the
past year we've been solving that
problem trying to find the balance of
ergonomics and practicality being
comfortable in your hand but
unnoticeable in your pocket the stylus
flex is the first stylist ever to have
its entire body be able to be used in
touch screen you can use it while you're
checking out because the person in front
of you sneezed on their hands or use it
as a stand while you're sitting at the
coffee shop watching funny cat videos
with your friends
use it as a southeast and get creative
with it not only a mobile stylist but so
much money
