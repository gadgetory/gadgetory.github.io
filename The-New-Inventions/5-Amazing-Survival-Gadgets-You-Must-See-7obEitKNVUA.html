Sawyer's very first product in 1984 was
the extractor pumpkin the extractor come
from this poison from snakebites wasp
and bee stings mosquito bites and more
the pump acts as a vacuum which provides
the most powerful suction available to
remove venom from the body by sucking it
out the same cavity through which it was
injected there's no need to use
dangerous blades or knives that come in
less effective bite kids do use the
extractor select the suitable sized
suction cup pull the trigger to its full
extent and place the suction cup over
the bite of the stain using your thumb
press the plunger all the way in until
you feel the suction and let the pump
remove the poison this should take about
60 to 90 seconds for insect bites pull
the plunger ups to gently release the
vacuum for snakebites center a suction
cup over one thing all the time and
alternate between fan holes every 2 to 3
minutes for 15 minutes discontinue use
after 15 minutes retrieving venom can
significantly improve treatment results
most snake bites occur in the
extremities like the arms lower legs or
the ankle and the expectedness of the
extractor from varies with the location
of the snake bite the extractor pump can
most effectively remove venom that pools
outside the muscle areas and then of
often pools outside the muscles and
bites to the hands feet and ankles in
large muscle areas like the calf the
venom enters the circulatory system much
quicker and the extractor pump is less
effective at removing venom in those
areas stings and insect bites leave
venom in poisons close to the skin
surface where they can easily be
retrieved best results occur when you
apply the pump quickly before fluids
enter the circulatory system however
mosquito bites can be treated
successfully hours after the bite is
occurred this is the bear grylls compact
