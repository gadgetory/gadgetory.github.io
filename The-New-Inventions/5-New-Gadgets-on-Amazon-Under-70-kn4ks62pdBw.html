we do it in the morning
we do it in the car
we do it at work and even when we get
home sitting we do it for over nine
hours every single day and because of
the way we're doing it ninety percent of
us will get bath pain in our lives
seriously when we've hunched and slump
it affects our mood our happiness even
how optimistic we feel look at yourself
right now
how are you sitting how's your back and
your neck probably not too great huh
hi my name is Catherine and I started
working on my posture two and a half
years ago when I started having terrible
sciatica pain I have spent so much time
and money on doctors visits therapies
special pillows and all these ridiculous
products but I couldn't find anything
that just worked so for the past year
I've been creating a real solution with
the most amazing designers and
prototypers and dozens and dozens of
people with really bad back it was
important to create something small
enough I could fit in my purse and
something effortless so I could just
count on it working and five seconds
flat something reliable and something
that would help me improve my posture
even when I wasn't wearing it this is
better back it allows you to
effortlessly fit in perfect posture
easing back pain and training yourself
how to sit use it when you're sitting at
your desk on an airplane watching a game
or even when you meditate basically use
at any time you have to sit you don't
have to go far to find people with bad
posture or back pain a friends a parent
someone you work with or even people you
meet product testing around San
Francisco every Friday here's what
people think about better back Oh
Oh Phil that sound of elaborate gil-dong
feels awesome it's so easy to just sit
up straight this could sound weird back
and like feel my my body you know I can
feel my my organs not being squished I
can feel that it's right here but it's
not like oh I have all this on me it's
just like I am just like relieves pain
free I'm sitting straight up right
there's like it forces your torso to
stay upright where can I get one of
these can I have this one simple it's
easy I put it on I feel immediate relief
so that's how it feels and this is how
it's actually helping better back gives
you better posture it allows you to not
fatigue the muscles that you use when
you're sitting down so when you do stand
up your posture is literally change good
posture can change who you are it
affects your attitude it affects your
decision-making good posture changes who
you are literally sitting correctly over
time does more than stops pumping stress
on your spine
it also retrains your body's natural
default posture so whether you're
standing or sitting without better back
your posture is greatly improved let me
show you how it works better bag zips
itself into a portable case throw it in
your bag and unpack it when you're ready
to sit wrap the back pad around your
back and the knee straps around your
knees all there's left to do is to pull
on the adjustable leg strap to stack
your spine into perfect posture so if
you're going to spend nine hours of your
day sitting you might as well be doing
it right when you're pain free and your
body is perfectly aligned you feel
happier more confident and you regain
your ability to focus on whatever it is
you want out of life
baboon is a Danish company that provides
high-resolution personalized weather
information to make this possible we
invented our wind meters for smartphones
we have won several awards for both
design and innovation and we believe
that users knowing both the wind speed
and direction will give them the
opportunity to get the full experience
of their outdoor activities designed
with two cups Yana is a really easy wind
meter to use as it provides highly
accurate wind sweet measurements with
its minimalistic design and the use of
highly durable materials we have made
the Mjolnir extremely robust and that's
why it's called the world's toughest
wind meter for more technical
information when my owner does not
contain electronics wind speed
measurements are conducted by four small
magnets mounted inside the wind meter
designed with blade slip knit is a
really easy wind meter to use as well it
provides highly accurate wind
measurements and this is the first
handheld a nano meter that also measures
wind direction and that's why it's
called the world's smartest with meter
for more technical information the sleep
near is made with optic sensors that
generate more than 40,000 readings per
second in order to use both wind meters
you need to get the babbled app which is
available for free on the App Store and
Google Play just search for the food the
first screen is where you can run your
own measurements when completed you'll
get a summary of your wind speed
measurements with additional information
such as the temperature and pressure in
the second screen you can see the value
community's measurements globally which
is handy if you want to know the wind
for your next location and in the final
screen you can see all your previous
measurements so now you don't have to
write them down anymore
so the Mjolnir you just need to download
the app and plug the device in your
phone for the Select name it's the same
procedure but you need to do a little
indoor calibration before you use it
just follow the instructions written on
your screen and when it reaches 100%
you're ready to go follow us to stay
updated with all the awesome stuff we're
doing in our quest to master the weather</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
