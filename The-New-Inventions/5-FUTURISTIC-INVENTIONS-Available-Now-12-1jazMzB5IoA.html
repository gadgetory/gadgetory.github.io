three-dimensional dinner globe featuring
all its craters in precise detail moon
was created using data from nasa's lunar
reconnaissance orbiter mission combined
with advanced engineering and careful
craftsmanship in mode making the result
is a stunning 1 to 20 million scale
topographically accurate replica of the
moon revealing its craters as the light
moves around casting dramatic shadows
across its surface moon has three modes
the manual mode allowing you to rotate
the Sun yourself setting the lunar phase
that you would like to see
the demo mode lets you observe a synod
Hickman's in just 30 seconds and last
but not least there is the live model it
synchronizes itself with the current
position of the will discover famous
landmarks like tycho crater or classes
and get to see the Sun rising over the
dark side of the moon for the first time
ever they've mimicked two sons real time
pass by building encoding a custom
computer that precisely controls the
motion of the light it's real time clock
and gearing system make sure it is
perfectly in sync put the actual
position of the moon Anderson we took as
much care with designing the inside
components as we did with the outer case
moons computer board has the exact same
memory as Apollo 11s computer the arm is
CNC machined from aircraft grade
aluminum and the base is cut from six
till all moons are manufactured and
individually numbered in a studio in
London this precision and attention to
detail not only makes moon a
scientifically accurate globe but also
an ambient light designed to sit on your
desk or shelf

there are over a hundred wineries in
Melbourne New Zealand here is a region
renowned for the crafting of world class
seven your block amidst these phones
there is a remaining cherry orchard on
which they began their craft all it's a
officially founded in any 2013 the paper
and project specializes in organic
fairtrade artist apparel custom
skateboarder and long boards made from
recycled wine barrels aiming for high
quality creative products that were
sustainable as possible we'll throw and
indigo Greenlaw said about creating a
unique style of wine barrel ball
partnering with organic biodynamic wine
makers at serious in the state the paper
and project use one soaked aged oak
barrels in a lengthy process to create a
longboard with a beautiful body and a
great ride we love doing what we do even
though sometimes it means that we work
from getting up until going to bed or
all through the weekends and don't have
much of a social life often written as a
struggle but this is a passion and we
can't imagine doing anything else we're
so passionate about making high-quality
creative and sustainable products a way
of life or just a part of everyone's
life
virtual reality is transporting you into
a digital environment where you can look
all around and interact with things as
if you were there whether it's again a
movie or a 360-degree photo it's a fully
immersive experience and a very
different feeling than simply viewing
digital content on a screen octo is a
new kind of virtual reality headset it
uses your smartphone it was born after
months of user research when we realized
that most PR devices aren't made for
everyday use opto is the first portable
headset with integrated audio sound is
not just an afterthought but an integral
part of the design we have designed octo
as a wearable it is lightweight sits
perfectly balanced on your head and is
made of closed cell foam a material
comfortable to wear and easy to clean he
will no longer feel like you're just
strapping a piece of hardware to your
face the process of inserting and
removing your phone is quick and easy
you simply connect the audio place the
phone inside and then pop the front
cover back on
you can jump in and out of VR whenever
you want inge watch your favorite TV
series on your couch or on the train
opto is your portable entertainment
headset
when I first came to yellowstone i'd
never forget that came over the
beartooth pass and the this panorama
just opened up and I just my wife was
with me at the time and I took one look
out and I just kind of looked out and I
said I'm never leaving this place and
that was back in nineteen eighty five
and having one of the first underwater
robots that could collect samples and
take images for science I was I was
given a contract by Noah to do work in
Yellowstone Lake I was a one-man show
and I was able to design equipment that
really served the needs of the scientist
and to depths that they weren't going to
be able to do with standard diving
techniques I love being on the lake and
I loved seeing what was down there and
even using very low resolution cameras
and images were we're really just
stunning but I realized that the next 30
years is probably not going to be all me
so when I started the foundation I made
a commitment to build a team of young
engineers who were passionate about this
as passionate as I was when I first
started and in the last year the
foundation has grown significantly we
have mechanical engineers we have
electrical engineers we have software
engineers we have video engineers some
of these young people are just
phenomenal and and I am absolutely
confident that they not only have the
talent but they have the drive the
ambition and I was convinced that that
the next generation could take this way
beyond what I started I feel I'm in a
position to achieve the goal of creating
a capability in Yellowstone that will be
second to none for quite a long time to
come and it's Yellowstone it's it's the
first national park it's the crown jewel
of national parks in this country and it
is our obligation to understand it
because the only way to protect it is to
understand it and and this is a mission
of the foundation it's a mission of
Yellowstone National Park how
people to understand why these
environments are important so what we're
asking for here is a hundred thousand
dollars to help create this robot
because in the end the public is what
benefits and we have a donor who is
willing to match dollar for dollar up to
a hundred thousand dollars to start with
and this is the kind of money we need to
build this robot and put it on
Yellowstone Lake and make it something
that will serve the purpose of
protecting the park for future
generations</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
