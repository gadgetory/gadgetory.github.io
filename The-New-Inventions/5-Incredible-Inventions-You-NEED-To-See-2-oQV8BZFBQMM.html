music is the purest form of art so we
have communicating and generating
emotions experiences with the
advancement of technology we've learned
how to capture and share sound and music
but no CD or no mp3 player will sound as
good as the original live performance
creating a solution to that problem we
came up with bacon
well Bacon's with wavy design is kind of
like the natural wave of a sound and the
Birchwood is handcrafted and has its own
story in every design so traditionally
you'd use the high quality cable made of
something expensive like gold to try to
get your best possible signal but with
the invention of tual technology we're
able to bring an even higher quality to
that without the expensive cables
because bacon is wireless the transcend
space limitations which means you can
listen to great sounding audio in
multiple rooms simultaneously Bluetooth
can only reach 16 K audio quality and
must use compressed audio files Wi-Fi
can achieve CD quality but will
experience delays when there's multiple
devices in the same area with the use of
dua L and OFDM technology to achieve
wireless transmissions TX and rx will
have lossless transmission bacon has low
latency that can pack a punch with its
384 K 32-bit audio signal
for people who love the sound of vinyl
bacon is your best audio playback
options thanks to its HDMI input though
you can connect to Google chromecast
devices fire TV Roku and any streaming
music services such as Spotify that you
might use to enjoy the best quality
sound of baking your going to want to
have cheese our amplifier which brings
the warm melting sounds of the human
voice and live performances generators
with careful attention to detail they
can fit all environments you need best
bacon the best audio experience because
you deserve it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
