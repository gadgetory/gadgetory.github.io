terms of nutrition in terms of training
every second counts
the equipment is is closure today also
sunglasses
in 1996 the air force approached us we
were three professors at Kent State
University's nickel crystal Institute
and they asked us to see if we can
create a technology that will allow a
pilot or a soldier going into a building
to adapt to the different environmental
conditions as fast as they can that
means that in the dark state it needs to
be like sunglass and in the clear state
as clear as possible it took us about 17
years to create it and we've invested
close to 40 million dollars to create
this technology it will allow a person
to be able to control the amount of
lights that hits them and when to him
I'm convinced that control we
revolutionized I were industry I had
them on automatic mode and I said this
is not gonna work but I went to a darker
place where I was about to grab my glass
and take them down instant ad clear
lenses
if you go for an easy ride it's nice to
play a little bit dark here in the race
it's not safe to take your hand off the
bar I would have it on automatic mode as
soon as I leave the bus it's
extraordinary that this piece of
equipment designed for your Special
Forces is available for any demanding
consumer for any athlete for anybody who
wants to enhance performance the product
can be customized in different ways for
optimal fit you can bend the sides and
then outfit
second of all you can also choose the
color of the frame and a color of the
lens you can take 200 cyclists and let
them try this and they say this is
 fantastic
you
