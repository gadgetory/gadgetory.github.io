hi I'm Jerry and sport I'm one of the
three co-founders of Stowe Joe we
launched our first Kickstarter in 2014
and with your help develop the patented
12 ounce dojo pocket covers it's the
world's only ultra portable collapsible
leak-proof coffee cup we've manufactured
and sold almost two hundred thousand
cups to date and learned a thing or two
along the way we've also received lots
of customer feedback about what works
and what doesn't
we think the proof is in the reviews so
check us out online and see what people
are saying about our first product many
of you have asked for a bigger cup and
wanted us to offer straws you can enjoy
both hot and iced beverages well you
spoke and we listened I'm excited to
introduce the snow Joe biggie
it's a 16-ounce cup that works just like
an original snow Joe Hockey Club when
collapse is still small and compact so
you can easily stow it in your bag purse
car stroller or pocket made from food
grade silicone and recycled bpa-free
plastic it flows the generous 16-ounce
capacity and has a leak proof lid it
comes with a heat sleeve and straw that
make it perfect for both hot and cold
beverages made of five main parts it
breaks down and reassembles for easy
cleaning and of course it's dishwasher
and microwave safe as three busy dad to
share a love for coffee in the
environment we were shocked by the
statistic that Americans cost fifty
eight billion disposable cups each year
it gets worse did you know that few
disposable cups actually get recycled
that means every time someone orders a
copy in that to-go cup even though that
coffee is gone
the resulting waste will be around for
centuries the only good solution is to
bring your own cup but most reusable cup
options are bulky and get left at home
that's why we design a reusable cup
that's so portable and convenient you'll
actually use it we love what we've
created and know that you will too
so backups today pick up a snow job
biggie and join us on our mission to end
disposable cup

personal filtration system available
it's a perfect solution for backpacking
hiking hunting fishing scouting
international travel and emergency
preparedness Adam here's 2 ounces the
mini fits in the palm of your hand and
can filter up to a hundred thousand
gallons of water from any freshwater
lake river or stream deployer mini has a
0.1 micron absolute pore size it was
tested with 10 million parts of bacteria
and a million parts of protozoa without
a single breakthrough this is the
highest level filters can be tested to
so we're confident these are the highest
rates of filtration available destroyer
mini-moon harms of bacteria and protozoa
like Giardia and Cryptosporidium and it
won't ring those chemicals and viruses
however viruses are rarely found in the
water in North America and in foreign
cities the mini can be used the
following ways attach it to explore your
squeeze pouch and drink directly from
the filter or dispensed into a water
bottle
use it as a personal drinking straw to
drink directly from the source or scoop
up a bottle of water and drink instantly
the mini screws directly on the most
standard water bottle which is great for
subject water overseas use it in line on
a hydration pack this allows you to feel
your hydration pack directly from the
source and filter water as you're
drinking through the bite valve so your
filters are so robust they could be back
washed with high pressures and reuse
over and over again
cleaning the storm in is really simple
you just take the included cleaning
plunger and fill it up with a filtered
water then take the mini and insert the
tip of the plunger into the end of the
filter opposite of the flow arrow and
then forcibly push the water back
through the mini you repeat this process
a couple times until the water comes
through clear and easy if you have a
clean filter if you have any questions
or comments we'd love to hear from you
so send us an email at feedback at
