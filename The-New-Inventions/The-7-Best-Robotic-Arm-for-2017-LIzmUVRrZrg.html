arm swift or you arm swift Pro the best
entry-level open-source robot hello I'm
maker arm the world's first
multifunctional robotic arm that with
anywhere in your workspace
I have changeable tool heads that allow
me to do some really neat stuff and I
can help my humans make just about
anything
I can 3d print freely since I don't live
in a box
I can auto level so my humans don't have
to I can make things up to 30 inches
long and 10 inches tall on any flat
surface I can make high quality 3d
prints with both filament and resin but
I can do a lot more than 3d printing I'm
great at building the next big thing
like this
I can cut sheet and 3d print corners I
can pick and place sheets and panels
together and create a custom PCB I can
solder assemble component I can even
work with fellow maker arm voila here's
our finished project a custom laptop I
can be operated wirelessly on all of
your devices plus my humans can teach me
tricks and send me remote instruction I
was made for creative people everywhere
I can make really impressive toy
paint on canvas and fabric and create
custom advices I can etch black engrave
plastic and leather carve metal and wood
I can also plot design
and yes I can even decorate cake
starting a business nowadays is easy
everyone has great ideas but sometimes
it takes a lot of repetitive work to
realize them this is where do bot m1
gets in do bot m1 is an industrial level
robotic arm production platform it's
precise fast and extendable and also
affordable it can be your 3d printer
laser engraver soldering machine or
whatever else you build upon it yes you
can build one do bottom one has 0.02
millimeters repeatability and 1.5
kilogram payload with these standardized
easy to change heads you can easily turn
this power into productivity like 3d
printing it can print your product with
fluency and details to colors no problem
or use laser to engrave your unfading
masterpiece or do sophisticated
soldering customizing your PCB circuit
board better than a pro besides being
multifunctional do bottom one is also
easy to master and develop doo-bot m1
supports Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connection
you can connect to multiple arms at once
and control them via our app on PC or
smartphone with the force-sensitive 3d
mouse you can control do bot m1 as
precisely as you want no more trying and
guessing on a confusing software with
its hand whole teaching feature you can
input coordinates in the fastest and
most intuitive way
do bottom one is programmable via the
integrated api's you can use official or
self built developing environment or use
this visualized programming interface
making things a lot easier but we don't
stop here do bottom one is highly
extendable there are no limits to your
imagination on it the maximum reach of
do bottom one is 400 millimeters which
is enough for most of the situations but
why don't we think bigger when it can
actually go further or use a camera for
visual with it's fast and accurate image
recognizing algorithm it can distinguish
colors without making one mistake do
bottom one loves companions they can
work seamlessly together processing
paperwork way faster than humans could
ultimately do bottom one is built to
replace manpower and production line
