at ng make we believe that everyone
should have the opportunity to become a
maker so that's why we've created the
maker kit which will give you the chance
to build your very own robot meet quad
block while studying engineering we
found that to be loads of theory but
very little hands-on making so we found
in a society for robotics from there we
developed the community and set out the
blueprints to offer people the chance to
build actual robots and since then we've
spent a lot of time around maker spaces
where we have run dedicated workshops in
order to share this knowledge with
others all of this experience has been
distilled into the maker care at the
core of any robot lies its heart in this
case the quad board an Arduino based
platform that makes robotics easy plug
in headers allow interfacing with any
sensory or motor plus onboard power
management handles charging and voltage
regulation in this kit you'll get a quad
board several motors and all the other
materials that you just can't print
using the resources supplied with the
maker get along with free online
software like Audrina and fusion 360 you
can go from beginner
to intermediate and finally expert you
can learn how to 3d design and print new
parts how to use electronics to increase
functionality how to apply math to
something real and how to code and
having no experience to developing
yourself into a real deal coder while
started as an idea soon became estranged
first coming to life through laser
cutting before being further refined
with 3d printing kwadwo has seen his
fair share of iterations before getting
to where he is now and guess what we've
enabled his design to be entirely open
for you to change what we really want is
for you to take quad ball and then make
him your own last week I knew nothing
about robotics and now I've already
built my own laser one it's our dream to
get everyone making now to do that
education needs a change we want to
bring quad bought into schools and
create the next generation of makers
you
this is Sarah she's an office manager
with long hours and bake
responsibilities working on a computer
all day long my name is Ryan I'm
treating Sarah for tension headaches and
stiffness in the neck and shoulder
stress and bad posture may have
contributed to our problem she always
has a great time here in the clinic
however the biggest challenge for her is
how long she can stay there relaxed at
home in modern days neck is being
punished every day driving sitting
computers and cellphones my patients
always ask me is there anything I can
use at home can you show me some easy
stretches that I can do at home so I
promised them I'll make something that's
safe portable maintenance free
instruction free and shareable with
family members which means one size fits
most introducing crest it is designed to
duplicate the manual stimulation save a
natural filling molded into this
beautiful package while stimulating the
key result area it greatly improves the
circulation to the head and relieves
tension and stress in product testing
what's better than giving it to my
favorite massage therapist see rest
helps with my science works is fine as
well it helps elongate my neck there are
my sinuses this is how to use it
wherever whatever rest on crest for 10
minutes or maybe longer move side to
side to get all those spots I want to be
happy and stress free therefore stiff
neck and shoulders should be managed
right so please invest in the feeling of
relief because we all deserve it take
that weight off your shoulder finally
you'll love it that I can promise
thank you do you like flying fpv would
you like to push your limits but are
afraid your plane might be damaged then
we have the right plan for you we wanted
to build a plane for a carefree flying
experience even when go to the ground
and close to obstacles last year we came
up with the idea of a fast agile easy to
transport and very crash resistant plane
we proudly present you the mini race
wing the first step was to make the
plane very crash resistant we achieve
this with a full carbon fiber fuselage
all the fpv and hace gear is kept safe
inside but still the wings took a
beating after some rough landings and
crashes
after many attempts we finally succeeded
by creating a wing mount that releases
the wings at a certain impact force from
now on no matter how have we crashed we
couldn't damage the mini racing anymore
a nice side effect of the crash release
is that the mini race wing doesn't stick
to trees you always take it home with
you but that's not all because
everything is nicely packed into the
fuselage we are free to choose the best
profit thickness and use one hundred
percent of the wingspan for lift
therefore the mini race thing as a much
wider speed envelope then similar flying
wings it's highly efficient and
surprisingly quiet
you can launch the mini racing out of
your hand it's easy and safe we designed
the wing for very high top speeds while
still keeping an eye on the angle of
attack for tight turns and easy landings
and even if you come in hot and the
landing isn't a net loss landing the
mini race ring does not care the mini
race ring has a lot of handy features
built in that we have come to love the
center of gravity can easily be adjusted
by moving the wing and motor mounts with
just a few turns of the screwdriver the
thrust angle can be changed there is a
dedicated compartment with a protective
plate for your fpv camera several mount
points for fpv antennas and of course
the space for your favorite HD camera
this makes the mini race being not only
perfect for flagging stock configuration
but also for building your own wings the
adjustable wing and motor mounts make an
excellent platform to test your ideas
and the Richard carbon fuselage is
keeping an electronic safe while testing
and at the end of the day you've
dismount the wings and pack them in your
a string into your backpack or suitcase
and take it wherever you want we have
already produced several prototypes and
kids and are able to manufacture the
carbon fuselage in our shop the high
quality carbon fiber material is
manufactured in Germany and the highest
strength and lowest weight
