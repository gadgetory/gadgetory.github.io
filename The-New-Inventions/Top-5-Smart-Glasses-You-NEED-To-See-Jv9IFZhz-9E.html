something I want to do it a percent
I always try to be a step ahead of the
others in terms of nutrition in terms of
training every second counts
the equipment is is closure today also
sunglasses
in 1996 the air force approached us we
were three professors I can't State
University's liquid-crystal Institute
and they asked us to see if we can
create a technology that will allow a
pilot or a soldier going into a building
to adapt to the different environmental
conditions as fast as they can that
means that in the dark state it needs to
be like sunglass and in the clear state
as clear as possible it took us about 17
years to create it and we've invested
close to 40 million dollars to create
this technology it will allow a person
to be able to control the amount of
lights that hits them and winter it I'm
convinced that control we revolutionized
I were industry had them on automatic
mode and I said it's not gonna work but
I went to a darker place where I was
about to drop my glass and take them
down instant at clear lenses
if you go for an easy ride it's nice to
play a little bit like here in the race
it's not safe to take your hand off the
bar I would have it an automatic mode as
soon as I leave the bus it's
extraordinary that this piece of
equipment designed for US Special Forces
is available for any demanding consumer
for any athlete for anybody who wants to
enhance performance the product can be
customized in different ways for optimal
fit you can bend the sides and the now
split second of all you can also choose
the color of the frame and a color of
the lens you can take two hundred
cyclists and let them try this and they
say this is fantastic
smartphones tablets mp3 GPS and
computers are the everyday fundamental
devices we all use and we also wear
headphones or earbuds that are often a
danger for ourselves and others right
now thanks to your support we can make
the extraordinary sound glasses project
a reality with sound glasses you can
listen without the unnecessary
impediment of earphones thanks to to
blue hell vibe high-tech bone conduction
speakers that totally bypass the ear
canal by transmitting sound vibrations
in close proximity to the temple talk
without any disturbance thanks to their
state-of-the-art built-in microphone to
be active without wires
thanks to their 4.0 Bluetooth
thanks to your incredible support we
reached our goal in less than 48 hours
and reached 3 stretch goals this allowed
us to give our backers new
customizations and brand-new accessories
for free but we're working to offer you
even more our next step will be an
extended battery life an intercom system
which will allow you to communicate in
any situations with your close buddies
with a touch of a button this snow is
amazing today yeah
follow me turn to the right ok with your
help and support we can increasingly
improve the sound glasses and you and
your friends will be the very first to
enjoy this amazing innovative product
sound glasses give you innovation
freedom safety and easier life solos are
providing some amazing information to us
in a way that is completely different
as an eyewear the soul dose is
absolutely revolutionary
I know a lot of cyclists get really into
that gear and into that technology and
how to improve and this is definitely a
tool to use to help you improve
we've been honored to be working with
USA Cycling for over a year now
developing this product there's no other
competitor out there that it started
working with Olympic team and a national
team from the ground up what do the top
level athletes were they looking for
what's comfortable even before we had
anything even for the outlets to grab
and look at and I think that the project
is turned out to check all those boxes
and even be better than expectations the
question that they asked was what do you
want in order to win US goal of her USA
in Rio the mission of solos is to really
empower the athlete with the critical
data that they need to perform at their
peak and this is accomplished through
state-of-the-art heads-up display and
audio technologies that will enable the
athlete to have access in real time to
the data that they're actually tracking
with our team as we prepare for Rio the
solos is getting feedback to the riders
instantaneously it's cool to have a dual
purpose like sunglasses and a palomito
all in one you see it immediately right
that as you're riding along and can hear
it through the eyepiece and have
anything you want on there your speed of
time anything you'd think it looks
really small but it's actually quite a
large display so it's like this entire
upper right quadrant but if you just
like look beyond it you don't even
notice it soles is perfect for the
casual commuter or the weekend warrior
now you don't have to worry about
dropping your phone or looking down at
your bike computer screen because her
virtual display is three times larger
than your typical biking pair you want
something that that has that technology
and conveys that information but also it
needs to be a cool pair of sunglasses -
for myself the biggest thing I think is
safety you can pull it turn-by-turn
directions or talk on the phone
hands-free and for the hardcore cyclist
or triathlete you will never have to
leave the air position because all the
data that you need is right there in
front of your eyes it goes along with an
app that's really easy to set up and and
super easy to use with our app you use
that to connect to the headset over
Bluetooth and then you compare to all of
the sensors you already have heart rate
speed cadence power all of that can
easily connect to the in
and push things up to Strava we already
have a GPS on the phone and you're good
to go
with the solos you have the ability to
change the focus and place that exactly
where you want to see that information
for the solos you know it's like they
weigh nothing especially compared to the
other options out there and what's so
cool about these glasses I mean you can
change the lenses it's super awesome
there's very very few companies out
there that can say that they've actually
paid the price that they're on the
ground with the athletes that that
they're doing everything possible and
following this journey with the athletes
you know for both the ups and the downs
and I think that's ultimately why we've
had such a fantastic product come out of
that journey today you can be one of the
first people in the world to purchase
the soleus for yourself on Kickstarter
souls will help you improve the
performance of your ride train smarter

special pricing to you with all the
features and functionality that have
