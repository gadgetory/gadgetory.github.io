shoes make the outfit but when it comes
to winter boots why are we forced to
choose between looking great and being
more can you believe in a world of
fashion and function of style and warmth
we believe again as adaptable as
innovative as comfortable as unstoppable
as you are we believe in better we
believe your winter will never be the
same hi I'm Katie the creator of one day
when I moved from California to Boston
for school I wanted a group it was warm
enough for the cold Northeast winters
stylish and versatile enough that i'd
also be excited to wear it out no matter
the situation so you can wear out dinner
around eight and not have to freeze on
the way there for maybe you just want to
enjoy some more during your day Lindy is
a complete reimagine ation of what a
boot can be you'll be thrilled to find
that these are beautiful boots it also
happened to be heated we've tested our
prototype extensively with hundreds of
potential customers perfected the design
of the heating system and selected our
manufacturing
now we need your help to our minimum
Florida proxies so we can start our
first manufacturing run help us
reimagine what a winter boot UV and join
and bringing wendys to people all over
the world who agree it's time for a
larger reboot you'll love to wear
everywhere so you want to automate your
house so you start with the basics
searching for a control device that can
connect all your home and personal
devices but looking around you discover
there are a lot of options to choose
from which is great but there's a catch
most of these control devices use a
connecting technology that requires you
to utilize some kind of adapter in order
to use your existing devices like your
TV stereo receiver or air conditioner so
at this point you're thinking not cool I
don't want to spend money on adapters or
replace what i already have for this to
work believe me we felt the same way and
that was our driving force to develop a
simpler more friendly solution to
automating your home where you can use
devices you already have it home and
remove the hassle and expense of
unnecessary adapters or new devices in
the end creating a more affordable
solution for home automation because we
strongly believe that things should be
simpler here's how it works most devices
in your home are controlled with
infrared like TVs cable TV's receivers
and radio frequency like your garage
door or roller blinds what we did was
create a control device that understands
and controls these devices through
connecting technologies they already use
one control one app that's simple with
more than 5000 devices already set in
our cloud cattle you can set timers
use it remotely
and even set scenes to literally have
everything the way you want it just a
touch away I've known my partner since
we were kids and something that always
bound us together with a strong belief
that things should and can be simple
we're always trying to come up with
better and smarter way to solve our
challenge so when we start looking at
the home automation market as consumers
we didn't like what we saw the solutions
were more complicated than they need it
to be with that we once again align
ourselves to create easy tax using the
same spirit and passion we have its
childhood friends to find a more
simplified solution a year ago we
started in a pursuit to create a unique
product and just one app to control your
entire home from a TV or EC to a roller
blind or a guard store we also had a
challenge to keep it affordable reliable
and to make your existing products smart
right out of the box we did succeed FCC
licensing it's on its way and we are now
ready for production please back it and
have it firsthand
