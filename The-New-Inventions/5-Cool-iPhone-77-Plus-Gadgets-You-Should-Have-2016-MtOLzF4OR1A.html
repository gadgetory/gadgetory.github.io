connector for iPhone 7 because Apple has
combined the audio jack and the power
jack into one connector on the iPhone 7
we are now able to give you a magnetic
connector that connects your data audio
and fast charging in a single clip it's
never been what he needed
magnetic connectors are vastly superior
to mechanical connections not only are
they way more convenient to use
they're also far more resistant to dust
water and other contaminants all this
added reliability can greatly improve
your peace of mind our engineering team
has worked very hard to make this
connector as small as possible we have
also developed a two-in-one connector
that works with Android and Apple
devices we've already successfully
completed a pilot manufacturing run of
over 1,000 units
we have done extensive testing to ensure
the reliability over extended news if
you're interested please contact us now
through our early review
please support us and make this a
reality we cannot do it without you we
love our smartphones we take them
everywhere we go they help us plan our
day keep in touch with friends and
family and for most of us
they even support our work day but all
these fun functions come at a cost
battery don't you just hate it when your
phone runs out of battery
our current solution includes carrying
around our power bank plugs cables and
everything else we need to ensure we
don't run out of juice imagine if there
was a smarter way to save your precious
phone battery from running out all the
time something lightweight and easy to
use
say hello to cube it's the world's first
revolutionary power bank that combines
three features in the one compact device
power bank memory card reader sync and
quick charging cable you don't even need
your USB flash drive anymore
cube turns into a memory storage device
and it's compatible with any laptop via
the USB port there's no need to carry
around any other accessories ever cables
are often messy but knock you simply
wrap it in this tuck away slot and
you're good to go how really does the
cube work well it's a simple concept
just plug your cube into your phone and
into the power source it detects when
your smart phone is fully charged and
redirects the charge to its internal
battery unlike your power bank that must
be charged separately cube automatically
charges itself while charging your phone
so you always know that cube is there
for you and will never let you down
hi my name is questioned as every busy
person I was often on the road and
almost every day my phone was running
out of the battery in the afternoon
instead of messy wires and power bank I
wanted
have only one small device that can
replace the number of home accessories I
have to carry everything when we started
to think about the cube group at the
existing technology on the map and we
quickly noticed that most of the
available devices were not complete and
not user-friendly
together with fear our head designer we
developed the cube we went through
several prototypes to find the best
design the cube the designer the elegant
compact and practically it was so
challenging with all those
functionalities together into a small
and cool design with a significant
battery capacity it was something that
had never been done but we made it and
we're so proud and excited to bring it
to you cube is the world's first compact
and lightweight device that combines the
functions of a power bank a memory
storage and a sink and quick charging
cable you also agree it's one of the
coolest looking power banks around

technology that we can no longer live
without let's bring it to the world

dual-sim capable doubles its battery
life by adding a 2000 mAh battery and

friends or family whatever carrying a
second phone is always irritating but
not anymore you will finally be able to
use two SIM cards at once in your phone
