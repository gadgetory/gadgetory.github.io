every single day and because of the way
we're doing it 90% of us will get back
pain in our lives
seriously when we hunch and slump it
affects our mood our happiness even how
optimistic we feel look at yourself
right now
how are you sitting how's your back and
your neck probably not too great huh hi
my name is Catherine and I started
working on my posture two and a half
years ago when I started having terrible
sciatica pain I have spent so much time
and money on doctors visits therapies
special pillows and all these ridiculous
products but I couldn't find anything
that just worked so for the past year
I've been creating a real solution with
the most amazing designers and
prototypers and dozens and dozens of
people with really bad backs it was
important to create something small
enough I could fit in my purse and
something effortless so I could just
count on it working in five seconds flat
something reliable and something that
would help me improve my posture even
when I wasn't wearing it this is better
back it allows you to effortlessly sit
in perfect posture easing back pain and
training yourself how to sit use it when
you're sitting at your desk on an
airplane watching a game or even when
you meditate basically use it anytime
you have to sit you don't have to go far
to find people with bad posture or back
pain a friend a parent someone you work
with or even people you meet product
testing around San Francisco every
Friday here's what people think about
better back
still that sound of elaborate I feel da
honey feels awesome it's so easy to just
sit up straight this could sound weird
back and like feel my my body you know I
can feel my my organs not being squished
I can feel that it's right here
but it's not like oh I have all this on
me it's just like I am just like
relieved pain-free I'm sitting straight
up right it's like it forces your torso
to stay upright where can I get one of
these can I have this one simple it's
easy I put it on and I feel immediate
relief when you're pain free and your
body is perfectly aligned you feel
happier more confident and you regain
your ability to focus on whatever it is
you want out of life do you or your
loved ones have a hypertension high
blood pressure or heart problems then
listen carefully you cannot trust your
home blood pressure monitor
a few years ago a friend of mine was
misdiagnosed because of the inaccurate
monitor readings when the doctors found
out the real reason of his sickness it
was too late that day and made a pledge
to find a solution which for the same
others unless their friends and families
avoid painful loss I didn't find any
automatic blood pressure monitor I could
trust all those should discrepancy from
doctors professional tools being an
engineer myself I decided to make such a
tool now three years later and proud to
present you a contention the first blood
pressure kit for at-home use that
provides the results as accurate as
doctors measurements the doctors mast is
very simple and three forward the use a
stethoscope to listen to the sons of
blood flow the problem is to accurately
measure the sons in real-time my
solution is was smartphone almost
everyone has internal and it can become
a powerful tool for your health care
regime attention can work with your
existing tools or on its own you can
plug it into a traditional spy gamma
meter or an automatic blood pressure
monitor
and for those who don't have either
there's a special cuff to directly
measure your blood pressure record blood
flow sounds using your smartphone acute
tension that visualizes them so you not
only hear the sounds but also see them
on your phone screen you can play back
the sounds later to ascertain the
reading or to show to your doctor the
visualize sound curve lets you see them
for precise measurement
it makes the measurement easy and
accurate every year hypertension and
high blood pressure kills 7 million
people with amputation we can help save
lives I want to bring it into your home
and to make it available for everybody

your reward series campaign with your
friends and family

always have the most precise information
and the peace of mind that your loved
ones can get help on time
they're called bandit with the Latin AE
bandit the bank and bandit as an outlaw
so they're all named after famous famous
bandits so the process of engineer in
behind we developed this alloy that has
the perfect balance between elastic and
plastic properties this means that it
will deform under pressure but it will
resume its original position without
without any damage once you bend it back
we will model one which had had its
flaws can you give an idea of the
concept the concept is that you then do
this and this is your result you will
discover that there are opinion things
that if you can do with the with those
sunglasses and its components don't use
them you pick them up and you have them
hanging on the things so that's how you
store them place the phone in the middle
you can have them fit tightly you can
have them fit lose wrap one along around
one of your finger and you just like to
keep them like this you're not left with
the with a piece of plastic that you did
not know what to do about you just put
it around your neck and I do think so
you move around it doesn't fall cook
them well stay super style you can wrap
it around around your wrist this one can
become a head band for girls or the few
guys left with ponytails are you can
work if you had yeah are you bandit
earrings covered them when you're not
using them then you're done if you
really wanna be cool and you have a
snake we even found out a way to wear
them when you've got a headache
like this yes there we go in
well it all started because I could not
find the sunglasses in the market that
are designed to protect the lenses
no one ever changes a sunglasses this is
a big leap for for sunglasses we're
changing something they're cool they
were they're fun they're not expensive
they're very well made very good quality
there's a lot of craftsmanship you might
not be able to see it because they're
covered in in silicone but what's inside
it's amazing how much work and how long
it took we spent months and months
working on the right or right bendiness
of the materials the right stability of
material and flexibility we're there we
pretty much did or all the legwork what
we need now it's your help to finance
the production by giving us early
support you will be able to get the best
deals on the on the sunglasses any
contribution is accepted and welcome I
hope you'll be able to go home with the
amazing pair of bandits
every once in a while you see something
unusual and face this new sensation that
goes against all your expectations for a
moment you have this extraordinary
feeling that can only be described in
one word magical we wanted to create a
product that delivers a special
experience and that's a flux test called
a spectacle a scientific experience or
skill toy however it will never fail to
impress you and your friends regardless
of how much you know about underlying
physics there is a rarely known rule of
megiddo dynamics called Lenz's law
the moving magnetic field of a falling
ball induces so-called eddy currents
that in turn creates a reverse magnetic
field that repels and slows down the
magnet this result is an amazing
anti-gravity effect when we built the
first prototype of flux
we were truly amazed by the reactions of
people having seen the surprise and
smiles on their faces made us believe
that it could be a product that everyone
wants we went through a lot of testing
and experimenting to learn what feels
good your hands and how we can improve
the product when able even more away
reviews each tube of flux precisely
turned and comes in a colorful leather
cover I seamlessly blends into the
surface of a metal
you can choose your own material and
variation of colors or even order a cool
desktop stand to match your style and
needs you can sit back relax and enjoy
the smooth almost floating movement of
the ball or you can perform fresh new
tricks since it's a new toy the
variations are only limited by your
creativity to ensure the most
spectacular experience your flux comes
with nothing but the strongest kind of
permanent magnets currently available on
the planet that tiny ball is strong
enough to hold a weight of 15 kilograms
its strength is a lot of fun but also
requires careful attention playing
around with flux it's just so much fun
we started this project because we
thought everyone should have the chance
to get their hands on this amazing
experience while our product seems
simple the components are expensive and
not available in low quantities as soon
as our minimum quantities are reached we
are ready to start mass production and
achieve the offered price by backing us
we are not only getting your own custom
set you're also helping to make this
magical product available so that
finally everyone will know what it's
like to feel flux
