of the nice patented features out here

you can set it to record continuously
and then something cool happens you just
tap it it will save up to the last five
minutes
you
did you get that totally got halfway
like yes that hi Bo narrow spectrum the
creators of the world's first
biofeedback device for back neck and
abdominal posture human evolution
accelerated when our ancestors stood up
straight for the first time standing
freed our hands while advancing
development of the brain propelling the
leap from Homo erectus to Homo sapiens
and paving the way for our civilizations
and culture then the 20th century came
along and challenged this very hallmark
of humanity the act of standing talk we
began to hunch over modern sedentary
jobs and habits forced us to adopt
unnatural postures causing accelerated
aging and degenerative changes of the
spine
even diseases such as spondylosis to
counter this regression we created the
world's first device that
comprehensively addresses posture of the
spine unlike other posture correcting
devices on the market which typically
address only a segment of the spine such
as neck or back our electronic posture
aid helps correct the posture of the
entire spine namely cervical thoracic
and lumbar segments and even addresses
abdominal musculature using the
electronic pastorate only 30 minutes per
day helps the user develop better
ergonomic habits without sacrificing
freedom of motion with great posture you
will be healthier look taller all day
better presence and feel more attractive
be focused on providing an intuitive
minimally intrusive solution ready for
use right out of the box using a
magnetic sensor keypad and an adjustable
strap our devices low powered durable
and easily customizable to use the
electronic posture aid put on the device
then adjust the strap and clip the
clothing turn on by pushing the mode
button assume your desired posture then
push the range button to calibrate
select between tactile auditory or
visual feedback modes to maintain your
posture while confident about the
potential the past few years going from
vision to reality has been a challenge
we researched developed experimented
coded and tested prototypes for a solid
quality durable product while working
full time elsewhere now we've made a
leap and created our first generation of
electronic posture aid and we're excited
about sharing it with you this is where
you can
while excited about our electronic
posture aids ability to address a
comprehensive set of posture keys with a
low profile aesthetic our goal with the
monolith is to pack this functionality

me and my human and we've seen a lot
together good times bad times overall
it's been a good ride why do I like
staring into the mirror I mean have you
seen this for two words on fleek I I'd
like to run around when my mom's not
here but I also miss mama when she's not
here you know when you get to be my age
well memories start to really matter
that's why I gotta pause cam yeah it's
pretty cool the first wearable camera
for dogs who arable just like my
favorite outfit let's see with paws cam
my mom can see exactly what i see so she
understands what i want oh and one time
I found my favorite toy that I lost a
bajillion years ago I thought the cat
stole it I only want people to see my
best moments so the six second clip
feature is my fav it's just me in my
most fantabulous moments it's the
perfect blank for sharing on Instagram I
have quite a following you know and
thanks to motion detection the camera
only turns on when it senses interesting
movement it's so my human doesn't get
videos of me just slowly ping download
the free app on your magic box your
small magic box your large magic box
your medium magic box hey by the way how
many magic boxes do you humans need huh
anyway know what we're up to with the
remote viewing on York whatever magic
box
well honestly I mean those shoes were
like so last year and I did her a favor
buzz cam is down tough and can withstand
bites and scratches when me and my
buddies play around it's also
puddleproof when out of range pause cam
saves the recordings until it's in range
again automatically syncing recordings
to the cloud pause cam saves moments
someone can view them remotely from work
oh when she's shopping or when she's
buying me treats um are you watching now
mum mum if you're watching now could you
give me a sign oh do you see that car
like I said me and my guy have seen a
lot together now we'll have those
moments forever you might use fancy
words like sinking social media sharing
and remote viewing I don't know much
about that stuff I just call it love
don't miss another precious moment like
pawns cam today</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
