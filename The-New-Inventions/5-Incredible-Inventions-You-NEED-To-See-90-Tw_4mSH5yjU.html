the tranquility and their movements to
the beauty in the way they light up a
room they can't survive in just any
aquarium they need a specialized tank
with no sharp objects or corners a year
ago we set out to create the ultimate
jellyfish tank one that solved all the
problems from every other tank on the
market every aspect of the jelly tank
design was based on functionality in
form with its clean lines sophisticated
look in natural flow our proprietary
tank design patent Oslo bark ensures a
current similar to what jellyfish would
experience in their natural environment
we designed the spray bar in a way to
keep the jellyfish from getting sucked
into the grapes while promoting movement
with men this allowed us to develop a
powerful filtration system to ensure
optical and water quality the tank is
small enough to fit on your desk yet big
enough to hold dozens of jellyfish our
design is twice as big as other tanks
and market which gives jellyfish a more
stable environment makes it easier for
you to maintain there's nothing more
beautiful and illuminated jellyfish so
we integrated a high quality
remote-controlled LED light take and
light up the jellies with whatever color
suits your mood I can see here and look
at it for hours I think this is so cool
that you can actually have something
like this like on your desk in your
house absolutely we've aligned ourselves
with what we believe to be the best
create a sustainable source of jellyfish
for our tank owners
we develop did some or first-time users
or expert acquire typical confident
going on a product and in fact by both
science and research put together the
ultimate starter kit for all you pick
starters we've included everything you
need to get your jelly tank up and
running including jellyfish
even though we are online 24/7 to all
kinds of smart devices really touching
each other when we're not together it's
still impossible so I started thinking
what if two people could communicate
over a distance my touch touch is a
universal language and hey creates new
moments and ways to communicate with
your loved one and the great thing is
you can create your own personal meaning
for a touch what did you like to be
together watching a sports event say hey
good luck or say hey good morning or
just a hey I'm thinking about you your
hey means what you two wanted to it
can't get much more personal for me it
all started with my oldest son when he
was 4 years old and we start a little
tradition when we saw something special
first one we would see would squeeze two
times and now we use it on all kinds of
occasions sometimes it's just say I love
you
five years later the tradition is still
very much alive I wanted to create
something that made this possible even
when we were not together and to answer
this question we created this little
piece of magic he enables people to
share special moments by touching each
other in real time whenever wherever you
are
I hate creates the real natural feel
social touch is vital for forming and
maintaining social connections with
other people think for example of
hugging someone you love or even just
holding their hands or putting your hand
on someone's shoulder these are really
fundamental ways in which we communicate
intimacy and love for the past five
years I've been doing research into
social touch through haptic technology
so technology that you can feel and what
I've seen from my own research and from
research of other people is that there
are parallels between the way that
people experience real social touch and
the way that people experience social
touch through technology imagine that no
matter where you are you're always quite
literally in touch with the people that
you love I think that's that's something
really remarkable and I think it can
really change the way that people
communicate with each other
