the founder of your message games and
movies are something I'm really
passionate about we have great screens
and sound system on our affordable but
still I've always had the feeling that
something could be improved in the home
entertainment experience something that
would let us be less passive when seated
how do you really feel the thrill what's
happening on your screen one year ago I
was watching the couch a scene from Fast
&amp;amp; Furious and I realize it'd be so much
fun to be part of the scene sometimes
you know you have an idea you can't get
it out of your mind well after extensive
research I realized that there was no
solution that fits in your living room
that is affordable or that is even
accessible unless of course you're a
millionaire that is why we've come up
with mercy to take games and movies to
the next level
the magic that said the mercy depart is
a Messier number of movements and
vibrations that literally take you
inside the screen what we're doing at
immerseus is trying to create the
world's best motion device designed
especially for gaming and movies just
imagine seeing some of the most timeless
movies again and living the experience
as if you were watching them for the
very first time imagine playing and
feeling the helicopters engine rumbling
underneath you and the tilting of your
couch when you on the fly Merced is
ready to use and very user-friendly you
just have to slip it under the feet of
your favorite couch chair a bed and turn
on the app it will automatically
recognize what movie you're watching or
game you playing and will synchronize
with it instantly then everything can be
controlled from the app you can adjust
intensity of the vibration and set the
high to your liking if you want a smooth
ride or a big shape
to create a message we assumed a team of
engineer from many domains will design
all the components for functionality and
aesthetics and ensures it will provide
the best explain 10 we overcame many
challenges but we managed to integrate
the most powerful system into the most
compact device our designers made the
most desperate device that will fit in
any living room under any piece of
furniture and without changing anything
we have tested immerse it extensively
and it's a pleasure to see users face
once the couch stopped moving beneath
them you can see the smile where they're
being immersed in the most surprising
manner adding one in your living room
will change the way you watch movies or
play games it will glue all of your
friends away and they'll love it our
third generation prototype is functional
both on the other way and on the
software side we're still improving it
daily and adding features but to make
this product a reality for anyone we
need you hardware development and mass
production is a long and expensive
process and we need your support we're
looking for patient it's dreamers
believers that will help us make this
kid's dream a reality for everyone thank
you
you
you
you
you
what if your drones were meant to do
more to be able to track your movements
and follow you around to be able to bowl
strikes for you to be able to fly custom
routes autonomously and free from a
remote code rijn is the drone that can
be programmed to do anything you want
it's part code and part drone if you've
ever wanted to learn how to code there's
never been a better time to start
because with code room your code can fly
and come alive we've partnered with by
robot to launch a high quality drone
that is both affordable and easy to
program the kit comes with all the parts
you need to build and code for your very
own drone you can program your drone to
fly within minutes after assembly out of
the box our community site offers more
than just easy-to-follow tutorials and
videos you can receive additional help
share new creations and connect with
other robot lovers learning how to fly
drones and code is now more fun and
accessible than ever before because of
the previous success of our Kickstarter
campaign co drone is already a reality
we at Robo link are a team of designers
engineers and teachers united by our
love for building robots and we are
continuing to develop and optimize the
best drone coding experience possible
supporting co drone means you're not
just getting an awesome drone but also
investing in learning a valuable new
skill with unlimited possibilities so
get coding and take flight that's the
code room
you
you
we all know that we need to get away
from fossil fuels and add more clean
renewable energy into the grid but the
problem that we have is our grid is over
100 years old and wasn't designed to be
able to have renewable energy
incorporated into it the solution is to
be able to add massive amounts of energy
storage on to the grid in order to
enable rapid adoption of renewable clean
energy our team had to look at this
problem differently we combined our
experience to create whoreson Network
energy storage when Orson is simply
plugged in you can store power from any
power source whether it's from the
electric grid or from solar if you're in
single-family home or if you're an
apartment it enables you to charge when
rates are low and discharged back into
your home when rates are high in order
to save you money Orson optimizes times
of charge and discharge automatically by
communicating wirelessly with our cloud
that monitors utility rates peak demand
charges whether blackouts as well as the
health of the Orson during normal
operation Orson provides power to any
energy demand within your home in the
event of a grid failure Orson
automatically trips the circuit breaker
in milliseconds to ensure the power that
you stored never leaves your home we've
been frustrated by the lack of
innovation and moving to a clean
renewable energy grid traditional energy
storage solutions are complex invasive
and clunky and they're meant to be in
mechanical rooms are outside whoreson is
beautifully designed it's the only
plug-and-play solution on the market we
designed it to be lightweight modular
and scalable so it can be rapidly
adopted by the masses it's literally
plug and play doesn't require permits
expertise to install and there are no
hidden costs think about it this way the
more people that use or a sense the more
renewables and clean energy can be
adopted to the grid so together we can
reduce greenhouse gas emissions and
protect the environment
