technology will save us we're on a
mission to spark the creative
imagination of young people losing hands
on technology really excited to be
launching the first wearable that kids
make encode themselves and I'm so
pleased introduce you to the mover kit
terrain Bella you're eating like the
wizard the crib spy satellites on the
odds the goal of a relay my friends it
is the first active play wearable kids
make and code themselves it has motion
sensors a compass and rainbow lights
that respond to kids moving and being
active we designed it to be portable
responsive and open-ended
we started with a need as parents we
really want to have the creative and
technical skills he was surely need for
his future another hit combines digital
physical technologies with the amazing
accessible playful make it yourself
approach that we're quite wonderful it's
basically a wearable designed for kids
imaginations your skin tells a story
it's the story of how you live your life
outside connected to the things that
matter to you but if your skin could ask
for something it would ask for
protection because there are over 1
million cases of skin cancer per year in
the united states alone the problem with
sunscreen you can't see if it's actually
protecting you sunscreen is like an
invisible armor so how do you know if
it's worn off how do you know if you've
applied enough to protect your skin hi
I'm Dave founder and creator of
sunscreen sunscreen ur is a special
camera that shows you the UV rays that
sunscreen blocks when you look through
sun screener protected stand appears
dark unprotected skin appears like you
can actually see the spots where water
sand or sweat has worn away your
protection whether you just need a quick
look at your kids skin or you want to
check your own protection sunscreen ur
has you come
I love spending time outside with my
family but I've always been concerned
about skin damage my goal in creating
sunscreen er was to find an easy way for
my family to protect ourselves while we
enjoyed the outdoors so I took
technology that was previously only
accessible to scientists and made it
accessible to all of us sunscreen er is
easy to use waterproof and durable it's
smaller than a granola bar yet as
powerful as a multi-thousand dollar
camera it's perfect for everywhere the
beach the soccer field your favorite
fishing hole even the golf course and it
helps us protect our skin and our loved
ones from sun damage your skin story
should be about doing the things you
love protect it with sunscreen ur ear
buds are an ideal piece of equipment for
listening to music while roaming that
said ear buds are not without their
drawbacks they can hurt the ears when
the wires get pulled ouch they have to
be put away when they get removed the
wires can get tangled up requiring
painstaking minutes to unravel and every
time those earbuds get knotted or yanked
we're going to see premature wear and
tear to those earbuds spark can provide
the solution to all these problems spark
can be attached to your earphones in an
instant making them easier to use easier
to take off more comfortable to wear and
smarter spark makes carrying your
earbuds easy all around your neck your
earbuds are instantly avail
it takes the strain from any wire tummy
so that your ears don't have to when you
no longer need your ear buds remove them
from your ears spark will carry them for
you they'll remain elegantly suspended
and instantly retrievable when you next
want them sparks flexible cord has been
specially designed to make it easy for
you to put your earphones away first
wind the wire of your earphones around
your hand then wind the spark cord
around the wires you can open out your
earphones in a matter of seconds unwind
the spark cord and the wires will
instantly drop ready for use
in a single movement you can fold spark
to transform it into a smartphone stand
spark contains an inbuilt NFC chip all
you need to do is to get your NFC
compatible smartphone into close
proximity with a spark NFC chip this
will reduce any series of repetitive
actions down to one single movement
quite handy isn't it
you

it seems like every few weeks I was
buying a new charger for my phone or
tablet between losing them kids and
coworkers borrowing them and switching
brands are updating to the latest
version they never seem to last until I
got the rabbit charger it's a mounted
charger that can handle two devices at
the same time it quickly installs into
any standard outlet so I know it will
remain there for whenever I mean it the
swappable tips allow me to charge my
Apple and my husband's Android at the
same time and update to the latest
versions plus I still have an available
outlet best of all the retractable cable
and sleek design replaces might jumble
of messy wires for a more permanent
charging solution the light tells you
when it's charging and with 2.4 amps it
can quickly charge a phone and tablet
simultaneously the rabbit charger is
easy to use looks great and best of all
doesn't disappear every few weeks which
saves me money and I don't have to chase
my kids and co-workers around anymore so
how can you get one I'll turn it over to
the Creator for the answer to that hi
I'm Patrick Barnidge creator of the
rabbit charging our working prototype is
finished so we can quickly move into
distribution to our backers after the
campaign we have some exciting reward
levels so please support our campaign
and share with your friends thank you
music is a language with emotion a part
of our lives when you listen to a live
performance you are cast by the music
and connect to the performance however
when you listen to the recording at home
why can't you experience the same and
similar frequency sound stages dolls an
actuary sound stage should have a clear
fergus everything is in this exercise
place at the right position timing is
very critical when it comes to sound
stage as it affects our perception high
resolution audio could only deliver
crystal-clear sound but not a musicality
only besides timing of all speaker
drivers can bring you a to sound stage
because of the limitation Oh technology
you can't find any Co time era speakers
in the market we use technology to stop
the problem when classic is the
cumulation of five years different work
it's offers you an authentic new civil
production but just as 110 the price of
most high-end audio system what's the
problem with the commercial speakers
single going through class / freighter
induces different time delay on
different frequencies move in return is
playing out of phase sound address of
the focus and knocking scale Wi-Fi is a
point-to-point communication signal is
transmitted to speakers one by one left

same time Sam stage is totally launched
jet technology has single-incision
hundred times over seconds left and
right speakers are aligned by used our
practices in linear phase after our
crossover further over interject and
playing phase no town area most bigger
drivers a fool and true sound stages
retained one classic delivers clean
clear and warm over cell which presents

our chavan two-hundred-thousand-dollar
settle for reference next the one closet
we put in front listen holla 40 thousand
allah wallah speaker reproduced sound
sooo close to chop and subject
so don't forget it's just something I'm
go you should be surprised and
transparent Brooks outsized and wireless
speaker can perform so close to John
speakers + amplifiers and CD player
generally we have Manning radio devices
at home those Wi-Fi and berto speakers
suffer from cloudy channeling the
variance for del operating a clean
frequency band it's channel is dedicated
for each device this year we got to sing
yes innovation of wars by jet technology
it's a great chance to design as his
first feature with a beautiful look and
excellence and quality one classy is
made of 12 millimeter thick German
acrylic a critic strong hotness and high
internal damping characteristics is
surgery to balance our myths option and
reflection inside a speaker and unlike
glass it is safe and sound with pure and
warm in all the tequila transparent we
can't use any absorption material or
petition structure in a speaker
enclosure instead we carefully trained
enclosure dimension to Han stir
constantly fed electronic board should
be compact enough to put inside a
speaker without destroying the
transparent appearance we developed in
holding one firmware loaded on the high

eliminate two balconies think the food
digital design can minimize your
microphone affect everyone has different
preference of siren character we can
afford their knees we introduced web
types of thumb profile by utilizing
digital parameters in souring

many accessory to get it working or you
have two down Lou Ann is drawing

young you only need a highly integrated
USB dongle which helped to deliver high
fidelity sound for you meet you is
plugging our USB dongle employee just a
