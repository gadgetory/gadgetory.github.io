matters most wallrider your speed
distance ascent in time I believe that
everything on your bike should be as
pure and beautiful as the ride and the
bike itself when I look at existing
cycling computers they look and behave
like a piece of consumer electronics or
a smartphone
I don't want now my handlebars I want a
modern speedometer and the only looks
like it belongs on a bike but reflects
the spirit and pleasure of wire ride in
the first place but without compromising
on the outside is a classic analog face
our decision to go with analog is based
on principles of visual perception it's
designed specifically to maximize
legibility in motion and give you the
information you need most at a glance on
the inside our custom mechanical service
only translates the GPS computer data
into this analog movement of the hands
because we have GPS and blessin
Bluetooth the ometer one tracks
everything with the same high level of
precision as the best cycling computers
which means all your ride data is
recorded and can be shared Ostrava or
the application of your choice it takes
a unique set of capabilities and a
strong point of view not to follow
convention and create something
different our vision is definitely
ambitious but with your support we can
build it we've assembled a world-class
team of engineers designers and highly
experienced product makers now we're
joined by world champion fabian
cancellara to help us ensure we get it
100% right collectively we have the
knowledge and experience to deliver this
product first you break the spot let's
go down this les it has to be more
precise this is for the people that just
love riding the bike
and that's what I also like I did 16
years professional and honestly I want
to join my rights
I'm collaborating with the hands and
updating software
you can almost see it almost touch it we
build lots of prototypes and products
are there we're so excited to share it
publicly and very soon get the first ah
meters on your handlebars and you can
see those hands right
what we're building isn't a retron play
essentially we see ometer is more a
statement of where technology could and
should go this isn't design for your
maximum attention it has all the
technology that you've won you don't
need to show those things all the time
you don't need more features to make it
a better product actually the more you
leave out things a better product if
you're a cyclist you'll know that bike
lights are both lifesavers as well as
one of your least favorite accessories
prone to getting stolen ruining your
bike's aesthetic getting forgotten at
home and breaking easily menses simplify
life by keeping you safe they usually
just get in the way turn now meet
lumineer it doesn't look like a bike
life because you can't find the bike
light luminaire is a holistic solution
to all of your aesthetic convenience and
safety issues it's the bike light that
no one will notice until it matters here
at a near L we believe that the role of
design and engineering is to make a
product as obviously useful as it is
obviously beautiful we've hadded
prototypes and tested to create
something that is unobtrusive and honest
down to the last detail
lumineer is milled out of a single piece
of aluminium to create a unibody
structure to hold all the complicated
circuitry inside it
this means no ugly wires or switches to
tamper with the clean lines of your bike
the lumineer is available in black and
chrome and can also be customized to
match the paint coat for your bike hi
Kickstarter's I'm on your element it is
really near you've designed this to be
really simple to use because we believe
a good product doesn't require a menu in
terms of any bike and simply replaces
your bike set to switch the light on you
simply push the LED itself to change the
mode you just press it again in great
posture and give you a steady beam
depending on your environment and
whether you need the luminaire to get
someone's attention
I designed the luminaire I've tried in
frustrated and it's like having a really
nice bike and struggling too unlikely to
a school as my bike I spend too much
money on a bike and ruin it with
accessories that on the performance
function and inform nothing like there
existed a and I really don't understand
why this obviously Pro product is why I
decided to take it to Kickstarter and I
know you love to this is the first
product launching under the name annual
and coat but this isn't my first
generation a lot of you have been
following my work since the
revolutionary cranium a pro helmet and I
hope that the new veneer captures your
imagination as cranium things you need
your help to bring this product to life
and take it through tooling and
production my overly followers we have a
special two hundred pieces just for you
this special customizations you can have
your name engraved and you can also
choose the color of your stem to match
your bike you can find out more about
this on the campaign page right below
anyway thanks for checking out a
luminaire stay tuned to the campaign and
share it on your tightly
hey Kickstarter's we have the developers
of the dirac the bike rack produced by
perixx to give your bike safe home for
those days when Batman is busy one and a
half years ago free do a meet founded
the company perixx to produce a designer
bike rack for practical and elegant
indoor bike storage when designing the
dirac we focus on all important aspects
of a premium bike rack the body of the
dirac is made of high-quality durable
aluminum it is cut using advanced CNC
machining technique afterwards it is
energized to fit the color of your bike
the D rec comes in different lengths
adjusted to your bikes handlebar size
in order to give
nice and smack home we shield the edges
using an extra robust anti-skid silicon
strip it's 3d molded shape matches the
wreck perfectly the optional front panel
enhances the appearance of your dreg
it's made of precious olive or
eco-friendly Cuban wood we designed a
separate warm line to securely attach
the direct to the wall
being closed in
plaintiff mounting template helps you to
adjust your rec to the angle of your
bike stopped you simply measure the
angle of your top tube attach the
drilling template in the same angle to
the wall and position the other
components
even the packaging comes 100% plastic
free and the optional leather strap
prevents your wall from getting dirty
we finished our design and development
process and met all our suppliers to
guarantee that they meet our high
quality standards we spent our last
coins to manufacture the tooling for
production and put the direkt to the
asset test with your help we can bring
the director life hi I'm Philip and I
created Lego as a passionate cyclist I
always look for great components to
upgrade my bike and two years ago I was
searching for wooden handlebar but the
only thing I could find was another
sandwich construction or just a solid
piece of wood which didn't feel safe at
all and at that time I came up with the
idea to create my own
wanted to create a handlebar which just
connects the beauty of a finished wooden
surface with the purist affixed gear at
that time I started to talk to a lot of
people a lot of people with woodworking
backgrounds I even talked to a guy with
a boat builder just to get an idea of
what's possible and what's not possible
I started scribbling and in 3d I came up
with two final designs both strong and
durable and but still was a continuous
wooden grain yeah and after a lot of
research I teamed up with a woodworker
and together we make the handlebars
reality maker is a very basic very clean
very minimalistic wooden handle bar
which is made out of high quality walnut
wood it has an aluminum core to make it
safe and durable and it's manufactured
here in Berlin Germany and now after
developing and refining the
manufacturing process I can proudly
presented two final handmade versions I
really hope you guys liked them as much
as I do and join me on this journey this
is max max bought himself a new road
bike because he likes to go road cycling
with his friends his friends also like
to do cyclocross rides
unfortunately Max's bike with its slim
tires isn't made for off-road cycling it
is also impossible to add a bike rack to
his road bike so when he does a bike
trip with his friends he's having a hard
time that's why max went back to the
bike shop and asked for advice
hi I'm Stefan the founder of a bar bikes
a bar is a small bicycle brand from
Berlin Germany we are doing customised
bicycles since 2011
when Max came back to the shop and told
me his issues I explained him the
differences between a road and a
cyclocross bike first they have a
different tire clearance for the front
and for the rear wheel and second
different heads and see to bangles
so the question was how can we develop a
frame set that can be used for a road
and the cycle press back that's why we
developed the eight parameter a bike
that can easily change its attributes
from a road to a cyclocross bike max
want to give it a try you can use it as
a road bike and change it to a
cyclocross bike within 15 minutes change
the four by changing the fork the front
of the bike is also rising up which
gives the rider a more upright position
and shadow ahead and C cube angles swap
the tires
move the slider dropouts to the rear end
which gives you more tire clearance and
changes the wheelbase at the same time
that's it now Max is ready for having
fun with his friends off the road
last but not least the a parameter can
be your perfect adventure bike because
it's got rack and fender mount now max
can enjoy the ride and doesn't need to
carry a heavy bag anymore</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
