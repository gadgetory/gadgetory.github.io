hi i'm ryan and i'm elias we are part of
the team behind sonic soak sonic soak is
a smartphone sized device that uses
ultrasound technology to clean almost
anything in ways never before possible
it claims to the microscopic level
beyond what any laundry machine or
cleaning spray can do the inspiration
for this device came from the fact that
we were frequent travelers and cleaning
our clothes while on the go was always a
hassle so we had to set out to find a
good solution
it's also quiet and can be used to clean
more than clothes it can clean glasses
jewelry fruits razors baby bottles the
products that are tough to clean using
sponges or rags or your hands or soap
and water I think they get the idea is
okay I just want to be clear this is the
best way to clean
pretty much anything sonic soak works by
generating ultrasonic sound waves that
create microscopic high pressure bubbles
to wash away dirt grime and oils we had
no idea at the time that we come up with
was a device that had so many benefits
outside of travellers wanting an easy
way to wash clothes while on the go it's
also simple to use you simply place it
in water add some soap turn on the
built-in timer and walk away minutes
later your clothes are cleaner than ever
before
sonic soak is designed for travelers
moms neat freaks looking for a thorough
cleanse and not just unclosed by the way
but on fruits and vegetables to folks
with small loads of laundry fashionistas
that eat a better solution for their
gentle cycle or hand wash only clothes
folks that don't have the space for a
full sized laundry machine really it's
for anyone who wants a cleaner will
almost anything because sonic soak is
more than a great way to clean your
laundry it can clean just about anything
you can stick in the water with it so if
you like things clean free from all
those nasty things you can only see up
close sonic soak is your solution

hi we have come a very long way since
the iguana fresh shoes was released five
years ago we have sold thousands of
pairs all around the world and today I'm
proud to present you our new amazing
product the iguana jungle most of us
live in cities we spend most of our time
and enclosed concrete cubes or in metal
boxes our bodies are wrapped under
layers of clothes the part of our body
that suffers the most
are our feet all day long they are
literally locked up in tight shoes
there's nothing like the feeling of
finally taking your shoes off and let
your feet breathe at the end of the day
when summer comes and temperatures get
high we can't wait to get our shoes off
the dream is walking barefoot on the
beach
and ideally anywhere but on rough ground
our feet need to be protected flip-flops
and other type of sandals have a design
that haven't evolved for centuries they
are inefficient and old-fashioned let's
change that introducing the iguana
jungle like the iguana fresh shoes the
jungle is inspired by the Amazonian
Indians that used to dip their feet
directly into natural latex to create a
second skin thereby protecting their
feet with our new concept the ultra
minimal piece of technical rubber will
only wrap around your big toe and your
heel by doing so it secures a thick and
soft ergonomic sole they assemble
together like a 3d puzzle and guess what
it holds
the feeling is amazing it is literally
as if carpet was set in front of your
feet at all times the Iguana jungle lets
you walk as if you were barefoot on any
type of grounds put them on and walk
like never before
all the iguana products are a hundred
percent made in Portugal there are two
types of soul available the first type
the luxury one is made of cork and
leather leather is ultra soft for your
feet and cork absorb sweat the second
type is made of EVA foam a flexible foam
that is ultra light and
waterproof</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
