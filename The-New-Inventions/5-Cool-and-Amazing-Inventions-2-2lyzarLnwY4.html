I'm excited to introduce you one of the
most innovative products in the world of
water sports in a long time the big
speed jet
the Bixby jet is a mini water propulsion
device designed to attach to virtually
anything you want to motorized in water
attach it to your kayak can attach to
your stand-up paddleboard and if that
wasn't enough we've developed a
submersible battery pack that you can
attach to your big speech yet and at
about five pounds you know of the
world's first and only portable diver
propulsion vehicle this is going to
change the way we interact with our
water sports
the possibilities are endless you can
mobilize virtually anything the big
speech it can push a kayak up to about
seven miles an hour you can go a lot
further you can fight fight win you can
explore places that you weren't able to
before
we've built in dozens of features to
make this a truly versatile and modulate
product most importantly we wanted to
make sure you can use your existing
watercraft there is no need for you to
purchase a new kayak or new stand-up
paddleboard
we've spent the past 18 months working
on this amazing product we've sourced
all the parts we've tested them in every
body of water you can imagine we've been
to 11 major iterations of the big speech
yet and at every turn you've improved it
you've made it better we've made it more
efficient and now it's ready for you
with your support we can produce 500
units which is the minimum we need to
make the big fees affordable support our
Kickstarter campaign and help us bring
this amazing product to life thank you

we've entered the age of personal
manufacturing but when it comes to
making durable things in your own shop
there's still no easy way to cut hard
materials as makers and engineers we
need to work with all materials so we've
built a machine that could the first
desktop waterjet laser works by
combining abrasive particles with the
high-pressure water stream the mixture
exits the nozzle and cuts through the
workpiece it's great for any workshop it
cuts every material it's compact and
contains and it's digital so you can
make precise cuts that are impossible to
make any other way
as an industrial designer I've used a
variety of desktop application too but
they tend to be very limited by the
durability of the materials you can use
on those machines with a desktop
waterjet we can go from design to
component to fitting that component and
testing within couple of hours that's an
incredibly powerful tool as a jeweler
and an artist with the work I make I
spend a lot of time hand cutting so
right now I'm selling pieces sort of as
almost limited edition because I can't
physically out with them not because I
want to be making in a limited edition
waser would allow me to not only make a
lot more but also to lower the price
point so they'd be available to a
broader audience I think you know people
tend to have their ideas constrained by
their tools and the things they're
capable of working with and having a
water jet cutter which has the ability
to cut a broader range of materials hard
materials like steel and glass will be
enabling and make them think in
different ways and have them build
different things they couldn't build
before the future of manufacturing is in
custom local fabrication people will be
able to make things in our own workshop
that they can use every single day and
will last a lifetime we've created a
unique desktop tool and we're really
looking forward to all the amazing
things that people create with it
hi I'm dr. diva to me and this is Lucy
the flagship member of our Salonika
family say hi Lucy at Salonika we
believe that if the sun is shining we
should never have to turn the lights on
daylighting is the illumination of
indoor spaces with natural light and we
want to invite you to join the day
lighting revolution Lucy lights up your
home or office with sunshine the first
ever of her kind she is solar powered
portable and Italian designed this is
how Lucy works place Lucy in a sunny
spot indoors or outdoors point her
towards the area you want to illuminate
and turn her on Lucy will do the rest
she will find and track the Sun for you
and redirect that sunlight back inside
turn off the lights and turn on Lucy
Lucy is also earth-conscious powered by
solar cells she never needs to be
plugged in and think of how much you can
save by turning off the lights for half
of your day last but not least lucy has
been built to be beautiful
italian-designed through and through
Lucy will never look out of place in
your home or office besides the magic of
daylighting made simple what else makes
Lucy special in one word sunshine Wow
whoa this is an entirely different room
right now I completely change the actual
house itself I can read you can actually
see the color of that wall which she
couldn't do before in contact with
nature because it's the plight of the
song Lucy is no longer just an idea born
from the dark corners of my office at
Cambridge our engineering team has
already gone through multiple designs of
Lucy and we have a fully working
prototype the one that you see in this
video
we have also started testing Lucy in the
field with our Barrett answer community
and solana cos head of manufacturing is
already hard at work with a top three
masts manufacturer to bring Lucy to
market that's why we've come to indy
gogo we're so excited about bringing
Lucy and all the benefits of the
sunshine she provides in indoor spaces
everywhere we really hope that you will
love lucy as much as we do and want to
join the day lighting revolution you can
