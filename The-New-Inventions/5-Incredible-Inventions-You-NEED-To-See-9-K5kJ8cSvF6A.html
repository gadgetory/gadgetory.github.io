control all of life's daily devices
with 06 your sense of touch allows you
to keep your eyes free all you need to
do is listen email one email from David
Wilson it says hi I attached the design
sketches this is short notice but the
meeting location has changed to 990 to
harrow street can you make it action one
reply yes no 15 minutes late message
sent action one reply action to navigate
to 990 to harrow street
use 06 to browse and listen to apps
while on the go tweet from San Francisco
Giants it says fun fact every starter
has Homer this week tweet from headline
news it says scientists to launch micro
spacecraft at twenty percent is 06 can
be used at home or the office with
gestures to control any mobile
application
and with an open API available to
developers you'll soon discover entirely
new ways to use 06

ghetto sex and free your eyes this is
the Eco cube air the Eco to bear is a
desktop hydroponics greenhouse designed
to improve your quality of life it adds
healthy air smart light therapy thriving
greenery and beauty to any space most
houseplants don't thrive indoors the Eco
cube air is the best solution for indoor
gardening because it provides the
perfect environment for plants to grow
the plants thrive by absorbing only as
much nutrients and water as they need
with ebon flow hydroponic technology and
uses ninety percent less water the
beautiful integrated LED lighting system
provides the perfect spectrum of colors
to support optimal plant health the
covered greenhouse maintains humidity
and warmth for abundant greenery we use
a NASA inspired plant medium to maximize
root growth without Messi soil and a
drain spout for easy water change to
integrated fans circulate air and feed
co2 to the plants enhancing thigma
morphogenesis for super healthy stems
and improved air quality the air you
breathe may be filled with mold
chemicals and dangerous toxins our air
flow system utilizes a three-step
filtration process first the air enters
through a HEPA like mechanical filter
that removes dust pollen and mold next
the activated carbon filter removes
harmful chemicals finally the plant
filters and oxygenates the air before
being circulated back into your room it
also includes a humidifier the smart LED
light also simulates the cycle of the
Sun sunlight dictates your circadian
rhythm which tells you when to sleep and
went to be awake with increased exposure
to computer tablet and phone screens
today our circadian rhythms have been
completely thrown off you can use the
eco cube air to influence your own
biological clock with the phone app this
helps you wake up feeling refreshed
alleviates insomnia improves
productivity helps overcome jet lag and
helps prevent seasonal depression the
ego cube air combines form with function
the cost of individual products adds up
in money space and time 1e cuckoo bear
solves all these needs at a fraction of
the cost
adis mission is to improve people's
lives by designing the most beautiful
low-maintenance desktop ecosystems ever
back this project now and get yours
today at a discount share with friends
and family this is the future a living
space that works for you let's bring
nature back into our lives and blur the
lines between outdoors and indoors Eco
cube air transform your living space
mechanical keyboards have taken over the
gaming scene we've experienced some
amazing innovations the amount of RGB
lighting options you have right now are
beyond imagination it really brings
gaming to the next level so let's talk
about real innovation I'm calder from
looting and we created the wooden one a
analog and Kenneth keyboard that can see
exactly how far down you press the key
for analog input this opens up an entire
new input dimension for PC games for
example in racing games this means you
can exactly control your steering wheel
problem you can see from the wheel that
you can make small increments make those
fine adjustments turn drifts and control
your photo for those tedious turns the
key tapping days are forever behind us
racing on the keyboard just got a whole
lot better available
and further first-person games you have
full movement roll over your character
control your own walking pace in game
swiftly dodge particles lineup that
perfect sniper shot you have full
control another cool thing is you can
buy multiple key combinations on a
single keystroke we used it to create a
whole new type of quick casting it will
show your calcium use during press now
and activate on bottom out but that's
not all it can do it can type just like
any mechanical keyboard duty one future
to flex which mon there are two switches
there's a linear red switch
and the quickie blue switch it's an
optical switch they can easily swap out
for another with the provider cooler you
can take out the switch and you can take
out the key cap and while you're at it
why don't you just take off that top
plate too during the design process we
wanted to break that critical gaming
stereotype that's why I went for a low
profile minimal design with floating key
caps it is a nice like carrying and is
easy to bring to those lab parties
there's a freeway cable better and the
detachable micro USB cable but this is
just the beginning of animal keyboards
we want to bring it to the next level
that's why we're going to make it fully
available for developers to create their
own applications with new graphical
possibilities this is the ghetto duo an
instrument for making electronic music
together
it doesn't matter how old you are
already know how to plan your choice I
duo can be played by anyone from as for
the designers we have a passion for
making things that are simple and
beautiful we are also about parents and
big fences in size we believe
synthesizers are too much fun to be left
to grown-ups alone but existing
synthesizers are either too complicated
or too precious to be used by kids we
wanted to create a way for anyone to
make electronic music so we put the
things we liked most about our
synthesizers into one instrument and
because we think jamming together is
better than making music alone we
decided to make the duo for two we
started prototyping the data duo from
day one mocking up design ideas and
testing them in the wild we wanted to
make it really easy to get started well
at the same time giving lots of
possibilities for exploring different
sounds
this is the circular sequencer you play
melodies into it using a Spence tonic
key at the same time the player on the
other side controls the synthesizer you
can change the sound by tweaking the
oscillators the filter and by adding
effects in percussion we carefully pick
the parameters so that you can't do
anything wrong even if you tried we
designed the dado duo to play nice list
of a cure to the laws being helped out
to external effects and can use NFC soon
signal to and from other ships in
computers as you can see we're all
having lots of fun German with our
prototypes now we like to share the joy
of making electronic music with you help
us bring the data due out to life by
backing this project and let's jam
together
what if you could see the world around
you in a microscopic scale blips is the
world's thinnest set of microscope
objective lenses that will turn your
smartphone into a digital microscope
when in use a tiny objective lens
electrostatically adheres to your
smartphone camera enhancing its optical
power and allowing a perfect distinction
of microscopic details two lenses for
two different purposes are offered blitz
macro provides an optical magnification
of about 10 times for high-definition
macro images of the most diverse
subjects blips macro is also usable as a
high power magnification lens for
quality checks blips micro is perfect to
observe the tiniest of details and
represents a first step into the realm
of microscopy it can distinguish details
of a few microns and allows to capture
images of cells and inhabitants of the
micro world
blitz is extremely thin and light the
world's thinnest set of microscope
lenses for smartphones and tablets super
compatible with any model of smartphone
and tablet ultra portable can easily fit
in your pocket or wallet very affordable
for all budgets blitz offers two main
kits the basic kit which includes one
micro and one macro lens to enjoy both
microscopic observation and macro
pictures the lab kit for a more precise
observation of the micro world with an
adjustable mechanical support to
stabilize the working distance a proper
light source and a set of selected
microscope slides</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
