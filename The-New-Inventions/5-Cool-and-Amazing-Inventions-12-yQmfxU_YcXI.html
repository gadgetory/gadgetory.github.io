sounds newest and most innovative idea
yet but first i want to show you who
this is for
we're gonna have to stop there because
we couldn't possibly show you all of the
people that would benefit from the HTTP
what did all those people have in common
well they were all exposed to
potentially damaging noises over the
years exposure to these damaging noises
can lead to hearing loss and it has for
one out of three people over the age of
65 but the time to protect your ears
happens long before that age you may be
thinking there are already items to help
protect your ears well I'm not here to
show you earplugs introducing the h2p by
Pro sounds this is no ear plug the h2p
is the result of over 50 years of
experience combined with a sleek design
comfortable fit and the latest
technology in hearing protection and
enhancement that's right it also
enhances hearing it's pretty much like
something you might see a really smart
british guy give to a secret agent in a
movie this new technology uses a
computer no bigger than a tiny grain of
rice to convert sounds into digital code
the h2p can process over 1 million
sounds per second shape sound response
over five thousand different ways block
damaging levels of noise while enhancing
soft and moderate sounds and this allows
you to hear life's greatest sounds at
work home or recreationally in full
digital stereo without risking permanent
hearing damage I've worn earplugs for
years just roll up put them in or stuff
am in my ear but as soon as I put those
in I can't hear anything I'm dead to the
world I find myself yelling to to
whoever's around me and when I don't
need to be yelling
and the noise cancelling on these https
you know it's just it's right there it's
instantaneous it's amazing how fast they
are HTTPS are very comfortable I mean
they're super easy to put in but the
thing I like the most about them is you
can wear them all day long without any
discomfort you know I I've had hearing
protection in the past that after an
hour I'm done my ears are hurting but
these I've worn them all day and I
couldn't tell any difference so I almost
couldn't tell they were in I felt so
comfortable a normal healthy here offers
the most advanced sound system on the
planet the arrival of sound waves causes
the stay peas to lightly tap on an oval
window on the cochlea which causes a
fluid to push past 35,000 to 45,000 hair
like nerve endings called cilia this
process sends signals to the brain that
are then interpreted as specific sound
healthy silly are returned to their
upright resting position after
interacting with a sound but hearing
damage from loud sounds over time
illness or other problems will cause the
cilia to bend over and fail to come back
up in the event of real damage they'll
actually break off leaving very little
nerves left to stimulate by backing this
IndieGoGo campaign you will be part of
bringing this innovative technology to
the market and help us make affordable
hearing enhancement available to
everyone back our IndieGoGo now to
receive exclusive discounts and receive
this groundbreaking new device before we
release it to the general public your
journey to better hearing begins now
hey Kickstarter I'm Tom and this is dan
almost six years ago we launched the
glyph a tripod mount for the iphone 4 on
Kickstarter the glyph is a tool that
unlocks the full potential of your
smartphone as a camera after numerous
iterations and customer feedback over
the last six years we feel we've
designed the best version yet to do that
we focused on three areas number one an
innovative quick release mechanism grant
tripod mounts in the market today fall
into two categories the slow and
cumbersome yet secure screw style or the
quick but insecure spring style we
wanted to create a mount that is the
best of both the quick-release lever
when open allows the jaws to move freely
making it easy to quickly load or remove
any device with or without a case here's
the clever bit when you close the lever
it automatically Titans and locks around
your device resulting in a super secure
connection
number two the ability to mount in
portrait or landscape the glyph has a
side mounted tripod thread which allows
devices to be mounted directly in
portrait orientation this is useful for
panoramic photos periscope snapchat but
whatever the kids are using these days
number three extensibility we want you
to consider the glyph the starting point
of your mobile photography rig as such
the glyph has a total of three mouths
these allow you to add additional
components like a microphone or a light
and speaking of additional components
along with the glyph we are launching a
couple of our own a handgrip and a wrist
strap not every situation calls for
mounting on a stationary tripod the hand
grip and wrist strap provide a
comfortable and secure handheld Sena
even just combining the wrist strap with
the glyph is a handy way to add a bit of
comfort and security when shooting with
your smartphone the hand grip is made
from solid cherry wood and the wrist
strap is made of durable paracord and
leather everything is tough robust and
built to last we hope you'll join us on
our campaign to create the best tripod
mount pepper the bulk of our funding
goal goes towards the considerable
upfront investment needed for injection
moulding we've received quotes where our
manufacturers here in the US and if this
campaign is a success they're ready to
start production we can't do this
without your help so please hit the big
green button to become a backer and help
bring this into reality thanks for
watching and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
