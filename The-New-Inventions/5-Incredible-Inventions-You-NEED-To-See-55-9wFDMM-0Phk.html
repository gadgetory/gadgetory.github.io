with great mother nature and staying
connected with family and friends I love
sharing my adventures but I've realized
that it's really hard to get access to
electricity to stay connected outdoors
the thing is today's mobile devices use
significantly less power than
traditional consumer electronics so one
day I came up with the idea what if we
could convert every energy resource into
personal power I want to introduce you
to E string it's a portable water
powered generator it converts any type
of running water into stored energy you
can get personal on-demand power with
nothing but water energy this is how it
works remove the cover unfold the
turbines and lock them
hook and release East reem into running
water let it spin freely to generate
electricity and it charges the built-in
battery it takes approximately 4.5 hours
to fully charge one East stream which
can charge up to three smartphones
GoPros or tablet PCs two times faster
than charging through an outlet
you can also use it as a lantern with
four different modes even underwater
east stream works well even in wheat
current or behind a kayak and regardless
of the weather or time of day it fits
perfectly into any size backpack it's
ideal for use while you enjoy camping
fishing kayaking biking or any other
outdoor activities

elf Emmett is an active non-invasive
wearable technology that helps us face
the challenges of our stressful lives
even when you're chronically stressed
elf Emmett will help you return to a
balanced State
with so many things going on it's hard
to keep a clear and focused mind so you
can effectively learn elf Emmett will
help you focus and concentrate when you
need to
most people have struggled with
sleepless nights all the stress of the
day just keeps you from resting elf
Emmett will calm you down and rock you
into a deep sleep elf Emmett works in
synergy with the natural rhythm of your
mind and body waves when you're active
and focused your brain frequency is high
when you're resting it slows down
however because of our busy lifestyle
our brain waves aren't always in tune
with what we need elf Emmett uses pulsed
electromagnetic technology to
non-invasively synchronize your mind
with the frequency of what you want to
do learn and concentrate while feeling
stressed
improve the quality of your sleep stay
awake when feeling tired
relax after a hard day we designed the
technology around a beautiful light
headband that is powered by your
smartphone or tablet and operated with a
simple application people have always
used extremely low frequencies to
achieve altered states of consciousness
just think of meditating to the rhythmic
sound of drums Gong therapy or the
steady flashing light of a fire things
that take us into a state of
thoughtfulness
even when the sound of train
different rhythms in music
they all have an effect on us we always
adapt to an external frequency our
entire biological system the brain and
the earth itself work at the same
frequencies mr. Nikola Tesla once said
that if we can influence those
frequencies electronically we can
directly stimulate the entire body and
mental system of humankind elf Emmet
uses the same power source as your
headphones to generate a weak
electromagnetic pulse between two coils
to demonstrate we can connect the coils
to a speaker and actually hear the
frequency that the application transmits
its music you can't hear the cerebellum
is the part of our brains that links the
brain in the heart depending on our
situation it suggests our performance
rhythm this is the spot that says slow
down there's no danger relax or it says
hurry up we have work to do concentrate
elf Emmet works directly on the
cerebellum and can influence the whole
system it tells both the brainwaves and
heartbeat to speed up or slow down</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
