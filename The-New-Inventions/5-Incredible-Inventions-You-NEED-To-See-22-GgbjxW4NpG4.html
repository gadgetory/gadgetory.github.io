this is Jeff and this is his exercise
routine he works re to build up his
cardio and muscle he also wants to lose
weight but it takes energy and time to
burn away the pounds Jeff would stay in
the gym and continue to fight for weight
loss results but he needs to get to work
imagine if you could take your weight
loss regime home with you to burn
calories long after you've left the gym
now there is a revolutionary technology
that allows you to do just that
introducing the thin ice vest a slick
wearable embedded with cooling
technology that forces your body to burn
extra calories when I first got this
idea I had this impulsive realization
that this could be a game-changer in the
weight loss industry the 1.0 thin ice
vest is ready for the mass market and is
an amazing product that has already
started to help people burn calories as
they lounge around the house but we are
crowdfunding to raise the capital needed
to fund the 2.0 version of thin ice
which is sleeker allowing it to be worn
right under your clothing imagine being
able to take your calorie burning with
you anywhere you go the 2.0 thin ice
fest is comfortable and lightweight and
will help you shed pounds even as you
sleep the vest can even wait until you
are in deep sleep before activating so
the technology won't make you cold it
will just make you thinner the thin ice
fest is also discreet enough to be worn
under regular clothing so you can use it
anytime day or night go to bed wake up
leaner how does the thin ice fest help
produce calorie burning using cold
temperatures the body responds by
revving up and burning fat to keep your
blood warm the process is called cold
temperature thermogenesis
that's really an ingenious solution
anything that I could just wear
day-to-day that would help me lose
weight would be an absolute there are
certain people out there that we all
love to hate and these are the people
who can eat whatever they'd like to and
not gain any weight and what this
product is actually able to do is give
you those characteristics by speeding up
your metabolism I'm a gamer so having a
cheat code is something I'm all about
another innovative part of the thin ice
system is the Bluetooth connected mobile
app it allows you to adjust the
temperature of the technology to your
comfort levels you can also track the
calories you're burning second-by-second
and if you want to take things to the
next level

coolest way to lose weight the world is
getting smaller and more of us are
traveling to distant and remote places
when we travel one of our biggest
challenges is how to guarantee but the
water we are drinking is safe
there are currently dozens of personal
water filters and filter bottles on the
market that claim to solve this issue
the problem is that water filters only
trap bacteria insists but then remain in
the filter and continue to live and
multiply this can add up to a major
health concern in addition water filters
do not eliminate or even trap waterborne
viruses that are really the biggest
concern of all to be truly protected
from bacteria and viruses water must be
purified not just filter
meet here to go the most advanced unique
and multifunctional true water purifier
in the world I'm here to go kills
bacteria and viruses instantly on
contact and on demand while also
completely eliminating waterborne cysts
such as crypto and Giardia
there is absolutely no waiting time or
preparation required as contaminated
water passes through period ago it is
purified instantly without the holding
time or procedures other true water
purifiers require here to go can be used
by one person or multiple users with
cleanable and replaceable insert
cartridges it can be used over and over
again for many years and more

periods without the same danger posed by

Science and Industry and premium bottled
drinking water to customers throughout
the world an industry innovator we
developed a proprietary water

bacteria and viruses on contact and on
demand so why is this different peer to
Go's insert cartridges provide three
tiers of filtration and purification

minute contaminated water undergoes
three separate filtration and
purification steps ensuring the water is
completely safe to drink with no danger
from any pathogens including viruses the
period ago comes in two convenient
packages first appear to go travelers

takes up minimal space in any suitcase
or backpack inside comes a 27 ounce
collapsible water bottle that screws
directly into the pier to go
the second package option is the pr2
gokit like the travelers kit it includes
a collapsible water bottle and a

by now we all have smartphones which
means we all stare at our phones
excessively whenever we need to call
text or just check the mail we do so
because we can't really know where to
put our fingertips without prior looking
at the screen tap it solves that by
adding a layer of buttons on top of the
screen as part of the cover case door
the buttons guide your fingers which
quickly learn the typography of the
keypad this allows you to locate where
you need to click without having to look
first at the touch screen let's say you
want to call a friend tap its main
screen allows you to do that by just
tapping a few letters of the name of
course whenever I need to I can always
just open the case cover and access the
screen we designed the case door to
cling on to either side of the case so
it never gets in your way
but how does it all work simple actually
the buttons embedded in the cover door
are completely transparent so as the
door closes the companion software
launches drawing
graphics under each button and whenever
you press a button your finger touch is
intercepted by the touchscreen below
under the cover tap its companion app
the tappet launcher is responsible for
putting the software buttons under the
physical ones and provide the telephony
interface but that's not all tap it can
do have you ever wondered why we still
prefer plain old TV remote controls over
software ones I mean
who likes to stare at their phones while
zapping channels and that's our little
revolution plan we want to allow
application developers to extend their
reach by leveraging tappets keypad using
a free and open API testing what is 85th
models we are now ready to take into
production but what is so unique about
that we take so many times to integrate
physical keyboards into smartphones
these were all electronic units using
heavy redundant or just took how it has
been space and that's what that is
different tablets keep it is like it
were strapped and allows us to try the
dynamic that fair experience without
getting in the way of the everyday usage
of the phone we decided to concentrate a
recent segment on Android phones to date
Samsung Galaxy S five six and seven and
make a working prototype of course once
we succeed with Samsung flagship phones
we do prepare to support more models but
in order to bring our first moment of
production we need your help so if you
like idea please become a baker and
share it with your friends instantly
