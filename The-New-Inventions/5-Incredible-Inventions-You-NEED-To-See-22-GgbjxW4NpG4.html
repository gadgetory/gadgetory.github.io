getting smaller and more of us are
traveling to distant and remote places
when we travel one of our biggest
challenges is how to guarantee but the
water we are drinking is safe there are
currently dozens of personal water
filters &amp;amp; filter bottles on the market
that claim to solve this issue the
problem is that water filters only trap
bacteria insists that then remain in the
filter and continue to live and multiply
this can add up to a major health
concern in addition water filters do not
eliminate or even trap water borne
viruses that are really the biggest
concern of all to be truly protected
from bacteria and viruses water must be
purified not just filter meat pure to go
the most advanced unique and
multifunctional true water purifier in
the world computer go kills bacteria and
viruses instantly on contact and on
demand while also completely eliminating
waterborne cysts such as crypto and
Giardia there is absolutely no waiting
time or preparation required as
contaminated water passes through peer
to go it is purified instantly without
the holding time or procedures other
true water purifiers require here to go
can be used by one person or multiple
users
with cleanable and replaceable insert
cartridges it can be used over and over
again for many years and more
importantly it can be stored for long
periods without the same danger posed by
filters how do we come up with this
design over nearly half a century water
one has provided ultra-pure water to
science and industry and premium bottle
drinking water to customers throughout
the world an industry innovator we
developed a proprietary water
purification mediafire robach that kills
bacteria and viruses on contact and on
demand so why is this different here to
goes insert cartridges provide three
tiers of filtration and purification
with a flow rate of up to 16 ounces per
minute contaminated water undergoes
three separate filtration and
purification steps ensuring the water is
completely safe to drink with no danger
from any pathogens including viruses the
pier to go comes in too convenient
packages first appear to go travelers
kit it fits in a small travel pouch that
takes up minimal space in any suitcase
or backpack inside comes a 27 ounce
collapsible water bottle that screws
directly into the pier to go the second
package option is the pier to go kit

collapsible water bottle and a purifying
filter but also a lot more the go kit

producer of water purifiers yet but we
are confident that with appear to go we
have made the most advanced unique and
multifunctional true water purifier in
the world we invite you to join us on
our business journey to bring pure to go
to global markets and to continue our
research development and independent
testing
whether it is the pier to go travelers
kit or a multi-functional pure to go kit
puter go is the only personal water
purifier you will ever need thank you
and safe travel by now we all have
smartphones which means we all stare at
our phones excessively whenever we need
to call text or just check the mail we
do so because we can't really know where
to put our fingertips without prior
looking at the screen tap it solves that
by adding a layer of buttons on top of
the screen as part of the cover case
door the buttons guide your fingers
which quickly learn the topography of
the keypad this allows you to locate
where you need to click without having
to look first at the touchscreen let's
say you want to call a friend tap its
main screen allows you to do that by
just tapping a few letters of the name
of course whenever I need to I can
always just open the case cover and
access the screen we designed the case
door to cling onto either side of the
case so it never gets in your way but
how does it all work simple actually the
buttons embedded in the cupboard or are
completely transparent so as the door
closes the companion software launches
drawing graphics under each button and
whenever you press a button your finger
touch is intercepted by the touch screen
below under the cover tap its companion
app the tappet launcher is responsible
for putting the software buttons under
the physical ones and provide the
telephony interface but that's not all
tap it can do have you ever wondered why
we still prefer plain old TV remote
controls over software ones i mean who
likes to stare at their phones while
zapping channels and that's our little
revolution plan we want to allow
application developers to extend their
reach by leveraging tap its keypad using
a free and open API
second is the product of two years of
research and after developing and
testing more than eighty fifth models we
are now ready to take you to production
but what is so unique about that we did
there were many times to integrate
physical keyboards in the smartest but
these were all electronic you you should
heavy redundant or just took half of it
does green space and that's what up it
is different tablets keep it is like it
were strapped and allows us to provide a
dynamic that fair experience without it
getting in the way of the everyday usage
of the phone we decided to concentrate a
recent cell phone android phones to date
samsung galaxy s five six and seven and
make a working prototype of course once
we succeed with samsung flagship phones
we do prepare to support more models but
in order to bring our first mother to
production we need your help so if you
like idea please become a baker and
share it with your friends instantly
