after finishing the design I took it to
my favorite skate spot I just made this
new board was ready to go it's just me
and it was it was perfect
I felt like I was on top of the world
waiting to drop in 121 city boards is a
lot more than just a skateboard company
it's a prototype to solve an
industry-wide problem that a global
problem of carbon fiber waste disposal
we'd really like to thank those people
that supported us with the first
Kickstarter last summer which allowed us
to go a lot further a lot quicker than
we thought during the production of the
aileron we noticed that we were still
generating a small amount of scrap and
so we decided to put that material to
good use that's when I knew we had it
this was this was the board we were
about to start making I really began to
see that we wanted to engineer the word
that was totally different it's a
time-consuming process we start with one
iteration go back change it again we
wanted to make it sleek and stark kind
of had it looking like a missile it's
got a sharp angular features that make
you think of an aggressive aircraft but
there's a lot of purpose behind that
engineering we knew we had to put a hole
in the board because we wanted people to
be able to lock it up we wanted to have
a shape that we laid
maybe it's weird you as an aerospace
product we ended up sweeping that whole
back and giving it a slight curve on one
side and a hard angle on the other
turning into more of an aerodynamic
shape
it all starts with processing we get the
shipments of scraps of material and we
cut it to length and width then kit it
load it into the press and then take it
out so the waterjet cutter
each board that we make it's water jet
cut to incredible tolerance within five
thousandths of an inch an eighty
thousand psi stream of water to blast
the material out of the way what you're
left with
cool skateboard
to the press to the tracks
engineered every aspect of the board to
keep
really focused on stability the Rovers
really the stable is small board on the
market the carbon-fiber composites you
kid allowed us to make even smaller we
have an even tighter wheel that gives
you that great handler was very member
this board represents the passion and
innovation of one party once it's light
and smooth it's unlike any other board
it's far higher quality material than
you can get in any consumer product when
we finally finished our board
it's like emerging from a cave I felt
like I was on top of the world
it's a whole new way of approaching
state for those of us that love the art
of engineering
this is the board for us
there are over a hundred wineries in
Melbourne New Zealand here is a region
renowned for the crafting of world-class
7l done amidst these funds there is a
remaining cherry orchard on which they
began their craft all this up officially
founded in early 2013 the paper in
project specialises in organic Fairtrade
artists apparel custom skateboarder and
long boards made from recycled wine
barrels aiming for high quality created
products that were sustainable as
possible we'll throw and indigo green
law said about creating a unique style
of wine barrel ball partnering with
organic biodynamic winemakers at Saracen
estate the paper in project use
wine-soaked aged oak barrels in a
lengthy process to create a longboard
with a beautiful body and a great ride
we love doing what we do even though
sometimes it means that we work from
getting up until going to bed or all
through the weekends and don't have much
of a social life often written as a
struggle but this is our passion and we
can imagine doing anything else
we're so passionate about making
high-quality creative and sustainable
products a way of life or just a part of
everyone's life so far we've sold about
100 long boards to wine makers long
boards are collectors and it's the whole
range of people throughout New Zealand
Australia Germany the States Switzerland
Sweden and France
we're finally happy with our product
development and need a bit of help to
get it off the ground
we've been living and working at our
parents property and we really need to
put a roof over our business we have
to work with blocks and Emmeline Bailey
sneaky studios Mina still it's in the
Laura Alice I'm a range of some
established and some emerging artists
for our apparel and skateboards yeah
it's really inspiring seen a cover
canvas for a whole range of styles we
would be stoked to have your help with
our project people who pledged to our
cause will be given ten crafted
Fairtrade organic products and most
immediate in house or help made by the
people that we work with it's treated
and the lower website so if you love
seeing a recycled handcrafted high
quality product cruising down the street
or you're interested in getting involved
in our project it's really appreciate</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
