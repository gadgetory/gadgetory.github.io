this is Scout it helps moms and dads
stay active and venture out with the
little ones it makes getting to the
trail for the park or even the beach
finally easy hi I'm Mike and I'm Meegan
and right here are three very active two
days we love getting outside together
this guy here was a key ingredient in
the early years for what was missing
until now ask out a stroller carrier for
your car one of our favorite things to
do as a family is getting outdoors and
enjoying nature when they were in
diapers we would load up our jogging
stroller water bottle snacks and all the
rest and head to the trail but it took a
lot of effort even with an SUV so Mike
set out to fix this problem to make this
easier for us and now for all young
families I took some time but after lots
of tinkering in the garage I ended up
with a few workable concepts they
weren't pretty two by fours and plywood
but they did the job and after lots of
great feedback we decided to take the
plunge mike is an engineer but we knew
we need a professional design help I
wanted Scout to be simple and attractive
not beefy or utilitarian like most bike
racks I wanted Scout to be an elegant
addition to a vehicle scouts design is
compact in elegant the custom profile
aluminum extrusions prevent it from
feeling utilitarian and give it a
distinctive and attractive aesthetic
it'll look great as a permanent fixture
on your vehicle but because it's all
aluminum if you want to take it on and
off it's super light and easy we
designed Scout to provide an effortless
experience for moms and dads scouts
design is minimal and unobtrusive and
easy to manage with a few easy steps
you'll be on your way and ready to enjoy
the outdoors with your family and that
was our key goal throughout the design
process the unique loading experience
means you never have to lift your heavy
stroller again we weld it all together
for a solid one-piece feel and we add
soft yet durable touch points for those
little
helping hands we love Scout because it
makes the process of enjoying the
outdoors of the families so much easier
Scout is ready for production but we
want to make a sizable order from the
factory to keep costs low for everyone
with your help we can begin shipping in
only a few months we're so excited to
bring skepta parents with little
explorers everywhere hope you'll join us
my name is allen i am the founder and
creator of way it's originally a
physicist so now I'm a full-time product
designer weights are smart
high-precision miniature wireless
sweating devices that have been designed
to weigh anything in the home last year
when I was armed I wanted to weigh my
luggage but I couldn't find any scale
that was capable of weighing a large bag
so I looked around the house and I found
that my parents had a kitchen scale and
off the scale even a bathroom scale but
they didn't have anything that could
just wait suitcase could weigh anything
so we decided to create a device that
could weigh anything in the home and
that's when we came up with the idea of
where
because it outputs to a smart device
that allows us to basically create
applications for our users that makes
their life a lot easier we can actually
weigh nutrient content of food rather
than just the food itself which is a lot
more accurate than normal dieting the
idea behind the way it's a very
innovative part of this is that it
doesn't have any surface so you can use
any of your platform in the house is
awaiting platform so for example you how
you want to wait a suitcase your
suitcase could just become the weigh-in
platform quite often when you're trying
to weigh a baby or you're trying to
weigh at pet it's because that pet needs
care and is stressed or is ill so the
best thing about ways you can use the
wherever they're happiest how's the
weighing scale so you can use the dog's
bed you can even weigh them where
they're sleeping or you can wait a baby
while it's asleep and its crib with
weights you can wait in real time so no
longer do you have to pack your bag
close it pick it back up and put it back
down you can remove and add items as you
see fit this is so small that it fits in
your pocket so you can just kind of put
in your pocket when you're traveling or
your you just go into restaurant 21 you
know have food you can just pick it up
put it on the plate on the table and
then weigh the food and stuff so I think
that's the whole idea how well it fits
one of the big benefits of ways that
we've designed to have a very very high
very high precision and have a high
resolution across a wide range of
weights so you can use way it's in the
kitchen 28 grams or spoons of
ingredients originally when we designed
this way it was just like travel scale
or a kitchen scale but but the number of
people approached us with various things
like weighing bees and pets and rabbits
and weighing scrap metal and I think
that those are the things which we never
thought about weighing is an age-old
problem and we found a really modern
smart solution for it
