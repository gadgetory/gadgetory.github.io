ridge rest and z lite or iconic
mattresses seen on backpackers climbers
and through hikers around the world
these original therm-a-rest designs have
earned eight awards for major outdoor
publications including a backpacker
magazine editors Choice Award and two
guides choice awards from the American
Alpine Institute therm arrest clothes
sell mattresses are lightweight and
durable making them ideal for rugged
activities like mountaineering and
through hiking they're also economical
and a great choice for value different
campers and backpackers low cell foam is
durable and long-lasting
the warmth and comfort provided by a
closed cell mattress is not affected by
tears or punctures the foam will not
absorb water damage mattresses can
usually be repaired with industrial tape
therm arrest clothes sell mattresses are
the most popular and widely available
clothes sell mattresses the company is
also responsible for significant leaps
in closed cell technology in 1986
therm-a-rest engineers created and
patented the thermoformed design for the
ridge rest mattress the thermoforming
process allows foam to be shaped to
provide greater warmth and comfort than
standard flat foam therm arrest clothes
sell mattresses are made with a special
blend of foam developed specifically for
mattresses therm-a-rest engineers worse
to produce the foam that is softer
lighter and more durable than standard
deviation 2010 therm arrest became the
first manufacturer to apply reflective
barriers to clothe mattresses this
patent-pending technology increases the
r-value or warmth
a mattress by reflecting the body heat
and improving heat trapping ability
therm-a-rest laboratory results show
that reflective barriers can increase
warmth by up to 15 percent these tests
also show that positioning the mattress
with a reflective barrier facing up
offers the greatest warmth therm arrest
clothes sell mattresses come in two
basic designs the ridge rest and the Zee
light both use Peaks that provide
support and valleys that trap warm air
redressed mattresses offer excellent
warmth while see light mattresses are

offered power with over eight billion
mobile sources world which is more than
the number of people we wanted to
develop a high-performance Lantern and
charger that could help people connect
communicate and have access to light

spending Golden Colorado here's today to
walk through the instructions of how to
setup our Morrison's do backpacking fins
the great two persons two poles two
vestibule designs that we really focus
on the ease of the setup and the quality
of the construction walk through with us
the first thing you're gonna want to do
is lay out your tent body on the ground
and work you've done so and access the
content of your stuff back which
includes ten take ten ply and told keep
7075 aluminum pimpled our Stegman could
in shock we're together you'll notice
the dispense hold are color-coded 115
silver one set being anodized gold or
two then take you to the poles of lay it
across the payment an x-ray pattern
following the corresponding color of the
cliffs gold on gold silver on silver and
they will proceed with taking out the
corners of the center very importantly
drive we've staked into the ground at a
45 degree angle facing away from the
tent it'll ensure that you get a nice
tight pitch with a snake firmly planted
in the ground and a nice tight pitch to
the pin we can now insert the pole into
the color-coded grommet on the corner
following the pole along the arch a 60
clips as you go once you reach the top
of the tent
you've got two 5hj hooks they come
across for opposing sides and make sure
is that you have a really nice tight
pitch next we're going to attach the
five in a tent you'll see through the
webbing attachment from the corner of
the fly correspond with a cut
webbing attachments on the bottom of the
tent to still again making it very very
easy to decide which orientation the
flies picked on top of the fence you've
got a front and rear guy out point to
the vestibule pulling it as far away
from the center as I can and again at
that magic 45-degree angle driving that
cake down to the ground
the next place you don't want to utilize
one of the tent stakes is going to be on
these guidelines on the side of the tent
you simply insert your stake into the
bottom of the three millimeter
reflective cord pull it a couple feet
away from the tent body and drive that
stake down into the ground and they come
up here to these tension locks that can
be fooled backwards to loosen and pull
down to tighten to get a nice high pitch
in the side of your tent and finally
your tents equipped with then on either
side of the slide these will allow for
greater ventilation inside to an
reigning human condition we can increase
the airflow inside to say and help
reduce any sort of condensation that
might happen in there during your night

easy to set up great two persons to fall
backpacking tent for your next adventure
thanks a lot for watching the sewer many
in the most versatile personal
filtration system available it's a
perfect solution for backpacking hiking
hunting fishing scouting international
travel and emergency preparedness Adam
near two ounces the mini fits in the
palm of your hand and can filter up to a
hundred thousand gallons of water from
any freshwater lake river or streams the
foyer mini has a 0.1 micron absolute
pore size it's tested to 10 million
parts of bacteria and a million parts of
protozoa without a single breakthrough
this is the highest level filters can be
tested to so we're confident these are
the highest rates of filtration
available the Sawyer mini room harmful
bacteria and protozoa
and Cryptosporidium but it won't remove
chemicals and viruses however viruses
are rarely found in the water in North
America and in foreign cities the mini
Cadiz the following ways
attach it to a spoiler squeeze pouch and
drink directly from the filter or spent
into a water bottle use it as a personal
drinking straw to drink directly from
the source or scoop up a bottle of water
and drink instantly the mini screws
directly on the most standard water
bottle which is great for suspect water
overseas use an inline on a hydration
pack this allows you to feel your
hydration pack directly from the source
and filter water as you're drinking
through the bite valve so your filters
are so robust they can be back washed
with high pressures and reused over and
over again
cleaning the sawyer mini is really
simple you just take the included
cleaning plunger and fill it up with
some filtered water then take the mini
and insert the tip of the plunger into
the end of the filter opposite of the
flow arrow and then forcibly push the
water back through the mini you repeat
this process a couple times until the
water comes clear and easy and you have
a clean filter</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
