prism design be discreet intelligent and
easy to use who made a video to show you
a clear is right fit for every
you
today to make a professional film we
need lighting cameras and sound
equipment that would make us think it's
impossible to do at home but what is
actually holding us back the cell phone
cameras that we have keep getting better
what's the problem the microphones stay
exactly the same to solve this problem
we've created the solo cap an HD
microphone that connects to your phone
via bluetooth bill to match the quality
of sound to the quality of video the
solo cam can not only connect to a cell
phone but also to a camera or GoPro the
180 degree pan is possible as a result
of an advanced axle and lets you film
without shaking the camera and getting a
much more stable image we also have a
natural hold handle to allow you to
Staveley support the camera or cell
phone to film for long periods of time
finally we have a smart app with a
karaoke station teleprompter filters and
much more with these options you can
customize the solo camp to film wherever
and however you want if you're a
journalist move faster to catch your
story and stream it live if you're an
aspiring artist or karaoke lover record
your song and directly upload the video
to share your creation with the world
and if you're taking videos of your
family you can catch voices and sounds
without interference we have a great
team of designers and engineers who have
been working for months to make sure
that the microphone provides top sound
quality that the handle is comfortable
and that the stick can stay please
support the phone or camera for as long
as you want to film we need a microphone
that is as useful flexible and versatile
as the cell phone and we believe the
solo cam is that solution

hi guys my name is holes and i'm the
creator walls walls is a baller I
concert now let me show you what it can
do 19 months ago I lost my first
Kickstarter campaign showing my hobby
project to the world from the minute I
pressed the launch button I was blown
away by the immense support and as a
result my hobby turned into a full-time
adventure ever since and thanks to the
back of feedback I work very very hard
improving walls and now i'm proud to
introduce my second edition which I
called walls Copenhagen one box contains
800 tiles endless design possibilities
and lots and lots of fun with easy to
work with plates heightened foam density
and by cooperating with a world leading
company perfecting the adhesive it has
never been easier to make food wallet
you start by choosing your favorite
design at the constantly growing online
design library and download the template
on your computer tablet or smartphone
and then you simply place the tiles
according to the easy to follow template
Walter Copenhagen is not only about eye
catching on it is also about team
building having fun and spending
creative time together it's about making
your personal art story besides being
reusable they improved the adhesive make
the time stick on all wall types does
not damage the wall and leave no residue
you
and now it's time to show some of the
functional design ideas perhaps your own
clock design as a nameplate for doors as
statements or even as a pinboard walls
has undergone a total makeover and now
my biggest dream is to realize the plans
of combining the digital world with
artwork including an app for checking
how I designed the look on your wall
before setting it up
online design tools for creating own the
science and uploading pictures turning
them into wall designs and finally an
online community for inspiring sharing
the science and pictures sharing and
much more with the diversity and endless
design possibilities I truly believe
Walter comb hanging is fit for every
home in office in the world you guys
