additional lights with cable and
connections attached simply hang a
satellite where extra light is needed
and plug the connector into the back of
gravity light
the second light plugs into the top of
the first one to provide ambient
lighting these satellites are ideal for
reading or writing
imagine if you didn't have to get your
phone out for every little thing what if
there was a simpler way to interact with
your devices flick is a wireless button
that connects to your iOS or Android
device so instead of going through your
phone you simply press the button that's
better I use the flick app to set it up
and then I can stick flick wherever I
want
I can even share this flick with my
roommate so he can use it when I'm not
around
the flick isn't just for your house
you can stick your flicks anywhere like
in your car or on your bike
that's great
it's really cool
your destination is on the left
and you can clip your flag it's great
for any situation where you need a quick
and discreet shortcut like now oh I'm so
sorry I have to take this but flight can
be so much more than just a shortcut to
your phone it could be integrated with
lots of different services beyond your
devices check this one out
take the old cabbie when I get home I
want everything to just take care of
itself
Shh movie starting
another great feature of flick is that
it can be used as a safety device with
just a push of a button you can send
live updates of your location or even a
distress signal to your family and
friends first me and the Flik team you
guys ready 1 2 3

items using a smartphone since that time

technology today we're proud to announce
tracker Bravo the simplest way to track
all your items tracker Bravo is a coin
size device that easily attaches to a
purse slips inside a wallet

far away you are from your items and
with the tap of your finger you can ring
the device and find the lost item in
seconds and it works both ways

button on the device and cause your
phone to ring

goes missing the app notifies our crowd
GPS Network to search for your lost item

tracker users phones you will receive a
GPS update of where your item was last
seen tracker Bravo your search is over
I am Marco I study at the School of Fine
Arts and ideally multimedia interaction
design when I develop my project I often
do it at night the room in which I work
gets cold very easily so I used to turn
on an electric stove
however if consume a lot so I decided to
design legal the igloo is composed by a
base and a metal grill on which lies a
double terracotta chamber the base
offers a place to locate the candles but
once you light them on will warm the
tiny near chamber up this cover stores a
lot of heat spread to the external
chamber the air intake of the world
facilitates the emission of the warm air
gathered between the chambers allowing
the thermal exchange with the
environment the first phase of
production of igloo is the hand making
that combines the study of the form and
the knowledge of Italian terracotta
craftsmanship to obtain the final form
for the production the matrix was
designed using 3d printing fusing
tradition and innovation from the matrix
was made a plaster mold for the
large-scale production of igloo designed
for everyone
natural colored and glazed igloo is a
simple use device you need just to
locate four candles on the base and the
grill on which the two chambers must be
placed candles will last for about five
hours enough for heating a 20 square
meters room with only 10 cents
increasing the room temperature by 2 or
3 degrees you can also heat your cup
pressed your hands like the secret on
Drive the animal heater dresses perfume
the room
cook the meat not the last one
actually I was joking in conclusion
they're friends of IndieGoGo
I need your help to begin the production
of new glue and to make real this
project thanks to you all and password
you
