the census it conveys emotion health
stories and helps us navigate our world
while we can only see what is directly
in front of us we can hear everything
from all around all of the time when was
the last time your headphones made you
feel like you were actually there not
just identifying the sound but feeling
transported that's the sound we want to
live in I'd like to introduce you to the
Asik ex Asik ex headphones combine
advanced 3d audio algorithms with head
tracking and individual Anatomy
calibration to create incredibly
realistic 3d sound headphones haven't
changed a lot in the past 65 years the
mission in Asik is to take the final
leap from reproduced audio to something
that's indistinguishable from reality
our founding team has a passion for
audio we have a combined 50 years of
experience designing some of the
top-selling gaming headphones and
speakers on the market our mission is to
change the way people hear sound oh my
god it's so it's so different it's like
in real life sound comes from everywhere
and the way you hear the world is unique
only to you it's based on your position
in space the size of your head even the
shape of your ears but with traditional
and even surround sound headphones these
elements are not taken into account in
effect you are removed from the sound
equation this makes for an incredibly
small audio experience where sounds can
only come from a few places instead of
anywhere the Asik ex is the world's
first headphone that instantly
calibrates to the listener creating the
ultimate 3d listening experience you can
be on a train and have the same
experience you had hearing the concert
from the best seats in the house we can
now transport you to the highest end
theater that has a full array of
speakers so you feel like you were at
the movies when you put them on hi my
name is ty ahmad Taylor I'm the CEO of
thx for the first time in my life I was
able to actually experience
sound outside of being the center of my
head and in a natural sound field that
expanded about several feet in front and
behind and above me it was really
revolutionary in virtual reality is all
about immersion
it's about transporting you to another
world Asik X will allow you to
accurately hear the sounds anywhere in
the full sphere and it's going to be
crucial in virtual reality to help
direct your attention and create an
incredibly immersive experience that
ties in with the visuals to create the
ultimate presence how is it so real yeah
all the audio effects ended up messing
perfectly with what I was seeing on all
seek is really bringing a whole new
element here because if you have three
16 immersive sound it's a more powerful
feeling of being there it's intelligent
sound asik X is gonna change the way we
game we bring a whole new level of
accuracy to hearing sounds anywhere in
space not just around us but we also
have the ability to unlock the sounds
above us and below us you get the
feeling that you've been teleported into
the game from a visual standpoint when
you're playing the game it gets really
intense and so having like accurate
audio cues to go with it can be just as
important being able to know where
someone is behind a wall or close
someone is if they're about to turn a
corner but you can't put a price on that
like and you know it cost you a game so
after listening to the awesome
headphones it seems like they've given
me an accurate representation with 3d
audio that I've never had before
communication is important in gaming the
asik X headphones use a 3d microphone
array with beamforming
to give you the same noise rejection you
would get with a boom but unlike a boom
ensure that your voice level is always
consistent the key to creating an
accurate and realistic sound experience
is knowing the listeners individual
auditory Anatomy and how it influences
the way we hear sound this is called an
HR TF or head related transfer function
in order to create this instant
calibration we've incorporated sensors
into the headphone and we take the
information from the sensors and feed it
into the software and we have an
adaptive algorithm that customizes the
playback for the individual wearing the
headphones additionally we have multiple
drivers within the headphone that can
beam the sound
the ear and so we can have the sound
naturally interact with the ear the way
it normally would by taking the
intelligence of the adaptive algorithm
and the physical hardware that's
interacting with you able to create a
personal experience that you need to use
the headphones feature a uniform
headband design and high quality
lightweight aluminum construction it's
unbreakable
they have been designed for durability
acoustic quality and comfort for
prolonged periods of use they conform
perfectly to the user's anatomy
featuring soft over the ear pads and a
revolutionary micro adjust air time it's
taken our team numerous prototypes and
years of research to package components
necessary for accurate 3d audio into a
high fidelity and durable headphone with
the design ready we've secured
manufacturing partners who are
experienced in production of high
quality audio products now we are
excited to get 3d audio into your hands
we know that there's a huge gap between
what's currently available for 3d sound
and what's possible that's why we
started Asik we're going to bring this
technology to life we want to put it in
the hands of content creators gamers VR
enthusiasts audio files together we can
shape the future of audio the journey of
music starts here with the artist it's
captured with intention and great craft
mixed and mastered for countless hours
and all of this is distributed directly
to
an enormous amount of energy goes into
making the music that we love and we
live in an age where all of this is
streamed to a negatives
so at Nura we ask the question how do
you make a pair of headphones that
preserve all of that detail how do you
make headphones that are perfect for you
introducing Nura the world's first
headphones to automatically learn how
you hear and adapt the music to provide
your perfect sound we all hear
differently but unless your headphones
take this into account
you aren't hearing the full spectrum of
your musical noah learns and delivers
what your ears need so you hear every
note exactly as the artist intended all
the details felt thin but it didn't feel
overly hyped or harsh it just felt right
it literally just becomes the clearest
sound like you're swimming underwater
and then you come out of water
exactly Nura is self learning the first
time you put neuron it plays a range of
tones as the sound waves enter your ear
they trigger a chain reaction that
simultaneously sends electrical impulses
off to your brain that also sends a
sound wave back out of your ear encoded
in this returning sound wave is your
unique hearing signature our proprietary
technology measures this information and
creates your hearing profile and all
this happens in under a minute
Nura can create and store multiple
profiles but once Nora knows you it
recognizes you instantly Amy welcome
back I've never seen anything like this
here in the audiology world they'd kill
for this that these days like the
clearest and best advice and just the
difference between the generic and then
calibrators me is just phenomenal Noah
is unlike any headphone you've ever won
it's over ear cut plays deep bass
through your skin while its inner
fluid-filled earbud maintains
crystal-clear vocals and times you don't
have to sacrifice the sound or the beat
and we measured countless years to make
sure you get the most comfortable fit
Nura preserves the integrity of your
music even in noisy environments it's
hybrid design provides enhanced passive
noise isolation without distorting the
music and Neuros isolation goes both
ways even at high volumes it's insulated
design prevents your music from
disturbing those around you music has
the power to unite and it has brought
together a team of experts in
engineering acoustics and hearing
science we haven't spent the last four
months in Shenzhen China the world
capital of electronics working with
manufacturers and industry experts we
now have working prototypes ready for
manufacturing and need your support to
begin production the journey of music
doesn't end at a smartphone or a pair of
headphones it ends with you the listener
to let Norah find your perfect sound
there's a revolution happening right now
you can hear it it's the difference
between listening to music being inside
the music between watching a movie being
in the movie playing the game and living
the game it's a revolution that is
taking over the world and it's all
taking place inside your headphones
it's called 3d audio and now everyone
can experience it with waves and eggs
here are waves audio we've come up with
a way for you to enjoy 3d sound using
any pair of headphones waves NX is an
application than you install on your
computer or mobile device and together
with the NX head tracker you will turn
any pair of headphones into a 3d audio
experience NX models human anatomy and
uses psycho acoustic algorithms to
recreate the experience for how we hear
sounds from the real world
NX takes 3d audio one step further by
tracking your head movement using the NX
head tracker wherever you move right
left up down forward and back NX will
track your precise position and adjust
the sound accordingly waves NX will also
let you hear true 5.1 and 7.1 surround
sound on your regular stereo headphones
no matter where you are you can watch
all your favourite films as if you were
sitting in the middle of the movie
theater
the waves NX application and head
tracker are available exclusively on
Kickstarter for $79 making it the most
affordable high quality 3d audio
solution how much you know about NX I
want to tell you a little more about who
we are since the early 90s waves audio
processors have been used in recordings
and live shows from almost every major
musical artist in almost every motion
picture television and popular video
games our algorithms are used to improve
the sound of laptops cell phones
televisions and voice communication
enhancing all your media experiences
waves is also one of the few companies
to receive the technical Grammy Award
for the lifetime achievement in sound
you can imagine what that means to a
company fully musicians and sound
engineers we love what we do
and we're constantly looking for new
ways to innovate and push the boundaries
of the audio experience in January 2016
waves release the first product in the
NX family called the NX virtual mix room
a software tool that enables audio
engineers to use headphones and hear
their recordings and mixes with
real-world dimension just as they would
in the sweet spot of a great sounding
professional studio
annex virtual mix room was received by
professional audio experts as one of the
most revolutionary products in the
history of pro audio now we need your
help spring annex to the rest of the
world the 3d audio revolution is already
upon us and we want to partner with you
to allow anyone with a pair of
headphones to enjoy the magic of 3d
audio your pledges will allow us to
expand our development and turn an X
from professional software that only
sound engineers can use to an
application that everyone can use with
every device every operating system in
every set of headphones
funds raised through Kickstarter will be
used to integrate NX into virtual
reality and augmented reality devices
that are going to heighten our senses
and change the way we hear the world the
way we feel the world and ultimately how
we experience we invite you to join the
3d audio revolution and help us reach
our goal of making the world a better
place to listen to I used to work for
major record company music lover like me
live in the city we always use the
headphones headphones gives you a good
sound mobility and silence but sometimes
I couldn't stand it
headphones are painful they've been on
for more than an hour uncomfortable and
sweaty I thought why not to design a
headphone and solve these problems this
is vision these shares 3d molded open
air frame design allows you to interact
with your environment while you're
listening to your audio this is the
first pain-free bluetooth headphone it
doesn't press on your ears which can
cause discomfort instead the 3d
geometric frame sits around your ear
with minimal body contact this allows
air flow and makes them comfortable to
wear for long periods of time B shares
core audio technology comes from Yamaha
smock five module one of Yamahas most
advanced codecs and enables us to
provide superior sound quality our
headphones have an onboard 3-band
equalizer that works with all your music
apps and allows you to customize the
sound to your own personal taste
it's important that you and only you can
hear the sound of your headphones the
share is designed with directional flat
speakers that produce amazing sound
quality and yet focus the sound directly
to your ears to keep what you're
listening to private the airframe keeps
you in touch with the sounds around you
so you notice when other people approach
or want to talk with you and without
removing your headphones or adjusting
your audio you can carry on a normal
conversation when you want to be
undisturbed the Viera headphones have an
interchangeable closed frame as well for
when you want to concentrate or when
you're in a loud environment each
headset is able to broadcast or receive
from other headsets so you can use V
share to share your audio with your
friends without disturbing others around
you we hope you can find places where V
share fits your lifestyle
this is what I designed be here
we built a great brand honor
speakers and active lifestyle and so we
found that what made sense with that
funds but we could have designed this
another headphone what we do is we have
to figure out a way to make it different
that was the biggest challenge in the
project which was actually figuring out
a way to create this hybrid all you know
which is what makes I had was different
and the hybrid audio really embraces our
core values of being able to be aware of
your surroundings and listen to music
well I've always had with headphones is
that they eliminate a key component to
your human sensory over the past two
years we worked on solutions help
augment your hearing and give you
control of the world around you
the micros are in your model they're
designed for athletes to need a snug fit
and better hearing in their surroundings
the MIDI is our on-ear model that gives
users versatility comfort and pure noise
isolation the masters are over ear
studio quality headphone featuring a
flat sound profile for the most
demanding audiophile</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
