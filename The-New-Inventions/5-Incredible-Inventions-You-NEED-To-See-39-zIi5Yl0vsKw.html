want high-quality recordings but still
be able to be present in the dive and
not fumble with filters and buttons so
we set out to make the world's best
action camera for diving octo spot is
the first camera that is able to log
your dive it's also the first to
automatically correct the white balance
to match your depth in records and high
quality and is intuitive to use it has a
long battery life even in cold water
we've designed everything to be operated
while using gloves and it can be mounted
fast and easy the octo spot is made for
divers you feel when it starts recording
and sharing your videos is easy all you
have to do is enjoy the dive
with the T rail click mount you can
mount a demount in a matter of seconds
it's rock solid there's also an adapter
mount so you can use other accessories
you may already have with a third-person
viewer you can put yourself in the shot
a great learning tool for all new divers
the ergonomic mask mount that's almost
any mask and records everything you see
the third-person viewer is the first of
its kind it's so compact it fits in a
pocket on your BC and can give you a
whole new perspective on your dive the
octo spot knows exactly how deep down
you are and make sure your recordings
and pictures are not tainted green or
blue it's the first camera in the world
that can automatically correct the white
balance to match the depth you're at it
also has electronic image stabilization
this removes shakes and creates a steady
and smooth video to avoid endless
gigabytes of data and make sharing easy
we invented snap record press ones to
take a picture and hold to record easy
big up connect to the octo spot by Wi-Fi
or Bluetooth and immediately view your
videos pictures or snaps depth
temperature and time can be displayed in
the video the clips are ready to share
or you can choose to edit

having a tough time keeping up with us
outside from batteries that run out
halfway through the day two phones that
can't withstand more than a drop of
water we couldn't believe there wasn't a
way for us to keep the devices we rely
on alive so we came up with a solution
