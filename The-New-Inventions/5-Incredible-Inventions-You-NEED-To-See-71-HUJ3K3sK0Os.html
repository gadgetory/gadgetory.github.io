thing in common a measure because to
measure is to understand and to improve
it's the starting point to human
ingenuity a dimension that drives
progress so enact this precious deserves
respect it deserves accuracy it deserves
the same obsession and love that we stow
upon the things that result from it this
is the progress that measuring deserves
this is dimensioning
hi we are instrument and we are
craftsmen of product team here has built
some really cool products over the years
but today we're launching something
really close to our heart natural
reaction to modernizing measurements
would be to just add technology to a
tape or ruling but we don't have the
same mechanical constraints and we
certainly don't use them in the same way
we can do a heck of a lot better we
build 01 into an elegant writing answer
free to be exact 10 pencil stylus these
are things you likely have in your bag
or purse or pocket we built it for
designers for architects for engineers
or craftsmen makers and even though
simply putting up pictures we want is
you want to be honest it's it's
measuring instrument but also to writing
instrument so that 01 is balanced and
feels natural it's an illusion of
security teams path 17 months sweating
hundreds of small part to their feet
finish building tools fixtures or to
enable an experience we've designed the
01 engineered it tested it instead of
manufacturing we're days away from being
able to ship but what's more we've
hidden a few gems inside you see 01 is a
dynamically evolving instrument this is
where we need your help over the next
few months the team here will be
creating functionality that will enrich
how we think about dimension
if you back us now not only will we ship
01 in pen pencil and stylus form it will
give us fuel to keep releasing features
that redefine how we capture and use
dimensions and bring them right to the
devices we've shipped back us today and
we'll start shipments December first
it's got your name on it everyday
objects of our lives are constantly
evolving phones have become handheld
computers cars are smarter and cleaner
watch as it turned into personal
assistants but what about our shoes we
spend most of our lives wearing them but
besides fashion designs they have seen
little evolution in the last few decades
we bend over to tie them to untie them
they come undone they get stuck in our
bike chain we leave the laces tied all
the time and damage our shoes sure we
have velcro shoes and zippers but you
still have to bend over and they don't
fit nearly as firmly as good old laces
at power lace we wanted to figure out a
way to create shoes that fit firmly and
comfortably without ever having to lace
or unlace them we decided to think
differently and we found a solution we
are proud to introduce the p1
our new Auto lacing system allows for
efficient hands-free issue race time the
first time you wear them slide your foot
in adjust the tension once and you're
set you'll never have to bend over again
to take off the shoes use your other
foot to press down on the back lever
it's that simple it's a nice product
it's a very streamlined it's not bulky a
thin sole lot of companies have big
bulky Souls Kevlar lace on any products
definite advantage been working in the
street for 25 years let's see two pairs
of pillows is broken power lace shoes
will simplify tasks of everyday life
allowing you to take advantage of a snug
shoe fit while on the go
in my 15 years in the footwear industry
I've never seen such innovation they are
comfortable they are very stable too so
I think it's amazing our shoes are made
of the very best materials and combined
proven shoe design with our innovative
technology we have working prototypes
and have met with manufacturers we are
ready to start production
our very first men's shoe the p1 will
soon be available in many different
colors help us make auto lacing shoes a
reality pre-order your pair today and
become a power laser
it cost less to keep my home warm by
including four items rather than warming
it up with a heater heating has always
been regarded as a damp utility some
people may have tennis tat in their home
but after program in advance most forget
about it and never touch it again these
natives realized that thermostat is a
widely unloved product and we decided to
change it
so we tried out different prototypes in
order to come up with the best design
the one is simple elegant and practical
we presented our first prototypes to the
people and transfers a feedback and
direction was wow what is it people find
it really fresh
solution consists of smartphone app for
iOS and Android devices central unit or
bridge entirely 614 it true so how it
works the information about desired
temperature goes from smartphone to
central unit that distributes the signal
to every room equipped with equals a
thermostat you can sap the precise
temperature for every room and e così

need to hit up an empty home whenever
you are on the vacation or on a business
trip so you greatly save on your energy
bill eCos a hidden solution installation
it's so easy that you can do it on your
own the most responsible little it NZ is
egos a thermostat installation approach

terrorist possibly you would need some
additional instruments to do this take
one eco zat Arras head out of your
starter kit and tightly attach it to
your water ID switch it on it should
find the eCos a central unit that should
be previously connected to your Wi-Fi
now said the West temperature present on
the lab set the temperature down and on
the ride to heat it up whilst you
