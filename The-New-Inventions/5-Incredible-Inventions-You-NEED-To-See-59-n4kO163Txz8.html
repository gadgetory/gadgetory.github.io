you
hi my name is Tim Trump with BRG i'm
here to present the Hobby hand and we
made some improvements to mimic the
human hand better so what the Hobby hand
is is not only a hardware but also comes
with a microcontroller where you can
control software also the breadboard on
the back you can actually add
expandability so you can add different
analog sensors like a sound sensor of
bonds over a light sensor and for
instance to control the hot behind any
man you which your desire to it also
comes with a manual controller so if you
just want to play with finger movements
directly you can just slide on this mini
mixer board that we created the
biomechanical robotics group envision
the future where we can provide
affordable 3d printed prosthetic ends
for those who are in need of them and
the point of the hobby hand is not only
to educate but provide a platform for
other users to develop code and in
sensors that may be helpful for this
community in the future so not only are
we working on Harvard design but we're
looking to minimize and maximize the
space of all these different motors so
the idea is that all the functionality
of the hobby hand will be in the hand
itself for example this hand was
actually developed after my own hand and
it actually shares the same size
and Rob dimensions
prg needs to be funded so that we can
provide the next generation of future
engineers scientists tinkerers to start
a base development for not only the
prosthetic markets but everything else
that comes in contact with the emerging
markets
our best technology and Internet of
Things
thank you for backing us we hope you
enjoy the ride ladies and gentlemen

devices it's portable works with Wi-Fi
or ethernet connection and it's super
easy to use all you need to do is turn
it on it can be used on its own or with
our intuitive app which lets you easily
control better spots for the past 5
years our company has provided its VPN
services to millions of people to ensure
safe and secure internet

there's something about working out and
the way it makes you feel almost
everyone when tasked would like to have
more Fitness in their lives but for most
of us it falls to the bottom of our
priority list so we developed the body
of oz to point out we wanted a product
that would empower people to reach their
goals where you'd be able to exercise
more often and consistently we want a
product that is compact something that
could do at all with no restrictions
this equipment is something that anyone
could use no matter their fitness level
a product it takes all these concepts
from the gym combines them into one
solution bring in the gym to you the
platform is strong the poster spaced
evenly apart on both sides so you can
simulate any exercise movement and
quickly adjust difficulty the base is
made wide enough to stand comfortably
during your workout and we even added a
layer of non-slip material to assure you
stay in place the bands were customized
for this concept and can handle any
height
there's even cloth in the bands to
protect you simply clip in to get
started shorten the bands or add bands
to increase difficulty our most popular
exercise is squatting with the bar it's
like a workout bar you would see at the
gym but more portable it can unscrew and
it features grip padding for comfort the
ends of the bar spin a full 360 degrees
and are shaped to avoid the clips from
sliding provided you the most natural
feel possible through all of your
exercise motions adding or dropping
bands easily provides many resistance
levels we added accessories to simulate
even more solutions such as handles that
will add weight adding bands are like
increasing your weight with a dumbbell
the wrist straps are double padded for
comfort and sweat resistant to stay in
place we even added a door anchor so you
can increase the workout the body boss
is lightweight made of high-grade
injection molding and capable of
handling hundreds of pounds of force the
underside has non-slip feet for safe use
on any surface the adjustable posts make
for easy storage starting from day one
you can choose your color green pink you
can choose your package and choose how
you want to follow workouts live
replay program all on your own normally
it costing thousands of dollars to buy
or recreate all of the support but by
back in this Kickstarter today you can
get it for a fraction of that Prince our
hearts and souls have developed the body
boss 2 point 0 and we're making our
first prototypes to be able to produce
the product and make it available we'll
need your support together we can make
this happen make this a part of your
lifestyle share this video with a friend
help us expand practical lifelong
fitness</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
