folding bikes haven't changed in over 30
years they use small wheels and hinged
frames that sacrifice performance and
ride ability in order to achieve a
compact size they are heavy awkward to
use but worst of all they don't actually
fold that small we wanted to create a
folding bike with big wheels a bike that
looks rides and feels like a normal bike
but could still fold small smaller than
any other folding bike it also had to be
lightweight easy to use and
exceptionally safe introducing helix
helix is a revolutionary new folding
bike it has 24-inch wheels but one piece
titanium frame and a patent-pending
locking system that is free of hinges
and clamps helix can go anywhere ride it
to work put it in the trunk of your car
for your next road trip take it on your
next vacation
we set up to design the modern whole
bike
that didn't compromise ride ability for
size using patent-pending helical hinges
we were able to put the wheels beside
the frame and between the crank arms
helix was created using modern computer
aided designs and manufacturing
processes it uses the latest bicycle
technology helix improves on decades-old
folding bike designs in every possible
way it rides better fold smaller and is
safer and easier to use Manufacturing a
folding bike is difficult Manufacturing
a folding bike that pushes the limits of
performance compact Ness and usability
requires a hands-on approach and a high
level of control over the entire process
that's why helix will be made in Canada
we're a group of designers engineers and
manufacturing experts we're also
passionate cyclists our goal is to make
the best folding bike in the world
we will oversee the entire manufacturing
process right here at home we're ready
and excited to go with your help we can
make it happen
we're tagged up a family by company for
the last seven years we've been creating
bikes rollers that are loved and enjoyed
all around the globe this is our latest
project we do not hesitate when we say
this is the next step in the evolution
of family bikes see three years ago we
searched for our next project we turn to
a lot of people and ask them what they
would want in a family bike some answers
were strange you make it fly somewhere
eye-opening young babies should be
facing their parents and some were just
adorable we listened and set out to
create the ultimate family bike for two
years we made sketches prototypes
studied materials carried out
experiments and explored every aspect of
family bikes in half
basically we reinvented the family Mike
this is the toga 2.0 the most
comfortable safe easy to ride practical
and just all-around coolest family bike
you could possibly imagine
the targa 2 has everything our customers
wanted and much more safety first
Tonga has three wheels so it's
inherently stable the cargo box
materials are super strong plastics with
a metal frame inside that makes the
seating area durable and resistant to
impact the child seats themselves have
endless features and options Tonga can
take one or two kids facing forwards
backwards or facing each other or a
boatload of laps to keep it versatile in
seconds taka two turns from a family
bike into a lockable cargo bike with
extra load space on top we use disc
brakes and a Shimano gear and you can
always easily turn it into an electric
light for effortless long distance rides
now for the fun part apart from the wind
in their hair we wanted the kids to have
a truly enjoyable adventure on our bikes
so we added the accessory bar to which
you can attach a variety of fun add-ons
yes there's also a water gun and when it
rains or if the kids just want some
privacy
there's the royal canopy let's see what
else no it can't fly yet but it can all
be taken apart to fit in your car truck
oh and the seeds come in a variety of
colors because you know the personal
touch transforms our own ultimate bike
into your own ultimate fighter last but
certainly not least the price while
creating the target ooh we never forgot
the one thing everyone asked make it
affordable make it affordable careful so
we did because to turn the family bike
trend into a real revolution we had to
make it accessible for everyone whether
you use it for a weekend trip a drop-off
for shopping or to carry your loyal
friends the target 2 is an ideal
solution our company has a proven track
record so this is one of those projects
you can back safe we need your help to
make this piece of family con a reality
so back tugga and help us make the
ultimate family mine
tada
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
