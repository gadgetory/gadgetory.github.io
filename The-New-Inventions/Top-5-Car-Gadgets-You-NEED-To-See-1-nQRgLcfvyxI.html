600 million people who get behind the
wheel of Baker's every single day at 75%
of em used a smartphone while driving
hello kick-started my name is Ivan and
today I'm extremely proud to introduce
Hardwick was it is a simple smartphone
accessory but charge your smartphone
into a head-up display just like any
fighter jet or luxury car we've been
working on improving safety and comfort
of a driver for three years
we started with a navigation app which
transforms our vision how how cell
phones can be used in cars by now over 1
million drivers have tried our and one
customer even told us it saved his life
how do we glass was inspired by rival
racing when you're driving 120 miles per
hour all your passions focus on their
overhead look away even for a second is
extremely dangerous put in a head-up
display in the racecar is one thing but
we realized regular drivers face all the
same distractions and more using their
smartphones while driving we put it to
the test
the two most common distractions are
reading directions of your phone and
checking your speedometer this causes to
drive blind for approximately 300 feet
on every mile on a typical 10-mile trip
we are distracted and driving blind for
over half a mile using Hardware glass
this distraction time is reduced to
nearly zero head-up displays in cars do
exist already but they tend to be very
expensive and usually found only on
luxury vehicles some companies are
developing more affordable devices but
they still cost several hundred dollars
and a stack in the midst of a very long
and complicated development process so
you still cannot buy them today Holloway
we take a simple around let's face it
your smartphone already has everything
you need to project data on a windshield
they can do i display japan internet
sensors the only thing is missing is a
special of your glass to providing high
quality reflection of your screen they
are not rain or shine well the only
thing missing
imagine that you already have had a
display in your park all you need is
just an accessory for your smartphone
imagine all navigation information is in
front of your eyes all the time imagine
music control conference calls or
catching up with your robot friend Siri
there are no limits you can use any app
on any smartphone that supports head-up
display mode now there is no need to
take your hands of the wheel or your
eyes of the road it's a safer and more
comfortable ride what do you think about
that
Wow it's really cool I like it I like
the reflection and it doesn't block your
view of anything it actually gives me
the option to just not have to look down
on my phone every two seconds you know a
lot of high-end luxury cars that have
the capability and if you don't have one
of those kind of cars make you know
thanks great to have gosh I don't know
it must be some kind of fancy glass

cuts for the marked and red cars are an
essential part of our lives we love the
freedom they give us but they are taking
their toll we pump out huge amounts of
carbon spend years of our lives in
traffic and thousands on fuel but most
of us can't just stop driving or buy a
price in your car every time a more
efficient model comes out we need a way
to take any car new or old and get the
most out of it we need go far dhofar is
an intelligent in-car device that
empowers you to drive your current car
smarter cutting your time in traffic
your emissions and your fuel use it
works by utilizing the science behind
your car's engine for every engine speed
there's a sweet spot an optimum throttle
position that maximizes your power and
minimizes your fuel consumption it's
where your car runs best driving in the
sweet spot saves fuel which saves money
and cuts emissions but the sweet spot is
different for every engine and unless
you are part of a Formula One race team
it's very difficult to find not anymore
go far find your car's unique sweet spot
and uses real-time feedback to guide you
there the display glows blue when you're
in a sweet spot and read when you're
wasting energy real-time feedback works
and in trials go far cut fuel use by 13
to 22 percent it's easy to install my 7
year old can do it for an ice-cream once
installed go far just works no need to
fiddle with your phone all you need to
do is get in and drive much safer go far
analyzes your actual driving patterns
telling you exactly when to leave a
house so you spend less time in traffic
your car can't do that in fact it's the
most advanced car computer on the market
if platz you're driving in 3d space and
measures every single Joule of energy in
and out of your car we spend a lot on
our cars and now you know exactly where
it's going to
send it makes tracking expenses a breeze
boyo connects your smartphone to your
car and your car to the cloud to
increase driver safety and convenience
all while you save money and help the
environment okay look boy elf says we
saved a gallon of gas 20 pounds of co2
as you'll see Boyle uses its advanced
capabilities to create new and exciting
driving applications the voya is a small
device that plugs into the diagnostic
port of your car in the US every car
since 1996 has this port usually located
just underneath the dashboard you can
use the voy a p-- to find where to
connect boyo to your car just plug it in
and you're ready to roll in some cars
boil wireless relays can be used for
fuel saving features and to provide
additional security
The Voice app and relays take less than
two minutes to install their
plug-and-play once though yo is
connected you can use the boyo app to
lock and unlock your doors and trunk
there's also an option to use auto key
so that you can automatically lock and
unlock the car as you walk away from or
toward your vehicle Auto trunkload can
be used to automatically pop the trunk
the next time you walk up to the car
boyo monitors a vehicle and sense an
event alert if the car is being driven
and safely if there's an accident or the
car malfunctions alerts are sent via
email or SMS and include information on
the time location and vehicle condition
sooner or later we all face the dreaded
check engine light wouldn't it be nice
to know your car has a problem before
the warning light came on boyo
constantly scans your car for problems
using advanced diagnostic software if a
problem is detected boyo provides you
with more information and reference
codes on the problem unlike other
systems that only talk to a few of your
car's computers The Voice app talks to
almost every computer in your car and
can read codes typically only seen by
your car dealer ever wonder where you
parked your car boyo can help just look
at your phone and boyo points the way
boyo adds an additional layer of
security to your car use the
immobilization feature to prevent the
car from starting unless the phone is in
the car or even to prevent the car from
starting between certain hours Eco start
allows the driver to control the engine
using the foot brake bring the car to a
complete stop make a slight press on the
brake and the engine shuts off slightly
release the brake and the entropy starts
and it all happens while I Drive Boyle
is developing the next generation of
mapping systems called voir aware it
automatically detects hazardous driving
conditions and places an icon on the map
for other drivers to see alerts include
anti-lock brakes hazardous weather and
cars swerving a where car is a free app
for iOS and Android devices that makes
your smartphone contextually aware of
your car all you need is this device
just put it in your glove box and forget
about it
the battery lasts more than the year you
can open apps as you approach drive and
leave the car when you approach your car
a wear car will even show Google Maps on
the lock screen for single swipe launch
if you're in a hurry a wear car can
easily find where you last parts you
don't have to do anything it happens
automatically if you're parked in a
metered spot a wear car automatically
asks you to enter the amount of time
that you paid for plus when you're too
far to walk back to your car before the
time is up we have alerts you
a $10 investment to avoid expensive
parking tickets makes a lot of sense</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
