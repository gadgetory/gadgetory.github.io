introducing Linc square SDK a portable
spectrometer and development camp Linc
square uses visible light to determine
the exact colors of objects and it uses

Square SDK is a link square spectrometer
a user's guide a set of sample color
chips USB charging cable and spectral
data collection software connect link
Square to a Windows PC using Wi-Fi next
place the link square in contact with
the object of interest then press the
button on the side of the spectrometer
link scale will gather data on how the
object responds to light and transforms
the data into a spectrum graph as a
developer you'll be able to use the
graphs you collect to careen
applications for personal use you can
green absolute distinguish between
medications validate the authenticity of
gemstones and much more link square can
be deployed in a wide range of fields
such as research pharmacy education food
and environmental studies

this is Leo two minutes and she's out
but you you've been trying for two hours
I'm sure you've tried every trick in the
book like trying to stop thinking stop
thinking stop thinking stop crap I
thought or trying to relax
oh it's not that these techniques are
useless in fact they're actually pretty
good unfortunately you probably had more
important things to learn at school
this here is history
relaxing fast is his thing just look he
focuses on his breathing and he
progressively slows it down and by
slowing his breathing all the way down
to about six breaths a minute
he stimulates the barrel flicks
physiological mechanism that allows him
to become completely calm in just a few
minutes and when it comes to not
thinking he's pretty good at that too he
can concentrate on his breathing for a
really long time and remain undistracted
by buzzing thoughts but you are not his
room even in bed you struggle to focus
on your breath for more than twenty
seconds at a time
actually your attention span is probably
more like balls than his runs
that's why we've designed dota it helps
you fall asleep by making you almost as
chilled as a shrimp I'll have one of
those
you synchronize your breathing with the
light projected on the ceiling by
focusing on something outside your own
head you'll pay less attention to the
thoughts that are keeping you awake at
the same time just like a metronome dodo
helps slow down your breathing from
eleven to six breaths a minute which
helps to relieve your anxiety and so in
less than eight minutes you'll find
yourself ready to doze off
dodo won't turn you into a Buddhist monk
but it will help you fall asleep faster
and that's probably all you need</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
