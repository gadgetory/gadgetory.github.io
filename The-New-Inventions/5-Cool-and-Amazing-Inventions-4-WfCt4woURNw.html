there's magicians that do
sleight-of-hand that then they call it
magic stop motion is animations it is
Magic have something this is inanimate
lifeless object and then having an
opportunity to get in there and bring it
to life is that is Magic sticky bones is
highly articulated precision poseable
animation puppet you have the
functionality of a skeleton armature
living here the form of puppet as well
it can eat up a lot of time when you're
in that exploration phase of exploring
poses so what sticky bones does sort of
bridges the gap between your ideas to
the computer just focus on what we as
and there's not to do that's just you
know kind of me in great stories as an
animator our job is to breathe life into
characters that were given with sticky
bones I thought wow this is a great way
to explore a pose not just in a flat 2d
plane but I can actually explore it in
3d to pose the character in 3d is a very
time-consuming process or refuse to a
little sketch and with something like
sticky bones you can quickly pose you
the way you want there you had all your
perspective makes the job really easy
being able to hose it out you know maybe
I need to push it more those are sorts
of things that you can like work out
pretty quickly it's going to give you a
different perspective and what you are
doing but sticky bones attack it would
just speed up that planning process to
get me animating that much quicker
ever since Eric pitched the idea I know
I would have been using it throughout my
entire career holding a character that
we get to pose well in our hands kind of
magical I love fabricating and making
the puppets and things like this but I
wish there was a faster way to have the
animation puppet like just already ready
for them to go like right out of the box
I take it out and just start Hannah me
so that's one of the first like seed an
idea happened
I start realizing all the other ways you
could use it besides just animation I
saw as a real tool where you can create
really cool poses to help animators and
artists to other stories faster and
raise Lee
sometimes you just want to play around
you just want something that the first
reaction was like I have one more things
Vicki bones would definitely speed up my
process sticky bones just seemed so
accessible and deceivingly simple with
sticky bones it can help like a people
who aren't too familiar with stop motion
get more into its kind of more intuitive
just so fun to just quickly and easily
put it into fun storytelling emotive
poses sticky bones can change the way
people work we envision a world where
sticky bones could be a part of every
animators toolkit and we're really
excited to make sticky bones a reality
these days children my smartphones
tablets and handheld devices a much more
attractive to them than watching TV an
addiction to the use of the advices is
not a healthy perspect either body or
mind think about this issue we came up
with an idea that there should be a more
positive interactive device for children

our belief that great idea come from
good camera such as good media and this
camera should be adorable cute inovative
and a nurture a child's imagination this
is our agar it looks like an egg but you

preserve a child's innocence agar was
built with all the consideration for the
whole children
such as knowing that children are
naturally sensitive to light so we have
scared projection brightness down to 100
lumens to ensure a child comfort and
safety Ecker also supports a smart
lighting system which automatically
adjust its brightness depending on its
surrounding agar is tailored for
children so it's very easy to operate
with our safe contact charging system
using magnetic pole connector tech
knowledge offer a simple fast and safe
charging operation even while charging
agar remains of cool and cute intuitive
and versatile agar is made for children
