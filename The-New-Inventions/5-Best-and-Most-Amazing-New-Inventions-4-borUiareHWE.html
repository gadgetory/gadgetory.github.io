the world with propotional fairing
it even has working headlights brake
lights and turn signals use your
smartphone to drive this car eat the app
controls including tip to stare and
touch swing includes that lets you drive
with a car like position race your
friends or construct an obstacle purse
to crack through
please support our vision so we can
bring more sophisticated technology to
micro scale models thank you
I know I know
hello IndieGoGo my name's Peter Treadway
and I am CTO and co-founder at Acton
Acton is a company that designs and
manufactures personal transportation we
are introducing a longboard the likes of
which the world has never seen
carbon fiber pressure cast aluminum
extruded aluminum CNC cut we are using
four top motors all wheel drive people
all wheel drive the one that will get
you up
most of the steepest hills in America
and around the world
but wait there's more if you're looking
for something a little more affordable
we've got you we have two more models
what we call the Blake s and the blink
s2 it's a different construction than
the Quattro it's made of wood but it has
an aluminum extrusion along the bottom
and an aluminum plate on top to kind of
sandwich the batteries inside of the
deck so there's actually a hole that
goes clear through it the s2 version of
this board is a little bit longer than
the s and that's because it has the
extra motor and it goes a little faster
and just needs to be a little longer for
more stability
so you get to choose from three boards
you get the cuatro or the blink guess or
the blink s2
now we're releasing three products at
the same time here so of course this is
why we're on IndieGoGo but we have
finished the development on these and we
have of course factory minimums that we
need to meet and that's why we're here
and that's why we need your help help us
out and get yourself onto an active
board and glide uphill into the future
of personal transportation thank you
