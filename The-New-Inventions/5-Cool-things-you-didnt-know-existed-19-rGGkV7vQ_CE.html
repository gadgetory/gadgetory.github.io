soon as you walk in seamlessly streaming
music why a Bluetooth sophisticated yet
simple understated yet elegant well
thats what blog z is all about me plug Z
a tiny device that turns any audio
speaker into a high-resolution bluetooth
speaker bugsy simply plugs into the
audio jack of your favorite music system
and let you stream from any
bluetooth-enabled device plugs e uses
the app ex technology that lets you
stream audio in high resolution with a
long lasting battery life plugs II can
play music for up to 18 hours and lets
you charge via any USB outlets to use
plug z simply hook it up with any
speaker having a 3.5 millimeter audio
jack pair the device with your
smartphone or tablet to bluetooth and
you are good to go
we've spent the past few months
developing plug Z and finally we've
reached a stage where we need your help
to begin mass-production after several
iterations and extensive prototyping we
think we have a device that will blow
your socks off support our campaign and
together let's make plug z a reality
that's plug Z for you a wireless
solution to all your audio needs
do you support the idea of a free and
safe internet without barriers and
censorship shellfire now offers you a
simple and easy solution the shell
firebox hi I'm month and my name is
Florian we are the founders of shell
fire and we believe that secure and free
access to the Internet is a fundamental
right to every single person on this
planet that's why we design our products
to be easy and intuitive and make them
freely available to anyone meet tom tom
is worried he fears that hackers could
steal his passwords many of his favorite
websites are censored or blocked in his
country and he doesn't want governments
to spy on his data tom has now found a
solution shellfire VPN shellfire VPN
encrypts all of TOMS data and sends it
through a secure server thereby
protecting him from hackers and other
spies shellfire VPN overcomes any
censorship tom is now able to use sports
events and episodes of his favorite TV
series that are otherwise not available
in his country over the last year's we
build a worldwide infrastructure with
servers in 20 countries our app secures
your computer and his smartphone with
just a few clicks we already helped more
than 150,000 users secure that data and
overcome censorship Tom wants to protect
all of his devices however most of his
smart devices like TVs or gaming
consoles don't even offer the
possibility to establish a safe VPN
connection that's why many of our users
have asked us for a simple solution to
secure all their devices at once we had
the idea to develop the shell firebox a
tiny little box that securely connects
all of your devices to our VPN network
within a matter of seconds it's that
easy
plug in the power cord connect the shell
fire box to your internet router
wirelessly connect your devices to the
shell fire box to go back to your
regular internet connection simply
switch back to your original Wi-Fi
network the shell fire box comes with an
easy to use web interface it lets you
select a VPN server in the country of
your choice with just a few clicks if
you share our idea of a free internet
support our campaign so that we can
finalize the development of the shell
fire box to protect your privacy online
if you want to further support us share
this campaign on Facebook or Twitter
thank you
we can have people coming home from work
or a long day and throwing on a record
instead of immediately turning on the TV
if we can use sprout to get people
listening to their music more often
we're going to be providing music to
people's lives and that really can have
an impact on daily life
I want to tell you about sprout simple
amplifier that does what you want
nothing more and really brings music
alive in your home once you know sprout
music will never be the same you know I
go to a concert and I love when I'm
hearing and then I come home and I have
maybe that same album on my phone and it
sounds good but it's not the same we
were sitting down having a beer and
Scott looked kind of contemplative and
he said pop is there a way that we could
take what you have in the in the sound
room with those big giant speakers
packaged it into a little box and make
it so that my friends and I could own
something I've takes something like that
home with us and we all looked at each
other and thought hey sounds good go for
it one of the things I found across the
board there's an awful lot of
frustration customers who are buying
what I like to call the big black box
two big knobs on them and nine different
inputs and an LED display I was just
looking at this thinking this can be
done been really just wanted something
that was sort of retro analog and felt
as though it was audio furniture instead
of just hard work will sprout creates
music over headphones
then the question becomes blood so
sprout really only asks two questions
what do you want to listen to and
because of that you designed the two
numbers one for your input selection for
your body it's as simple as that there's
no software there's no apps to download
or anything like that all of our
smartphones all of our iPads all of our
computers are enabled with Bluetooth so
you just turn it on select sprout and
push play on your music and there you
know you're rocking it out sprout was
born in assessing the real goal was
putting it into a package that had the
feature set that fit me that how I
listen to music doing that with sound
quality in a small box at the right
price that's why no one's done it before
that's why it's so hard to get to where
we're it's astonishing you feel like
you're in the venue when you hear a good
system and that's every bit of what we
wanted to bring to the table is from
it's a high-end piece it has you know
the high-end vinyl it has high end DAC
it you can hook it up with USB to your
computer it's a great piece this was
designed by people who understand sound
and who know how to make something sound
like it's live and in the room that's
what's in sprout and that's what's
package there there will never be a
better opportunity to take sprout home
with you than right now
