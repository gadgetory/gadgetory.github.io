high-quality drone footage like this a
professional drone operator a cameraman
expensive equipment or simply this
introducing the sci-fi level one drone a
drone that lets absolutely anyone
capture footage like never before
sci-fi the level up technology is the
real breakthrough by using six rotors
the drone can fly without tilting making
it simple and intuitive enough for
anyone to fly plus you get professional
stable footage without an exposed gimbal
because level up gets rid of the usual
multi rotor while tilting the interface
can be simplified to fly just swipe
swiping is a superior interface that
allows you to see what you're capturing
while flying
unlike tilting or joystick only
navigation our flying interface can be
downloaded as an app on your smartphone
it's simple accurate and fun because
drone flying is better when it's shared
the level one can post shots and video
real-time to your social network of
choice and with the new geofence
technology you can define the area in
which you want to fly your drone will
stay within your boundaries of choice
allowing everyone from beginners to
experts to practice their piloting
skills with confidence so far sci-fi
work has been building drones for
industrial application but we want to
bring our drone inventions to everyone
that can
friendly prices plus we just love robots
so really we put our full technological
expertise into designing a drone for the
consumer that gives professional video
quality and stability but doesn't
require professional knowledge to flight
our drone will come with a 1080p high
quality camera and it will be ready out
of the box for everything from videos to
action filming to home inspection this
is the first drone for absolutely
everyone from the drone company sideline
seemi is different from anything on the
market right now in the sense that it
solves the problem of how you control
the entire flying movie and image
capture process from a single device
what it does is make flying easier by
bringing automation of those systems
inside of the flyer and allows you to
concentrate on where you want the
vehicle to be the images and video you
want to capture and then to be able to
rapidly share it with your friends
Seanie is the first networked camera
drone you control seamlessly from a
single mobile app Cimiez 1080p HD camera
is housed inside of simi
extending down from the flyer at takeoff
and retracting when it lands
seemi is a lightweight compact and
portable drum you can take it anywhere
in a traditional camera bag
see knees legs detach easily for travel
and storage part replacement and for
future component upgrades
seemi has multiple flight modes
including orbit pano follow and manual
control simi can orbit clockwise or
counter clockwise around you in panel
mode simi will remain in a fixed
position while turning and capturing
amazing panoramic shots for follow mode
shots simi includes an attachable water
and sweat proof tracking device this
rugged GPS tracker enables you to put
your mobile device down and focus
completely on your tasks and follow mode
simi will adjust to your position as
well as to increases and decreases in
speed so you don't even have to think
about see me
when flying see me manually you can
select where you want the flyer to go
next
just enter your chosen destination and
see me will takeoff and wait there for
you and your aerial video and photos
will be completely stable because Cimiez
in-house camera unit is controlled on a
unique 2 axis micro gimbal which
automatically adjusts itself at every
turn while in flight simi allows you to
live feed videos straight to your mobile
device then you can instantly upload
your videos and images to any social
media platform with an open API you can
share your video and grow your social
following
before simi touches down at this point
we need your help
in order to get final components
selected and purchased to push us
through the process of testing our
flight software and the entire control
system in order to be able to cut the
mold and get the fuselages built and
shipped the advantages of being our
backers early on you get the flyer below
retail price you're involved in the
development process
as we're putting the vehicles together
and you get to shape the flyer that we
ultimately all can get to go and use out
in the field
what if there was an aerial camera
platform that really could capture your
world from any perspective something
completely different from anything
you've seen before
an aerial platform that was portable
unbelievably rugged powerful and simple
to use one that you could take with you
anywhere without a lot of hassle
introducing sprite the world's most
portable and rugged unmanned aerial
vehicle whether you're an active outdoor
enthusiast or a serious professional who
just needs to get the job done
sprite is as portable rugged and
hardworking as you are
the motors and electronics are all
sealed tightly into the airframe keeping
them safe from dust dirt and water
whether that's happening in the backyard
or the backcountry it even floats but
it's also really easy to use which
sprites powerful autopilot you can
create three-dimensional GPS flight
paths you can change speed hold a
position fly circles a survey patterns
even scan structures or regions of
interest all while keeping the camera
pointed right where you want it sprite
can even follow you to capture that
ultimate perspective or if you like you
can fly sprite with an optional remote
control transmitter the automatic
controller lists flight modes let you
program sprite and leave the
controller's back at Basecamp or at home
the airframe is made up of durable
connecting sections making it super easy
to change batteries or even payloads
on-the-go without tools sprite comes
with a camera mounted on a one axis
stabilized gimbal to take crystal-clear
video and still images in full
high-definition a GoPro module with the
two axis stabilized gimbal is also
available and attaches to sprite in
seconds because sprite is modular you'll
be able to easily add new cameras
sensors network communications hardware
and other accessories as they become
available we spent more than 2 years
perfecting sprite and the hard part is
behind us we now need your help to get
us over the final hurdle and into
production but to gets right out of our
backpack and into your hands we need to
know that the world is just as
interested in a portable rugged and
simple to use aerial platform as we are
please support us on Kickstarter choose
a reward that's best for you and help
spread the word among your friends
family and colleagues tell anyone who
you think can use an unmanned aerial
vehicle is portable rugged powerful and
simple to use is sprite please visit our
website for more information and details
about sprite and about us and thanks for
your help the future of stripe is in
your hands
I always wanted to fly with birds when I
was a kid my family fulfilled his dream
my daddy and my granddaddy they created
the first mechanical bird it was not a
plane it was a wing flapping machine
today my dream is to create Bionic bird
for the 21st century it will be
connected
it's a flying up here is my earning belt
this is a prototype the egg is a
portable charger you can charge a bird
in less than 12 minutes Bionic body is
only eight point five grams in hazzard
electric motor of 0.8 watts
rotation speed of 55 thousand rpm an
aluminum mixing and a lithium polymer
batteries it also has a great design
inspired by nature plus we can fly as
high as 100 yard
finally I add my friend
when you're lucky the real bird come to
play with you I'm a dreamer I'm not a
big company and I want to share my dream
with you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
