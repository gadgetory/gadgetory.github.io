evening at the park beach or camping
trip light up the night with a colorful
blaze of a flashlight in and keep
playing long after the Sun Goes Down
with the press of a button you can
illuminate the blue green red and
color-changing Cisco LED plus a
flashlight is water-resistant and a
quote crafted with true balance for long
straight flights the disc weighs in at
185 grams and wolf feels and slides just
like non-illuminated this it is
hands-down the best light up flying
discs ever made with the patented LED
modules and fiber optics array that runs
all the way to the rim this disc is
presently visible and catchable from
every angle so to easy to replace 2016
lithium batteries will keep you playing
for 20 hours so snag a flashlight
grab some buddies and head out for some
nighttime fun
you know that black hole inside your car
should how to drop stop that bottomless
pit Carmita triangle should add a drop
stop that annoying gap between the seat
and center console should have had a
drop stop now you can stop the drop with
drop stop hi I'm Jeff and I'm mark and
our amazing invention will save you time
money and maybe even your life watch
this money down the drain
makeup jewelry cellphone but with drops
up you'll be saving cash in a flash and
you'll never have to search for anything
ever again we came up with the idea of
drop stop after my phone fell I took my
eyes off the road nearly hit a
pedestrian and almost smashed into a
pole
don't drop and drive keep your eyes on
the road not in your gap the finger that
drops off business built-in fun designed
to go around the seatbelt catch
anchoring to the seat that means
nothing's getting through it's not a
dime not a two thing and since drop stop
slides it's always at your side drop
stops not some cheap piece of foam
it's high-grade neoprene built to last
look at all the crumbs and dirt
now you're free from debris drop stop
may look too wide but it's squishy
inside which means one size fits all and
since the gap is always a dark shadow
drop stop blends with any color interior
like we're gone then you actually pack
game again
challenge yourself for your friend call

hi I'm Nikki and I'd like to introduce
you to hideaway the bottle you'll always
reach for because it's always within
reach experts suggest that for optimum
health
the average active person drink over 10
glasses of water every day but for those
of us who are always on the go it's
nearly impossible to stay hydrated
without reaching for disposable bottles
of water or sugary sports drink bottled
water may be convenient but it's not
cheap it costs more than two thousand
times more than tap water even though
it's less regulated for health and
quality then there's the bottle every
minute US consumers throw out ninety
thousand plastic bottles and less than a
quarter are actually recycled the rest
end up in our landfills and in our
streets parks and beaches we need a
convenient solution to disposable
plastic bottles that fits our active
lifestyle
so as a freelance product designer I'm
traveling a lot visiting clients
visiting factories going to trade shows
I was looking for a water bottle that
would not take up a lot of space in my
carry-on and I started looking around
for a product that would work that would
still be functional and it wasn't out
there as I'm going through airports I'm
seeing so many travelers probably with
the same problem and I figured this is a
problem I could solve myself you know
once I had a solution for business
travel I realised this had great
application my personal life especially
in the outdoors going backpacking or
just on hikes I could bring water with
me and when the bottle was empty it
collapses and goes away and takes no
extra space in my back no one loves
buying disposable water bottles it's
it's merely out of convenience and the
Hideaway makes a reusable bottle more
convenient in fact in some places
disposable water bottles are being
banned so we're all going to move
towards the reusable water bottle model
and that's why I feel like this is kind
of the next generation and hydration
this gives you an option to have a water
bottle all the time without having to
throw anything away
I'm really excited to share the Hideaway
bottle with with the world and
Kickstarter is an amazing opportunity to
do that to be able to show you the
backers what this is all about so please
check out the rewards we need to raise a
significant amount of money to get this
into production to get it on the shelves
this year and just as important please
share it with everyone you know tell
them about this great water bottle the
hideaway
Oh
she
you
okay
don't be like me everything is you
laughing whoa
Wow
oh wow
we
Oh
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
