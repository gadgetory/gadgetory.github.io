and a little more secure do you remember
the first time you stream the video on
your smartphone at that moment you are
no longer tied to your living room for
your entertainment or to your office for
work you could access your content
anywhere but there's one small problem
your small mobile device screen almost
all of us prefer large displays for
entertainment and for work when those
work deadlines are approaching a large
desktop monitor our dual screen setup
will significantly boost your
productivity so what if there is a way
to have the mobility of a phone tablet
or laptop without losing the benefit of
a large screen sounds impossible but
that's exactly what we did introducing
spud the spontaneous pop-up display spud
is a high resolution 24 inch display
that collapses down to the size of a
book and weighs less than 2 pounds this
revolutionary product is the first truly
collapsible display and the only device
that gives you both portability and a
large screen for entertainment and
productivity sorel the spot design
process we focus on image quality and
ease of use we use the latest projection
technology combined with our own custom
optics to project a large high quality
image over very short distance this
enables spa to produce a bright sharp
image that's about four times larger
than a laptop screen and 20's three
times larger than a smartphone screen to
mix but as easy to use as possible we
designed to work just like a ruggedized
on bro you can pop up the screen in a
very intuitive way you have the spot
setup iran in less than 10 seconds and
since but it's also lightweight battery
powered and uses a hassle-free hdmi
connection you can get straight to the
big screen you want without wasting any
time
one of the most exciting things about
spud is the many different ways that you
can use me on the entertainment side but
is basically a portable TV or movie
screen whether you're traveling camping
hanging out with friends at a coffee
shop or just lounging around your house
it's the big screen that you can use
anywhere for work having a dual screen
setup is great productivity but you can
also use it for presentations and it's a
collaboration it's great for tradeshows
sales business or any kind of field work
spud gives you the flexibility you need
no matter the situation and it's great
because it's a complete solution in a
very small package that you can take
anywhere we have the team the product
and the vision to execute on spud and
now all we need is your support by
backing us on Kickstarter you're
becoming part of our founding community
as a special thank you we'll be adding
all of our Kickstarter backers to an
exclusive VIP list that gives you early
access to discount codes product updates
and beta testing opportunities so
Kickstarter what will you do with your
spud you are hearing the actual signals
transmitted by the earth circling
satellite one of the great scientific
feat of the age it's hard to imagine
world where we don't have satellites
daring
into others fate has literally changed
the way in which we live today's
high-tech satellites are some of the
most complex machines ever invented they
are the crucial link in an ever
increasing number of tasks hi I'm angry
founder of cosmos pioneered since I was
a kid I wanted to be part of NASA that
didn't happen but my dreams of space
never died I wanted to contribute to the
growing movement to open access to space
for everyone so I worked hard to create
something totally new the Cosmo near is
the world's first desktop satellite
simulator it is the only tool of its
kind in existence today that can help
people learn about the unforgiving
realities of outer space it's one
hundred percent hackable open source and
can help you design a spacecraft that
might one day fly it features realistic
guidance navigation and control systems
governed by the limited power and
communications operating in a low
friction environment it's designed to
constrain the user to limitations
experienced in space
I showed the Kozma near proto at
national and world Maker Faires to see
what the interest would be and the
response was overwhelming teachers
makers geeks mass employees everyone
wanted a kid I started this campaign to
make a cosmic it available to anyone to
like me wants to enter and possibly
contribute to the new space age but to
do that cosmos pioneering need your
support by backing the Kozma near you
will enable us to refine the
manufacturing process and reduce the
cost especially for teachers and
students but we also need your support
to help spread the word because the
Kazmir is truly innovative the breach
could be greater than we can even
imagine the educational possibilities
are balanced and if the maker faire
enthusiasm is any invitation we could be
advancing the evolution of DIYs face
please back the Kazmir photo and tell
your family and friends they should to
let them know they are part of the
growing movement to expand mankind reach
to Mars and beyond one of the great
scientific feats of the age
two years ago we did a Kickstarter with
loon cube and thank you for those who
backed us hey we're stuck to be back on
Kickstarter bringing you the lifeline
you
the lifeline to be a thousand lumens
waterproof to 30 feet half the size and
a third the way we wanted to be the
light that you take with you anyway it's
something that you want to keep with you
because you never want to miss that
moment a couple years ago at my
foundation event I was introduced to the
product and from that point on I was
very interested in linking now we have
the life like half the size seventy
percent of the light is still there it's
an amazing piece of electronics you
forget that it's in your pocket cuz it's
so small and so compatible with
everything as the company grows it still
within to its customers and that's
what's so amazing and seeing everybody
work together out of absolute love for
what we're doing and the solutions that
were created
doing something different whether it's
photography or surfing with the lights
at night this lights opened up a giant
opportunity for me I don't want to miss
one surf session after the Sun Goes Down
we're a software company with hardware
devices that solves problems in the
mobile imagery world there's great
companies out there that have created
great products but we're just that
perfect complement we realized that in
order to have the perfect image the
perfect memory you need the perfect
light I think life life brings that to
you it's cool to be partners with a
company that allows you to make the
product look sick but to also have fun I
believe that's what nigga cube is all
about is having fun and trying to light
up things you normally want to be able
to wherever I am or whatever we're doing
I'm finding that we're using the life
light for so many more things than we
ever intended the light waterproof it's
so small if it allows us to do things
that we weren't able to do before and
yeah people night sir foot not with
lights this brain not with the
technology of cameras these days we're
capturing things that were never really
imaginable this is so different to
anything else that's ever been shot and
surfing like this I'm just stoked to be
a part of this movement
just cool that you can take life light
and put it in the ocean film Jamie
O'Brien and then you know you can take
it to some state spot with me and films
an incredible scenery shot we need to
take you to the snowboarder you guys we
have to take it everywhere that's what's
great about life light is that it's
bringing all these different athletes
together because now we can do unique
things that we weren't able to do before
cuz you can see I'm stoked to be with
the Loom cube family it's allowed me to
do some insane things check out the
Kickstarter flight it up have fun
please support us let us show you what
we got
I'm confident with the team around us
we'll continue to bring the most
innovative products to market

light to your life
