everyone loves traveling we all love to
explore the amazing place around the
world and most importantly shopping we
all want you pack every silver near
where anything we bought into the
luggage but we all face the same problem
when we pass no matter how you organize
the size of them will still be too much
in the end we cannot put everything the
luggage but make ourself tired oh and
the dirty clothes that's kicking off
during the trip we don't even want to
mix it with new clothes or maybe there
is no space for it already hello
IndieGoGo I'm Jennifer as a traveler we
are thinking about how to make more
space in the luggage an after our
research we found out clothes bags and
other sort of things occupy more than
fifty percent of the luggage for a
five-day trip so that's what creates
bagel a miracle solution of making more
space in a very short time now we only
need to do is to put our clothes in
tobago back think about it put on bago
plug in power and push the bottom Vega
will automatically and great quote
we can enjoy your time in the hotel or
any other place well bago is doing its
job don't worry this intelligent Vega
will automatically stop when the process
is finished the only thing you need to
do is putting their strong vacuum back
into your luggage we can also use
printable battery to retract bagel we
believe this convenient designed to make
shopaholic divine more remember those
dirty clothes bagel vacuum back to
prevent smelly smell and urine so you
can keep the luggage cling and use more
space efficiently in the same time to
make your overall trip even more
convenient so we use the general micro
USB cable for the recharge design create
extra space for your luggage to Lake
every space count currently Vega will
have four color and we'll have more
color collection in the near future each
vago will come with vacuum bag for
clothes and silk stuffs now Vega is in
the modeling design process and we have
a really great thing to make it even
better we will appreciate if you can
support and plus this product and we are
sure bago can make your trip more
relaxed more convenient and later bring
more souvenir and memory home thank you
for watching
hi I'm John and I invented my phone the
grab-and-go booster seat this is a
regular car booster seat and this is my
fold my fold is the most advanced
compact and portable booster seat in the
world it's more than 10 times smaller
than a regular booster and it's just as
safe how's that possible well a regular
booster seat lifts a child to be in the
position of an adult my fold does the
exact opposite instead of lifting the
child up it holds the seat belt down
it's that simple my fold is engineered
to protect children from the age of 4
all the way up to 12 the patented design
takes the seat belt off the stomach and
the neck making it comfortable safe and
easy to use car loads of kids and
parents already tried and they love it
when it comes to car seats for children
safety is the number one priority it's
crucial for us to meet the highest
regulatory standards and we've crash
tested prototypes successfully in
testing facilities all around the world
now people often ask me John where did
the idea come from so let me tell you
some stories about when my four kids
were little guys come on when you were
little thank you carpooling was a big
part of our lives we always had boosters
for our own kids but not for the extras
that came along Michael is so small that
kids can keep one with them
all the time when my parents visiting we
always had to juggle bulky booster seats
from car to car my fold is so compact
you can store one almost anywhere and my
fold is narrow so you can easily put
three in a row even in the smallest cars
do you live in a big city how often do
you jump in a taxi next they never have
a booster seat and that's not safe and
hey by the way that is not a taxi thank
you last time you rented a car you
probably paid an additional forty
dollars to rent the booster that's more
than my fault costs and ours isn't
covered in another kids dinner or worse
my soul's easy to keep clean you can
even put it in the dishwasher so I
thought if I could make a booster that's
mighty small and mighty strong when you
could take with you everywhere then
children could always be safe no matter
whose car though in using super tough
plastic polymers an aircraft grade
aluminium top designers engineers and
industry experts together we've created
my fold the most advanced compact and
portable safety seat ever invented and
we can't wait to start getting my fold
into the hands and the bags of children
all over the world pre-order your my
fold now at my phone com soon we'll all
be ready to grab and go
