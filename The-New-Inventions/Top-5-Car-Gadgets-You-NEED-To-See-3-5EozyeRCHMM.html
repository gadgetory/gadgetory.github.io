our roads can't see behind them when

expensive or is much too difficult to
install you practically had to be a car
guy to install it yourself so we made
the world's simplest and easiest
solution yet to hit the market

smart parking device
the embedded ultrasonic sensors can
detect any object within three meters of
the car's front or back blind spots we
use an accelerometer detect when the car
is backing up and then use bluetooth to
automatically launch the app on the
drivers phone we've designed a
completely seamless experience that
requires no interaction on behalf of the
driver the device itself installs in
less than five minutes with absolutely
no wiring and only four security screws
to prevent that it's so easy
your grandma can do it
the device itself knows when your car's
backing up and immediately launches the
app on the drivers phone cladding
audio-visual and vibration alerts for
optics and your client spots

that's the sound of you stepping into
your car the beginning of a remarkable
journey
so why having formats changed in over
half a century formats like these are
outdated look cheap don't protect the
floors completely and have huge safety
concerns
I wanted formats that were just built to
last and function but would also provide
an excuse to simply take my car out for
a drive so I created auto print formats
a complete reinvention of what car mats
should be our very own cream leather
material with luxurious diamond
stitching will instantly give your car
an upgrade of elegance and style whether
you're driving to work or picking up
some friends you'll be able to show off
your personality and confidence through
the auto cream mats alone you don't
really realize how easy it is to keep
your car pristine until you have full
floor coverage that protects your
vehicle the upside coverage ensures that
any sort of dirt or trash is kept on the
floor mats nothing will ever get
underneath the floors and when it is
time to clean the mats all you have to
do is either vacuum or wipe the surface
off with the baby wipe if you live in an
area with harsh weather conditions and
your car tends to get dirty more often
Auto cream Plus is the perfect option
for you it has a detachable layer on top
of the original maps which make the
cleaning even easier while giving double
production to the vehicle these soft
waterproof and durable mats are also a
favorite for those who enjoy driving
barefoot it truly is amazing how foreign
material technology and the
possibilities of manufacturing have
become we use the most durable

ride I love driving but I hate it when
long rides begins to tire me out and
bring pain to my lower body Auto clean
floor mats have you covered with
comfortable soft padding this padding
allows for a painless journey one of the
biggest concerns in any aftermarket
product is that it might create problems
such as the mats getting trapped under
the gas or brake pedals with safety

conducted numerous experiments and I've
found various ways to solve this
possible problem the auto clean floor
