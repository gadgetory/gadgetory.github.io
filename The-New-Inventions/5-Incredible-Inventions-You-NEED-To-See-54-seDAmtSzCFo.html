be not where you were where you are
focus on your goals focus with
everything you have focus on more than
the everyday focus believe and you can
achieve at Aksum our only focus was to
create the world's best earphones to
change the soundtrack start the
revolution we're proud to present the
world's best truly wireless earphones
reproducing music as originally recorded
clear powerful and full of emotion we've
implemented em boys patented sound
technology previously reserved for use
by leading comics the technology enabled
us to analyze and optimize accent gear
in the virtual space producing a clearer
sound you've ever heard in wireless
networks the adjustable hook allows
youths during the most extreme sports
activities and with one size it will fit
you perfectly no matter what shape
you're in the latest Bluetooth receiver
offers a range of up to 10 meters
waterproof double nano coating covers
each internal part before the whole unit
is recounted for full protection whilst
our magnetic charging next delivers
hassle free power to your efforts making
recharge easy and with a built-in
microphone and hours of battery life all
you need to do is keep on going add some
gear start the revolution
since kids get distracted easily parents
are always concerned about how to best
communicate with their kids as education
experts say it is crucial for parents to
help kids form good habits in this stage
now we have honey bot the first
educational family robot designed
especially for young kids distinguishing
from other similar products we have
integrated AR technology into
interactive activities for example kids
can draw a picture and then honey bot
will recognize the object and turn it
into animation with educational
explanation and music we have also
prepared many flashcards of diverse
objects with AR technology
kids can show the flashcards to honey
BOTS and honey BOTS will display the
objects on the screen in 3d form with
explanation to help kids learn and
memorize honey BOTS habit-forming system
was designed to help parents guide their
kids to develop good habits easily kids
can keep a virtual pet with honey bots
like a real pet you will get hungry
dirty and tired has the pet owners the
kids will need to feed it give it bats
and put it to bed according to different
scenes from such interactions kids will
be able to gradually build good habits
besides it's educating function honey
bot is also designed to help
communication between parents and kids
be more fun and effective parents can
use the voice changing function with
smart phones and send a voice message to
honey pot honey bot will then play the
message to kids with a funny voice even
when parents are miles away they can
video call their kids and talk to them
face to face
we hope that honey bot becomes the angel
of your home by providing good company
for your kids helping you in your kids
bond and helping kids gain knowledge and
develop good habits considering the
safety issues we only use the safest and
most environmental friendly materials to
make honey buck and we made it into more
of a round shape without sharp angles we
have already finished our MD and small
batch production now we need your help
and support to mass produce honey bot
please support us and make honey bot
into reality what you see in science
fiction
tech fiction is very quickly becoming
possible if you point the structure
sensor out into the world you're
capturing the world it's like giving
some sort of a superpower to average Joe
devices what if you could give your
mobile device a new sense the ability to
not just capture the world in
two-dimensional images but to actually
understand it in three dimensions the
structure sensor does just that it's the
world's first 3d sensor for mobile
devices what I really am excited about
the destructor sensor is it makes it so
easy you can clip it to a mobile device
and walk around your world basically
pull your world into a digital form my
name is Jeff powers and I'm a founder of
occipital we're passionate about giving
devices the ability to see and under
the world around them this isn't about
taking pictures it's about computer
vision and interaction we call it
spatial computing it's much bigger than
just us and it's going to change the way
we interact with the world let me show
you what you can do with this you'll be
able to capture every dimension of an
entire room in a matter of seconds and
you can send a model to your phone so
you can get any dimension you need at
any time you'll be able to easily
capture and send three-dimensional
objects across town or across the world
and make decisions together
even when you're apart you'll be able to
play games games where the real world
becomes the game world building hardware
is something we had never done occipital
is fundamentally a software company so
to create this device we had to teach
ourselves hardware design and we were
lucky enough to work with some of the
best technology companies in the world
not the least of which is primeSense the
company whose technology actually
powered the original Kinect applying 3d
technology to mobile devices is an
immense challenge occipital is geared to
make that the panel 360 and red lays
there so this is a team that can
actually pull this off structure works
by capturing a pattern of invisible
laser projected light which allows you
to measure thousands of distances all at
once the iPad has arguably the best user
experience of any tablet and it was
important to us to go the extra mile to
make structure work specifically with it
structure latches securely to your iPad
it connects via the new lightning
connector the end result is actually
thermal design mechanical design
industrial design Oakley put together
into one perfect object structures
single piece body is machined from
high-grade anodized aluminum it serves
as both a beautiful exterior and as a
thermal core that keeps the precision
optics inside at an optimal temperature
what's really important is get a
platform out there and see what
developers do with it for the first time
you'll get an SDK that lets you tap into
a 3d sensor on iOS you'll have complete
low-level access to the sensor and if
you don't feel like processing raw depth
data you can tap into the high level API
just write your application in Xcode and
hit deploy you can even launch your app
on the App Store if you want to develop
on another platform we're giving you
everything you need a USB hacker cable
open source drivers and even open CAD
specs so you can 3d print your own
attachment for almost anything I really
like how this device was designed from
the beginning to be open and hackable
because we don't know which way it's
going to go now it's time to get it into
the right hands
early adopters developers hackers we're
using Kickstarter to connect with you we
want to get sensors into the hands of
some of the most creative people in the
world to create new applications to
inspire new features to help us make the
sensor even better new senses are going
to make possible new applications
Kickstarter backers have the opportunity
to get a structure sensor before the
rest of the world complete with demo
applications that you can use straight
out of the box it will also be providing
source code for these demo applications
details are on our Kickstarter page as a
backer
we'll get frequent updates about new
things you can do with your sensor
structure is the senso we've always
wanted
well for me the challenge has been in
creating three-dimensional objects this
completely obliterates that challenge
beyond thrilled that you
building this can I help with your
backing we can take the structure sensor
to the next level join us get a sensor
and be one of the first to experience
what happens when your mobile device can
understand the world in three dimensions
I mean I said yes finally somebody is
doing that
looking for the best tracker to protect
your valuables and even your kids track
tag is more than just the smallest and
best looking Bluetooth tracker it packs
a rechargeable battery good for 80 years
and a smartphone remote control with
multi functions including making
emergency calls track tags can be
clipped on or attach the keys luggage
laptops and even kids if your track tag
goes outside the preset range from your
phone they'll both remind you with
alarms and if you forget your phone your
track tag will flash and beep loudly to
remind you to go back and get it it's so
small like kids don't even know it's
there until it beeps and flashes around
their neck it's so loud you can even
find it from a distance and if you're
not nearby a record of the GPS locations
is automatically saved can't see your
phone call it from your track tag and
follow the preset ringtone what makes
track tag better than the rest is that
the same remote control button can
secretly activate your smart phone to
take videos pictures and record audio
without you touching it even if your
smart phone is being used for GPS
navigation in your car it can still take
dashcam videos with one press of the
track tag button out of sight during an
emergency or a dangerous situation if
your phone is inside a pocket or on your
arm band track tag can make a dial a
preset phone number without you having
to take it out best of all the 80 year
battery life saves you money and hassle
of replacing batteries track tag the
best tracker to protect and serve you
and save money too</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
