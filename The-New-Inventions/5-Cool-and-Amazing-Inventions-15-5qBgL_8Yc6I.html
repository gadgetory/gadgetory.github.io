talking about security did you know that
the weakest part of the door is actually
the cylinder lock we redesigned it from
scratch and amended a new construction

security in the
the bold smart lock installs just like a
regular cylinder lock unscrew the
retaining bolt slide out the old
cylinder
slide the smart lock in

done the lock has elegant minimalistic
design because we believe it just has to
look good on every door you could put a
knob of your own choice on the outside

need a smartphone not necessarily we've
included a remote as a backup or for
your kids electronic locks have been
around in professional spaces like
airports and hospitals for decades but
