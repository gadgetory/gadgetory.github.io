capable to solve most of everyday tasks
Everson is packed in a tiny and
lightweight aluminum body no buttons no
batteries just touch it and hit over
your hand will be converted into a light
illumine is a body heat powered
flashlight heart of the device is tag
unit that convert heat into electric
current excessive energy is stored into
a super capacitor and voltage converter
boost it up into a usable range allow
battery on smartphone and you're in a
dark route not a problem anymore need
forever left in light source for reading
for everlasting light in your twisted

least scary of brands on a big name
this is what happens when you snap your
fingers next to regular dice and this is
what happens when you snap your fingers
next to boogie dice
who he dies for the world's first sound
activated motorized gaming dice
whoo you guys can be used with any of
your favorite games adding a new element
of fun and excitement
the dice are activated by the sound of a
clap click bang or by throwing them like
standardise the dice a program to come
to a stop after a few seconds inside
each die there's a microphone a
vibration motor a tilt sensor three LEDs
and a rechargeable battery hi my name is
the warden of the creator of press it
and I'm sorry I creator of the games the
agents looking down I was inspired by
the cool features of baby dice to create
a fast pace to achieve a card game that
utilizes the dice to expire best effect
we're proud to present bots battleground
the first game that we've designed
around boogie dice
seven six five four three two one
in box battleground the dice determine
which pots go to battle it acts as a
timer and we've designed the charging
station to act as the battleground arena
boogie dice are programmable and come
with your own app so you can easily
switch between different programs and
games
wats battleground is our first game this
is an exciting new platform for games so
play along and share your ideas of
what's next for boogie dice ready go
people are the most creative when they
are children but the tools they use to
create have not changed for years
hi I'm roostin and this is the robo cube
and it will change how our kids learn
about technology introducing Robo
wunderkind a revolutionary robotics kit
for kids of all ages which can be
programmed and controlled with
smartphones and tablets
robo cubes can be attached from either
side so you can make different robots
two years ago I was
computer science at the University of
Technology and I was building robots on
Arduino platform my friends were
fascinated by what I was doing and they
also wanted to build their own robots
but as no fun and simple way for them to
get started this is why I decided to
create a robot that would be easy to
build that coat and move accessible for
everyone
we are embedding different electronics
such as microcontrollers sensors motors
and divin cameras into the cubes this
way kids can easily believe unique
robots with different functions and in
any shape they can imagine I think it's
really important that kids introduced
technology at a very young age and I
think Robo is really interesting
platform for enabling these kinds of
things that turn makes the robotics
technology accessible the biggest
engineering challenge for our team was
to create a connection system between
the cubes we've created the technology
that will be easy to grasp even for a
five-year-old child and it works
perfectly as two types of cubes build
the robot and connect it to your tablet
via bluetooth
we've created an intuitive app that kids
really love you don't have to write any
code to program the robot just jack and
roadblocks in the app and press stop
teachers love the way kids learn by
playing with a robot that's why we've
also developed a curriculum for teachers
on how do you throw by when they can't
