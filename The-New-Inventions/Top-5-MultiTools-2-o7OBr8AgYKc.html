apps games and media keyport combines
your keys every day carry tools and
smart tech into the ultimate everyday
multi tool you will use dozens of times
a day every single day I've been
designing multi key devices for over ten
years today I'm proud to introduce two
new key ports with more multi tool and
tech features than ever before the
keyboard slide 3.0 which works with our
patented key blades and the key port
pivot based on some of my original
designs from over a decade ago works
with your existing keys both linked
products are all metal and engineered to
accept our brand new multi-tool and tech
features such as the Bluetooth locator
knife blade and LED flashlight each
device is totally customizable for any
type of users
keyboards mission is to create a system
that allows each user to consolidate and
customize their own unique set of tools
and keys for everyday life we try to
integrate customer feedback into
everything we do the features and our
new products are a direct result of our
customers requests the keyboard slide
3.0 is made of precision machined
aircraft grade aluminum with a spring
steel frame the ergonomic soft touch
side plates are interchangeable with our
new tech and tool modules the keyboard
key blades and inserts slide in and out
with your thumb as needed
like the slide the keyport pivot is made
of aircraft aluminum with stainless
steel components and works with our new
tech and tool modules the flexible
linkage allows the device to expand from
four to nine of your existing keys and
various key port inserts our new
low-profile lanyard attachment locks to
the end cap when not in use the biggest
complaint about keys is losing them the
tracker compatible key port locator is a
Bluetooth low-energy crowd-sourced
locator that helps you keep track of
your key port at all times our most
popular request from eg Sears is the
addition of a knife blade so we
partnered with clicker knives to develop
our knife module the keyboard knife
provides a sturdy cutting blade that can
easily be removed for airline travel and
then just as quickly reattached when you
unpack your luggage we're creating a
partner platform for makers students and
companies to create compatible modules
for our products we can't wait to see
what you come up with to top it off we
have upgraded our lost-and-found program
this new online lost-and-found service
connects owners and finders directly and
anonymously add a click with no
middleman or number to call once you
register your keyboard with keyboard ID
you'll be able to use that same number
on your other valuables such as your
phone laptop and even your wallet such a
service typically costs around twenty
dollars per year but we are including
the first year free with any slide or
pivot reward whether you slide our pivot
pledge today and help us put a key part
in your pocket
last year for Windsor released the
Nutter cycle multi-tool many cyclists
have been in touch telling us they love
vanilla but just wish that included a
chain breaker but we listen the breaker
cycle multi-tools
features a tool grade steel pen that
threads them to the tools main body then
uses the tool but extender as a handle
giving you the functionality of a
workshop chain breaker and a multi-tool
you
the breaker is compact and fits nicely
into a lever and recycled in a tube
pouch which holds everything needed to
fix a puncture together in a nice
compact bundle
a magnetic taulbert slot is located in
the tools in allowing the tool for use
like a screwdriver a secondary tool that
slot is located on the side of a tool
allowing for more torque when needed
you
the pouch is able to attach under your
settle or to the top tube of your bike
please help us to bring the brake and
multi-tool to life by backing our
projects and be one of the first to
receive a breaker of your very own
like I said it's a survival multi-tool
and everyday carry it's composed of 3d
printed parts sandwich by a back and
front stainless steel plates that are
laser-cut
they're attached all together with
stainless steel rivets to endure rust
and oxidation has many features and
carabiner clip a bottle opener with dual
function it's a bottle opener and a
wrench at the same time and the compass
has a blade momentary flashlight for
emergencies ferrocerium rod and has a
split ring to hang keys or any other
on the other side you will find a
scraper that slides out the scraper
itself it's a mini tool that has a
quarter inch bit adapter has three
different size nut adopted ranging from
small medium large
it also can serve as a flathead
screwdriver goes back in place when you
need to start a fire
basically swivel out your ferrocerium
rod pick your scraper out scrape scrape
spots mark and start a fire when you're
done you close it turn it around put
your key back in place your scraper and
you're done
it set has a carabiner where you can
hang it in any belt loop backpack or
wherever you want to hang this too it's
very lightweight
this is a very cool multi thing as many
functions this is no matter hope you
guys like it and hope you guys can back
me up very cool item thank you hope to
hear from you soon
hi there my name is mark winter founder
of fall winter a small bicycle
accessories design company based in
London we launched our quick fix vendors
on Kickstarter last year and since then
have been working away on the nutter
a new innovative cycle multi-tool
another is exceptionally simple yet
extremely functional it combines the
most commonly used bike tools into one
unique piece most cyclists usually carry
a set of tire levers a multi-tool and
the spanner each time they go for a ride
the Nutter combines all these tools into
one saving space weight and hassle one
of the most common issues the cyclists
faces is fixing a puncture roadside but
none of features a tire lever with a
steel core and glass reinforced nylon
outer meaning or never snap and won't
damage your alloy rims at the other end
the NADA has a 15 millimeter box head
span for undoing and tightening nuts
another handy feature is the quarter
inch magnetic tool bit slot this allows
another to perform a huge variety of
tasks it comes with eight of the most
widely used cycle tool bits and a
magnetic tool bed extender but all
itself acts as a handle providing great
leverage the nutter houses two of the
tool bits inside its structure it also
features a spoke key for tightening and
loosening your spokes we have designed
the tool pouch for another to hold
everything together and once more
compact bundle the pouch is made from
lever and recycled bicycle inner tubes
the pouch is designed so it can be hung
under your saddle from your saddle rails
but another is investment cast from
stainless steel and been hardened making
it extremely strong and durable it is in
cnc'd for a precision finish we would
like to offer you the opportunity to
preorder of another if we raise more
than eight thousand pounds then we can
take venado into production with your
help the money you would allow us to
make the tool molds and help pay for the
initial production run thanks for your
help and we look forward to bringing you
another
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
