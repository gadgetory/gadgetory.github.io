construction works it's usually
necessary to squeeze the floor first the
durability and appearance of the
resulting surface depends on how
carefully and correctly this procedure
is carried out just in case let's
clarify that screeding a floor is a
really hard work a layer of cement or
concrete mortar is applied to the floor
screeding means levelling the floor
making it stronger and removing
irregularities it's not an easy process
usually it takes an average of 22
kilograms of floor screed compound per
square meter if the floor area is large
it can take a long time to prepare the
right amounts of mortar not to mention
the fact that you have to carry the
product to the right floor and evenly
distribute it over the entire surface on
the screen you see a simpler and faster
way to screed when ready mixture arrives
at the construction site by truck
high-tech equipment makes it possible to
apply the mixture to the floor surface
using a hose without you making any
effort in the process before the mixture
hardens you need to make sure that the
floor is flat and the composition is
evenly distributed using a special tool
for this purpose
notes that the builder is leveling the
floor while standing in a comfortable
position in just a few minutes he
processes the whole area this way of
screeding a floor has an advantage over
the traditional way that uses an
aluminium loot when you have to work
sitting in an uncomfortable position and
of course the process takes much longer
heated floor
here's another technology that makes it
easier and faster to handle conventional
construction work a heated floor has
special tubes underneath the surface
when hot water flows through them the
surface heats up how evenly it warms up
depends on the position of the tubes
they are usually attached to the floor
surface using a special stapler wrap X
feed from the Swiss company or a house
works differently here as you can see
it's also tubes that are used for the
floor heating
however the materials are different
the pipe is wrapped in hook-and-loop
material that attaches to the mat
underneath thus even one person can
install the tubes the work is done 50%
faster
if the pipe section is not laid
correctly it can be detached from the
maps and moves to the correct position
Road patches sooner or later even the
best roads fall into disrepair potholes
appear on the surface and they need to
be repaired in time the problem is that
the traditional repair method has many
drawbacks fresh asphalt in potholes
crack's more quickly in some cases after
a few days the road gets damaged again
this is because there are microscopic
gaps between the old asphalt layer and
the new one under the impact of wheels
water and oil they expand and the
surface loses its integrity American
Road patch is a technology that allows
you to extend the effect of road repairs
it took about five years to develop it
the advantage is that the repair
procedure itself does not change
construction workers still clean the
road and then fill it with fresh hot
asphalt mixture the only difference is
an extra step at the very end a patch is
placed on top of the pothole or crack
and then tramped with a tool that is
widely used for road repairs a trauma
after that the patch becomes parts of
the road now the pothole is covered so
the impact of the external environment
on it is minimized thanks to this the
surface integrity is preserved for a
much longer time the last advantage we'd
like to mention is the fact that it's
aesthetically pleasing with the color
and structure of the patch matching
those of the road
flexible aluminium profiles aluminium
profiles are indispensable at any
construction site they use to create
stretch ceilings and drywall cladding
however working with them is sometimes
uncomfortable as they are solid pieces
of metal they're not flexible not
malleable and therefore the scope of
their use is limited comprar profiles
from the Italian company I Pro fili do
not have this disadvantage
the construction of the metal section is
passin tit thanks to it the material has
optimal flexibility for all construction
needs in this case for example it's used
to create a rounded ceiling the
advantage of this design is that the
section is attached just like any other
that is the Builder does not need to be
retained or think long about how the new
material works the manufacturer
recommends the use of Cobra to create
arches semicircular structures and s
curves
however the scope of use of course is
limited only by the fantasy of the
designer they standard length of the
section is 3 meters however it can be
easily shortened to fit your needs
block laying the device you see on the
screen is the future of the construction
industry there are houses made of blocks
or bricks in almost every city
traditionally they are laid by people
the process is long and time-consuming
the weight of an average brick is
slightly more than three kilograms the
weight of a building block can reach 220
kilograms
thus builders have to carry enormous
loads every day hadrian x is a robot for
laying blocks and bricks which could
significantly reduce the human effort it
first lubricates the blocks with a
special adhesive and then places them in
the right place
adrian x stacks up to a thousand bricks
per hour
Road marking if you have ever seen
workers placing thermoplastic road
markings you know that the procedure
requires a lot of care and patience also
in order for the stripes to be perfectly
flat and in the right position it's
necessary to use expensive equipment for
work here's the technology that allows
one person to mark the road the
procedure is quick and effortless while
the result is not inferior to the
marking applied by the most advanced and
technological equipment first the
asphalt is heated with a gas burner in
the place where the marking has to be
laid a strip of preformed plastic is
then placed on top in this case the
product of the french company all rate
paint is used the only thing that
remains to be done is to use a gas
burner to treat the place again the
preformed thermoplastic is delivered in
roles of 5 meters each it can be used to
mark a parking lots like in the video
and ordinary roads to
