fortunately almost every city in the
world today has a well-designed sewerage
system this means that a large number of
different sewage pipes have been laid
underground and they're accessed through
manholes their appearance and design can
vary greatly as a general rule manhole
covers vary depending on the country in
which they were produced to end
installed today we're going to show you
a manhole cover offered by the German
company a Co passive and Gus the system
known as trikona includes a manhole
under cover with a unique design the
purpose of this system is to facilitate
and accelerate the installation process
the fact is that the lid is relatively
light weighing about 25 kilograms while
a traditional lid weighs at least 50
kilograms this means that workers need
less time and effort to open and close
the sewer at the same time the cover is
firmly attached to the frame at three
points in other words you can't just
lift the lid even when it's so much
lighter the lid is divided into four
sections each of which opens
individually
pay attention to the locking mechanism
which prevents the cover from being
accidentally closed during sewerage work
the safety lock and hinges are made of
high-strength cast iron this means that
they're protected against stress
corrosion cracking and contact corrosion
which often occurs when metal comes into
contact with other metals for an
extended period of time
gum removal machine
millions of people consumed gum everyday
although there are usually bins
everywhere on the streets much of the
chewing gum consumed by people ends up
on the ground ruining the appearance of
the streets it's also extremely
difficult to remove so governments have
to allocate large amounts of money for
this procedure that's why the
specialized equipment you see on the
screen was invented the m/v 700
gladiators a gum removal machine the
equipment is manufactured by the British
company addicts group the chewing gum
removal machine allows you to quickly
and easily clean the surface the machine
optimally cleans the surface even if the
coating is irregular or defective unlike
traditional methods such as high
pressure washers this equipment does not
damage the surface in addition the
device uses five times less water than
its analogues the NV 700 Gladiator is
designed to clean places with high
pedestrian flow
it's maneuverable and quiet it should
also be noted that the machine not only
removes the gun from the asphalt and
paving stones but also eliminates dirt
from the surface the machine can clean
up to a hundred and sixty square meters
per hour
snow melting system in places with harsh
and long winters huge sums of money are
spent annually on snow removal and frost
control traditional ways of coping with
the effects of winter are effective but
it's not perfect the best solution is to
install snow melting systems basically
they're heated tracks the snow which
falls on the surface melts instantly and
the water does not turn into ice that
way you don't have to worry about
removing snow in winter the road warms
up to the point where you can feel the
heat when you touch it
some of you install this system in your
backyard you'll even be able to walk
barefoot on it the video shows the work
done by the specialists of a group
creations
suction sweeper nowadays it's not
necessary to hire a brigade of people to
clean up the streets instead the
complete cleaning cycle of almost any
street surface can be performed with the
help of a single team here is the
Nilfisk CR 3500 street sweeper which is
operated by a single person the machine
is equipped with separately controlled
routes hating bushes the garbage whether
small or large is collected and then
taken to the suction house the working
width of the machine is 2.4 meters
the machine is small and maneuverable
facilitating the removal of debris
around poles and other objects it can
even be used in parking lots the
operator can adjust the speed of the
brushes and water usage the brush
pressure on the surface is also
adjustable however regardless of the
pressure the brushes will leave no marks
on the surface
another outstanding feature of the
equipment is the water recirculation
system this way the machine consumes
less water and has to be refilled less
frequently there's also an additional
external hose integrated in the body of
the machine to clean the water from
storm drains suck up fallen leaves and
empty the waste containers
power trowel nowadays in order to
install concrete pavements workers more
often use equipment similar to that seen
on the screen what you see here is a two
rotor power trowel these machines are
manufactured by Whiteman it is used to
trowel concrete in large and medium
areas the procedure is performed
immediately after pouring the concrete
the main goal of the procedure is to
remove irregularities and compacts the
surface
the machine is 3 meters wide which is an
advantage as it allows for a large
working area the operating principle is
very simple there are routers inside
equipped with six blades each the
hydrostatic drive provides high torque
the blades simultaneously smooth wet
concrete and exert pressure on it two
rotors allow the work to be performed
faster
this machine also stands out for its
electronic control which adjusts the
fuel supplies of the engine and its
consumption rate
road sweeper this is another machine
designed for fast and efficient street
cleaning this particular model is
specifically used in cases where a wide
roadway needs to be cleaned the
equipment removes debris from the
roadside with a rotating side brush it
also has a nozzle for spraying
high-pressure water this removes dirt
and dust from the road at the same time
the machine can be operated with
two-side nozzles that distribute water
to both sides of the road
the Yantai hyder machine tool
manufactures this equipment
