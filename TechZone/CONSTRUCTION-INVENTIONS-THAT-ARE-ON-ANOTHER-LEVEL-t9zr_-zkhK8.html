sites and warehouses bulky and heavy
loads have to be transported at all
times
traditionally forklift trucks use for
such operations they are capable of both
moving and loading but are cumbersome
and expensive the hand truck PHT 140 is
an efficient mobile and compact
alternative the tool is designed for
lifting and transporting loads weighing
up to 140 kilograms the maximum lifting
range is 1.9 meters only one person is
needed for the job and the physical
effort is minimal such con trucks are
produced by the Australian company
mechanics construction products the
construction consists of two wheeled
chassis and a scissor lift powered by an
electric motor when folded the hand
truck PHT 140 takes up very little space
and weighs only 40 kilograms you can buy
it for $4,500
hardened on construction sites special
paper tape is used to seal joints this
material prevents cracks from forming in
the future the only problem is that the
paper tape is not adhesive this means
that the builder first applies a thin
layer of spackling paste to the joint
this has to be done very carefully in
order to make as an even layer and
quickly before the spackling paste
hardens in other words the work is
painstaking and not so easy
it's performed in two stages - and
requires a lot of effort from the worker
hardened turns it into a one step
procedure the tape is inserted into the
device and the spackling paste is pumped
in - after that the only thing left to
do is pass the tool along the joint it
stacks the filler layer itself and then
applies the tape the result is perfect
there are no air bubbles or other
defects under the tape hardened costs
$1,500
the mule the weight of concrete blocks
differs depending on their size and
design some of them can reach between 20
and 40 kilograms this is quite a lot if
we take into account that the worker has
to lift a dozens of blocks a day it
becomes clear why construction is a
difficult and time-consuming job
everyday workers left up to two and a
half tons of materials the mule is a
device by construction robotics designed
to speed up and simplify construction
site tasks the manufacturer claims their
product increases efficiency by 300
percent it's a robotic lift that can
carry up to 61 kilograms of weight
operated by the craftsman thanks to the
unique design of the lift enhancer the U
operates as follows the worker takes the
block and places it in the right place
as usual however he does not feel the
waste of the block which means that it
can perform the task much faster
information on the price of the device
is available on request but if you buy
it you will earn the cost back after
only six months
Ripper stripper dismantling old floor
tiles is usually a long and
time-consuming process workers use a
variety of tools such as rotary hammers
drills chisels and hammers
besides it's a rather dangerous process
to the craftsman has to spend a long
time in a room filled with construction
dust large pieces of tile and cement
like all the other tools shown in
today's video Ripper stripper is
designed to make the work of builders
easier faster and safer the machine
allows to get rid of tiles in a short
time
moreover Ripa stripper is also able to
remove a layer of carpet wood or other
similar floor covering the device
requires minimum effort from the worker
there's no need to hold heavy bulky
tools in your hand feeling their
vibration with your whole body you can
buy Ripa stripper for $1,800
door lock installation kit to install
even the simplest lock or doorknob you
need to make a few holes in the door
their size is calculated with great
precision otherwise the knob won't fit
inside or will be loose which will cause
problems in the operation
a set for door locks installation from
Lowe's company costs only $30 it'll help
you make a perfectly sized hole for a
knob in the right place the set looks
like a nozzle which is attached to the
place where the handle or lock will be
located once it is attached to the door
the worker sees where the hole needs to
be made also the manufacturer offers to
buy templates for cutting ends
Paz load 18 G a this is a lithium-ion
battery powered brad nailer the American
company Paz load manufactures these
devices the main feature of this tool is
its low weight only 2 kilograms and they
compact size thanks to this it's
possible to work with it even in
confined spaces
the Paz load 18 GA will batter down a
nail in a corner or any other tight
space according to the manufacturer this
is one of the lightest tools of its kind
on the market you combine to the price
of 350 dollars
surface preparation tool before you
start painting or performing any other
type of surface treatment you need to
prepare the surface beforehand
for example remove stickers paintwork or
rust all these operations can be
performed with a single tool by Kimble
Midwest its versatility is provided by
three different wheels the eraser wheel
removes vinyl and other stickers
adhesives and reflective tapes from the
surface without damaging it the
stripping wheel removes rust corrosion
dirt and oxidation it can also handle
paints and glue it is suitable for metal
wood and plastic surfaces finally the
wire wheel is designed for particularly
persistent dirt it removes paint varnish
scale and corrosion it's suitable for
cleaning forged parts the bristles
impact the surface without grinding or
polishing it
guripa woodworking machines are
dangerous and can cause injury even if
you're very careful this is because the
saw
sometimes exerts too much force on the
workpiece it bounces aside and inertia
can push the palm of your hand right
under the blade you can use the girl
Ripper to avoid such problems when
working with wood it's produced by micro
jig it's noteworthy that it doesn't
affect the quality of work either the
person has complete control of the
situation and can perform even the most
complex and precise operations at the
same time the palms are always at a safe
distance from the blade the video even
shows a blindfolded person work with the
tool but we don't recommend trying to
repeat this trick the cost of the full
set of the Gura refers is a hundred and
thirty dollars but it can also be
purchased separately</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
