the tedious paddling while waiting for a
way
however the creators of the floating
stationed the dock decided to solve this
problem
the unusual device was created by candle
and it's a light 30 meter long floating
bridge that floats on the waves and is
always just at the right angle
using the dock is really simple the user
just sits on it while waiting for the
perfect wave as soon as the wave is
formed the bridge and hence the person
honest is always on top this position
allows the athlete to ride the wave as
simply as possible they just have to
jump off the pontoon in the most
suitable place the concept is really
very simple but it's worth paying
attention to the possible dangers when
using this floating dog
the fact is that some songs while moving
on the waves the pontoon gives the
surfer additional acceleration which can
make the surfer jump in fly a few meters
and collide with the board or another
surfer
in addition it should be noted that the
dock is fixed to the bottom of cables
and you should avoid colliding with them
too
in order not to get injured the social
way to the plat fern is 500 kilograms
that consists of plastic cubes
trident the underwater scooter trident
produced by a chinese company is
designed for diving and snorkeling to a
depth of 50 meters two screws create a
12 kilogram thrust and allow the diver
to choose between two speeds 3 point 6
or 7 km/h switching is really simple and
is done with just one finger and next to
it there's a charge indicator that
allows you to monitor the status of the
device notice that charging the 24 volts
6,000 milliamp hour lithium battery for
one-and-a-half hours will be enough to
use the skill set for an hour and the
charge indicator will let you know when
it's time to return to base the device
is equipped with child's protection and
has a socket for attaching a GoPro
camera but the most important feature of
the device is its size this under water
transport can fit in a backpack and its
mass is only 3.5 kilograms which is much
less than that of analogs on the market
another advantage of Trident that makes
it better than other similar gadgets for
scuba diving is its price the underwater
scooter comes in orange and white and
you can buy it for only $500 on
IndieGoGo
my canoe rowing is one of the most
famous summer sports however it's not
very popular and one of the reasons is
the size of the canoe the boat needs to
be stored somewhere and you'll need a
car with special mounts on the roof to
transport it but thanks to my canoe you
can forget all that my canoe is a
plastic canoe which can be disassembled
in just five minutes
or assembled in ten minutes just like
origami when folded it looks like a pair
of ordinary sports bags they're easily
placed in the trunk of a small car in
the pantry or even under the most
ordinary bed
freezy assembly a small hammer is
included
some parts such as gunwales endcaps and
stiffening ribs are made of aluminium
and plastic with a total weight of 24
kilograms the five millimeter thick
double layer polypropylene can withstand
at least 20,000 cycles of folding and
unfolding therefore the boat will be
over to serve its owners for more than
just one summer when unfolded the length
of the canoe is four and a half meters
Nik can accommodate two passengers with
a total weight of no more than 200
kilograms the folding boat slides very
easily on the water it moves quickly and
if desired its supplemented with
accessories boat crutches and stabilizer
tubes the canoe is tuv certified and the
whole warranty covers ten years the

Nimmo specialists of the company blue
have developed a portable and
inexpensive device for diving
it's main advantage is the absence of
bulky air cylinders Nemo consists of an
air supply system and a power supply
that provides immersion to a depth of up
to three meters for an hour the set
weighing four and a half kilograms is
packed in a small backpack which can be
purchased additionally basically the
devices are floating air compressor
which adjusts to the user's breath the
air supply is carried out only when it's
necessary which ensures economical
operation of these 74 watt hour power
supply
a 10-meter air hose connected to the
smart rag breathing device which is
placed in the mouth is attached to the
compressor the sensors and silicon
diaphragm inside the smart rag tracked
the drivers breathing frequency and
transmitted the information to the
compressor the latter in its turn forms
the optimal mode of air supply as much
as necessary and at the right time
according to the developers compared to
the existing similar systems Nemo spends
only 10% of the energy that's usually
needed to operate other underwater
respiratory systems this is what
provides it with a unique compactness
when underwater the diver can learn
about low battery thanks to a special
sound signal a floating ring with a
bright red flag is attached to the
compressor so that the user doesn't
damage the device while underwater the
cost of one set of Nemo is 580 dollars
