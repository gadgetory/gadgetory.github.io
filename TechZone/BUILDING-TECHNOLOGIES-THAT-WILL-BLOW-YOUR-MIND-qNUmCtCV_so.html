replace a whole team of workers laying
bricks five times faster than a person
in one day a normal Mason can lay 300 to
500 blocks while the Sam can lay up to
2,000 the robot carefully places the
material and evenly distributes the
grounds
nevertheless people's work is still
needed one builder has to place the
bricks on the conveyor and then the Sam
takes them from it the robot covers the
bricks with grout and lays them after
that another worker removes the excess
of cement the result is ideal and
long-lasting while spending less time
hun Klinger the hydraulic grippers hyung
flinger are ideal to automatically lay
paving slabs the gripper is used as
equipment for crawlers wheeled
excavators mini excavators on rubber
wheels backhoe loaders stacking machines
and multifunctional loaders
two pairs of rubber clips each equipped
with a guide roller can be placed in six
different positions the reliable welded
structure with components inside the
frame ensures durability even under
heavy loads while the hydraulic clamping
device guarantees a flat surface at the
joint of the layers
halt its power Ripper this hydraulic
electric tool is designed to collect
limestone and operates like a standard
Ripper in combination with a hammer it
can work in conjunction with any 35
tonne excavator a powerful metal element
picks up a limestone layer and breaks it
dividing it into small fragments the HPR
can also be used for crushing large
stones or removing roadbeds
column X malov irks bow system this
unique device is ideal to apply mortar
on different types of slabs including
sandstone bricks the adjustable lateral
support ensures precise alignment of the
construction sheet and proper adhesion
at the edges
a special technology makes it possible
to evenly apply the mortar thereby
obtaining an optimum layer for secure
bonding of the plates this in turn not
only guarantees accuracy at work but
also saves working time
MBC 50 thanks to Wang less than a ton
this manoeuvrable crushing bucket is
suitable for working with compact
excavators including mini excavators the
MBC 50 is especially useful in the
demolition of small buildings and also
for gardening road construction and
laying pipeline in conditions of limited
space the bucket provides high
productivity up to 10 cubic meters per
hour and a consistently high quality
result it is flexible and eco-friendly
making the entire construction process
safe for everyone since it allows you to
reuse the crushed material directly on a
construction site
the Bo d 3d printing technology has been
successfully applied in many spheres of
the human life including construction
today entire buildings are made using
this method the printer uses standard
compositions based on M 300 to 500
cement which can be purchased in any
country the printer produces layers 20
millimeters high and 50 to 70
millimeters wide thanks to the laminated
structure the walls are highly resistant
and the rooms can be built in any shape
possible most building printers perform
in similar ways a 100 square meter
building can be printed in a hundred
hours it should be noted that these
devices are suitable for printing not
only thin interior partitions but also
bearing walls
a HK 36 2,400 this impressive device is
the leader among crane trailers and is
widely used in construction thanks to
his modern masked system the crane can
easily reach a height of 36 meters and
lift up to 2,400 kilograms of load at
the same time it weighs only three and a
half tons but reliable fastenings ensure
stability and safety throughout the
entire process of operation
flight assembled architecture the six
meter flight assembled architecture
tower was designed jointly by Swiss
architects from the Graz CEO and cooler
office an Italian robotics specialist
Raffaello Dandrea it consists of 1500
blocks of polystyrene foam which are
laid out on top of each other in a
strict order with the help of
pre-programmed quadrocopters these
compact devices not only can grab
transfer and assemble blocks into a
single structure but also interact with
each other without colliding while
flying
ETH Zurich robot this wooden structure
stands out for its unusual shape and the
fact that all the parts were created
using a robot her trims of different
sizes were cut off and adjusted to each
other in order to build the construction
according to the creators thanks to
automation methods and innovative
feedback processes the manufacturing
system minimizes material waste reacting
to different materials sizes even during
the construction process
for this the robot uses special scanning
devices it's worth noting that the
construction took five weeks including
testing the finished parts and
assembling on-site
Road printing machine
paving wide roads at a rapid pace is
possible thanks to special machines that
place whole layers of ready-made stone
on the road the most famous vehicle in
the world for this kind of work is the
tiger stone produced by the Dutch firm
van qbv the first examples of this
technology began to appear on the roads
of different cities in 2009 the
self-propelled tiger stone is operated
by two or three people whose work is to
place the new clinker bricks inside the
machine under their own weight the
stones go deeper into the machine
forming a special road pattern slowly
moving forward the tiger stone spreads
the pavers on the surface as a results
it can cover up to 300 square meters of
Road per day guys it's time to recharge
your brain visit the channel brain time
there you'll find a lot of interesting
and useful facts lots of positive energy
and tons of useful information subscribe
right now we promise it's going to be
really exciting</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
