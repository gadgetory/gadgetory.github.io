motorcycle created by French designer
Ludovic Lazarus founder of Lazarus the
unique vehicle developed on the basis
that the Buell XP 12s motorcycle was
shown in July 2018 the mechanic has not
only transformed the appearance of the
motorcycle it integrated a Mini Cooper S
turbo into the engine from the original
model pay attention to the protection
mounted on the belt to ensure that the
rider's knee doesn't come into contact
with it also noticeable is the unique
single sided front suspension and the
redesigned area around the headlamps the
Buell XP 12 turbo is yet another
motorcycle by Lazar earth with an
amazing design
Yamaha motor roid at first glance it may
seem that the vehicle on the screen came
straight from a sci-fi movie about the
future
however the Yamaha motor roid is a real
vehicle moreover it was first shown to
the public during the Tokyo Motor Show
in October 2017 the Yamaha motor Ordaz a
conceptual electric motorcycle of the
future with artificial intelligence the
vehicle can interact with the owner as
if it were alive
firstly the bike is able to recognize
faces and identify the owner secondly
you can control the bike using gestures
thanks to the built-in computer vision
system for example by waving your hand
you can ask the bikes at drive up so you
all go to the parking lot
the chrome-plated cylinders you see on
the sides are just batteries because a
futuristic vehicle of course must be
environmentally friendly in 2018 this
Japanese concept won the prestigious red
dot award for its stylish unusual design
20:20 livewire in January of this year
at the Consumer Electric Show in Las
Vegas the American motorcycle
manufacturer harley-davidson finally
made a big announcement the 2020
livewire the electric motorcycle that
the company has been working on for the
past few years is now available for
pre-order it's a high-performance
motorcycle that can do naught to 100
kilometers an hour in less than three
and a half seconds the maximum speed of
this motorcycle is a hundred and
seventy-seven kilometers per hour
since it's an electrically powered
transport many were interested in the
power reserve so according to the
company it's quite impressive 175
kilometers one hour of charging from the
most ordinary outlets will provide a
power reserve of 20 kilometers the
manufacturer draws attention to the
facts that when driving there is no need
to press the clutch or change gears the
bike gives off power when turning the
handle as well as other harley-davidson
motorcycles the 2020 livewire has a
classic design including athletic
outlines for the electric motor and an
aggressive riding position
the BMW are 100 silver bullets it took a
total of seven weeks to create the
motorcycle you see on the screen this is
a BMW cafe racer based on the Torah BMW
are 100 RS the Silver Bullet was created
in a single copy by a custom car
technician named pepper Russell who runs
the xtr pepper workshop the idea of its
creation belongs to the Spanish magazine
revival of the Machine the master was
given a 1978 BMW motorcycle as well as a
variety of parts and he had to assemble
a new vehicle in less than two months
challenge accepted in June 2017 the
technicians showed this original and
really unique motorcycle
the Silver Bullet has nothing in common
with the bike it was made from the
master equipped his brainchild with a
modified frame and an aluminium body the
fork for the motorcycle came from the
BMW r9t these silences from Anna crapper
Fitch and the brakes from a Brembo
BMW landspeeder
and here's another custom bike that
exists only in a single coffee it was
assembled by technicians from the
revival cycles workshop in Texas USA the
basis for this original vehicle was the
classic BMW r107 motorcycle however in
the end only the agent remained and it
was completely restored the mechanics
equipped the vehicle with a modern
electric magneto with convenient
handling the frame was also completely
replaced the BMW landspeeder has an
elongated wheelbase and low engine
position a custom fork and an adjustable
shock absorber were also installed you
won't find another motorcycle like this
anywhere else in the world
if only because the workshop specialists
made most of the parts by hand these
include for example the steering wheel
and all the control structures the
unusual appearance is highlighted by the
custom dodger and the stainless steel
exhaust system
ARC vector last November at the
motorcycle show in Milan the startup ark
showed for the first time its unique
vector motorcycle according to the
developers it is the most technically
advanced motorcycle in the world the
bike was made of rare materials and has
a futuristic appearance the engineers
equip the vehicle with a 95 kilowatt
power unit
the arc vector accelerates up to 100
km/h in approximately 2.7 seconds
reaching a maximum speed of 240 km/h the
battery holds enough charge to cover a
distance of 270 kilometers in the city
or 190 kilometers on the expressway
especially for this motorcycle a helmet
is equipped with a projection screen and
a rear-view camera were developed a suit
that can warm the rider about vehicles
in the blind spot was also created all
these features are combined into a
single system which makes this cafe
racer unique and provides increased
dynamics and driving safety
the Nira ebike today we've already
mentioned a bike assembled in just seven
weeks which is an extremely short period
of time motorcycles that have been in
production for a long time are usually
built in a much longer period of time
nevertheless this may change soon
last November the German laboratory now
lab showed an electric motorcycle which
took only 12 weeks to build the secrets
of the high-speed Assembly lies in the
fact that all 15 components of the bike
were 3d printed then the mechanics added
the electric system consisting of a
battery and electric motor and
headlights the parts that were printed
include the Nira ebike wheels they have
a unique design while riding they
slightly change shape under the weight
of the motorcycle and rider and the
deformable parts act as shock absorbers
the length of this motorcycle is 183
centimeters the weight is 60 kilograms
unfortunately it's difficult to say when
the bike will go into mass production or
whether it will go into production
that's all right now the nearer a bike
exists in a single copy it was created
to demonstrate the abilities of modern
3d printers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
