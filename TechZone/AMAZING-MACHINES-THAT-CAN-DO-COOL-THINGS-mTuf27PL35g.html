world's most popular confectionery
products is often a fully automated
process the reason for this is the
enormous demand to satisfy this demand
people build factories with large
industrial capacity that could not exist
without specialized equipment this
Skittles factory uses a wide variety of
machines each has its own function as
you can see there are almost no people
involved in the manufacturing processes
they are only needed at the loading
stage when the product is packed in
boxes and sent to the conveyor belts at
the warehouse
however at some factories this procedure
is also performed by machines the
candies made of sugar fruit juice citric
acid and artificial flavors are covered
with layers of glaze each batch is dyed
in a separate color and then they're
mixed to fill the package with a candy
rainbow
cake decoration humankind has been
making cakes and similar products for a
very long time
traditionally they were made by hand
the decoration was considered to be a
complicated process which required skill
precision and ingenuity today everything
has changed at the factory automated
equipment performs a full cycle of cake
preparation from mixing the dough to of
course decorating the product
this is cake finishing center a piece of
equipment developed by specialists of
the Canadian company UNIFEM Systems Inc
amazingly it can decorate up to seven
cakes per minute at the same time the
quality is not affected by the high
speed because all the mechanisms of the
machine are adjusted perfectly
interestingly this model is capable of
performing a variety of functions for
example it can spread buttercream
between two pieces of cake the machine
determines the correct dosage of the
cream itself it covers the entire
surface of the cake with an even layer
of glaze in literally one second and of
course it is equipped with a variety of
icing nozzles for decorative purposes
the possibilities are limitless it is
possible to even decorate a pie
bread production it may seem surprising
but before putting a piece of dough in
the oven to make a loaf of bread you
have to do a lot of work of course
modern engineer's have managed to
develop equipment that also mates every
stage of baking it all starts with a
special mixture of yeast and flour when
you add more flour malt sugar and other
important ingredients to it you finally
get the dough but you can't put it in
the oven yet once the dough has been
processed in the mixer it is transferred
to a long conveyor belt here
mechanized rollers roll it out gradually
making the dough layer thinner until the
thickness reaches the required standard
the special discs then cut the dough
into identical strips excess dough on
the sides is removed it will then be
mixed with the dough that has yet to be
rolled out then the dough strips are cut
again to obtain identical rectangles
then another piece of equipment rolls
them into rounded pieces they will then
go into the oven the video shows an
artisan a baking line equipped with a
Rondo bot module in 2018 the system even
won an honorary Award as the best
innovation of the year pasta production
here is another piece of equipment that
also greatly simplifies and speeds up
the food production in this case it is a
pasta maker it's developed by the
Italian company sermon the model shown
in the video is the orchestra's head
according to the manufacturer it is
designed for use in small facilities as
well as large restaurants and diners
the design of the device is quite simple
the container is filled with semolina it
says the coarse purified wheat middlings
of durum wheat white flour and eggs are
also added all these ingredients are
thoroughly mixed for about 12 minutes
the perfect pasta dough should be soft
and grainy then the extruding process
begins the dough is first squeezed out
without attachments to fill the entire
space inside the extruder then the
worker chooses one of the many different
nozzles determining the shape of the
future pasta the machine you see on the
screen can be used to make for example
long length pasta like tagliolini or
spaghetti
interestingly the worker rips off each
batch of pasta manually to cut short
pasta like cannelloni a special knife is
used
note that the machine can be equipped
with an automatic pasta custom device in
this case the work becomes even easier
with it you can make macaroni in
knockety Sardi the blade has to be
changed though if you want to make penne
mushroom picking nowadays technology
allows even to pick mushrooms with
little or no human involvement which is
undoubtedly a huge process after all a
few decades ago mushrooming was a
difficult long and exhausting task the
Dutch company Vanden top mushroom
equipment manufactures this harvesting
equipment
according to its representatives it's
not just a machine that facilitates
collection and packaging it's a
fundamentally new unique method that
allows you to pick mushrooms as neatly
as possible without damaging them in the
process the work is carried out in huge
greenhouses champignons are grown here
using a special Dutch shelf technology
mushrooms are not able to produce
chlorophyll on their own so they are
grown in a specially prepared organic
environment compost when the mushrooms
are ready to be harvested a special
cutter passes through each shelf it cuts
the mushrooms right at the roots and
then transports them to the conveyor
belt
the mushrooms move along its to the
packing workshop where they are placed
in plastic containers and are sent for
washing afterwards
a worker sorts the mushrooms manually if
the mushrooms are damaged they will be
disposed of and if they're too large
they will be cut the machine then
finally cuts the mushrooms and places
them into small plastic containers from
here they go straight to the store some
mushrooms are also harvested without
being washed after packing they are
immediately sent to the shop to storage
rooms or somewhere else
robotic restaurant last May it was
reported the students at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology
and chef Daniel Boulud opened the
world's first fully robotic restaurant
it was named spice and any person at
Boston can visit the place its kitchen
is literally full of robotic equipment
you are seeing seven self-contained
units capable of preparing tasty and
healthy food when ordering the client
chooses the desired ingredients on a
special screen after that all the
selected products get into one of the
drum-like
walks where the cooking process begins
the workers only have to prepare the
products ie to slice the vegetables and
meat chefs also carefully add side
dishes to the cooked food
in this kitchen and magnetic induction
is used to heat the food eh machine as
temperature control the wok is
constantly spinning so the food won't
burn the robots also learned how to
clean themselves on their own between
different dishes the kitchen was
specially made open so that visitors
could see the miracle of robotics with
their own eyes it is said that it's the
work of robots that allows for
reasonable prices because there are
almost no paid employees in this
restaurant</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
