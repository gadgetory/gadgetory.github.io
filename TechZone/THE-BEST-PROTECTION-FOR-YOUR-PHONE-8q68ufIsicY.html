and indeed the test results were so
impressive that it seems that with the
mouse case your phone will survive any
even the most destructive procedures the
secrets of the cases durability is a
patented material known as arrow shock
developed by the manufacturer

inner parts of the rear protective panel
is made of polycarbonate while the
material for the outer part is chosen by
the user it can be carbon wood leather
or even seashell on the outsides the
cover is also finished with thermo
polyurethane butts back to arrow shock

of cells filled with air when the phone

phousi Apollo you can see right away
that the case on the screen is different
from the ones we've already shown today
the fousey apollo is suitable for people
who prefer to use something like a pouch
rather than a transparent case in our
opinion the main remarkable feature of
this case is the fact that it protects
gadgets from different kinds of damage
you usually don't even think about your
phone suffers during sunny days just
like it does during cold days when the
temperature drops to unpleasant levels
the battery is the one that suffers the
most though and it starts to lose charge
too quickly the fuji apollo protects the
phone from the cold and sun so the
battery charge is used to the usual rate
in both hot and frosty weather
the secret is that the case is made at
the same material used for sewing the
astronaut suits together it's specially
designed to protect against extreme
temperatures the chromed shell of the
pouch reflects about 90% of solar
radiation thanks to water resistant anti
sink technology the case works like a
lifejacket in water to keeping the phone
on the surface the durability provided
by the phousi apollo meets military
standards and the gadgets in the case
for withstand a fall from a height of up
to two meters it's price is $60
Crysta lusion we are all used to the
fact that the only way to protect your
phone is using a case or at least a
protective film for the display however
we have here an innovative product for
16 dollars the manufacturer of crystal
ocean will sell you a cloth
it will protect your phone using a
liquid glass which has already been
absorbed by it all you have to do to
protect your gadget is wipe the clean
surface of the gadget with the cloth and
then give the glass an hour to adapt
after that the surface of the gadget
will be protected by an ultra-thin layer
that protects the gadget from water dirt
as well as from mechanical impact
the main advantage of crystal ocean
liquid glass is its versatility and can
be applied to any device whether it's a
phone tablets laptop screen or TV that
is you can save time by not having to
look for a protection system that will
fit your gadget model interestingly the
same protection can be used for glasses
or any other similar surface other
advantages of this product are its
absolute transparency the protection of
the display under the liquid glass from
the accumulation of bacteria and of
course not having awful bubbles formed
when you use a protective film
Protection Pro have you ever wondered
which device protections are used on
NASA space stations or how they cover
the blades of helicopters to protect
them from minor damage and extend their
service life the answer to this question
is a film made of high-tech and ultra
strength polymer this material is chosen
by specialists from the American company
matakohe to create a protective film
known as protection Pro is less than two
millimeters thick that is it doesn't
affect the sensitivity of the screen
the transparent elastic film can be
applied in just a few minutes and then
immediately begins to protect it meaning
you won't have to wait for it to work
protection Pro protects gadgets from
water micro particles of dust scratches
ultraviolet light and greasy fingers the
film provides a strong grip in the palm
of your hand so the smartphone won't
accidentally slip out
the phony coats to see this case which
provides your smartphone with optimal
protection you need to look closely for
a while that's because the film after
being applied to the surface is like a
stronger ultra-thin transparent second
skin the phone coat has two very
important properties it doesn't break in
case of damage like a standard case and
has the ability to repair the damage
itself
the phone code cost $18 and for this
money that buyer receives two films one
for each side this way they will provide
360 degree protection that is the
integrity of the screen the edges as
well as the corners of the phone which
usually get damaged during a fall will
be guaranteed see how it works if the
surface is damaged and some scratches
appear just heat the film to make them
disappear
to hate it you can use the most common
hair dryer

only two millimeters thick nevertheless

hammer blow or the impact of a grinder</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
