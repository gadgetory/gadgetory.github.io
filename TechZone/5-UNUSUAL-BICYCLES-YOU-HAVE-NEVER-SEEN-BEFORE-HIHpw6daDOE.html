denne bike a few years ago Australian
company Teague presented its design
project for the Oregon Manifest
competition open to win a prize before
designing it the company's engineers
wondered how to inspire a huge number of
people to switch from cars to bicycles
the result of their thoughts as well as
many years of work was the innovative
smart I so called Zdenek it has a huge
number of functions that make it
different from other smart bikes first
of all pay attention to the on-board
computer which is able to measure
resistance and automatically switch
gears depending on the pressure the
cyclist puts on the pedals not to
mention the removable electric motor
which in a matter of seconds turns a
traditional bike into an electric one
thus at any time if the cyclist gets
tired he or she can activate the motor
and continue riding without any extra
effort
the handlebar has a very interesting
design with the flick of the wrist it
turns into a bicycle lock it not only
securely fixes the bike in place but
also makes it impossible for the thief
to ride the bike it's noteworthy that
the bike has a light sensor that
measures the level of light around and
automatically adjusts the brightness of
the headlights
in addition Danny is equipped with very
unusual fenders made of rubber bristles
they remove water from the wheel while
driving in humid weather protecting the
cyclist for splashing
twice achill for many people around the
world a bicycle is not just a means of
transportation it's a way to keep
yourself in good physical shape
eliminating the need to go to the gym
very often however although the bike
provides physical exercise it doesn't
stimulate all of your body
you only train the lower part while the
arms and the torso remain quite relaxed
here we have the twice the call a
bicycle that allows you to work out the
muscles of the arms and upper body while
driving its main feature is the presence
of two chains which makes it possible
for you to use the bike in three
different ways
the bicycle may be set in motion in the
traditional way using our legs the
second mode is when the handle virus's
for driving that is the load on the legs
is reduced while the back the chest the
ABS then of course the arms are working
but the third mode combines all that and
both arms and Loucks works to maintain
iya sleep
the tricycle is designed in such a way
that the design of the handlebar changes
from the traditional to the rotating
mode in just a few seconds pay attention
to the support made of soft material it
provides body support and protects the
cyclist from direct contact with the
front chain thus that's why circle is an
amazing and effective exercise equipment
that you can use even outside enjoying
the surroundings while exercising the
bike is already on sale and you can buy
it for $1,400
ElliptiGO
here is the first elliptical bike in the
world it was designed by professional
athletes to become the perfect device
for mixed workouts using a lip to go
allows you to train as if you are
simultaneously running riding a bicycle
and exercising on an elliptical trainer
surprisingly that allows you to burn 33%
more calories than riding a traditional
bike ElliptiGO was originally designed
to help runners who have chronic
injuries the fact is that the unique
design of this bike significantly
reduces the load and the harmful effects
on the joints
today ElliptiGO can be bought by anyone
it wants to get a fundamentally new
experience of training in the open air
and although this vehicle is primarily a
bicycle it doesn't have a seat when
riding instead of pedaling the user
alternately presses on the platform for
the feet the thanks to this the bike
moves forward ElliptiGO is convenient
people quickly adapt to its design and
balance perfectly it's noteworthy that
the rider independently chooses the
range of movements of the platforms that
is the intensity of the training may be
different the cost of the ElliptiGO
depends on the model ranging from 800 to
$3500
flash the manufacturers of the bike that
you see on the screen initially set out
to create a vehicle that would provide
the optimal balance between freedom and
safety while riding and it just so
happened they eventually created one of
the most advanced bikes in the world the
flash bike is equipped with an electric
motor and a rechargeable battery it has
a capacity of 500 watts and allows you
to travel up to 80 kilometers on a
single charge
it's maximum speed of movement is 28
km/h the road can be a dangerous place
for a cyclist so flash was equipped with
turn signals lights that can be seen
from any angle as well as LED headlights
interestingly the bike is sensitive to
movement if it's left somewhere on the
street in the defensive mode it's almost
impossible to steal it when attempting
to take it the bike hits the intruder
with a not so dangerous but sensible
charge of electricity while the lights
turn on and the bike sends a warning
signal to the end or smartphone the
built-in GPS module is an advantage and
allows you to always be aware of where
the bike is it's price varies from 2,000
to $2,600
self-driving bicycle Danes have become
famous throughout the world thanks to
their love for bicycles this is
undoubtedly great but this leads to more
than three hundred and fifty thousand
road accidents involving cyclists
happening every year that's why Google
experts from the Netherlands started
developing a bike which would be much
safer easier and more convenient to
write as a result they created a bag
that can independently control its own
movement
the vehicle that you see on the screen
can determine where it is located what
surrounds it and even presume what will
happen to it in a short time while
working on the project
the experts turn to engineers who are
engaged in the creation of self-driving
cars so the technology turned out to be
similar although it was provided with a
couple of functional features for
example the bicycle can be called to the
right place using a special mobile
application and also since it's able to
move completely independently you can
even work while riding the bicycle
well did you really believe that the
video of the bike that we just showed
was posted on March 31st 2016 and it
turned out to be an April Fool's joke
from Google however considering that
today there are already cars traveling
without a driver a future in which
bicycles will not need a rider is very
close bicycle technology today is
actively developing innovations concern
not only the internal device but also
external parameters experts create bikes
that have an increasingly unusual
appearance every year
do you think the bikes in the future
will really have something in common
with these pictures or will they be very
different tell us in the comments below
and be careful on the roads</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
