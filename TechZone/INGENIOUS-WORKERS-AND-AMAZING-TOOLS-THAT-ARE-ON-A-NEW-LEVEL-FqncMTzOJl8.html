workers quickly handle construction
tasks and always achieve top quality
results sometimes these people train
other builders we're going to show you a
lesson by a Construction master he
demonstrates the proper technique of
joining two drywall panels together
of course in the construction process
much larger sheets are used but in this
case to simplify the demonstration he
chose small ones during the work the
master uses a sharp trowel putty and
paper tape the first step is to fill the
container with putty it should be noted
that it must have a sufficiently thick
consistency the party is then applied
directly to the joint the master moves
the tool from top to bottom so that the
layer is not too wide the material is
applied in a thick layer and distributes
it evenly in a horizontal movement
during the working process the master
makes sure that no excess mixture
remains on the trowel if it dries it
will cause problems when applying
finally it's time to apply the paper
tape that pays there's moistens to
improve the addition of the materials
from the sensor to the edge the master
presses the tape with the trowel to make
it stick as firmly as possible
now all that remains is to let the scene
dry overnight and apply another layer of
putty on top
roof cleaning here's a team of
professionals who do the difficult and
dangerous job of cleaning roofs in a
fast and efficient way the key to the
success of these workers is the
interesting choice of cleaning tools all
operations are performed with a water
gun the sprays water under pressure in
professional circles the operation is
known as pressure washing generally
speaking this method makes it possible
to remove the most problematic
impurities such as lime rust certain
resin the high-pressure jet can even
remove a layer of paint from the surface
in our case however the Masters use
water and a relatively low pressure of
nearly 34 mega Pascal's careful
treatments at the surface leaves no
traces of dust dirt or vegetation the
advantages of this cleaning method are
also the respect for the environment
since it uses plain water without
chemical additives high speed and ease
of use are other important features
Foundation insulation polyurethane foam
is a foamy porous plastic that has
optimal insulating properties it fits
tightly to the surface and doesn't need
to be fixed
additionally the treated surface is
smooth and seamless when the master
sprays polyurethane foam on the walls
surface the material expands filling
absolutely all cracks and gaps in adea's
firmly to the surface blocking the wind
as well as you can see the application
procedure is simple and fast the masters
choose polyurethane foam as an
insulating material also because it has
a high resistant to heat loss and
provides excellent acoustic insulation
by the way there are two types of
polyurethane foam open cell and closed
cell polyurethane foam in this case the
most expensive but most efficient option
is used the open cell material is
elastic while the closed cell material
is more rigid in other words the
procedures seen on the screen increases
the stiffness of the design this type of
material is ideal for external thermal
insulation as it does not absorb
moisture
flooring installation now we'll show you
how ingenious workers quickly lay the
floor on the terrace special boards and
adjustable supports are used for this
purpose in most cases this method is
chosen when it's necessary to level the
surfaces of different heights this
patented solution is applied even when
it's necessary to lay the floor on an
unprepared surface or as in our case if
you need to raise the terrace to the
required level here the new construction
is installed over an existing tiled
floor as you can see the supports are
made of plastic this material was not
chosen randomly the fact is that these
supports are the most practical solution
compared to metal and wood supports this
is because they don't rot they're not
affected by moisture and aren't prone to
corrosion the talents of the workers is
proven by the use of a technology that
accelerates installation three to four
times in addition the construction can
be disassembled and reassembled at any
time cables and pipes can be easily
placed under the terrace deck as well
vinyl flooring installation the choice
of finishing materials for the interior
of the house must be just as careful as
the choice of materials for exterior
decoration one option that is
aesthetically pleasing and has excellent
performance is vinyl flooring or as it's
also known PVC tiles it's the material
used in this video
this high quality floor covering which
looks like natural wood is nice and warm
to the touch an interesting feature of
the material is the top layer of
protection thanks to which the panels
keep their integrity and attractive
appearance over time there are several
ways to install the flooring in this
case tiles with the passing Set fixing
system were chosen so that a simpler
installation method could be used but
first the master lays a special subfloor
it has soundproofing properties and
retains the heat the fixing system we
mentioned consists of protrusions and
grooves at the edges of the tiles in
this way the master only fixes the new
parts of the floor to the already
installed ones when the protrude whants
enters the groove you hear a distinctive
click therefore the master knows that
the floor elements are firmly fixed to
each other
punching and cutting of metal the manual
production of complex metal parts is
possible but difficult and
time-consuming it is much easier and
more efficient to use specialized
equipment such as the one that you see
on the screen to produce the work pieces
this is the MX 700 and hydraulic sphere
by the Spanish company now gazer it's a
hydraulic punching machine capable of
pressing metal that a force of more than
70 tons
a series of interesting structural
features such as that wide workshop and
a long stroke length give versatility to
the tool it handles a wide variety of
tasks - for example that makes holes
bends cuts and more the machine can work
with sheets strips tubes - L&amp;amp;U profiles
even the holes made by the machine can
have different shapes they can be round
square or oval the work tool changes in
as little as 30 seconds - therefore the
use of these presses significantly
increases productivity
hey stop being lazy it's time to use
that brain Eeyore's welcome to brain
time incredible facts from the past the
present and even the future the power of
nature and wild animals amazing facts
and unsolved mysteries you'll find all
this and much more hair subscribe now
