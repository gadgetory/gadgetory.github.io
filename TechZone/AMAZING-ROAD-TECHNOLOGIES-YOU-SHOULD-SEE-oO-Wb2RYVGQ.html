technology of the future what way allows
you to produce electricity from sunlight
without taking up excess space panels
that capture the sun's rays are mounted
directly into the roadway they're
special construction allows to generate
enough electricity to provide all local
buildings and facilities with it when
manufacturing this equipment the company
coalesce group thought about the fact
that on average roads are occupied by
cars only 10% at the time in addition
research has shown that by 2050 global
demand for electricity will double
compared to today solar panels what way
according to the manufacturer are able
to solve this problem approximately 20
square meters of panels with 1,000 sunny
hours per year is enough to power a
whole house with electricity it's
noteworthy that for the installation of
the panels it's not necessary to break
the integrity of the asphalt surface
they're simply placed on top are durable
and provide optimum tire grip
ETI rolling guardrail barrier in the
case of a car accident the main danger
for the driver is driving off the
roadway especially dangerous are those
accidents when roads are located on a
hill near water or in a mountainous area
to reduce the number of accidents with a
fatal outcome the special road barriers
ETI
with rotating barrels were developed
they convert impact energy into
rotational energy of the barrel while
driving the vehicle to the side
preventing it from driving off they have
a huge margin of strength and elasticity
so as to not collapse even when hitting
a large car such as a truck it consists
of individual sections that can be
replaced this reduces the cost of repair
work barriers are equipped with a
reflective film as well to increase the
safety of driving at night
plastic roads plastic garbage is a
serious problem for the environment as
it decomposes from five hundred to a
thousand years and we produce more than
three hundred and ten million tons of it
a year some companies are actively
working on ideas for some use of plastic
waste so these plastic roads were
invented in addition to environmental
benefits they also have another
advantage significantly better
performance compared to conventional
asphalt roads plastic is a material
resistant to corrosion and atmospheric
phenomena it operates in the range from
minus 40 to plus 80 degrees Celsius on
the outside such roads don't differ much
from asphalt ones for their production
crushed stone and bitumen substances are
also used
however recycled plastic is added to the
final composition plastic roads serve
three times longer than asphalt and
there's 70% faster to place and four
times lighter
no a cube box wall the technology that
you see on the screen allows you to
provide better and effective protection
against flooding using bags of sand is a
relic from the past so they were
replaced by no aq barriers they are
mobile and can be reused the design of
barriers is such that they instantly
fixed on the ground by their own weight
and also by the weight of water their
ways has approximately 1% of the weight
of a bag of sand thus they are installed
easily quickly and without extra effort
the 50 centimeter high barrier has a
weight of not more than five and a half
kilograms per one running meter the
manufacturer guarantees a hundred
percent efficiency the main advantage of
no aq barriers is that the more people
can participate in the construction of a
dam against flooding this greatly speeds
up the installation and a sutas size.if
moment can change the critical situation
GRT wet lock dust which floats around in
a large number of working places such as
mines
quarry's yards and farms poses a serious
threat to human and animal health his
special composition called GRT wet lock
allows to reduce the amount of flying
dusts almost completely it is a
synthetic dust collecting products that
can cope with even a large amounts of
contamination ecologically safe it is an
odorless liquid it is non-toxic
resistant to fire and does not have
volatile properties absolutely safe for
people animals of plants and also
resistant to sunlight and water it is
applied quickly and easily with the help
of a special sprinkler suitable for a
wide range of surfaces such as gravel
sand clay and limestone it doesn't
interfere with the work as well
immediately after processing you can
walk and ride on the surface
GRT enviro binder this is another
substance that splashes onto the ground
this time it's a unique product for
preventing erosion called enviro binder
penetrating into layers of loose
granular soil it's a deer's to it
forming a strong waterproof surface
after it dries it's used in places where
soil erosion is unacceptable and applied
with special equipment or by manual
spraying it's noteworthy that the
substance is eco-friendly and non toxic
and doesn't interfere with the growth of
plants one spray is enough for a period
of six months but in some situations the
substance works up to 24 months
Road line marking machine the company
Hofmann is engaged in the production of
machines designed to accelerate and
simplify the application of road
markings their compact equipment of the
series h 33 has a high capacity it can
work on almost any road as it overcomes
even the ascent it works with
thermoplastic sprayed thermoplastic and
cold paints and the capacity of the tank
is 600 Lisa's the maximum range of work
is 5 meters the machine is equipped with
a width fixer to apply perfectly even
strips even at high speed
Sirocco roads drier rain and snow are
the main enemies of roadworks especially
when it comes to markup to not postpone
the work and not delay it due to
unpredictability of the weather machines
like Scirocco road Rio were invented it
allows you to instantly dry the roadway
preparing it for paint application the
drying speed is from three to six
kilometers per hour depending on the
road and weather conditions it produces
a hundred cubic meters of air per minute
and it's temperature is set manually and
can range from 350 to 550 degrees
Celsius it works on standard automotive
fuel and as a long service life it
allows to carry out road marking at any
time of the year and at any humidity at
the same time the quality of the
finished mark-up is not inferior to that
which was supplied in dry weather
three M stomach this is a special tape
designed to improve the safety of
temporary work areas three Amstel mark
reacts to the change in pressure and
therefore to attach it to the road you
don't need to use additional adhesives
it's applied quickly and also quickly
removed leaving no traces it doesn't
damage the road surface thus it's
possible to quickly mark different areas
during road repair work and the tapes
will be held in any weather until
they're removed manually the tape is
applied at a temperature of 15 degrees
Celsius and is suitable for places with
high traffic as it has outstanding wear
resistance available in white and yellow
colors these tapes are noticeable from
afar and give motorists a clearer
understanding of where roadworks are
being conducted it can also be used as
an alternative to road markings guys
it's time to recharge your brain this is
the channel brain time there you'll find
a lot of interesting and useful facts
lots of positive energy and tons of
useful information subscribe right now
we promise it's going to be really
exciting</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
