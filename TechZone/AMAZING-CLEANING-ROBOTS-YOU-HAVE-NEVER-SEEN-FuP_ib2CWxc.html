pressurized water for cleaning surfaces
is not new however such equipment for
cleaning inaccessible places like
sloping roofs appeared relatively
recently removing dirt rust moss and
vegetation as a roofs is a long
laborious and sometimes very dangerous
process after all you have to climb
really high
the tiles can be slippery unstable and
it's very easy to slip and fall down
Aquajet greatly simplifies the procedure
allowing you to achieve perfect
cleanliness as soon as possible and most
importantly it's absolutely safe to use
it's usually quite difficult to remove
moss and lichen from the roofing tiles
as they penetrate deep into the surface
structure however the Aquajet can easily
remove any stubborn soiling on top of
that this equipment copes with everyday
problems like dirt and dust
despite the fact that Aquajet uses a
large amount of water it's impossible to
flood the garden or the yard a special
pipe is attached to the roof drain to
collect all the dirty water on the
surface as well as particles of dirt the
degree of water pressure is regulated so
that a variety of soiling can be cleaned
the equipment is controlled by a person
standing at the very top of the roof all
the user needs to do is move the Aquajet
up and down the roof using the water
pipe
pressure Joe SPX 3000 here is a washing
device which according to the
manufacturer is the absolute bestseller
in the United States and occupies the
first place at the market pressure Joe
by son Joe can perform a smart cleaning
of any surface the equipment removes
dirt from the surface with a stream of
water whose power is a hundred and forty
two kilogram per centimeter squared this
is enough to eliminate almost any dirt
even on difficult surfaces
it's noteworthy that despite its power
and efficiency the SPX 3,000 years is
only six point six liters of water per
minute
this means that cleaning is not only
fast and efficient but also economical

pressure Joe doesn't use gas Bert's
electricity to function which means that
it's absolutely environmentally friendly
the user has to make the minimal effort
to clean the surface all you need to do
to start cleaning is to connect the
high-pressure device to the hose with
water and press the button for more
efficient cleaning there is a special
tank for detergent you can use different
agents depending on the surface thus
with the help of a single device you can
clean the yard the house the furniture
and even a car the pressure is regulated
by replaceable nozzles which allow you
to clean even hard-to-reach places the
pressure Joe SPX 3000 will deal with
soiling such as rust mold grease oil tar
or dirt you can buy it for a hundred and
fifty dollars
robot 198 engineers and designers around
the world are working hard to launch to
the market more automated equipment for
cleaning houses and apartments robotic
vacuum cleaners have more or less
managed to become an everyday item and
they won't surprise anyone but window
cleaning robots are definitely something
new here we have the ho bot won 9-8 a
robot designed to leave any window
perfectly clean the robot is attached to
the surface of the window after which it
moves up down and sideways the special
design allows the robots to prevent
water leakage so there would be no
stains on the surface of the window
after cleaning it's noteworthy that the
ho BOTS won 9-8 can be used for a
variety of surfaces it easily cleans
even glass with protective or tinted
coating

used to clean glass surfaces such as
tables or showers it's suitable for
cleaning walls floors countertops tiles
and even TVs the robot moves on the
surface independently but it can also be
controlled using a smartphone or remote
control the robot won 9-8 also works
almost silently one charge is enough for
20 minutes of cleaning and it's price is
450 dollars
Clym rob one-to-five cleaning houses
apartments and adjacent territories is
undoubtedly a tedious task but doable
however cleaning industrial sites where
there are tens of kilometres of various
surfaces is almost impossible without
specialized equipment fortunately some
companies produce various devices to
fight soiling as an industrial level on
the screen you see the climb Rob one two
five from the German company felt this
is an automated device with magnetic
fasteners thanks to them the massive
equipment can move even on vertical
surfaces and quickly and efficiently
clean it
the club 1 to 5 is a high-pressure water
jets robot designed for cleaning metal
surfaces it can be used on ships at the
docks as well as to clean large
industrial tanks and construction
objects
the Jiva bot solar panel maintenance
necessarily includes regularly removing
dirt and dust the fact is that the
clogging of the surface impairs its Sun
absorbing qualities making the equipment
less efficient manual washing of solar
panels is an incredibly long process
especially in places where solar panels
occupied dozens of square meters
therefore there is specialized equipment
to perform this task quickly and with
minimal effort
the jevan boss is equipped with a set of
four wide brushes that when moving clean
the surface of the solar panel across
its entire width the water supply hose
is extremely long so the brushes can
move from the car for a considerable
distance cleaning even long surfaces all
that the user needs to do in this case
is to move the brushes from one panel to
another occasionally rolling up the
water supply hose the Jiva bot removes a
wide variety of soiling from the surface
such as dust sand industrial waste
leaves suits bird droppings and even
pesticides
the brushes are made of a unique
material that doesn't leave scratches on
the surface the manufacturer claims that
the equipment is 85% faster than manual
cleaning and it also uses 80 percent
less water than other similar equipment</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
