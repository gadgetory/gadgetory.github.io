constructional was to always requires
laying bricks or blocks usually it's the
longest stage of the building process
only truly experienced and resourceful
builders know how to perform this task
fast enough you're seeing now an expert
craftsman laying a wall of foam concrete
blocks look at this improvised device a
few boards and a flat trowel create a
tool to distribute the binder evenly if
desired these tools can be purchased in
specialized stores however in this case
the Builder has come up with his own way
of assembling the wall this tool
guarantees a more precise work the
mortar is distributed in an optimal thin
layer which also makes this method more
cost-effective and of course the work is
done much faster the foreman doesn't
waste time manually spreading the mortar
all he has to do is fill the tool with
the mortar and move it
building a face wall fiberglass mesh is
a common building material used to
reinforce a variety of surfaces in this
case it's placed between hollow clay
flocks v+ system is a device developed
by the German companies I convert
cluster barren
it allows you to lay fiberglass mesh
much faster than using the traditional
method notes that a thin layer of mortar
is placed on the surface along with the
mesh once the layer has been processed
with the tool the workers can lay a new
layer of blocks thanks to the wheels at
the bottom of the unit the V+ systems
speed of operation is equal to the
walking speed of a person for efficient
operation you just need to place the
rolled fiberglass mesh in the device and
then filled the tank from time to time
smoothing out a wall if you are a
longtime viewer of our videos you
probably know how difficult and
time-consuming it is to plaster a wall
to achieve a smooth surface
that's probably why Chinese company
cheapo machinery has developed a device
that can handle this difficult task on
its own this is the true po8 rendering
machine it is equipped with a special
tray where you place rendering mortar in
large quantities the nozzle fits tightly
against the wall evenly distributing the
mortar a section of the wall is
processed from the floor to the ceiling
in one operating cycle which takes about
40 seconds
the resulting surface is perfectly flat
and smooth the use of such equipment on
the construction site increases
productivity by approximately seven
times the quality of the work improves
as well because machines unlike humans
make fewer mistakes the two po8 allows
you to even out up to 70 square meters
of wall per hour the thickness of the
mortar is also adjustable the working
width is 1 meter producing mosaics
Everstone has established itself as one
of the world's leading manufacturers of
glass mosaics and that's not surprising
because making each tile is a long
complex and meticulous job
the video shows experts from a glass
mosaic Factory at work in total about
800 employees work in this facility in
an area of 25,000 square meters a huge
part of the tile making work is done
manually the workers have to choose the
right materials measure each piece and
make cuts which is a really delicate
process
the patterns on glass are applied by a
machine performing water jet cutting
using a mixture of water and an abrasive
substance once the glass has been
processed in the furnace the pieces are
placed in the molds by hand to ensure
that each element has a perfect shape
and a matching color the results as a
high quality very beautiful cast mosaic
used to finish surfaces in hotels
airports and luxury homes all over the
world
installing flexible pavements all
construction work must be carried out by
professionals using certified equipment
this guarantees a perfect results when
it comes to complex projects such as
installing and flexible pavements the
work begins with the preparation of the
surface parts of the soil is removed and
the remains are carefully compacted to
avoid hollows inside in this case the
pavement will be surrounded by a
concrete curb it is very important to
use guides during the paving process to
guarantee an even surface crushed stone
is laid under the paving slabs to be
used as a base it is evenly distributed
over the surface in thick layers from 75
to 100 millimetres a plate compactor is
used for compressing the material
the next layer is made of sand here two
guides and measurements are crucial if
the sand is laid even slightly unevenly
the defect will be obvious when the
slabs are laid of course
this stage of work is completed by
compacting and evening out the layer
finally the slabs are installed the
workers check that the structure is
leveled at the beginning of the work in
case of an error it will be easier to
fix if only a few slabs have been
installed elements at the edges are
smaller in this case the boards are cut
with a diamond saw
finally the joints between the tiles are
filled with sand the plate compactor is
used again for this purpose the result
is an aesthetically pleasing durable
surface that will last for years to come
wall installation according to research
40% of the heater leaves the room
through the outer walls this means that
the quality of the thermal insulation
will define the level of comforts of the
residence it's important to select high
quality building materials and of course
you should trust such an important stage
of the construction process to
professionals insulating the wall in a
proper way will be several times cheaper
than fixing a mistake when the building
is already finished
the workers perform the procedure in
several steps first they prepare the
surface of the law applying a coat of
primer to it then a metal framework is
attached to the wall on which the
insulating material is then installed
this step should be done very carefully
it's important to fasten each metal
strip evenly next the adhesive is used
to attach the styrofoam panels this
layer contributes to the structures
resistance to water and ice in order for
the panel to be securely attached to the
wall the adhesive must cover at least
40% of its surface in this case the
softness of the material is an advantage
because you can simply cut out the
excess of the material with a knife
in order to achieve even better
installation the joints are filled with
special foam 12 hours after the panels
have been installed after hardening the
excess is also cut with a knife corners
near doors and windows are reinforced
with fiberglass mesh protecting the
surface from cracks caused by the
natural movement of the structure the
workers have also reinforced the corners
of the building protecting them against
physical impact at this stage the
thermal insulation of the building is
completed</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
