amounts of useful space in any room in
modern houses where every square inch is
precious almost every piece of furniture
performs two or more functions the
stairs are an exception but there is a
way to change that these are stairs with
a side use for storage it's noteworthy
that the space of the stairs is enough
to place inside a few large roomy
compartments
and here's another useful way to use the
space at the stairs the boxes are
mounted so that they're pulled right
from the stairs they are less roomy but
there's more compartments to store
things interestingly there's a way to
fit a large closet into the stairs
however in this case the stairs are not
pullout but the whole system is lifted
in this case it consists of three steps
the easiest and most accessible way to
hide the entrance to the room from
prying eyes is to disguise it as some
piece of furniture this is a secret room
with a wardrobe door
it's noteworthy that this door is a
great advantage it not only looks like a
bookcase but it works as one as well by
the way inside the secret room there's a
hidden compartment for storage it's
impossible to see it from a side because
it looks like as parts of a brick wall
here is another bookcase working as a
secret door the owner of the house made
it with his own hands the secret room is
now used as a playroom for children
according to him this door not only
looks interesting it also saves space in
the hole as it doesn't have a swing
design
the bookcase is mounted on special rails
making moving it very easy so even a
child can do it
even though dining tables are an
irreplaceable elements in any house it's
used only a tiny amount of time a day
therefore modern manufacturers of
kitchen furniture are often often to
integrate the dining table into the
kitchen cupboard thus it's possible to
pull it out several times a day when
necessary at any other time the table
looks as part of a cupboard leaving the
room spacious and airy
the design of the dining table built in
a wardrobe or cupboard can be different
some have a foldable design
for example the table that you see on
the screen is pushed aside the process
of assembling adi assembling takes only
a few seconds and that's definitely an
advantage
japanese manufacturers produce the most
technologically advanced furniture in
the world
for example they created this garden or
patio table which appears directly from
the ground
this design significantly save space and
also protects the table from the adverse
effects of weather can different
what looks like a giant rubik's cube is
actually a cabinet with a huge number of
compartments for storing important
things
the piece of furniture stands out for
its bold design and striking capacity it
has hidden lockers of different sizes
inside and even a slot for charging
gadgets the cabinet that you see on the
screen is extremely practical and roomy
thanks to a special design unlike other
furniture it uses all the space from the
floor to the ceiling and here's another
piece of furniture that has much greater
capacity than it might seem at first
glance
the woods square consists of several
multi-component blocks which can
function as a coffee table or a seat at
the same time in any moment the owner
can pull out the moving parts and flip
it to open the compartment for storage
inside the coffee table as a socket that
can be used for charging gadgets also
there's a chess board aa retractable
lamp a compartment for storing wine
glasses snacks and even magazines
the kitchen that you see on the screen
demonstrates the ideal use of space and
it has a huge number of technical
modifications
for example the kitchen island as a
built-in mounted television that rotates
360 degrees
another TV is mounted in a wall hanging
cupboard so that you can watch it while
cooking the angular space highs a coffee
machine and you can pull it out only
when it's needed kitchen appliances like
the toaster and mixer can also be stored
in the retractable compartment of the
cupboard
even the sink in the kitchen can slide
this design saves precious space on the
countertop short people and children
often face different problems in the
kitchen
trying to get something from the top
shelf may lead to broken dishes and cuts
here's a built-in folding ladder
it allows you to easily and quickly take
the pans even from the highest shelves</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
