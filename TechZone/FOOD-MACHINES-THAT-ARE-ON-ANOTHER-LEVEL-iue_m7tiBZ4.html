line is the key to the success of any
food company it's a whole system
consisting of a variety of components
we're all machines complements each
other the raw materials and then the
products move through the production
line via a special conveyor belt in this
case the equipment is filled with raw
materials for the production of bread
ingredients include water flour salt
yeast and more during the preparation
stages the wall materials passed through
an industrial mixer this machine mixes
large quantities of ingredients and also
saturates the mixture with air bubbles
the material then passes through an
extruder which converts the dough into
separate rounded pieces but the dough
cannot yet be put into the oven it has
to go through an important phase called
proofing that's why the product travels
along an especially long conveyor belt
during this stage the required
fermentation process occurs thanks to
the activity of the yeast
only after this step does the dough
finally enter the oven and become bread
he will then be cooled selected and of
course packaged
pastry just as there are lots of
different cookies cakes buns and other
baked goods
there's also a variety of different
specialized equipment to prepare them
their operation has very clear purposes
minimize human labour accelerate baking
through automation and consequently
increase production and profits today we
will show you some of these machines
let's start with the device that uses
the liquid dough's to create a product
with the right strength these are
special extruder switch squeeze the
dough through a variety of nozzles the
equipment is smarts automated and mobile
offering almost unlimited opportunities
for cookie design it can also be used to
make meringue the machine can be filled
with a variety of ingredients here for
example a layer of marzipan is laid and
here cream is placed on top of a product
the next equipment we'd like to show are
ultrasonic knives these guillotine
knives are designed for the automatic
cutting of products into slices are a
certain size the blade produces micro
vibrations for the frequency of 20 to 40
kilohertz
despite being imperceptible to the human
ear a vibration gives the knife unique
and very useful properties the device
does not squash the product when cutting
it making the cuts with the utmost care
even if there's filling inside the
product in addition the product doesn't
stick to the blade the blade remains
stationary only rotating round it's
accessed in this case only the platform
with the product moves
doughnuts the equipment you see on the
screen is designed for the final stages
of donut processing it's basically a
decoration line the procedure is
performed in two steps finished and
baked products are placed at the
beginning of the conveyor belt first
they pass through an area where one part
of the donut is covered with liquid
glaze and the donuts are turned around
so that the glazed side is on the top
the products are sprayed with sprinkles
that stick to the glaze it should be
noted that unused material is
immediately returned to the tank and can
be used in the next batch
the final parts that doe decoration line
is cooling which makes the glace harder
by the way anything can be used as
sprinkles for example chopped nuts
potato chips now we're going to show you
the production process the potatoes go
through to become Mike sells chips it
all starts with the harvesting this
process is done with special machines
the potatoes are delivered to the
factory in huge trucks and from here the
potatoes are immediately sent to the
production hall or stored in the
warehouse the production of potato chips
begins with cleaning the potatoes of
dirt and dust the potatoes are peeled in
a bunker with rough walls to obtain high
quality chips employees check and cut
particularly large potatoes in half the
automatic equipment cuts the potatoes
into slices the next step is washing the
slices to remove excess starch this is
followed by drying after this stage
these slices are processed in hot oil
now they are tasty and crunchy but the
production is not yet finished special
machines then sprinkle the product with
spices
and the last stage is packaging
apples it is hard to imagine that even
fruit goes through several industrial
processes before ending up in
supermarkets now you're going to find
out what these processes are it all
starts with the boxes in which the
apples come from the gardens a special
automated machine picks them up and
turns them so that the fruit ends up on
the conveyor belt
they then immediately put into a tank to
be washed modern equipment has a liquid
recirculation system so that the water
is consumed cost-effectively from here
the apples reach the roller conveyor its
role is to distribute the fruit leaving
a small distance between them by the way
the same conveyor also serves as an
inspection table where the worker takes
out the damaged fruits a special food
detergent is sprayed on top of the free
to remove harmful substances and dirt
then you can wash the apples pass under
a special dryer that removes excess
moisture during this thorough cleaning
the apples lose their natural protective
layer this affects its look and
expiration date to artificially restore
the protective layer a small amount of
wax is sprayed on the apples once the
apples are dried again the last stage of
production begins when a sticker is
attached to each fruit some apples are
packed in trays and boxes while others
are packed in bags and nets
I scream the full milk becomes ice cream
it goes through processes such as
filtration pasteurization and
modernization and cooling however we're
not going to focus on them we'll just
show you how this device produces ice
cream from already processed ingredients
for example this is how a layer of ice
cream is created between cookies the
employee inserts cookies stacks into the
special dispensers beforehand the
cookies are placed on the production
belt in a highly precise manner correct
positioning is also very important
because the extruder squeezes the ice
cream onto the cookies the only thing
left to do is pushing another cookie on
top the finished product that passes
through a special tunnel where it's
blown with air at minus 35 degrees
Celsius this process helps the ice cream
hardened and now it's ready to be packed
here we show you how ice cream cones are
made an automatic extruder squeezes the
filling directly into the paper cones
starting with the chocolate syrup then
the ice cream is poured into the cones
and a little more chocolate syrup is
placed on top the ice cream is then
sprinkled with nuts and covered with a
lid
hey stop being lazy it's time to use
that brain of yours welcome to brain
time incredible facts from the past the
present and even the future the power of
nature and wild animals amazing facts
and unsolved mysteries you'll find all
this and much more here
