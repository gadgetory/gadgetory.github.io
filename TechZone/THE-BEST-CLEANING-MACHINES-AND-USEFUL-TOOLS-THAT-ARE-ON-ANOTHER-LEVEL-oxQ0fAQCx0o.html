improves the living standards of the
residents of any house the only problem
is that for obvious reasons this area
has to be cleaned up more thoroughly
dirt and vegetation can make the
flooring slippery and unsafe the best
and most effective ways to clean the
surfaces around the house is using a
high-pressure cleaner like this
the modern market offers a fairly large
selection of models
the device you see on the screen has
been developed by the German company
Karcher as you see the surface is
exposed to a powerful water jet sprayed
under extremely high pressure it's so
powerful that even stubborn dirt is
removed another advantage of the Karcher
k4 is its low water consumption rate
compared to a conventional hose it
consumes 50 percent less water besides
the water doesn't fly in all directions
which is also an advantage
service worker 250 high-pressure sprayed
water is one of the most common methods
to clean surfaces it's perfect for
companies dealing with large-scale
cleaning where huge areas have to be
cleaned thoroughly and quickly the
equipment you see on the screen provides
an extremely wide range of cleaning
options this is the surface worker 250
from the German company foutch the water
is mixed with air during its operation
increasingly cleaning power of the water
jet the air also divides the jet into
individual droplets which increase the
impact force of the jet as well as the
friction of the points of contact
thus this method of cleaning allows to
get rid of corrosion paint varnish and
mold that is from all those contaminants
that most often affect buildings
another feature of the surface worker
250 is that it moves automatically and
in any direction the water jet can also
be aimed in any direction thus the
washing machine can be used to clean
even tall buildings the working tool
rises even to hard-to-reach places
brush Hiro that's all you see on the
screen looks like an expensive powerful
complicated tool designed to clean
different surfaces however although it
is really powerful it's not that
expensive and it's very easy to handle
brush Hiro is a standard hose nozzle
equipped with a rotating brush it turns
any water supply hose into an effective
cleaning tool the technology used to
create brush Hiro is patented the unique
brush rotates under the pressure for
water
this washing tool is ideal to clean
wheels
bicycles motorcycles car parts and other
equipment the compact design of the
brush allows it to penetrate even into
hard-to-reach places the manufacturer
also offers a modified 90 centimeter
brush head it additionally expands the
cleaning possibilities and allows you to
reach even remote places the price for
brush Aero starts from $60 and it
depends on the rotating brushes
configuration
dual power Pro this equipment designed
for professional carpet cleaning will
also be useful at home dual power Pro by
the British company VAX looks like a
normal vacuum cleaner however it is a
powerful and efficient carpet cleaner
that uses warm water and detergents the
user applies a minimum amount of effort
while the unit is in operation you only
need to fill the tank with clean water
in time drain the dirty water and then
refill the detergent the manufacturer of
the device highlights that it works
slower than a standard vacuum cleaner
but much more effectively first the
cleaning nozzle passes over the surface
once or twice in the washing mode then
the operator switches to the rinse mode
and passes over the treated surface
several times
the device collects all the water left
after cleaning leaving the surface dry
and clean it's noteworthy that the
machine copes with even the most
stubborn stains for this purpose a
special corrosive agent is used in this
case the operator uses a special nozzle
and sprays the cleaning solution into
the desired place it's left for 10 to 15
minutes and then the surface is clean as
usual
glass polishing machine there are a lot
of reasons why car windows may get
scratched in any case it is unpleasant
and in some cases even dangerous after
all they can block the view for the
driver
however in specialized workshops there
are people and equipment that can remove
even deep scratches however you have to
work very carefully as glass is a
fragile material a special polishing
machine is used it's also possible to
work with a drill but a cloth head but
in this case you have to carefully
monitor the temperature of the glass
high temperature causes additional
damage the principle of operation of the
polishing machine is quite simple a
special fine grain paste is applied to
the surface the removable working disk
is made of felt the disc rotates for the
speed you set manually and it can be
changed for each specific situation the
rotation creates friction between the
paste grains of the glass which erases
the top layer of the surface the
professionals work on the glass until
the surface is smooth but they work very
carefully it's important not to damage
the glass otherwise you won't see
properly through it
Skater five the last device we want to
show you today is also a powerful water
jet for cleaning the principle of
operation is similar to the device you
saw at the beginning however it is more
powerful because it's designed to clean
places with high levels of pollution
such as city streets pay attention to
the large amount of steam distributed in
all directions this is caused by the hot
water used during operation its use
allows reducing the necessary working
pressure reducing the time spent as well
as the amount of cleaning agents used
hot water even dissolves fat oil and
resin which simplifies cleaning and has
a positive effect on the final results
in addition surfaces that have been
sprayed with hot water dry out much
faster the high-temperature kills
harmful microorganisms
additionally disinfecting the surface
interestingly the company that we
already mentioned today
ouch is the one that produces this
equipment the temperature at which the
device operates reaches 98 degrees
Celsius so there is no chance for
contamination the power pressure of the
machine is 500 bar
