global concern surprisingly airplanes
can fly while being 12 kilometers above
the ground buts the most dangerous
situations are the landing and takeoff
that's why special safety services keep
a close eye on the condition of the
runways up to the point where they
determine the coefficients of grip of
the wheel at the road surface the
obtained values give comprehensive
information about the condition of the
lane the skiddo meter bv 11 is a special
equipment that allows you to determine
this very coefficient this airfield
brake cart is a measuring wheel that
rolls on the runway after the vehicle
this equipment is provided with a
hydraulic lift and a touchscreen so it
integrates better at the vehicle and
provides increased efficiency the
skidder meter bv 11 can be mounted on
any brand of pickup truck on the market
without the need to modify or alter the
vehicle remarkably the instrument can be
used at any time of year even if the
weather conditions are not too favorable
garage screen system everyone who has a
garage in their house must have thought
that the traditional design of the gate
is extremely uncomfortable the gate is
comfortable to use only if you come in
or out of the garage in a car specialist
from the American company nas Bush
Blasco have found a way to solve this
problem here is a unique system that can
replace the garage door with a normal
human friendly door the panel which is a
wall and the sliding door is mounted on
special rails
thus the owner can choose whether to
cover the garage entrance with a
traditional door or with Nas Bush Blasco
another advantage of this design is the
speed of unfolding which takes no more
than three seconds the Skiz II the
device you see on the screen can give
you a whole new skiing experience it is
fully mechanized and it pushes the
person from the back when he or she is
on the skis minimizing physical efforts
and providing a stable speed skeezy has
been assembled from a four-stroke engine
with eight horsepower and a caterpillar
threat similar to that seen on
snowmobiles the long handle on which the
control buttons are located is divided
into two handles and rests on the skiers
back
it's not worthy the thanks to its unique
construction schism can be used not only
for skiing downhill it's powerful enough
to push a man on skis over flat terrain
and even up the slope 152 kilograms is
compact enough to fit in the trunk of a
car the maximum speed up to which the
Schism can accelerate a person is for
support meters per hour it's noteworthy
that the device can be used in
conjunction with a snowboard but the
most comfortable experience can be
achieved only with skis glass rinser
glasses especially high glasses are
probably the most uncomfortable glass
wet or wash it's not that easy to clean
the surface with a sponge as the glasses
are often too narrow for your hand to
get inside if a liquid dries up in the
glass it's almost impossible to wash it
off the glass rinser as a special device
designed to quickly and efficiently
handle dirt on tall and narrow glasses
it's installed next to the sink and when
pressed it releases several powerful
water jets in different directions thus
to wash the glass you just need to put
it on the glass rinser and hold it for a
while the device can be used for cups
mugs glasses goblets and even bottles
you can buy it for one hundred and
twenty five dollars
hot tug if you want to swim in a river
lake or any other natural water body
it's not necessary to put up with the
cold of probably dirty water hot tug is
a floating jacuzzi to swim in any
natural pond where you are allowed to
swim with comforts and in clean water
the unique design of the jacuzzi allows
it to stay on the water as if it were a
small boat and it actually looks like
one at the back of the jacuzzi there's a
lever that allows you to choose the
direction of travel from the outside it
may seem that people swimming in the hot
tub float directly in the river but they
are not the design of the jacuzzi takes
clean hot water for swimming from the
water around it the hot tub frame is
made of wood that materials such as
polyester and fiberglass have also been
used the jacuzzi is a large sham
designed for simultaneous use by eight
people or so it's worth mentioning that
the water is heated by a stainless steel
wood stove which is installed on board
the cost of the hot tug is $15,000
make it fit modern people have long
forgotten the charm of walking barefoot
and even on the beach who have to wear
shoes as there's a risk to get your feet
dirty
or worse to injure them but if you
really want someone on the beaches
barefoot you can use maker fit these are
unique pants which are placed on the
naked feet on the outside make a fit
resembles the most usual in size but you
don't need shoes it's for the durable
thin and elastic pants are able to
protect the skin not only from sharp
objects but also from the fungus it's
noteworthy that the device can handle
high temperatures so you can walk on hot
sand or stones without fear in addition
the surface is designed to minimize the
risk of slipping on wet surfaces such as
tires perhaps the only drawback of naked
feet is that they are disposable you can
buy a couple of pads for $11
plenty spots more and more often in
newspapers and news sites you can find
articles about the high number of
bacteria found in hotels when renting a
room even in a decent hotel you can't be
a hundred percent sure that you'll sleep
on cleaned well washed linen cleanse bot
was created to keep people safe from
bacteria and germs it's a small portable
robot that can fit in any bag even a
small one it's designed to disinfect the
surfaces on which it moves
studies have shown that the cleanse bot
eliminates 99.9% of bacteria where it
passes to start just put it on the
surface and press the button the robot
will move around the floor the table and
even the bed on its own destroying the
bacteria the device is wireless it
charges in only four hours and can work
for three hours it's cost it's 260
dollars
shark off bathing in the ocean is the
dream of many people very often however
the risk of encountering a half stops us
shark off is a bracelet that will keep
people safe in the water according to
the developers it's like kryptonite for
sharks
shelf off is worn on the arm or the leg
thanks to the elaborate design it looks
like the most ordinary stylish accessory
the bracelets treated with a special
substance which dissolves in the water
and forms a weak electric field
it doesn't affect people but it does
affect sharks so shark off is like a
shark repellent one bracelet cost $30
and is enough for 250 hours of swimming</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
