when rooms were automatically flooded
with water in case of fire are gone now
there are systems that extinguish the
flames with the help of a special phone
they are especially useful in modern
facilities with an increased fire hazard
the video shows the testing of a
modified fire extinguishing system it's
installed in the aircraft hangar of the
NASA Armstrong Flight Research Center
the system uses high expansion foam
thanks to this feature the amounts of
water and chemicals in the composition
is reduced the foam is more
environmentally friendly than standard
products the difference between this
innovative foam and conventional foam is
substantial the damage caused to the
premises and to the aircraft is
significantly reduced it covers 90% of
the room in only 60 seconds after that
the expansion of the foam takes four
minutes the height of the resulting
layer reaches 90 centimeters
jet suit if you've always dreamed of
having a costume like the one Ironman
has take a look at the screen in July
2018 the British company gravity
industries began selling these flying
suits you can buy it right now if you
want and if you have four hundred and
forty-seven thousand dollars to spare
the suit is 3d printed five engines lift
the user into the air it's noteworthy
that they can run on jet fuel as well as
diesel the rated maximum speed is 90
kilometers per hour however so far the
top speed reached by the jet suit is 51
kilometers per hour the manufacturer
recommends it as the safest speed
the maximum height that you can reach
wearing this suit is three thousand six
hundred and fifty seven meters however
don't start planning a long and exciting
trip with your jet suit the fuel tank
capacity is only 15 laterz this amount
is enough for about five minutes of
flight in cold weather ten minutes the
suit weighs 27 kilograms
I three older people are often sedentary
and don't go far from home not because
they don't want to but because moving
too much causes them discomfort and even
pain American company unliving offers a
solution to this problem here is the
portable electric scooter I three it was
specifically designed to meet the needs
of the elderly when folded the scooter
is compact enough to fit in the trunk of
a car therefore it will be easy to store
at home too despite its fairly low
weight only 24 kilograms its maximum
payload is 136 kilograms the user
travels in a comfortable sitting
position there's no need to pedal or
push other advantages include mobility
and easy handling the scooter rides
softly and is stable even when driving
on an uneven surface the maximum speed
is six and a half kilometers per hour
while the minimum is three kilometers
per hour one battery charge lasts for up
to twenty two and a half kilometers of
travel you can buy the i3 for twenty
eight hundred and fifty dollars
dactyl the video you see on the screen
now was shared last july by open AI a
non-profit research company from san
francisco researchers studying and
developing the capabilities of
artificial intelligence have developed a
robotic arm amazingly it's able to
manipulate objects as easily as humans
do we're used to seeing demonstrations
of what robotic body parts and all sorts
of exoskeletons can do the problem is
that they all lack fine motor skills but
the dactyl project does not have this
disadvantage experts were able to create
a dexterous hand which will be the envy
of any modern robot such sensational
abilities were achieved thanks to a
self-learning algorithm the engineers
made the hand practice in a simulated
environment for several days the
computer model of the mechanized fingers
move the cube to solve the object
reorientation task in this way
scientists were able to significantly
speed up the learning process
simultaneously several hands were
practicing in a simulated environment
each time a new task was set before the
robotic hand changing the initial
parameters such as size weights material
and smoothness of the cube surface as
soon as the robot fulfilled a task it
received a new one after a while the
hands were transferred from the
simulated environment to a real one it
turned out that the knowledge acquired
by the artificial intelligence was
enough to do what you see on the screen
in order for the hand to learn it was
equipped with three cameras and sensors
that read the movements of the human
fingers the algorithm processes the data
received from the cameras and then gives
the robotic hand the orders to complete
the task
electric car mover this device will be
useful for people who work in car
workshops because electric car mover
allows one person to transport even the
largest vehicles at first sight the
device looks like a standard manual
forklift used in warehouses however the
device is designed specifically for
transporting cars it works quietly
moving smoothly too so that the operator
doesn't accidentally damage the car the
device lifts the vehicle from the front
and the maximum lifting weight is 3400
kilograms
gift-wrap three thousands super every
year hundreds if not thousands of people
face a very specific holiday problem
they have to wrap their Christmas
presents carefully and beautifully but
they simply can't
here's a device which won't completely
solve the problem but at least it will
help some people the gift wrap 3000
super as a machine to automatically wrap
boxes and wrapping paper it is bulky and
expensive so you shouldn't bias if you
wants it put it in the back yard or
garage however it does wrap gifts that
can be bought in a shop and look very
neat each wrapped gift looks just like
the other there like twin brothers
amazingly the gift wrap 3000 super is
able to pack 50 boxes per minute it's
produced by the British company CPAC
Limited
Brij health fire blanket when a car is
on fire you only have a few seconds to
do something because a burning vehicle
threatens the safety of any people or
objects in the vicinity that's why it's
so important to develop systems to
eliminate the fire as soon as possible
that's why the Norwegian company Bridge
Hill AS created the fire blanket you see
on the screen the use of this innovative
tool allows you to completely extinguish
the fire in just 20 seconds not only
does it stop the fire from spreading but
it also stops the emission of smoke and
toxic substances two people will be able
to deal with the fire by just unfolding
the blanket it is stored in a compact
roll then grab the handles and cover the
car on both sides after that you can
safely pull the blanket down to the
ground
the fire is immediately extinguished
since there is no more access to oxygen
it is recommended to leave the car like
this for 20 minutes using the bridge
he'll fire extinguishing system you can
also prevent open flames from spreading
the surface absorbs up to 90% of the
heat so you can safely walk behind it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
