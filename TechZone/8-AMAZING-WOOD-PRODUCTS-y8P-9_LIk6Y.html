materials is cedar it's very popular not
only for its strength and durability but
also because of the aroma enhance during
the heating process am because of its
healing qualities a distinctive feature
of this small sauna first of all is it's
round stylish design and large panoramic
window overlooking a lake the
installation of this luxurious system is
quite complex for builders as the window
can be deformed due to heating
in addition accuracy in the calculations
is important in order to avoid the
additional work of adjusting the
circular plates to each other in order
to strengthen the saunas resistance and
prevents it from drying the creators
used metal staples similar to those that
can be seen in wooden barrels
Pizza although for many people woodcraft
is for functional objects there also an
excellent material for self-expression
as well as for creating unusual and
unexpected objects for example a wooden
pizza can be a great decoration element
in a themed restaurant or for making a
joke to your friends the designer didn't
just create a simple wooden circle with
a drawing for use various types of wood
to make an object similar to a real
pizza the round dough is made of
different fragments it's completed with
lighter materials and thin sheets of
mahogany are attached to them
it's worth noting the special cheese and
it's at the surface manually as well as
the varnish which not only protects the
wood against corrosion it also increases
the realism of the final work
hammer to create this wooden hammer wood
from two different trees were used black
walnut and ash to increase the weight of
the tool symmetrical round cavities were
made in the wooden panels held together
with blue and metal elements once the
preparation stage was completed the
holes were filled with melted metal for
a special dispenser adding a weight at
24 ounces
thus the weight of the hammer increases
significantly without the addition of
external elements that could interfere
with the working process
it is important to note that the wooden
handle is placed inside the instruments
and attached to the hammer with the help
of a special concentrated glue
despite the total absence of the usual
nails and other fasteners that guarantee
the reliability of the construction the
resistance of this hammer is guaranteed
by the compression of the wood with
special clamps
giant rubik's cube we all know this
world-famous toy
invented in 1974 by a hungarian sculptor
and architecture professor Erno Rubik

rubik's cube speed competitions a new
records are set every year
normally this mechanized cube fits in
the palm of your hand that is made of
plastic but kyle's have a lover of wood
carvings and unusual ideas decided to
change this the designer created a giant
wooden rubik's cube based on a standard
three by three by three version with 54
elements of different colors the
inventor presented his sculpture at the
town's Summer Music Festival in
Cleveland Ohio the huge cube with a
height of 7 feet is equipped with a
mobile mechanism that allows its
horizontal elements to rotate in any
direction to create the different
fragments of the cube Kyle Toth used a
multicolored plastic film while the base
was covered with black paint for
greatest similarity with the original
wine bottle another of Kyle Toth's
creations is this bottle of wine

and carved on a lathe as a base
fragments of Caribbean rosewood and
ebony were used and according to the
creator this is the 14th bottle is

is 12 inches and its circumference is
about 3 inches as the bottle is
assembled from separate segments and

flowers
Kasana
this wooden model of a Japanese katana
is inspired by the television series
iron fist and the creator's love of
martial arts the designer decided to use
ordinary wooden planks that he had left
after remodeling his house to make this
creation this however did not prevent
the result from being impressive
first with the help of online
measurements and a bandsaw
he created the basis for the future sort
according to the creator it was very
important not to forget to leave space
at the bottom of the wooden weapon to
attach the handle later after sharpening
the blade for the first time it was
necessary to create a tsuba an oval
plate similar to a sword guard to do
this a small piece of teak wood was used
which was given the proper shape in
order to not use any material other than
wood the manufacturer of the katana
decided to create the characteristic
pattern of the Japanese sword handle and
then manually combined the details of
different types of wood although this
process turned out to be a long one the
result is similar to the silk strings
with which the samurai wrapped the real
katana
in the final stage all the sword
fragments were assembled together he
placed the tsuba on the blade and then
fix the handle with a small knob on the
top
toy worm this worm shaped mechanical
wooden toy was created with the help of
several identical segments obtained by
cutting a homogeneous piece of wood the
polished parts with holes in the center
are fixed to each other by using special
rods and are driven by a wooden handle
next to the frame the simplicity of the
design allows you to create a similar
toy at home
