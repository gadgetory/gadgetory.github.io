hammer to create this wooden hammer wood
from two different trees were used black
walnut and ash to increase the weight of
the tool symmetrical round cavities were
made in the wooden panels held together
with blue and metal elements once the
preparation stage was completed the
holes were filled with melted metal for
a special dispenser adding a weight at
24 ounces
thus the weight of the hammer increases
significantly without the addition of
external elements that could interfere

handle is placed inside the instruments

of a special concentrated glue

nails and other fasteners that guarantee

necessary to create a tsuba an oval
plate similar to a sword guard to do
this a small piece of teak wood was used
which was given the proper shape in
order to not use any material other than
wood the manufacturer of the katana
decided to create the characteristic
pattern of the Japanese sword handle and
then manually combined the details of
different types of wood although this
process turned out to be a long one the
result is similar to the silk strings
with which the samurai wrapped the real
katana

fragments were assembled together he
placed the tsuba on the blade and then
fix the handle with a small knob on the
top
