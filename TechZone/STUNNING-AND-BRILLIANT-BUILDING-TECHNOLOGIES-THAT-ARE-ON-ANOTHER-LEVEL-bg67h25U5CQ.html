a wide variety of products for wall
decoration but did you know that you
don't necessarily have to buy them
inventive craftsman can get this surface
and aesthetic complete look with a dry
mix so you just need to mix cement sand
and water in the right proportions after
that all you need to work as a roller
with a porous surface the worker simply
has to apply the mixture as if he were
applying ordinary paint to the surface
but thanks to the special roller the
surface remains course after application
if you don't want to use mortar you can
achieve the same effect with other
materials for example in this case the
worker used is the most common white
acrylic paint you have to stir it
thoroughly and then use the same
textured roller as you can see the
results is very similar the only
difference is the color
ventilated underfloor space strip
Foundation has a very characteristic
construction it is basically a
continuous strip under the building that
takes on the main load of these
supporting elements of the building at
the same time these strip rests on
foundation footing which ensures better
load distribution with this foundation
you have to choose whether to make the
under floor space closed or ventilated
when we talk about underfloor space we
mean the chamber between the foundation
strips the ventilated underfloor space
has certain advantages for example
circulating air eliminates humidity
however this construction also has
drawbacks water constantly evaporates
from the ground under the house and
rises as steam leading to damp problems
mold formation and insufficient Heat
saving in the house the problem is
particularly accused in places with high
groundwater levels the workers you see
on the screen are familiar with the
problem and they know how to deal with
it
guttered right sect 2.0 by gutta Italia
is a system of plastic modules for
ventilated underfloor space they are
installed and then covered with cement
the plastic layer protects the interior
of the house from excessive moisture
this way the house enjoys all the
advantages of a ventilated underfloor
space without any of the problems
in addition gusset right a 2.0 protects
the house from dangerous radon gas which
can be emitted by soil
Hall construction the object you see on
the screen is operated by the Czech
company a ttle according to one of the
members of the company it is one of the
largest hole builders in Europe the
company offers a variety of buildings
ranging from ten to five thousand square
meters you can choose through 78 types
and 308 variations of halls which differ
in the shape of the roof and the color
palette in a very short time the
company's employees put up impressively
large buildings the construction
materials travel tens or even hundreds
of kilometres like in this case when
they had to be transported to the
village of Krakow soft 320 kilometers
away from Prague the secrets of the
construction speed is the modularity of
the structure it consists of a large
number of huge metal arches from this
arch hall more than 30 elements were
used the arches are made of one and a
half millimeter thick metal
according to the manufacturer a ttle is
the only company that builds holes and
produces equipment for creating metal
arches the finished building is
protected from rain it's equipped with
the ventilation system doors and can
have an upper floor see these holes make
ideal storage rooms production holes
sport holes agricultural buildings and
aircraft hangars
elastic brick tile in our time interior
designers can do well whatever they want
a huge amount of finishing materials
allows them to easily and quickly
execute absolutely any ideas for example
if you want to decorate a wall with
exposed brick you can do it with an
elastic decorative brick it looks like a
flat thin regular tile after the
installation this wall is absolutely
identical to a real exposed brick wall
these tiles are made of mineral
polymeric composite the brick feels like
a decorative plaster to the touch
decorative brick finishing is done
manually
so it requires accuracy and patience
first the worker mixed say polymer
modified cement glue or glue made from
water-based acrylic polymer emulsions
the mass is applied to the wall in a
thin coat and then the brick tiles are
laid elastic decorative bricks when
compared to clinker bricks have one
significant advantage they are soft and
flexible which means that you can use a
regular knife to cut off the excess to
ensure joints are the same size the
worker places a metal strip between the
Rose
building a fire pit after a long day
everyone would like to relax by a cozy
fire crackling in the backyard you might
think that assembling of fire pits is a
long and complex task however a
resourceful craftsman you see on the
screen proves it's not anyone who has a
standard set of tools will be able to do
it the video shows two different fire
pits a rectangular one and a round one
the first one is made of stone blocks
first you have to put them on the lawn
use a shovel to mark the size of the
future structure on the ground
then the extra grass and soil are
removed and the ground is compacted the
worker ensures that the surface is flat
the pets is then filled with gravel
mixture which is moistened and compacted
again the stones are placed in three
rows the access is cut with a circular
saw and the blocks are secured together
with concrete to D civ the inside of the
fire pits is covered with fire clay
bricks now the fire pit is ready the
round structure is built in the same way
however paints and a thread are used as
a compass for marking
PVC pool liner the most popular way of
finishing a pool is to cover the base in
the ceramic tiles it's hygienic
aesthetic and convenient but has a
fairly high price in addition the
construction of even a small child paul
takes at least three months a
cost-effective and simple alternative to
tiles as a special PVC liner it allows
you to reduce the construction period by
almost half also it significantly
reduces the cost of the project once the
swimming pool is figured water it's very
difficult to distinguish this coating
from ceramic tiles especially
considering the fact that the edge of
the liner is decorated with each tile
pattern the video shows the process of
replacing an old PVC liner with a new
one when the worn-out material is
removed you see an empty concrete basin
at this stage is recommended to repair
any damage on the surface pouring cement
mixture over it then a geotextile is
laid in order to protect the coating
from abrasion finally the liner is light
it is fixed with a special fastening
strip mounted just below the pool edge
then a pump tube is placed under the
film to pump out the air first it's left
on for 20 or 30 minutes then the pool is
filled with water to a height of about
30 centimeters next the pump is removed
and it remains only to cut the openings
for water drainage and lights</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
