see on the screen can literally clean
any hard surfaces dirt is removed by a
powerful jet of water from the washer
today's market offers a wide range of
similar tools they differ in costs
appearance but most importantly power
pressure that the washer generates to
create a water jet is measured in mega
Pascal's depending on the model the
washer can have a pressure from 5 to 200
mega Pascal's the least powerful models
cope with simple impurities such as dirt
including ingrained dirt
high pressure washers are capable of
removing corrosion paintwork and mold
it's noteworthy that both horizontal and
vertical surfaces can be cleaned in
addition the nozzle is small enough to
handle dirts in hard-to-reach areas this
cleaning principle was invented in 1950
in 1984 the first prototype of a
handheld washer was developed and it
became the basis for the creation of the
tools you see on the screen today the
most powerful high pressure washers are
purchased by companies specializing in
cleaning territories however a more
compact and portable model for home use
can be purchased by anyone their price
varies from a hundred to two hundred and
fifty dollars rotor wash here is another
equipment also intended for cleaning but
this time indoors rotor wash devices are
floor washers you can use them when you
need to cope with large amounts of
cleaning on a regular basis so with the
help of rotor wash you can wash floors
and shopping malls and some of the
machines are designed specifically for
cleaning the steps of an escalator as
you can see the escalator continues to
work
the principle of operation of this
equipment is based on the opposite
rotation of two cylindrical brushes
between them is a special drum that
collects dirt and transports it to the
collection tank so rotor wash performs
mechanical cleaning the dosing unit
allows you to achieve perfect results
during cleaning by spraying clean water
or detergent solution in front of the
machine the liquid dissolves the dirt
but at the same time acts as a binding
agent this means that it's easier for
the brushes to collect the dirt into the
rotating drum rotor wash saves up to 90%
of water and chemicals when compared to
conventional planing methods according
to the developers the cost of the models
you see on the screen varies from 3500
to $4,000
steam cleaner a truly excellent cleaning
results is not just a surface that looks
clean when it comes to a house or a
place where medical and cosmetic
services are provided it is important
that the surfaces are also disinfected
in these cases the ideal tool for
cleaning is a steam cleaner there are
many different models available the
video shows a steam cleaner from the
American company to pray the principle
of operation of such equipment is quite
simple the cleaning process combines the
effects of water temperature and
mechanical impact in a special tank the
water is heated to a temperature of 115
to 155 degrees Celsius in this case 150
degrees as a result steam is produced
it's noteworthy that it has low pressure
and low humidity these are undoubtedly
advantages so that the steam cleaners
can be safely used in production and
industry as well as in the household
hot steam can penetrate between the dirt
and the surface this causes the dirts
who peel off and is then easily removed
with a vacuum cleaner or a cloth the use
of a variety of nozzles greatly expands
the list of stars that the steam cleaner
can handle the model you see on the
screen can be purchased for $700 with
its help you can wash floors grilles
tiles upholstered and leather furniture
and bathroom fittings hot steam removes
up to 99.9% of bacteria and viruses as
well
skypro every year more skyscrapers
appear all over the world for many years
the problem of their cleaning was quite
acute industrial climbers had to wash
huge glass areas manually at the same
time they were at a high altitude
putting their lives at risk
fortunately a few years ago skypro
appeared on the market it's a
professional automated cleaning system
designed specifically to wash glazed
buildings it can work at great heights -
despite its considerable cost it pays
for itself in just a year that's because
it eliminates the need to constantly
hire a team of workers for cleaning
there are two models the sky pro and the
sky pro many the video shows the work of
the second model their only difference
is their size but the way that they work
is exactly the same inside the case
there's enroller that cleans dirt from
the glass surface the washer is lowered
and raised using a winch mounted on the
roof surprisingly skypro can handle at
least 2,000 square meters of dirty glass
in one working day
Keele crap the inaccessibility to a
contaminated area doesn't mean that it
should be left unwashed all washed less
frequently
traditionally yachts boats and other
vessels are washed in a special dock by
hand wasting a huge amount of water this
requires a lot of time and money as well
if you don't do this regularly the
bottom of the hull becomes covered with
seaweed of various organisms in some
cases their layer can reach up to half a
meter which significantly reduces the
performance of the ship the keel crab is
a drone developed by Italian engineers
it's designed to finally make the
cleaning procedure quick and easy the
main advantage of this washer is that it
can work underwater
weighing only nine and a half kilograms
keel crab cleans the surface at a speed
of one and a half square meters per
minute regardless of the shape and size
of the vessel the special turbine is
powered by brushless engine creating a
vacuum thanks to its the cleaner
attaches to the surface of the hull and
is able to work even upside down the
keel crab also comes with a remote
control the washer is equipped with a
waterproof camera
thus the operator has complete control
over the cleaning process the retail
price of the device is $2,800
Bissell carpet cleaner cleaning carpets
is probably the most exhausting activity
in the household regular vacuum cleaners
only removes the top layer of dirt to
really remove dirt from all layers of
the carpets making it perfectly clean
you need to use special equipment for
example wet/dry vacuum cleaners like the
ones that you can see on the screen they
are manufactured by Bissell
it's a powerful yet easy to use tool
similar to the most common vacuum
cleaner is unique feature is its ability
to perform wet cleaning it removes
persistent dirt even in the deepest
layers of the carpet there are two
liquid containers inside the cleaner
this means that cleaning is always done
with clean water the dirty water is
drained into an additional tank the
floor remains moist after treatment
however according to the manufacturer it
only takes an hour's drive out so in
general cleaning is not uncomfortable
Bissell offers several different models
costing up to $200
