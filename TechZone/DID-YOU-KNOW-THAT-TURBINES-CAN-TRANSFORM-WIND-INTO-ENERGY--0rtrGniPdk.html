of producing electricity are disastrous
for the planets if we don't want to face
the deplorable consequences of
environmental degradation we have to
come up with alternative less harsh ways
to produce it the equipment that
produces electricity using wind power
was invented back in the 19th century
since then and has been perfected but
windmills are still impossible to use in
the city however a way to use air to
produce electricity in cities has now
been invented and has already brought
some benefits in Turkey where it was
invented and first tested
the N Load turbine does not use natural
wind to generate electricity but air
flows created by buses when they go in
opposite directions it turns out that
the air flows they produce are enough
for the turbines to revolve around their
axis at the moment the project is under
testing but about 300 turbines have
already been placed along a road in a
Turkish city it's noteworthy that if the
tests are successful such turbines can
be used throughout the city because they
have a compact design and don't take up
much space in a few years the Enlil air
turbines may well become a source of
endless renewable energy for cities
works hydro shot here is a tool that can
help you wash any items in or outside
the house using only water the works
hydro shot is a high-pressure spray gun
that connects to any source of clean
water it's noteworthy that it doesn't
have to be a pipe or a hose you can
throw the pipe of the gun into any clean
pond such as a river or a lake sprayed
water instantly washes away any dirt so
you won't feel any difference it can be
used to clean metal tiles vehicle
surfaces furniture in the yard and
garden
interestingly the works hydro SWAT will
even clean rough fabric the manufacturer
offers several models to adjust the
pressure of the water spray
thus the tool can be used not only for
cleaning but also for example for
watering plants in addition works hydro
shows has optimal portability as a
source of water you can use water
bottles so you can clean whatever you
need virtually anywhere you can buy this
Universal cleaning gun for a hundred and
twenty dollars
diluvian dry flood barrier every year
people in hundreds of places around the
world face the consequences of flooding
national services for the Prevention of
such impending disasters are doing
everything possible to protect people
and their property but this is often not
enough traditional methods of protection
are difficult to install sandbags are
heavy
building barriers takes time equipment
and people
the design you see on the screen is the
world's first portable and flexible
barrier that can be built around the
house in no time when you receive a
notice of imminent flooding every second
counts and that's why the barrier
diluvian is designed in such a way that
it's assembling takes less than half an
hour
at the same time it requires no special
equipment except for the teamwork of two
people the barrier consists of many
modules that are connected by a court
that's why it can take any shape and go
around corners diluvian was a stable
construction sue when water arrives its
precious seals the barrier to the place
so everything inside it remains dry
according to the manufacturer such
barriers cost as much as sandbags but
they have much less weight they're
easier to install and they can be used
more than once
dual-headed spray want the process of
painting walls doesn't necessarily have
to take a long time
today there are already special sprayers
that allow you to quickly apply the
paint to the surface and an even neat
layer specialist of the British company
Spray decks apparently decided that
there is no limit to perfection and
developed a new innovative sprayer that
allows you to do the job even faster its
secret is in a special nozzle that
sprays paint not with one jet as usual
but with two thanks to this design the
working width of the tool is 61
centimeters which is ideal if you need
to paint a large surface Joule head
spray wand has been designed for
large-scale commercial and residential
projects
thread road here is a device that can
greatly facilitate the process of
sourcing clean clothes after all it's
not only washing and drying after that
you still need to iron then gently fold
each piece and put it in a special place
the thread robe looks like a washing
machine drug hidden behind the cabinet
door however it's actually an innovative
invention that's ready to perform most
of the tedious work for a person all you
have to do is pull a bunch of clothes
ask the dryer and then load it into the
drum the system independently hangs
things on hooks and shelves so that
everything's in its right place
thread robe works in tandem with a
mobile app when you need to wear
something just use this application to
choose the right thing from your
wardrobe the system selects a given
thing steams it so that it's not
wrinkled and then sends it to the same
loading tank you can just take the thing
out it's ready to wear
it's noteworthy that the application has
a calendar that allows you to plan
outfits that the system prepares for the
desired day and hour it's also worth
noting that the thread robe is quite
smart it can distinguish between clean
and dirty clothes analyze the frequency
of wear and can even show the percentage
of colors in the wardrobe
the rocket traditionally cleaning a
paint roller is a long and messy process
but engineers from Green Leo's have come
up with a solution that can greatly
simplify it the device you see on the
screen is called the rocket it allows
you to clean the rollers stains with the
paint in just a couple of seconds
without even soiling your hands
according to the manufacturer it was
created by painters for painters to
finally save the workers from long and
painful cleanings for effective washing
the device uses water pressure while
intensively rotating the roller around
its axis
the Rockets is designed so that it can
be used at home the standard water
pressure in the tap is enough to power
the device
the developers highlight two main
benefits of their invention first its
environmentally friendly and secondly
its able to save money as you don't need
to throw away the roller but clean it
and use it again
according to statistics in the United
States alone people throw 650,000 used
rollers annually Matthew so the Rockets
will significantly reduce this number
you can buy it for $60</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
