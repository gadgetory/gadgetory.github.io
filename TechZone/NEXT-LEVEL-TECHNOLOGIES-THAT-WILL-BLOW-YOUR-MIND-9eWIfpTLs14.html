the screen is the engine of a
solar-powered car
the maximum speed the engine can reach
is 152 kilometers per hour
this is a brushless model designed in
Japan specifically for the sky a Stiga
racing car of the Ashiya University team
s carabane this is an invention that can
make your wildest dreams of a totally
autonomous outdoor life come true as
Kara vane is a self-sufficient home its
developers believe in the idea that
solar energy can provide people with
everything they need to make their home
systems work that's why as carabane is
able to rotate around its axis capturing
and transforming as much solar energy as
possible
curiously the house not only uses a
solar panel to generate energy but also
a retractable wind turbine as carabane
is also equipped with a system to
collect and purify rainwater once
assembled the house is seven point eight
meters long one person needs
approximately 30 minutes to install it
as carabane is a functional house with a
kitchen two bedrooms a bathroom and a
porch all installed on a mobile platform
special sensors monitor the Sun and
rotate the structure to collect as much
energy as possible
unfortunately these houses are not yet
mass-produced however you can buy a
prototype for $400,000
max gates the design of boats and other
vessels is constantly being improved
however these changes are mainly related
to speed capacity power and payload max
gates as a unique development that does
not have analogues on the market it's a
system that gives any boat new amazing
skills max gate as a landing system
equipped with special spikes when
anchoring the vessel the spikes perform
two important functions firstly they
secure the ship in place even strong
winds or tides will not move the boat
secondly they are able to pull the ship
onshore on their own and push it back
into the water when necessary the max
gate system ensures that the boat never
runs aground either in addition even
with several hundreds of kilograms of
loads the boat won't get stuck on the
shore max gate will also come in handy
when you need to dry the boat last but
not least max case allows even heavy
loads to be transferred from one boat to
another directly in the water the video
shows a car driving over to open bridges
this patented system was developed by
the American company hard drive marine
go scan spark crea form designs and
manufactures technologically-advanced
and modified 3d scanners and similar
equipment go scan spark is its latest
product released earlier this year it's
a powerful 3d scanner that aims to
increase productivity the main features
of the device are ease-of-use and high
operation speed career form specialists
have developed the device primarily for
designers and engineers this portable
tool gives them the opportunity to
digitize physical objects anywhere the
ghost can spark is equipped with four
built-in cameras provided high-speed 3d
scanning and allowing you to receive
data about the color of the object as
quickly as possible
pay attention to the ergonomic design
which allows you to conveniently hold
the scanner in any position the tool
measures a wide range of shapes and
services at different stages of product
development reducing errors
glass cutting tool if you've ever
wondered which tools are used to cut
glass it's time to find out
German company Arnold grouper
manufactures this equipment for cutting
glass tubes
although the machine is operated by one
person the productivity rate is
extremely high the glass tubes are cut
in seconds pay attention to the clean
edges of the processed product only
professional machines provide such high
quality this model is designed to work
with tubes from 80 to 150 millimeters in
diameter however it is powerful enough
to cut materials from 20 to 400
millimeters thick the cutting process
goes as follows a worker places the tube
into the roller units and presses this
against the adjustable stopper to ensure
that all pieces have the same length on
the outside the glass is cut by a
diamond disc inside the tube a burner is
placed on a long support the flame of
hydrogen or oxygen affects the slit
created by the blade causing the glass
to crack the tool is suitable for soda
glass like glass and borosilicate glass
truck unloading system traditionally
discharging large volumes of bulk solids
is a long and complex task carried out
with a large number of vehicles a few
years ago Brooks proposed a new simpler
and faster solution the system is a 23
meter lifting platform at one under the
platform a 5 meter long receiving hopper
is installed the truck is securely fixed
at the platform and then the container
placed on it is opened when the platform
is lifted the truck tilts causing the
load to fall into the hopper quickly
this method allows to unload up to 7 to
8 trucks per hour the capacity of the
hopper is enormous a hundred and seventy
cubic meters this truck unloading system
allows to unload up to 250 tons of
material per hour
Industrial vegetable peeler companies
that produce large quantities of
precooked food need really powerful and
automated equipment if every carrot had
to be peeled by hand the productivity of
any company would be very low you're
looking at an industrial vegetable
peeling machine this type of equipment
is produced by the German company head
pro the model on the screen is the up8
thousand specifically designed for
peeling oblong vegetables such as
carrots radishes zucchinis and manioc
each vegetable passes through the roller
system many times when the process is
over not a single inch of skin remains
keep in mind that human participation is
minimal the equipment picks up the
vegetables at the loading station and
pause them into the container the device
peels up to 8,000 vegetables per hour
the only condition is that the length
must exceed a hundred and sixty
millimeters the diameter of the
vegetables must be between 25 and 70
millimeters and in the process each
vegetable loses between 18 and 20
percent of its initial weight
