something new or unique after all they
were invented almost a hundred years ago
however some of them like the one you
see on the screen surprised us for the
amount of details and the quality of its
pieces this is an RC transformer robot
produced by G Aki the troopers tt six
six seven model is part of a quite
extensive line of Transformers there are
at least six different models the car
shown on the screen is an exact copy of
a famous Lamborghini the miniature is 27
centimeters long and is available in red
and green it charges in about 60 minutes
and works for up to 20 minutes the price
starts at 120 dollars
zero this toy was shown several years
ago during the annual CES exhibition in
Las Vegas which is already an
interesting fact and hints at the modern
technological components of the device
in fact according to the developers zero
is the world's first Lego type robots
that can be controlled by hand movements
unassembled the kit is simply a sets of
pieces you assemble the robots on your
own so the design and appearance may
vary depending on your skills and
imagination it should be noted that you
can also customize the robot using
objects at hand such as cardboard sheets
plastic bottles or Lego blocks the
default set includes four electric
modules and two pairs of wheels to
create several robots or one large and
powerful robot car the robot is also
equipped with a Wi-Fi module you can
configure the motors in the app keep in
mind that instead of a standard remote
control you will use a special glove
that also connects to the Wi-Fi network
to move the robots you have to move your
hand this is an unusual but interesting
and intuitive way of controlling the car
for example 4:02 move to the right you
must tilt your hands to the right the
price is 250 dollars
Oh's Oh bot when children learn the
basic subjects of school and grow a
little it's time for them to develop new
skills importance in the modern world
specialists from the Czech company
ozobot created an interesting and
unusual toy that introduces children
through programming and coding they
propose the kids to use their
imagination to create their own games
and tasks which they will then have to
solve ozobot is designed to distinguish
colors and follow lines that can be
drawn or printed the toy can move on any
smooth surface this means that you can
draw the lines even on a tablet the
developers of the mini robots have
designed it to glow with the color of
the line on which it is moving but that
is not all color combinations transform
into commands to which the robot react
for example if you draw three dots blue
red and green in a row
oh so boss after passing over them will
turn right the child can download
ready-made color schemes or create new
ones the mini robot has the ability to
remember up to 500 commands associated
with these combinations ozobot
developers also offer an app to set the
commands on the tablet
thus the mini robot will perform the
specified actions in the given order on
any surface even without the lines the
cost of the toy is 110 dollars
spero RvR here's another toy also
designed to help people learn to program
it was developed by specialists from the
American companies Sphero
the robot shown on the screen is not
their first invention the device
resembles a miniature tank the main
feature is that the users can modify and
program the RV are the user can download
the Sphero edge.you application first
the application allows you to control
the robot with the joystick secondly it
opens up possibilities to visually
program the robot it should be noted
that the infrared ports under the fronts
and rear lights allow it to communicate
with others Faro devices other
interesting features include a light
sensor a magnetometer an accelerometer
and a gyroscope they all help the robot
move in the direction you choose if
desired you can put a special plastic
cover on the toy it will add some space
for additional circuits and rotors
increasing the possibilities of the mini
tank the manufacturer offers a variety
of external devices speakers and much
more for the sparrow RvR the wide
crawler wheels give the toy optimum
maneuverability so it can move even on
the most uneven surfaces the price is
250 dollars
drift here's the world's first toy car
that behaves like a real racing car
while you're driving it the developer
Martin Mueller managed to recreate the
real driving physics with great
precision
thanks to this these toy cars will
entertain both adults and children drift
not only moves and turns but unlike
other similar toys can also drift you
can use the mobile application to
control your device another advantage of
the toy is that it doesn't need a track
or other surface specially prepared for
racing you can drive drift on the floor
on the table or on any other horizontal
surface the car is small and fits easily
in your pocket so you can take it
anywhere the manufacturer argues that
cars are just one element of a complex
system generated by the app the toy is
equipped with intelligent sensors that
for example can recognize a virtual
track so you can set the start and
finish line even if they're not
physically marked the system knows when
the car crosses them using this feature
you can arrange virtual races with
people around the world the price is 220
dollars
I bow about ten years ago Sony's first
robotic dog was discontinued it had an
unusual appearance and didn't really
look natural in 2018 the company's
specialist wrote their new creation the
name of the new dog robot is re bow
although it does not look exactly like a
real dog it is really cute i bow has
been created with new and advanced
motion technology and improved
artificial intelligence the dog uses
cloud computing to develop and form a
unique personality
I don't can learn different tricks
however to do so you will have to
download them first the robot dog
understands when you praise and scold it
thus forming behavioral patterns the toy
knows how to recognize people reacts to
orders movements and the environment to
built-in cameras in the back and front
as well as for microphones are
responsible for this perhaps the only
disadvantage of this cute little
creature is its high price $2,900
