I'm gonna be the voice in today's video
thanks for your understanding
LifeStraw you probably think water
filters are usually found in people's
kitchens but life straw is here to
change that it is a filter that can
provide access to clean potable water
wherever there is a water source
this small portable device weighs only
56 grams however this filter can purify
up to 4,000 litres of water enough for
an average person to live comfortably
for five years life straw kills 99.9% of
bacteria and parasites and filters out
micro plastics the process is almost
instantaneous
the filter cleans up to three litres of
water per minute so you can place one
end of the filter right in the river and
drink absolutely clean water from the
other end no batteries or chemicals are
needed this portable version cost $20
however the manufacturer offers a
variety of models
for example LifeStraw flex is equipped
with a bag for carrying and storing
water
external side airbag ZF develops and
supplies automotive parts to the world's
most renowned manufacturers more
recently the company has demonstrated
the first test of its new creation an
external side airbag the system works as
follows the airbag when folded is
attached to the side of the vehicle
Engineers have installed special sensors
on the bumper and side mirrors that
calculate the optimal moment to deploy
the airbag when the car is in danger
the system decides whether or not to
activate the airbag which inflates in
just a hundred and fifty milliseconds
that's the same amount of time it takes
for a person to blink for now the
technology is being tested there is no
information on the starting date of mass
production however it has already known
that the volume of the inflatable device
will vary between 280 and 400 liters so
it could be installed in any car the
developers say the technology will
protect the body of the car in the event
of a collision as well as reduce the
risk of passenger injuries in a side
crash by 40%
bionics soft arm and hand today a large
number of Engineers around the world are
working to create new smarts and
autonomous machines take robotic arms
for example you would notice the
following trend they're almost always
fast robust and work with pneumatic
systems this is because they are
designed for production aids bionics
soft arm by Festo is a new generation
robotic arm with completely different
technical characteristics
it is soft it has tactile sensors the
built-in artificial intelligence allows
the robot to work alongside a person
providing a high level of safety for the
operator bionics soft arm is basically a
robotic arm with the soft robotic palm
called Bionic soft hand a surprising
feature of the robot is that it can
perform the same movements as a person
that is it can grab hold
rotate touch and more bionics often
mostly resembles the hand of an adult
person however it does not have a
skeletal structure inside the fingers
are made of three-dimensional knitted
fabric with tactile sensors inside the
fingers are flexible thanks to pneumatic
bellows which fill the chambers with air
artificial intelligence allows the robot
to be delicate when handling objects
when the object is in hand 3d cameras
and depth sensors create a virtual copy
of the object after that the AI launches
a large number of simulations to find a
way to perform each task the hand uses
the trial-and-error method for problem
solving to perform new similar tasks the
robot uses the previously learned
manipulation algorithms in other words
the robot learns and this learning
method is very similar to a human one
kill crab anyone who works with boats
knows that cleaning them is often a
complicated expensive and slow process
it is usually done manually or with
special equipment in a special dock keel
crab is a device that greatly simplifies
the cleaning of yachts boats and vessels
it is an underwater drone created by
Italian developers for automatic hull
cleaning the drone is attached to the
surface of the boat using a vacuum the
rubber brushes in the tracks allow the
device to move in any direction and on
any uneven surface the cleaning
procedure is absolutely safe for the
boat and leaves no scratches or other
defects on the hull
the drone is remotely controlled with an
application installed on a smartphone or
tablet the drone is equipped with a
high-resolution underwater camera and is
highly maneuverable ensuring there's not
a single stain or dirty spot after
cleaning nylon bristles effectively
remove all vegetation and microorganisms
in addition research has shown that
regular use of kill crab extends the
service life of the Hall
the cleaning speed is two square meters
of surface per minute
interestingly the company's latest
development kill crabs smart can also be
used for pool cleaning the price of this
drone is $3,000
whoosh dams whether big or small are
very useful to people
however they have a negative impact on
the population of some fish species for
example they prevent salmon from moving
upstream during the breeding season
traditional ways to help fish to move
are not very effective it is difficult
and expensive to catch each fish
manually and then transport them in a
container or a truck that's why experts
at the Pacific Northwest National
Laboratory offered their own solution to
the problem the whoosh system it's a
pipe that moves fish out of the dam or
into a container for transporting the
design has already been successfully
tested the fish in the tunnel cross a
distance of up to 70 meters and rise up
to 4 meters in the process
step lift not all buildings have the
adequate structural characteristics to
install an elevator the problem is that
the cabin is usually large bulky takes
up a lot of space and is pretty
expensive step lift is an incredible
device that will help residents of small
houses forget how uncomfortable it is to
climb stairs it's a compact tool if that
takes up only 15 centimeters of space
next to the wall and is easy to install
when the person uses step lift there is
enough space on the stairs for other
people it's very easy to use you just
have to push a button a small platform
comes out of the wall the user has to
stand on it and then give the order to
move up after passing a flight of stairs
the system automatically extends another
platform for the next flight there is no
need to press the button each time it
should be noted that the system is
absolutely safe for both the user and
the people around if the platform
encounters an obstacle it stops
immediately
hey stop being lazy it's time to use
that brain eels welcome to brain time
incredible facts from the past the
present and even the future the power of
nature and wild animals amazing facts
and unsolved mysteries you'll find all
this and much more hair subscribe now
you won't regret it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
