champignons you have the opportunity to
see how mushrooms are cultivated on the
largest Dutch farm though at champignons
worldwide on an industrial scale people
use shelf technology for the cultivation
of mushrooms there's been invented in
the Netherlands since the mushrooms
don't have the ability to produce
chlorophyll independently a necessary
condition for their growth is a
specially prepared organic environment
that is compost in addition it's
important to maintain a constant
mushroom friendly climate humidity in
the room is kept at around 70 to 95
percent they can't be exposed to direct
sunlight either the first few weeks the
air temperatures between 22 and 24
Celsius then is lowered to 16 to 19
degrees the use of advanced climate
systems on farms allows year-round
maintenance of mushroom friendly
temperatures regardless of season it is
noteworthy that all this is not enough
for the cultivation of champignons on an
industrial scale because there's also
necessary to control the concentration
of carbon dioxide his indicator should
be in the range of 800 to a thousand ppm
the first mushroom heads appear only a
week after bedding fruiting begins 20 to
26 days after planting
egg melange the use of conventional eggs
in industrial cooking is inexpedient for
two reasons first because of the
fragility of the shell so transport is
complicated
the second the shape of the egg
complicates storage melange is a
pasteurized mixture of egg white and
yolk and is devoid of such drawbacks
it's simple and convenient both in
storage and transportation the
production of melange is carried out on
an industrial scale at special factories
from the hen house fresh eggs get on the
conveyor belt after which the equipment
breaks the shell and separates it from
the contents further the mechanical
separator separates the liquid from the
dry matter and feeds it to the filter
cylinder production of melange doesn't
take much time almost immediately after
filtration the liquid egg enters the
packing Department
whereas Borden's it hermetically sealed
packages from here the melange is sent
to numerous bakeries and factories that
produce culinary products in the factory
which you see on the screen they also
make egg powder to do this the melange
is dehydrated using drying or the
sublimation method
cheese each piece of cheese that gets on
our plates makes a long and difficult
journey from a special production farm
everything begins in the barn where the
milk is collected first of all it's
pasteurized in order to kill bacteria
whose presence is unacceptable
then friendly bacteria added to the
processed milk they contribute to its
setting up the next step is treatment in
a cheese birth in it the excess moisture
is removed from the mass and they
carefully mix it until it thickens
from the cheese barfi thickened mass
falls on special equipment that forms
chunks of cheese it may seem that after
this stage the cheese is ready and can
be sent to store shelves
however it's not immediately after
pressing the cheese is a tasteless mass
that resembles rubbers at the touch in
order for the cheese to acquire its
unique taste it must stay for a while in
a warm or cool place this process is
called ripening the duration of the
ripening depends on the type of cheese
for example dutch cheese has to stay
there for two to three months
Swiss cheese ripens for about six months
the final stage of cheese production
begins immediately after the ripening is
completed the chunks are cuts then
packed and already in this form are sent
to the stores
bread the production of bread would be
impossible without flour people have
received it from ancient times by
grinding wheat with stones but for
industrial cases this method just
doesn't work in the UK alone about 16
million tonnes of wheat a grown per year
is planted in autumn and it's harvested
almost a year later in August special
equipment is used for harvesting the
wheat before the collected wheat enters
the mills specialists take some of it
for tests to determine its quality if
the party passes the tests is to tend to
the flour making facilities there the
grains are washed and cleaned to achieve
the desired composition of flour
different kinds of grains are mixed with
each other
finally they fall into threshing
machines where they turn into flour
if the flower shows satisfactory results
on the quality control test it's sent to
the production bakeries as a rule one
plant is engaged in making a wide
variety of bakery products buns loaves
baguettes made from different flour and
with different fillings the flour is
mixed with Walter eggs and various
additives from the dough balls of the
desired shape are formed and after being
in the oven the products are cooled and
sent to the packing Department
chocolates now you will see how Rockets
chocolate is made at the Red Hook
Factory in Brooklyn cocoa beans are
extracted from cocoa seeds they're quite
big depending on the species they can
reach a length or up to 30 centimeters
the pulp contains up to 50 beams rocket
chocolate uses a custom-made refurbished
juicer to crack the beans and obtain a
homogeneous mass after processing the
cocoa mass is a loose powder and is
passed through a grinding machine
initially they were created to handle
spices in tea production but rocket
chocolate re-equipped them too in this
machine the chocolate mass is being
processed for up to 8 hours and as a
rule that's left there overnight in the
morning sugar is added after which the
mixture is sent to special rollers
this is necessary in order to saturate
the chocolate with air as well as give
it the necessary density the next stage
is hardening so that the whole mass has
a uniform taste one of the final stages
is the addition of fillings in various
flavors to get the usual bars that we
all know the chocolate is poured into
molds and after that it stays there for
some time for final hardening the final
stage is packing thus the company rocket
shop work produces from 1600 to 2000
shot four bars per day
caramels sweets as the basis invert
syrup or starch syrup is used for the
production of hard sugar candies the
first option is more preferable since
the use of starch syrup may result in
undesirable sugaring they add sugar and
water to the syrup then mix thoroughly
and bring to a boil pot caramel is
poured onto the palate and the liquid is
distributed so us to form a uniform
layer as soon as the caramel cools down
a little and becomes viscous it's rolled
and moved on to a special machine it
allows adding the dyes and flavors and
stirs the caramel to a uniform viscous
state
the further process of production varies
and depends on what kind of candy you
want to make a specialist rolls out the
caramel and makes a big candy putting
the right stuffing inside in this state
it gets into the rolling machine where
it becomes narrower until it acquires
the dimensions of a conventional candy
after that it's manually cut shaped
cooled and route</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
