common ways had joined several metal
parts is gas welding is popular due to
the fact that the equipment is simple
gas or welding mixtures are sold
everywhere and the energy source doesn't
have to be high power with gas welding
the metal is heated gently and slowly
so this joining method can only be used
for conventional or tools steel
non-ferrous metals and cast iron the
thickness of the metal must not exceed 5
millimeters either pay attention to the
white color of the flame this means that
a mixture of oxygen and fuel gas is used
the welding methods shown in the video
looks quite original the flame flux is
well adjusted and provides excellent
adhesion
friction welding friction welding is
often used to join different metals and
thermoplastics in the aerospace and
automotive industries it's a type of
pressure welding in which two metal
surfaces are joined by deforming the
area in which they come into contact in
this particular case one of the parts to
be welded rotates or moves in relation
to the other friction is then generated
by this interaction and it heats the
contact area resulting in direct welding
the process can be divided into three
stages during the first stage the
frictional force destroys and removes
the oxide films present on the surface
in the initial state during the second
stage heat is released and the material
becomes moldable under its influence
first temporary contact occurs but then
it breaks the parts are pressed with
constant or increasing pressure which
causes the most moldable parts of the
pieces to be welded to be extruded from
the joint finally the third step is the
end of friction it's completed by the
formation of a welded joints this
whirling method was first used in 1956
afterward she was actively introduced
into the industry worldwide
hyperbaric welding if you've ever
wondered how underwater welding is done
you're about to see it the main feature
of this welding is that it's carried out
at high pressure
hyperbaric welding is applied when it's
necessary to repair a ship an oil
platform pipes and other metallic
structures submerged underwater a
special waterproof electrode adapted to
these conditions is used in the welding
process if other equipment is used there
is a high risk of electric shock the
electric arc increases the temperature
of the workpiece and the electrode the
melted metal is transferred to the work
pieces by means of a gaseous bubble it
forms around the arc due to the
disintegration of the flux layer on the
electrode the electric current causes
the metal droplets to travel from the
electrode to the surface to be treated
performing the welding process it should
be noted that the work must be done with
care and more importantly quickly as the
joint cooling speed is higher in the
water
Forge welding this is the first
technical process in human history to
create inseparable metallic compounds
studies of ancient metal objects have
shown that people began to use forging
in the fourth or third millennium BC
modern Forge welding is mostly done with
the help of hydraulic hammers and
presses this type of welding has
practically no advantages it may seem
that the process is quite simple the
metal parts are heated until it become
moldable then the surfaces to be welded
are covered and molded with the impacts
from the tool however the process is far
from easy
in fact it requires a blacksmith with
knowledge experience and high
qualifications other disadvantages of
this type of welding are low
productivity and low strength joints as
a result due to these characteristics
forging can only be done with a few
metals nowadays it's mainly used in
adverse conditions when machine parts
and equipment have to be repaired
without being able to use complex
technology it should be noted that the
parts must be of low-carbon structural
steel the carbon content should not
exceed not 0.3%
otherwise the weldability of the metal
is drastically reduced
electron beam welding the first electron
beam welding plant was created in 1958
today this equipment is widely used to
weld refractory and highly reactive
metals in the space and aeronautical
industries in instrument manufacture and
other similar fields hietzing and
welding are possible thanks to the
kinetic energy of the electrons produced
by the beam a special electron gun
produces the beam electron beam welding
is used when it's necessary to obtain a
high quality steel with deep penetration
welding for large metal structures
advantages of this method include the
fact that in the process the melted
metal is not saturated with gases in
addition the high heat concentration
allows even thick metals up to 200
millimetres to be welded in a single
pass however there are also
disadvantages the process must be
carried out in a special vacuum chamber
in addition the world route may have
lack of fusion
submerged arc welding this welding
technique is used in stationary workshop
conditions and can be used with any
metal and alloys with a thickness of one
and a half to a hundred and fifty
millimeters the welding is done by
electric arc it burns under the flux
layer between the end of the welding
wire and the metal to be welded the
electrode cable is automatically formed
in the arc o special mechanisms one
contact carries the welding currents of
the wire and the other to the metal this
welding method shows higher productivity
and minimal metal losses in addition the
welding zone is protected to the maximum
since the arc burns under the flux layer
there's no splashing and no need for
protection devices against light
laser beam welding if you need to
connect identical or heterogeneous metal
parts for electronic or radio devices
most of the time you should opt for
laser beam welding as you can guess the
laser acts as an energy source it was
first used in the 1960s when the first
continuous wave and pulsed laser systems
appeared the welding process is quite
simple the laser beam is directed to the
focusing system becoming a beam with a
smaller cross-section and hitting the
parts to be welded partially reflected
the laser beam penetrates the material
the metal then absorbs it heating up and
melting this is how welding joints are
formed interestingly this welding method
is much more environmentally friendly
compared to traditional welding
techniques
exothermic welding the powder mixture
consisting of mill scale and metallic
aluminium or magnesium is called
thermite in exothermic welding this
powder is used to heat the metal
aluminium based thermite is used when
it's necessary to bond steel and cast
iron parts in most cases it's used to
process rail and pipe joints weld cracks
and weld over light the parts to be
joined are processed with a refractory
material after which they are heated the
melted thermite is ignited and then used
to fill the welding sites
thus the liquid iron which is formed in
the process melts with the main material
creating a strong weld magnesium based
thermite is used to repair telephone and
telegraph wires and all kinds of cables
