a lot of time cutting the hedge neatly
is not so easy and it's even more
complicated if the plant is tall a hedge

makes fence maintenance easy and fast

only need to set the direction of
movement like in a garden tractor

that remove excess vegetation at the
speed at which the machine is moving

perfectly even cut in addition there's
no human factor so the risk of damaging
the hedge is minimized the video shows
the hedge trimmers of the French company

a manual hedge trimmer in fact it's a
kind of chainsaw attached to a long
handle for convenience with its help you

even cut the grass on the lawn the teeth
on the blade are specially designed to
cut branches with little or no effort in
addition because the blade is long and
straight it leaves a perfectly even cut

with a 360-degree camera which
identifies the appearance of a
particular plant and how quickly it
grows the manufacturer also offers a
mobile application specially developed
for garden space in which all the plants
can be added
the information obtained from the
cameras and the application allows the
device to determine and follow the
optimal irrigation schedule for each
plant surprisingly garden space can
recognize each crop and determine
whether or not to water the sprout so
the owner can stop worrying about plants
not getting enough water or vice versa
