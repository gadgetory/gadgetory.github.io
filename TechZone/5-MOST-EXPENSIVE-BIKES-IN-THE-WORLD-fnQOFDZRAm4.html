Brothers have been developing and
selling motorcycles with the very
unusual look for more than a year its
costs as you can guess is proportional
to its great look that is quite high for
example the neutron Pike which was
inspired by the motorcycles in the movie
Tron Legacy can be purchased at a price
ranging from 55 to 75 thousand dollars
depending on the finishing materials
the new trombone looks like a futuristic
vehicle and its interior definitely
meets the requirements that will be
imposed on motorcycles in a couple of
decades
for example the bike was equipped with a
96 volt electric motor as well as the
lithium-ion battery pack in just 12
seconds the motorcycle accelerates up to
160 km/h and its cruising range on a
perfectly flat Road and in warm weather
129 kilometers the materials chosen are
durable yet lightweight such as carbon
supplemented with aluminium and carbon
fiber the unusual 24 inch wheels without
hubs attract the most attention but it's
also interesting that the drivers
position is almost horizontal at the
moments there's only one neutron bike
with this look spirits GP supports the
specialists involved in the creation and
the motorcycle you see on the screen say
this although it was designed for a
sports track the bike is suitable for
traveling on normal roads the spirit GP
sport motorcycle represents a new level
of super sport bikes the bodies made of
carbon fiber and inside there's a
four-stroke three cylinder engine with
the volume of 749 CC a notable feature
is the fully adjustable chassis
traditionally these motorcycles have a
welded body but the spirit motorcycle
specialists decided to abandon this
design instead the GP Sport has a
braised body making the undercarriage
more elastic providing greater control
in addition the bike adapts perfectly to
the needs and preferences of its owner
almost everything is regulated from the
angle of inclination of the fork and the
distance between the axles to the
location of the axle of the aluminium
pendulum weighing a hundred and 40
kilograms the spirit GP Sports has a
capacity of 180 horsepower the
manufacturer will launch only 50 of
these bikes the first of each is
approximately 97 thousand dollars
Lazarus lm8 47 today few people will be
surprised by a motorcycle with a large
engine but only a handful of models have
a v-shaped 8 cylinder engine inside the
laser of lm8 4:7 is equipped with a 470
horsepower engine similar to that of a
maserati
sports car the engine is so large and
powerful that's like the motorcycle
itself it can be seen and heard from
afar by the way the name of the
motorcycle the LM 8:47 is a reference to
its power eight is the number of
cylinders and 4.7 is the capacity of the
tank in lisa's the twin wheels a huge
body of polyester and carbon fiber as
well as the large 16 and 1/2 inch tires
give the bike a striking an aggressive
look the bike weighs 400 kilograms but
is the best power-to-weight ratio
between cruiser models it's only logical
that a motorcycle was such an incredible
engine should be equipped with equally
incredible brakes in fact the front
wheels are equipped with two 420
millimeter brake discs with eight piston
holders on the rear wheels there were
two 255 millimeter brake discs with four
piston calipers therefore the Lazarus LM
8 4 7 combines incredible power with
high control on the road offering a lot
of safety the price more than two
hundred fifteen thousand dollars makes
this model one of the most expensive
motorcycles in the world
the Massimo Tamburini t12 the secret of
the price of this incredible motorcycle
more than three hundred and fifty
thousand dollars
lies in the name of the person who
participated in its development Massimo
Tamburini is a legendary Italian
designer who gave the world motorcycles
such as the MV Agusta f4 the chakashi
916 the motor cars and other vehicles
Massimo Tamburini started working on the
t12 model from 2012 and it was the last
creation of the famous designer as he
died in 2014 in recent years after the
death of the engineer his family
continued to work on the motorcycle
fortunately they managed to put all the
developments together as Oh in 2016
the world finally saw the Massimo
Tamburini t12
the engine power is 230 horsepower and
the most notable features include a
carbon-fiber body a large number of
electronic components and a unique
titanium exhaust it's also interesting
that the motorcycle is equipped with a
patented system thanks to which is
possible to change the rigidity of the
frame without replacing any parts the
weight of the Superbike is 154 kilograms
and of course the motorcycle is
available for sale and a limited edition
harley-davidson bukhara a blue edition
the motorcycle you see on the screen can
be considered to be most expensive on
our list with a resale price of 1.8
million dollars this is without
exaggeration Harley Davidsons most
expensive motorcycle the results of
collaboration between the company's
engineers and specialists from the
jewelry company who Shara as you can
imagine the high cost of the vehicle
resides in its details the base of this
blue series motorcycle was the
harley-davidson Softail slim s model
with 16 inch wheels and an engine
capacity of eighteen hundred and one
cubic centimeters everything is unique
here from the color to the little
details to give the frame an ultramarine
color the specialists silvered it first
the press was also affected by the
gold-plated details the steering wheel
with diamond ornaments and the special
compartments in the body inside them as
a diamond ring as well as an expensive
gold wristwatch they come with the bike
harley-davidson blue edition was
assembled manually and is creation to
2500 hours there is only one model of
this motorcycle in the world
