fire in the modern world are considered
non compliance with the rules of
operation of electrical equipments and
devices as well as careless handling of
fire
there are also non-human reasons such as
lightning strikes and self ignition of
various substances and materials as well
as defects in cables
all fires there whether domestic
industrial or natural are destructive
and caused great damage and loss of
human lives these statistics are
disappointing every year about 24,000
people die from fires and up to 70,000
are hospitalized in terms the material
damage
fires destroy some 15 billion dollars in
property annually that's why it's so
important to find new faster and more
effective ways to deal with fire this is
especially true during the first and
most important minutes after a fire the
fact is that if the source of the fire
is not eliminated and the fire is not
extinguished within the first two
minutes in most cases the flame spreads
too far to extinguish it easily quickly
that's where all the problems we talked
about come from elite fire is an
innovative way to deal with fire if the
device is used constantly and all over
the world it will be able to correct
fire statistics as well as save many
lives the lead fire is a fire
extinguishing ball developed by
specialists from Thailand as it heats up
it explodes and covers a radius of 1.3
meters with a special powder it is
absolutely harmless to both humans and
the environment but extinguishes the
fire quickly enough in lead fire weighs
only one point three kilograms and is
ideal for those cases where the fires
just started
you can make the consequences of a far
less damaging or prevent it from
happening
survivor plus if a ship is in an
emergency situation where the crew is
forced to leave the ship in a hurry and
jump into the water putting on a
lifejacket is only part of the measures
needed to survive at sea or in the ocean
people face a cold climate which is
difficult to prepare for so crew members
often die in the water before even
reaching a life raft survivor Plus at
first glance looks like a common life
jacket but its unique technology
provides a personal life raft to each of
its users
once in the water the person pulls the
ring actuate in the inflation mechanism
of carafe folded into the back of the
vest the total opening some of the life
raft is only 60 seconds and the user is
kept on the surface of the water with
the help of the burst after the life
raft has been opened it is enough to
enter it with the presence of a zipper
is definitely an advantage inside the
raft the person doesn't come into
contact with the water so they can then
warm up and wait for the rescue teams
savor emergency breath system
experienced firefighters despite
fighting fire claim that in 80% of cases
it is not the fire that kills people
but the toxic smoke that fills the room
when the fire occurs after those who
flee simply don't leave the building
because they lose consciousness saver is
a personal emergency breathing system
that easily fits in a bag or desk drop
in the presence of smoke in the room
although personally Stu do is put on the
clamp that comes with the kit on that
nose and then insert the device into
their mouth from then on the triple
filter allows the person to breathe the
hot collect the material the filter is
made of converts carbon monoxide into
carbon dioxide in other words the person
will not breathe pure oxygen but will be
able to breathe without the risk of
losing consciousness
unfortunately the device only works for
five minutes
after which it stops filtering dust and
toxic substances and stops the
conversion of carbon monoxide although
five minutes may seem like a very short
time in most cases it's enough for the
person to leave the danger zone you can
buy this device for $35
storm shelter natural hazards are
extremely diverse hurricanes typhoons
tornadoes and tsunamis to survive a
person has to learn to adapt and find
new ways to protect his or her life
special shelters are increasingly
popular in regions that suffer the
effects of tornados and hurricanes every
year they can have a variety of designs
and locations be part of a bed or be
installed on the garage floor
but they all have one thing in common
when the wind blows outside the window
in its speed exceeds 100 km/h these
shelters save lives these bunkers are
made of durable materials most of the
time it's metal they're stable and are
able to protect the person inside from
objects flying in the air
as a general rule there are no special
commodities inside as people are not
expected to spend much time inside
life raft and here's another
technologies designed to save lives in
an emergency aboard a ship this model
was manufactured by life raft systems
Australia it offers a wide range of life
rafts both open and closed varying in
size and capacity we've already said
that not everyone can withstand cold
water
the life raft you see on the screen is a
more humane way of evacuating because
people are being rescued to try it
should be noted that the evacuation is
done safely quickly and efficiently the
raft unfolds in one minute after which
people enter the staircase
the raft is then divided into two
sections so two people can enter at the
same time which greatly accelerates the
process
these systems can be used on all types
of vessels from commercial to fishing
and passenger vessels it should also be
noted that there are similar life
whereas designed for polar conditions
too they have these same capacity as the
other rafts but they continue to operate
even if the air temperature drops below
minus 50 degrees Celsius
hey stop being lazy it's time to use

present and even the future the power of
