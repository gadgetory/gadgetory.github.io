you see on the screen began in 1898 when
for the first time in San Francisco the
factory was established for the
production of cherry candy for the
hundred years later this family business
is still working nine varieties of
sweets are made here and the production
of each candy last 12 days the initial
ingredients are liquid sugar corn syrup
and corn starch all of them are heated
and then mixed cherry juice and natural
flavors are then added to the resulting
mixture as all the sweets of this
factory are made in the form of hearts
the prepared mixture is sent to a
special equipment which pours it into
the molds it should be noted that the
machine fills 8000 molds per minute the
molds are also made from corn starch
future candy then spends two days in a
special room where it's cold and dried
by steam after this these sweets are
separated from molds by a special
machine without human intervention on a
conveyor belt they are sent to the
workshop where they're heated again it's
steam the surface of the candy becomes
sticky which is needed because in the
next stage they're covered with sugar
this allows the candies not to stick to
each other
the hardest job is that to the person
fills the boxes with almost ready sweets
as he lifts about 27 kilograms every
minute after the candy settles room
temperature it's sent to the panning
room this means that the sweets are
stirred in a steel drum adding syrup and
sugar little by little and some of hard
crust of sugar forms on the surface
the only thing left to do is to let them
cool polish them in the next run and
then pack them
French palmier cookies the production of
these puff pastry starts of course with
the preparation of the dough all the
ingredients are mixed in the industrial
mixer then the factory operator cuts the
dough into pieces of the same size and
places them on a conveyor belt they are
placed in the extruder a machine that
forms fine uniform strips of dough a
layer of butter is then placed on top of
the strip which is also formed by the
extruder then the dough is folded to
cover the layer of butter and the next
machine squeezes the layers together
mixing them the next step is making the
laminated dough the strip's are stacked
on top of each other and sprinkled with
sugar to form six layers the only thing
left to do is to fold the dough in the
shape of hearts and bake it every day
about 1 million of these pastry products
are made at such a factory if necessary
the products are immersed in chocolates
to give them an extra flavour and an
original appearance
after the hearts have cooled down the
workers patenting in plastic boxes and
they're set to the store
doughnuts at the donut factory it all
starts with the dough in Krispy Kreme
the factory you can see on the screen
the secret formula is used to create the
products the recipe hasn't changed since
1937
the dough is mixed in an industrial
mixer and then stretched at the same
time the adjacent workshop begins to mix
the glazed a the mixed dough is placed
in the extruder which squeezes it out in
the form of the future ramped Donuts the
next step is the heat treatment the
donuts are first baked and then fried in
oil special equipment turns them over so
that the products are fried uniformly
once fried the donuts move along the
conveyor belts and excess oil comes out
of them finally they're sent to a
machine that covers them with the glaze
that's been prepared beforehand at this
point of the production process is over
we just have to wait for the donuts to
cool down to put them in boxes
Necco wafers in each package of these
sweets there are 38 pieces which can
have different flavors
the Necco wafers factory produces only
one flavor at a time which means
different batches of sweets are prepared
one by one in the first stage large
amounts of powdered sugar are mixed with
food colorants and flavor additives in
this case they add a mint additive and a
pink dye to create a flavor called
wintergreen then corn syrup and binder
are added to the mixture in this case
it's a vegetable gum and gelatin
dissolved in water the mixture is
stirred for 8 minutes before it thickens
and then the workers transfer it to the
dough roller there a thin uniform strip
of the mixture is formed watch as the
workers constantly spread cornstarch on
the equipment so that the sweet mixture
doesn't stick to it at the same stage
other equipment first stamps the company
logo and then shapes the future candies
the product is transported to a
multi-stage drying tunnel by means of a
conveyor belt the sweets then pass
through the machine 13 times in an hour
then the candies are taken to a special
roof to cool down the same level of
humidity and temperature is maintained
there so that a candy obtains the
correct consistency after the quality
control the sweets of different flavors
are mixed and sent to the packaging line
cornflakes the production process of
this fast and healthy breakfast is
divided into two separate stages the
first is to obtain the corn grits and
the second is to produce corn flakes
from the grits at some factories as in
this case only the second stage is
carried out as the corn grits are
brought ready for use first they're
cleaned of impurities for this a grain
separator is used and then the grains
are washed the grits are scalded with
hot steam and given tons of rest after a
while the grits are sent to the heat
treatment machine where they're mixed
with the salt and sugar solution they're
treated with heat for two hours after
which the mixture is sent to the drying
equipment there it spends six to eight
hours at high temperatures in the next
step the lumps are removed and the
mixture is stamped to produce fine
flakes they're passed through a sieve
and then roasted after this all that's
left is to cool the finished products
classifiers and then packet
chocolate the factory whose work is
shown in the video produces up to 2,000
chocolate bars a day all production
processes are carried out here from the
processing of the cocoa beans to the
filling of the finished products the
cocoa beans are grown on the plantations
and are large enough to be broken to
extract valuable cocoa seeds they're
brought in 70 kilogram bags to the
factory using special equipment
the workers grind the beans into a
homogeneous mass that resembles a powder
the next step is processing it in a
special grinding machine which takes
about eight hours
although the mixture already looks like
liquid chocolate it still has a long way
to go to get the right flavor and
consistency
after processing these sugar is added
and the mix is then transferred to
special rollers at this stage the
mixture is enriched with air and becomes
thicker the future chocolate is then
hardened and completed with different
fillings and flavor additives
the final steps are filling the special
molds cooling and packaging
