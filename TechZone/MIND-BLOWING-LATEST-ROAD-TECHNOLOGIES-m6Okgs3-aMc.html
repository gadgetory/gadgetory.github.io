methods for removing and repairing
manholes on roads are not perfect people
have to perform tedious time-consuming
work which moreover is extremely unsafe
fortunately today new machines are being
invented that allow performing the
procedure faster easier and safer the
most difficult stage of the adjustments
of manholes is the removal of the frame
because it is built into the asphalt
surface
this equipment known as gold series
six-shooter cuts the asphalt around the
manhole significantly reducing waste and
makes the process more economical it is
an attachment used in conjunction with a
skid steer the cutting diameter is
adjustable 70 or 150 centimeters this
design greatly expands the possible
scope of work is noteworthy that a
nozzle can be equipped with an
additional handle after which the
cutting diameter is increased by another
30 centimeters the depth of the possible
cuts is 35 to 50 centimeters and the
blades are powerful enough to cut
asphalt and concrete
vogue Ellis Superseries
laying asphalt equipment has a long
history a definite contributions of
world production in terms of developing
innovative technological characteristics
was made by the german company virgle
a-- the model series of this
manufacturer today he has a huge amounts
of equipment and the asphalt pavers
differed primarily in the width of the
working area the video demonstrates the
performance of the super 803 a new
generation machine that stands out for
its compact size
the overall width of the device is only
1.4 meters while it's capable of laying
up to 300 tons of asphalt per hour the
compact dimensions allow working in
tight spaces even in the narrowest areas
the laying width is adjustable from more
0.5 to 3.5 meters it is used to create
and repair private roads small roads
bicycle and walking paths another model
shown in the video is the super 1303
it's also used to install small roads
and playgrounds however the maximum
width of its installation is as much as
5 meters
pavement preservation machine each road
deteriorates in its own way the degree
of damage depends on car activity the
age of the asphalt and other operational
features to fix the road you don't
necessarily need to remove the old layer
of asphalt and then lay a new one when
the degree of damage is small it is
enough to apply a layer of special
saturate it is a liquid that consists of
acrylic polyurethane other polymers and
surfactants this is a more economical
and easy way to keep the roads in a good
condition from the outside it may seem
that the road is simply painted but
impregnation is needed not only for
aesthetics it seals the goat surface
hides the seams and also protects the
asphalt from the adverse environmental
conditions in this case for the
application of the saturates also known
as seal coat they use specialized
equipment a huge tank filled with the
liquid slowly moves along the road
distributing the material over the
surface in an even layer after this the
road can be open for cars already on the
same or the next day depending on the
weather conditions
cats ap 1055 F a huge number of
companies are working on the production
of asphalt pavers among them the company
caterpillar famous for its numerous
high-quality equipment here we have
attract paver model a p10 55 F
this is a high-performance machine
that's designed to work on runways
highways and other large work sites
notable features include high-speed
excellent possibility and outstanding
traction the capacity of the equipment
is 1600 tons per hour and the maximum
paving width varies from seven point six
five to ten meters the video shows the
optional equipment integral DX which
turns ordinary asphalt pavers into
spraying
ham h20 I one of the most important
stages during the creation and repair of
roads are the compaction of soil and
asphalt specialized rollers are used to
perform these procedures here we have a
roller produced by the huge German
engineering company ham AG the ham aged
20 I has a compact size it's equipped
with a roller drum and it's two point
fourteen meters wide the benefits
include excellent possibility the
equipment is mobile but at the same time
the wheels provide optimum grip the cab
is designed to provide a wide viewing
angle thanks to this it's possible to
achieve increased accuracy and quality
Liss mac multi-cut companies that work
in the construction and repair of roads
have to use equipment that can cuts the
surface of asphalt counselling the
pavement can be done for different
purposes for example to remove the old
coating and put a new one on top
sometimes the old cracks are cut for
subsequent effective filling and fixing
the bitumen in any case the equipment
must be powerful enough to cut the
asphalt without breaking it the German
company lists Mack is engaged in the
production of very different equipment
including universal saws and slot
cutters
the video demonstrates the operation of
the multi-cut 550 and the multi-cut 600
models both of them are powerful for
stores with a special drive that
guarantees smooth and controlled machine
operations the whole structure is stable
and maneuverable the maximum cutting
depth of the first machine is 415
millimeters the disk diameter is 1000
millimeters the multi-cut 600 is bigger
than the cutting depth is 515
millimeters and the blade diameter is
1,200 millimeters
Hoffmann age 33 for the easiest and
fastest way to apply road markings is to
use specialized self-propelled vehicles
here we have the H 33 4 produced by the
German company Hoffmann it's used to
spray thermoplastic it is equipped with
a 500 liter pressure free tank a bellows
pump a diesel burner and a centrifuge
for glass beads the advantages include
the fact that you can spray with it's a
variety of paints for example cold
two-component plastic or spray plastic
the width of the applied line depends on
the equipment for example 10 or 100
centimeters the manufacturer claims that
this is the most compact marking machine
which are the same summers great power
maneuverability and the abilities apply</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
