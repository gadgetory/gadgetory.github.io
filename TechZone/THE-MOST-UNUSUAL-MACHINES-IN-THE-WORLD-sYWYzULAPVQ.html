technology was very popular until the
1970s but today many farmers are
starting to use it again significantly
in order to process the soil at a great
depth farmers use two to five tractors
of different capacities as well as a
special heavy plowing machine capable of
shaking the soil at the depth of eight
feet thanks to its design and the use of
corrosion resistant materials the
playing machine can be much longer than
the rest of agricultural machinery the
elevation of the lower soil layers in
turn is beneficial for growing crops and
future crops
cabbage harvesting machine given that
the most effective technique for
harvesting cabbages is to cut the bud at
the lowest point the harvesting
machinery should work as carefully as
possible vegetables are moved from the
bench using special metal shafts and
then cut off and transported along three
moving tracks while eliminating excess
leaves only one person's participation
is necessary at the final stage to
remove leaves and other remaining
elements after that a cabbage is sent
for further processing the use of these
machines in agriculture is becoming
increasingly importance in the modern
world as it does not require a large
number of workers in a narrow specialty
and allows for a significant increase in
the speed of harvesting
tobacco Harvester the main difficulty in
collecting tobacco is the need to
collect the leaves in layers as they
mature from the bottoms at the top
because a deviation from this skin can
damage the quality of the product
however manual harvesting is not
economically viable and is rather slow
that is why the manufacturer of this
vehicle offers to use an unusual three
wheel Harvester with an adjustable
height to cut and harvest a backhoe
leaves depending on the configuration
this machine can go through the
plantation cutting only one layer of
leaves leaving the rest intact
peanuts harvesting machine farmers use
special machines of various dimensions
and prices to extract peanuts from the
ground for example this tractor equipped
with the trailer and six cutting blades
can process large areas of a field in
record time without damaging the product
the vehicle only removes peanuts from
the ground for later harvesting
depending on the area to be processed
the number of blade segments can be
reduced to two special combine
harvesters are also used to collect
peanuts from the ground and separate
them from the roots of the plants
topping juleps this tractor of the
famous European company John Deere has a
capacity of a hundred and fifty
horsepower is equipped with three
cutting mechanisms and it removes the
upper part of the tulips at the same
time each of the mechanisms can cover up
to six feet in a single cycle
guaranteeing high quality work chu'lak
flowers need to be cut because they're
grown to produce bulbs that are
harvested in the summer a few months
after the removal of the flowers
potato planting deutz-fahr seventh
series tractors not only offer high
performance but also greater comfort for
the operator the cab of each tractor is
equipped with an automatic conditioning
system and an anti vibration unit
provides stability inside another
defining feature of this tractor is that
company's reliable engines and efficient
three-stage transmissions if necessary
the machine wheels can be replaced with
special crawler tracks to improve the
ability to travel off-road for example
while working in the field
in to drain plow this vehicle moves
thanks to two huge crawler tracks and
can transport up to four coils of pipes
or cables simultaneously the v-shaped
tool located at the front cuts the soil
and at the same time installs the pipe
and then replaces the soil layer this
technology is known as trenchless
installation because it does not damage
the soil only two people are needed to
use the vehicle the operator responsible
for the control and his assistant who
will connect the pipe ends the vehicles
equipped with a 500 horsepower engine
and uses a unique system to control and
maintain an accurate depth at all times
plugger MKC 2tr this cutting-edge Dutch
built combine harvester is specifically
designed for harvesting herbaceous
plants the vehicles capable of
processing a 21 foot wide field strip in
a single stroke that is equipped with a
special device to collect the leaves so
that the plants do not pull out for the
roots but continue to grow uniformly
after harvesting the parsley is placed
in the mobile container sent to a truck
and transported for further processing
or directly to the store
class Jaguar 900 field shuttle this
Dutch vehicle mainly used for Mays field
processing is equipped with powerful
cutting tools located in front of the
drivers cap as well as a load
compartment with a flexible cut plug
thanks to the track wheels and
significant cab lift the vehicle can be
used even on difficult terrain and low
visibility areas after harvesting the
crushed plant automatically passed into
the bin through the pipe which can be
unloaded remotely controlling the entire
process from the cab
Kronus wardro mm this huge agricultural
vehicle is one of the biggest on the
market not only is it capable of working
on large areas of land at a short period
of time about 20 hectares per hour but
it also provides the operator with
maximum comfort even after several hours
of work according to the manufacturer
the squad row mm is the ideal vehicle
for large-scale agricultural work the
working width of the device is
approximately 62 feet while the width of
the rolls reaches 10 feet it should also
be noted that the vehicle is equipped
with an intelligent control system
