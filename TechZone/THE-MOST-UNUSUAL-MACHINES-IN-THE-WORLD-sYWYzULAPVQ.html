technology was very popular until the
1970s but today many farmers are
starting to use it again significantly
in order to process the soil at a great
depth farmers use two to five tractors
of different capacities as well as a
special heavy plowing machine capable of
shaking the soil at the depth of eight
feet thanks to its design and the use of
corrosion resistant materials the
playing machine can be much longer than
the rest of agricultural machinery the
elevation of the lower soil layers in
turn is beneficial for growing crops and
future crops
cabbage harvesting machine given that
the most effective technique for
harvesting cabbages is to cut the bud at
the lowest point the harvesting
machinery should work as carefully as
possible vegetables are moved from the
bench using special metal shafts and
then cut off and transported along three
moving tracks while eliminating excess
leaves only one person's participation
is necessary at the final stage to
remove leaves and other remaining
elements after that a cabbage is sent
for further processing the use of these
machines in agriculture is becoming
increasingly importance in the modern
world as it does not require a large
number of workers in a narrow specialty
and allows for a significant increase in
the speed of harvesting
tobacco Harvester the main difficulty in
collecting tobacco is the need to

wheel Harvester with an adjustable
height to cut and harvest a backhoe
leaves depending on the configuration
this machine can go through the
plantation cutting only one layer of
leaves leaving the rest intact
peanuts harvesting machine farmers use
special machines of various dimensions
and prices to extract peanuts from the
ground for example this tractor equipped
with the trailer and six cutting blades
can process large areas of a field in
record time without damaging the product
the vehicle only removes peanuts from
the ground for later harvesting
depending on the area to be processed
the number of blade segments can be
reduced to two special combine
harvesters are also used to collect
peanuts from the ground and separate
them from the roots of the plants
topping juleps this tractor of the
famous European company John Deere has a
capacity of a hundred and fifty

while working in the field
in to drain plow this vehicle moves
thanks to two huge crawler tracks and
can transport up to four coils of pipes
or cables simultaneously the v-shaped
tool located at the front cuts the soil
and at the same time installs the pipe
and then replaces the soil layer this
technology is known as trenchless
installation because it does not damage
the soil only two people are needed to
use the vehicle the operator responsible
for the control and his assistant who
will connect the pipe ends the vehicles
equipped with a 500 horsepower engine
and uses a unique system to control and
maintain an accurate depth at all times

visibility areas after harvesting the
crushed plant automatically passed into
the bin through the pipe which can be
unloaded remotely controlling the entire
process from the cab
