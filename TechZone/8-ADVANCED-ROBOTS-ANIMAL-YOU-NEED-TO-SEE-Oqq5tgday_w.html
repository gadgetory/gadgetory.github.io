butterflies not only resemble their
real-life relatives but can mimic their
behavior thanks to a series of GPS
sensors located in the perimeter of
flight and to a series of infrared
cameras the butterflies can orient
themselves in space and avoid any
obstacle in the belly of each robot
there is an infrared marker in the belly
of each robot as an infrared marker and
the emotion butterflies monitor the
movements of their friends and don't
crash in the air
the ways of each butterflies only 32
grams and the movement is possible
thanks to two servo motors and a pair of
small batteries the wingspan reaches 20
inches and watching these animals fly is
a complete pleasure Bionic copter the
German company Festo has presented its
most recent creation a dragonfly robot
known as Bionic copter this model
differs from previous creations for its
great maneuverability the robot can
break and glide in the air
momona copter is much larger than a real
dragon fly and the wingspan of the robot
is 27 inches and his length is 19 inches
the body of the Dragonfly is made of
carbon fiber and is covered by polyester
membrane other parts of the device are
made an aluminium polyamide and polymer
thanks to this the weight of the robot
does not exceed 6.0 ances the robot is
controlled with a smartphone spot mini
this four-legged robot can move in such
a way that its head remains in the same
position the weight of the robot is
almost 55 pounds the module with the
head which is actually a mechanical hand
adds to the weight of the robot another
10 pounds the developers say that the
robots capable of running on the
built-in batteries for about an hour and
a half depending on the type of tasks
performed
to orientate the robot uses a series of
sensors that scan the world around
cameras that calculate the distance and
the gyroscope it's worth noting that
spot mini is a fully electric robot it
doesn't have any kind of hydraulic
mechanisms and all the joints are moved
with the help of conductors cheetah
robot to cheetah robot has the
technology to run like a true cheetah
among other things this robot can change
the position of its backs to increase
the length of its steps and speed up
the teaser robot was tested on a
treadmill the power source was a
hydraulic pump also used were devices
that help the robot maintain balance
currently the cheetah robot is not ready
to compete against a real cheetah which
can reach up to 70 miles per hour
however the engineers hope to achieve
that one day to match the real prototype
for now the robots capable of traveling
at 18 miles per hour
Bionic ends another creation of the
company Festo Bionic ants the size of a
human hand
the objective of this project is the
creation of mechanisms with a collective
intellect which will allow them to work
in the factories of the future
fulfilling diverse tasks the ants have
been printed using 3d technology and
have a plastic body and electronic in
Syria six mechanical legs joined with
porcelain conductors are capable of
performing various activities with
minimal energy expenditure in the head
of each of the ants is a stereo camera
that allows the insect to define its
position and the position of the object
with which it must work
oops
temperature sensors allow the aunt to
create an image of the world around it
and they can also salt to each other
using wireless technology aqua penguin
like a real penguin aqua penguins have
an aerodynamic shape perfect to save
energy
the force of movements of its wings
allows them to maneuver independently in
narrow areas aqua penguins can find
their way in a body of water and move
independently
with the aid of a 3d sonar that mimics
that are the real penguins they can
communicate with the world around them
and with other Bionic penguins a
completely new feature in the world of
robotics is that's also of the penguins
which can move in any direction with
quick and accurate regulation aqua
penguins can swim in groups without
crashing controlling depth pressure
temperature and stability robot
dragonfly tech jet dragonfly has a Wi-Fi
module and is equipped with more than 20
sensors you can control the actions and
movements of the robot using your
smartphone or your laptop based on an
application available on Google Play in
the app store the user of this robot can
enjoy its aerodynamic wings its patented
four wing mechanism its brushless motor
and its polymer lithium battery
tech jet dragon fliers borrowed from
insects not only the shape of its wings
but the size about six inches long the
weight of the robot is one ounce and
works thanks to a lithium battery of 250
million powers which guarantees between
eight and ten minutes of gliding and
between 25 and 30 minutes of flight the
robot can carry up to 20 sensors for all
kinds of applications Bionic kangaroo
the Bionic kangaroo project until
recently has been kept secret but
recently the company Festo has shown the
public its robot which mimics the
jumping of a kangaroo including its most
complex mechanism using the power of one
jump to perform the next one the bionic
kangaroo uses this principle with the
aid of Springs that recover the
mechanical energy of the landing and
release it when making the next jump the
robot is 3.2 feet tall and weighs 15
pounds in addition it's capable of
jumping 2.6 feet horizontally and 1.3
vertically</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
