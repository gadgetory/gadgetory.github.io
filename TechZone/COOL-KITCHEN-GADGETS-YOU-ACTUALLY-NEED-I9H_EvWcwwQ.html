temperature although automation at this
process with the help of a robot may
seem strange the rotor Matic is a truly
unique device the robot can bake Rotti
bread perfectly and with little or no
human intervention at a speed of one
Rotti per minute much faster than the
manual preparation process the weight of
the device is 17 kilograms and the
dimensions are 40 centimeters cubed
