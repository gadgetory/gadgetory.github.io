Netherlands developed a new bicycle
frame using 3d printing the bicycle is
made of stainless steel using welding
and 3d printing techniques the art
bicycle is very light and like a
conventional bicycle with a metal frame
and can be used for driving on uneven
cobbled streets in other words this is
not an art project but a fully-fledged
device for moving within the city which
however is not yet available for buying
poupi wooden bicycle the design of the
Hoopoe bicycle can be easily adjusted
for adults of any height and the plywood
framing can be used to store tools spare
tires or other items in addition the
frame can be adapted to mount the engine
which allows you to convert the vehicle
into an electric bike the finished frame
weighs only three kilograms the total
weight of the finished bicycle is twelve
to fourteen kilograms
poopee can withstand loads of up to 200
kilograms in the process of designing
the bicycle some changes may be made to
the frame because the instructions on
the developer site contain cutout
schemes of various shapes this unusual
vehicle will cost potential buyers 36 to
72 dollars
the X terrain 500 this electric bike is
able to move on sand snow and high grass
without losing speed this effect is
achieved thanks to the 25 centimeter
wide front wheel the rear wheel has a
standard bicycle size this type of
transport is perfect for off-road
driving and can be used as an
alternative to a flat bike the bicycle
is equipped with a 500 watt electric
motor the user still has to pedal but
thanks to the electric motor it's not
that difficult the vehicles powered by
48 volt battery the capacity of the
battery is 9 amp hours which allows you
to ride the bicycle 440 kilometers at
the same time the maximum speed of the X
terrain is 32 km/h the approximate cost
to this all-terrain bike is $1,500
concept 1865 BASF one of the largest
chemical concerns in the world
reinvented the penny-farthing a
retro-style bicycle with a big front
wheel and a small rear wheel and no
chain in the pedal drive the concept
1865 was built using only advanced
materials and the electronic motor parts
the wheel axles and the brakes are made
of metal the rest of the elements were
made from various types of foam rubber
and plastics epoxy resin and
polyurethane the front fork the frame
and the handlebar are made of carbon
fiber which provides really high
strength for the seat the manufacturer
chose Alaska flex W used in the
automotive industry the rear and front
wheels are made of thermoplastic the
diameter of the large front wheel which
is driven by pedals reaches 39 inches in
the middle of the rear 24-inch wheelers
are built in water block where the
electric drive is located
unfortunately this bicycle is made at a
single copy and therefore it's
impossible to buy it cycle ebike this
solid folding electric bike can wear
Stan loads of up to 150 kilograms is
available in four colors and optionally
supplemented with a second battery
the cycle ebike can reach 32 km/h and
travel for 64 kilometers without
recharging the folding frame provides
maximum ease of storing the bike
requiring a minimum amounts of space the
bicycle works in conjunction with the
special application that allows the
owner to track all necessary
characteristics including battery and
itinerary you can buy the cycle ebike
for $650
rumble this electric bike looks like a
real motorcycle and can reach 70 km/h in
just five seconds
at the same time in spite of being
absolutely eco-friendly it can produce
the characteristics sound of vehicles
equipped with a motor despite the fact
that the rumble weighs 105 kilograms it
easily overcomes slopes and the special
front wheel mounting design provides
high maneuverability the cost of this
motorcycle bike is $3,000
the cardboard bike in 2012 ishgard
Gaffney and Israeli mechanical engineer
and cycling enthusiast presented a
prototype of a bicycle made almost
entirely of cardboard all elements
including the frame the wheels the
handlebar and the seat consists of
sheets of cardboard folded and glued
together in a special way the weight of
this unusual vehicle is 9.1 kilograms
the bicycle is fireproof and waterproof
thanks to a special impregnation that
protects the cardboard base
in addition it can withstand a load of
up to 220 kilograms making the bike
suitable for any rider the tires are
made of hard rubber obtained from
recycled car tires the approximate cost
of this bicycle should be about 9 US
dollars which makes it the most
affordable vehicle in the world
diamondback andean the creation of this
triathlon bike took two years this is a
joint project of the company Diamondback
the Kevin qualms studio and the
University of Toronto Institute for
aerospace studies and the ins
fundamental difference from all sports
bikes is the use of the arrow course
scheme to minimize the air drag
basically you have two large wheels with
free space between them filled with a
frame of carbon fiber which avoids
turbulence while driving in addition to
outstanding aerodynamic performance and
leads monolithic design as another
interesting advantage over these
skeletons of conventional bicycles with
its own weight in 9.3 kilograms the bike
can serve as a mobile storage performing
the function of a backpack unfortunately
we couldn't find the price off this
bicycle
ethnic fad strike this tricycle for
adults is made of aluminium which
provides maximum ease and strength the
design guarantees stability and fast
movement in shallow water as well as on
sand and snow four inch wheels
contribute to better surface traction
and the electric motor makes it easier
to client the slopes you can buy this
tricycle for thirty six hundred dollars
on the official website of the
manufacturer
mr. Chia a designer from India created
this aerodynamic electric bicycle
equipped with a 350 watt electric motor
along with the battery it weighs 40
kilograms this electric bike stands out
mostly by the unusual position of the
user
despite its uniqueness not everyone will
like this bike since there's no seating
you have to drive it facing down there's
also no handlebar the driver holds on to
the ledges on the front wheel axle while
moving there is also no need to pedal
nevertheless mr. Chia can travel up to
30 kilometers after charging its battery
for an hour and according to its creator
all parts of the bike are self-made he
worked on this bicycle alone for 18
months</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
