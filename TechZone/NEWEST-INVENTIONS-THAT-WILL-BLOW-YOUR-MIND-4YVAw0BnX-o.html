colorful underwater world and admire the
colorful fish and strange corals with
their own eyes and not only on the TV
today to do it you don't have to spend a
lot of time learning how to dive there
are ways to explore the underwater world
even without the slightest risk of
getting wet one of them is a semi
submersible boat called penguin
most often these marine vessels are used
in the Maldives for tourist excursions
but first size it may seem that penguin
is a common small boat because its
unique feature is hidden under the water
the boat is equipped with a special
watching area located below the water
level the windows are mounted in the
side so the observer has an overview of
180 degrees in places where such
excursions are often held the fish are
not afraid of the boat and swim up to
the cabins so close that in fact they're
at arm's length the device is absolutely
safe the person in the cabin is not
subjected to any pressure so the
excursions are suitable for people of
any age from children's for seniors
ermm Oh
recently people are becoming more and
more serious about compact electric
vehicles this is logical and natural
because it's an environmentally friendly
and sometimes more affordable
alternative to any other means of
transportation the main advantage of
these vehicles is their compactness
however modern manufacturers are working
to improve this feature that is to make
electric vehicles even more compact Omo
looks like a hoverboard but unlike it it
has a folding structure and therefore
takes up much less space at the same
time the technology of riding
practically does not differ from riding
a standard hoverboard in any case if the
person doesn't have much experience
riding such vehicles the learning
process will not take more than five
minutes just look how easy to use the MO
is you just have to grab the handle
located between the foot platforms and
the vehicle will change its size when
folded it doesn't need the size of a
briefcase so you can take it with you on
public transport or even shove it into a
cars stuffed trunk it's also noteworthy
that the weight of ammo is only six and
a half kilograms at the same time the
device achieves a speed of up to 15
kilometers per hour has a charge of
twenty kilometers and a full charge
takes only two hours another advantage
is the glowing lights that make riding
at night safer it costs about twenty two
hundred dollars
total the creators of the device that
you see on the screen wanted to develop
something to give a person access to the
gym anytime anywhere the results of
several years of work was the tonal
exercise machine which allows you to
keep yourself in good physical shape and
train at home the way a person would
train in a gym with a personal trainer
when folded the equipment doesn't take
up extra space as it's attached to the
wall a built-in touch screen allows you
to follow the tip of a virtual trainer
in addition tone allows you to perform
exercises with weights just like in a
classical training device
the manufacturer claims that tone or can
do the work of all training machines of
any gym it gives almost unlimited
opportunities for training you can work
out a variety of muscle groups
interestingly the device independently
selects the level of resistance of the
mechanisms for exercising and increases
it as the owner becomes stronger it's
also able to register various parameters
and after training show the range of
motion the power of motion and much more
tonal even keeps a training calendar and
shows you your progress and how much
stronger you are you can purchase the
device for $3,000
Ikaros in ancient Greek mythology
there's a story about Icarus a character
who loves flying this is a device called
a Karass
and it seems that it's connection with
Icarus is not accidental on the outside
the person using the device looks like
they're floating in the air and they are
actually flying however only in virtual
reality air cross is designed to break
the common stereotype that gamers don't
exercise and don't go to the gym
because one flight session in virtual
reality is simulator with fully fledged
training of the whole body the device
although it has bulky dimensions is very
simple on the inside the person rests
with their elbows and knees on the
special supports wearing a VR helmet or
VR glasses movements in real life become
movements in the virtual world that is
to play the person has to move their
body in the game the person's given the
opportunities of being the role of an
aircraft which flies among the Alpine
mountains thus almost all major muscle
groups are subjected to physical
activity
freefly Alta 8 in the modern world
drones perform many different functions
they can take pictures and video from a
great height put out fires and track
down criminals however it recently it
became clear that you can even surf with
drones the video demonstrated the work
of the multi-purpose unmanned aerial
vehicle free fly Alta 8
the video shows the power of the device
initially it was planned that it would
be used only as a means of observation
of patrolling but soon turned out that
it has enough power to pull a person
along the water despite its modest size
the drone is only one point one meters
long it can reach speeds of up to 75
km/h and rise to heights of up to 300
meters
lacks there are moments in life when
you're so tired that you desperately
want to sit no matter where you are but
there's no way to do that the Lexx
device was designed to solve this
problem its producers are sure this
invention can make people's lives more
comfortable safe and healthy
Lex is an exoskeleton seating system
while the person is walking he doesn't
feel the presence of Lex however if the
person wants to sit down he can do his
right where he is no chair needed the
legs of the exoskeleton bends providing
optimal support to sit the device is
made of lightweight aluminium selects
doesn't add an extra load to the body
and the person doesn't experience
fatigue the exoskeleton is installed
quickly and easily and the process only
takes 30 seconds
Lexa's attach with straps to the waist
and to both legs and according to the
