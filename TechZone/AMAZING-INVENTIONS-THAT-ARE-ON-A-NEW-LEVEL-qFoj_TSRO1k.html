seal the joints on dancin stage Florrie
and fasten cables manually they had to
work in an uncomfortable position for a
long time which only made the process
longer luckily today there are more and
more floor tape applicators like this
gaff gun was developed by American
engineers and does more than just
dealing with these tasks it can also be
used to apply signal and warning tapes
the device enormous Lee accelerates this
monotonous and tedious work you can see
that when the cables are taped they're
not even lying flat the funnel guide
lays the cables correctly by itself an
adjustable adapter allows you to work
with different widths of adhesive tapes
and the price is 219 dollars
portable speed bump at first glance this
speed bump is no different from any
others that you can see on the road
however there is a difference its
portability what you're looking at is a
folding system that can be installed
anywhere when you don't need it you can
fold it and put it away
this invention weighs only 11 kilograms
the modular system allows you to connect
two or more devices together to block
several lanes at once you can also
install reflective poles to help drivers
see the speed bump even at night the
device costs a hundred and seventy
dollars
platform gate trains are one of the
safest means of transportation serious
accidents when people are injured are
relatively rare the situation on the
platform's though is very different if
the station is full of people almost
every passenger is under risk of being
pushed straight onto the railway tracks
in front of a train that's why the
authorities are inventing new ways to
protect people this protective fence can
be found in the osaka prefecture in
japan it protects people at the Ibaraki
railway station
you can see how cleverly it's designed
since the platform's very long it
wouldn't be very convenient to make a
folding fence instead it was decided to
make an elastic fence made of fabric
when the train stops near the platform
the gate Rises and hangs above the
passengers thanks to the soft material
it's easily folded so as to not bother
even the tallest people however when
unfolded the fence has the optimal
heights to prevent people from
overcoming it
effie the people who invented this
product compared irons and heating water
for washing with a bonfire because these
technologies are outdated now it's time
for the tedious ironing to disappear
from our lives EFI is an innovative
device that can dry and iron clothes in
minutes you don't need to make any
effort or waste your time all you have
to do is hang the garments on the
special holder and then press the start
button Fe dries and irons clothes for
the hot press the set includes hangers
with adjustable hook plate so that you
can use Fe on oil types of clothes even
for children at the same time you can
hang up to 12 things on the device all
of them will be ironed one by one it
takes the Machine about three minutes to
process each garment
effie is paired with a smartphone app
that allows you to monitor the device's
performance you can buy this automatic
ironing closet for approximately $900
drummy you can wash your clothes quickly
and efficiently without using a modern
expensive washing machine drum II is the
brainchild of the Canadian company yet
Reger it allows you to clean things with
minimal effort and without wasting
electricity the drum of this washing
machine can hold up to seven items of
clothing it consumes about nine litres
of water soo while conventional washing
machines use about 40 litres in one
cycle the machine is powered by a foot
pump which means that the user has to
press a special pedal one cycle of work
takes from five to ten minutes during
this time drummy manages to wash rinse
and spin the clothes the manufacturer
suggests using this device on trips or
as an alternative to hand washing for
delicate garments the price is three
hundred and fifty dollars Gardi and GT
nowadays there are already smart
exoskeletons that can take the abilities
of the human body to a new level one of
them is the Guardian GT the device that
you can see on the screen this is a
development of the American company
sarcos robotics the robot is something
like the kinematic equivalent of a human
being to control the robot you don't
need to take a special training course
it's very intuitive all you have to do
is put on the glasses and sensors and
then the robotic arms start to repeat
the movements of the body with utmost
precision and smoothness the robot can
carry up to 450 kilograms of weight
including quite fragile objects the
mechanical hands turn and manipulate
things very delicately
the problem with moe
these robots is this while having great
power they aren't very agile Guardian GT
does not have this drawback the
manipulators have a built-in tactile
feedback system
it's detectors are so sensitive that the
operator can even feel the robotic arms
pushing the buttons in addition when the
robot is lifting weights the operator
feels the load put on a smaller scale a
maximum load the user feels as if he or
she were holding a two kilogram object
in their hands
this makes control even more accurate in
the future these robots will be used in
the construction industry or in rescue
operations for example
snappy screen being exposed to the Sun
for long periods of time is a key factor
in the development of skin cancer that's
why doctors recommend using special
sunscreens most people are too lazy to
use them all the time while others
simply don't like the feeling of this
sticky substance on their bodies the
solution to the problem is the snappy
screen stations designed specifically
for spraying sunscreen on on the outside
they resemble a vertical tanning booth
however instead of a radiation a person
receives a dose of sunscreen you can
choose the level of protection from the
Sun as well as the area where the cream
will be sprayed surprisingly the
procedure takes exactly 20 seconds
ex9 follow and this invention will
definitely appeal to people who like to
spend their free time on the golf course
the fact is that the weight of the golf
bag can reach 20 if not 30 kilograms in
order to spare people the hassle of
having to carry the weight on their own
Stuart golf has developed the smart cart
x9 follow it can work in two modes in
the first one you push it in front of
you while holding the handle in the
second it activates the follow me mode
the carts determines the location of the
remote control and follows it of course
the user keeps this remote control the
compact size allows you to hang it on
your pocket the owner can also specify
the direction for the cart the speed of
the device is adjustable to match the
user's walking speed
a remarkable feature of the x9 follow is
its stability thanks to which it can
drive even on uneven surfaces up or down
hill there is a compartment to store
food and drinks to and the price of the
vehicle is about $2,000</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
