may seem like a simple task but it
requires precision accuracy and of
course a certain skill from the master
traditionally in order to erect a brick
wall a large number of tools are used
for example a trowel to apply mortar
pick up the excess and adjust the bricks
in addition it's always necessary to
ensure that the gaps are the right size
about three millimeters larger or
smaller gaps can have a negative impact
on working prophecies our go fast is a
device designed to make it easier for
experienced bricklayers and beginners
alike to light bricks it reduces the
number of tools that have to be used in
the wall construction process it
consists of two parts
one allows you to apply a layer of
mortar by the horizontal join neatly and
evenly with the second tool you can
create a vertical joint with the mortar
neatly and evenly stacked on the header
using artifice allows you to reduce the
consumption of mortar and also greatly
accelerates the work flow it's
noteworthy that the width of the device
can be adjusted to suit any type of
brick
seeker postfix this is a kind of
solution for the installation of various
supports and pods with its help you can
quickly and most importantly cheaply
build a fence a small structure on
supports or install a mailbox the
manufacturer believes secret postfix is
a revolutionary substitute for concrete
a bag like this one you see on the
screen wastes slightly more than a
kilogram make a replace 225 kilogram
bags of concrete notice that no special
tools are needed to use this solution
all you need is a knife scissors and
some protective equipment like gloves
and glasses the support is installed in
a pre-drilled hole for it
the seeker postfix package has two
components with separated important
components of the solution during the
process the master rolls the bag on one
side so that the divider breaks and then
mixes the components within 20 seconds
then he throws the hole with the
resulting solution within three minutes
it will increase in size filling the
entire space and then becoming solid
excess material can be cut from above
with a knife and then the hole must be
covered with a layer of soil complete
solidification of the solution takes two
hours after which the pole is firmly and
securely fixed in the ground
MTA manhole covers usually weigh more
than 50 kilograms they are massive and
heavy on purpose so that they won't move
even under heavy traffic in addition
it's very difficult to lift it alone
which prevents theft at the same time
however this design makes the job of
municipal service employees very
difficult the Austrian company MTA is
engaged in the production of special
hydraulic lifts which allow removing
covers quickly and relatively easily
thanks to its powerful magnets and
levers the series includes several
different models the MTA nine is
equipped with nine magnets it weighs
only four kilograms critical lift covers
weighing up to 230 kilograms
the MTA 10 is a more powerful model with
sixteen magnets to lift Hatch's up to
300 kilograms the MTA
11 uses 18 magnets to lift up to 420
kilograms and finally the MTA 90 is a
device that works in conjunction with
the MTA 10 or the MTA 11 it can lift
metal loads weighing up to 600 kilograms
thus this unique device makes work
easier ensures the safety of workers and
saves time
Tyl is traditionally grouting tiles as a
complex time-consuming and painstaking
job the task is complicated by the fact
that when it comes to floor tiles we
have to work in an uncomfortable
position standing on your knees right on
the floor
the fatigue caused by such conditions
leads to an additional waste of time
like all the other device is shown in
today's video tire lease is designed to
make construction work easier speed up
the work and save time money
it's a machine for grouting joints it's
noteworthy that with this device it's
possible to grab 90 square meters of
tiles per hour
thanks to the special design of the
machine the rollers move in different
directions effectively filling the
joints in this way that Saleh's moves
and works at the speed of a person
working slowly
Papi's here is an innovative device
designed to remove old popcorn ceiling
texture quickly and easily usually
people use a scraper for this purpose
which is quite effective but pieces of
material fall on the workers head after
that they often end up on the floor
which means that the process can be
messy you can attach a plastic bag to
the scraper to avoid falling debris but
as it fills up it becomes heavier which
increases the load on your arms poppies
is basically the same scraper but it has
a hole at the end so that you can attach
it to a vacuum cleaner remarkably not
only does the device allow you to scrape
the old text of the ceiling away it also
provides a high level of safety the
scraper is attached to a long handle so
it can be operated standing on the floor
without the risk of falling off a ladder
it can be bought for forty four dollars
roofing power ladders and hoists there
are a huge number of stages to building
a house one of the most dangerous
processes for the workers is installing
the roof people after work at high
altitudes moving on a steep surface in
such situations falling off the roof and
getting hurt is very easy the video
shows the special safety hoist ladders
and the lifts
they're designed to simplify roofing and
make the work safer for people they have
a lot of advantages - for example they
hoist sup portable compact and
relatively inexpensive they lift
building materials upstairs in seconds
freeing people from the need to climb
stairs with a load in their hands these
ladders and hoists are ideal for lifting
up tiles felt insulation plywood and
even solar panels
quad so the so you see on the screen
will be a great help for electricians
that allows you to cut straight
rectangular holes in the drywall and
similar materials at minutes cord saw
was developed by specialists at the
British company genius IP it uses a
patented technology a metal frame fixes
the device that uses four serrated
stores to cut a rectangular or square
hole in the wall the sole is basically a
nozzle that works with any standard
drill the squad store allows you to
quickly make tiny holes the only
drawback is that the device isn't
powerful enough to cut through a
concrete or an ion war
hey stop being lazy it's time to use
that brain of yours welcome to brain
time incredible facts from the past the
present and even the future the power of
