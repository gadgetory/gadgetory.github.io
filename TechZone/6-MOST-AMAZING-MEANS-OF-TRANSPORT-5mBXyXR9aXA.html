air this innovative single seater
airplane has been brought in to replace
self-balancing scooters hoverboards and
jetpacks
the flyboard air looks like a vehicle of
the future and makes us think about the
day when people will switch from cars
and public transport to flying machines
this vehicle is designed based on a
conventional fly board which uses
powerful water jets to lift a person in
the air the flyboard air in turn is
equipped with jet engines that run on
kerosene fuel fuel is fed to the engine
from a backpack located on the riders
back
therefore the creators managed to get
rid of the unnecessary pipes and cables
which connect the device to the ground
in the pilots hands there is a control
panel according to the creators the most
difficult stage in the creation of the
flyboard air was the development of the
engine it wasn't easy to design it to be
lightweight only around three kilograms
and produce more than 30 kilograms of
traction and not waste too much fuel at
the moment the device can lift a weight
of a hundred kilograms developing speeds
of up to 140 km/h during six minutes of
flight the developers however continue
to improve the vehicle and soon that top
speed will be 200 km/h the flight
capacity will increase to 30 minutes and
the load capacity to 200 kilograms
Porsche 996 hoverboard the Bell and
bells studio based in Barcelona is
working on the creation of a hoverboard
based on the Porsche 996 this company
creates custom vehicles and furniture
from unusual materials the Porsche 996
hoverboard is a unique vehicle assembled
completely by hand
a real car was used as the basis for its
manufacture before that the company
develops static furniture and different
sofas in the shape of cars the Porsche
996 hoverboard is one of the first
models to adopt the ability of the
original car to move independently the
developers thought that a sofa that you
can travel on for example from the
living rooms of the kitchen is an
incredibly useful invention and they
were right the device will go on sale in
the second half of 2018 at the moment
there's no information on price capacity
and exact dimensions
deep flight the name of this device
speaks for itself it was created for
deep flights that is underwater it's
quite easy to imagine as the exterior of
the device is more or less like an
aeroplane deep flight is an individual
submarine with a glazed cockpit for the
pilots and passengers who enjoy the
underwater scenery the first model the
super Falcon is quite large measuring
5.9 meters long 2.7 meters wide and 1.6
meters high the vehicle can travel to a
depth of a hundred meters and is
designed for passengers with a total
mass of no more than 250 kilograms is
designed in such a way that it's
environmentally friendly traveling
quickly but also in absolute silence
another model the improved Super Falcon
3s also descends to a depth of 100
meters but is designed to support a
total weight of up to 375 kilograms and
although this device is a true submarine
the board has a very unconventional
appearance the creators of deep flight
wanted everyone without special training
to be able to use the vehicle that's why
the controls are intuitive and training
is minimal the cockpits designed to
protect the pilots and passengers from
pressure the creators claim that their
device is absolutely safe and in any
unforeseen situation it automatically
rises to the surface
nice and blade glider this unusual
vehicle was first shown in 2013 but
since then miss Sam has continued to
refine it
thus in June 2017 the functional
prototype of the blade glider
participated in the Goodwood Festival of
Speed the car combines respect for the
environment with impressive dynamic
characteristics is part of the Nissan
project to develop zero emission
vehicles the main blade glider is not
accidental as this electric vehicle
literally glides on the road as it has a
silent power unit and an aerodynamic
shape
the model has a fundamentally new
configuration a narrow front and wider
wheels this design gives the car optimum
aerodynamic characteristics it also
ensures reliable control the roof has an
open structure however it's equipped
with a reinforcement frame for greater
safety and the event of tipping over is
worth paying attention to the high
midline of the body and the hinged
butterfly wing doors that make every
exit and entrance extremely impressive
as already mentioned instead of fuel the
car uses electricity there's however
doesn't prevent it from achieving great
power it's capable of accelerating up to
190 km/h in addition the acceleration
time from 0 to 100 km/h is less than 5
seconds tricker here we have a unique
three-wheeled vehicle that looks like a
scooter but has much more outstanding
technical features each model is
equipped with tricker Tech's patented 3
CV system which allows the rider to
travel without pedals and even without
having to touch the ground with their
feet the movement is similar to that of
some skates since to move the tricker
the user pushes with one foot making an
arch and moves the other foot and so on
it's worth noting that a trip on the
trekker can replace a visit to the gym
thanks to his unique design the user
uses almost all the muscle groups during
the trip the manufacturer produces
different models of the trekker
weighing between 5 and 13 kilograms the
body is made of durable aluminium and
the brakes provide a high level of
street safety thanks to the use of
electricity as fuel the trigger is also
environmentally friendly the
high-capacity battery allows models to
travel up to 45 kilometres on a single
charge
a definite advantage is the foldable
design the vehicle is not only easy and
convenient to store but can even be
carried on public transport the cost of
this electric vehicle depends on the
model varying between 220 and 1100
dollars
icon a5 on the screen we have an
ultralight aircraft developed by the
american company icon aircraft he was
first introduced in 2008 but the first
serial model was launched only in 2015
in short the icon a5 is a high wing
monoplane with carbon-fiber fuselage and
retractable landing gear it should be
noted that the model has folding wings
which can be retracted manually or using
an optional electromechanical unit
therefore being folded the icon a5 is
compact and can be easily transported
the aircraft is equipped with a 100
horsepower Rotax 912 is engine is
designed to transport two people the
creators wanted to simplify the handling
of the aircraft as much as possible
which is why the interior of the cabin
is more similar to the interior of a car
for added safety the icon a5 is equipped
with an emergency parachute capable of
safely landing the aircraft in an event
of an emergency situation without
damaging the fuselage the maximum speed
that the aircraft can develop is a
hundred and seventy-six kilometres per
hour
the range of flight is 791 kilometers
the device can take off and land either
on land or water hey stop being lazy
it's time to use that brain of yours
welcome to brain time incredible facts
from the past the present and even the
future the power of nature and wild
animals amazing facts and unsolved
mysteries you'll find all this and much
more hair subscribe now you won't regret
it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
