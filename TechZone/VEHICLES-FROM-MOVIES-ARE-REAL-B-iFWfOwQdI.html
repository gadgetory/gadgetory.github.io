in the movie Tron Legacy which appeared
on screens in 2010 there was a
spectacular motorcycle with an unusual
look apparently experts from the Parker
Brothers workshop located in the city of
Melbourne Florida had the idea to
recreate this amazing vehicle after
watching the film three years later the
experts presented the neutron bike all
its details are amazing
from its futuristic appearance to the
possibility of driving us on the most
ordinary urban roads the neutron bike
can reach a speed of 160 kilometers per
hour inside the motorcycle there's an
electric motor which allows driving a
distance of up to 130 kilometers on a
single charge so now the film fans have
the opportunity to purchase the neutron
bike for example in 2018 25 of these
motorcycles were created
the Lockheed sr-71 a sometimes real
military equipment is used in films and
that is exactly what happened with the
supersonic strategic reconnaissance
aircraft that Lockheed sr-71 the
unofficial but more famous name of the
aircraft is the Blackbird the main
feature of this vehicle is the ability
to fly very high and very fast that is
why while dodging rockets a blackbird
can perform acceleration maneuvers and
sudden changes of altitude this
reconnaissance aircraft was used by the
US Air Force despite the fact that the
aircraft was commissioned back in 1966
even today it has a very futuristic
appearance so there's nothing surprising
in the fact that the plane was shown in
such films as x-men first class and
Edwards who the Lockheed sr-71 AE can
reach speeds of up to 3,500 kilometers
per hour and the maximum flight height
is 29,000 meters
that spot
there have been many films about Batman
however in the Nolan trilogy the famous
bat-cycle known as the Batpod first
appears in the film The Dark Knight in
2010 two years after the film was
released the American workshop chopper
sissy created a replica of the Batman
motorcycle its appearance is almost
completely similar to the original
thankfully only the appearance because
the real bat pod is armed with a
machine-gunner grenade gun and other
weapons all this is hardly useful to an
ordinary person on the road the replica
is known as the PS Pot the chopper City
USA experts assure that their creation
is the first working replica of the
bat-cycle in the world suitable for
driving on ordinary roads
millennium falcon from the first moment
that this spaceship was shown in the
Star Wars film fans all over the world
of dreamed of being inside it Gregg diet
rich and Jay quality did more than
dreaming and built their own Millennium
Falcon the most amazing thing was that
the idea turned out to be realistic
although in the end only the cabin was
built in their own garage the men
created a real spacecraft it took them
seven years to finish the life-size
cabin and every detail of the cabin was
similar to those of the ship shown in
the film
those who had a chance to visit the
cabbage say that the interior is created
with such precision that as soon as you
find yourself inside you instantly
recall the spaceship for the film as
well as the excitements and emotions
that it aroused the handmade Millennium
Falcon has a body chairs in a dashboard
and of course all the levers and buttons
are decorative even the creators of the
replica are not aware of their true
purpose amazingly every detail that you
see on the screen was made by hand to
make the final product as realistic as
possible
the creators even taught the cabin how
to shine and make sounds
iron man suit it is impossible to
imagine the price of the original iron
man armor created by Tony Stark
however we know the price not of the
original but of a toy armor created by
Toys Asia and it's from another world
because it costs three hundred and sixty
thousand dollars designers managed to
create a suit that brings cosplay to a
whole new level the appearance of this
mark 43 is almost identical to the armor
that was shown in the movie Avengers age
of Ultron of course it doesn't come with
a protection mode or an infrared scanner
it would seem that for such money the
suit could at least fly but this
function is not provided either the high
price is because of the manual work the
armor was assembled from 567 separate
parts which were very difficult to
combine with each other
the suit is human size and it's
noteworthy that each copy is created
individually according to the dimensions
of the user the developers place 46
small engines inside so that the costume
could transform and unfold as shown in
the video
Aston Martin db5 in his 25 different
films the superspy James Bond has
managed to drive a huge number of cars
however this particular Aston Martin db5
is considered the most recognizable Bond
car when it was first released in 1963
the db5 series became the logical
continuation of the previous dp4 series
few people know that the DB in the title
is not just random glasses but an
abbreviation which stands for David
Brown this man owned the company asked
Martin from 1947 to 1972 in total there
are 1021 such cars in the world the most
recognizable elements of the car or its
round shapes laconic features chrome
edge details and a huge grille the Aston
Martin db5 attracts attention at first
sight and thanks to this the car was
chosen as the perfect vehicle for James
Bond in the 60s and 70s its cost was
approximately $12,000 and today thanks
to the popularity of bond the price has
greatly increased for example the car
shown in the film Goldfinger was sold in
2010 for a record 4.6 million dollars
the cost of the cars used for the
promotion of the film is estimated at
2.6 million dollars the Mystery Machine
many people don't know the brand of the
car used by the legendary team of
fighters against paranormal creatures
along with scooby-doo so the team's van
was based on the Volkswagen t2 therefore
this particular model was used to create
a real prototype of the van from the
show
the manufacturer has paid attention to
both external and internal similarity
the interior of the van is made in
brights light green blue colors the same
as those applied to the body the
prototype was made by engineers at
Disney pay attention to the disco lamp
which creates a special atmosphere
instead of a Sun Visor you can see a
panel simulating paranormal detectors
ecto-1 and here's a replica of the car
shown in the movie ghostbusters released
in 1984 it's based on the 1960 Cadillac
Miller meteor nevertheless the original
car from the film is based on a 1959
Cadillac Year however they are extremely
rare and expensive in that year only 25
copies were released that is why the
replica was made from a car released a
year later of course the car that you
see on the screen wasn't in the film
however the interior and exterior design
were recreated quite accurately to add
realism to the car its developers even
added replicas of ghost fighting
equipment</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
