distinctive features of this tractor is
its ability to move on crawlers or on
wheels on the railway the special wheels
located in front and behind the crawlers
can be lowered and lifted
this allows the tractor to be an
effective tool for repairing railways as
it can carry pieces of rail tie them to
the right place and immediately lay them
in order to move comfortably often on
the railway the crawler wheelbase can
expand increasing its width to 9 feet
the tractor could also carry any other
cargo thanks to a suggestible sensor of
gravity the maximum speed of the machine
when traveling on the railroad is 25
miles per hour
Latour Noel 2350 this loader is by far
the largest wheel loader in the world in
general Latour Noel 2350 is used in the
mining industry particularly in the
extraction of iron and copper ore it's
twenty four foot wide bucket with a
capacity of 1,400 cubic feet has a
powerful hydraulic system and is capable
of lifting up to 72 tons of payload
under the hood of the vehicle there's a
20 300 horsepower 16 cylinder diesel
engine with a capacity of 65 litres
during an hour of work it consumes
almost a hundred and 70 litres of fuel
and over a day more than four thousand
liters
this huge car is not transported to the
place of work as a whole instead it's
assembled right in the quarry from
separate parts in the operators camp
there are no rudders or levers but only
two joysticks one of them controls the
movement of the loader itself and the
other the bucket all the other functions
like control of the maximum load mass
the state of all units and mechanisms
time parameters are all controlled by a
special electronic system
maneuverability of the loader is
provided by a powerful hydraulic drive
with a working pressure of 240
atmospheres the Latour Noel 2350 chassis
is supported by four huge wheels each
with a diameter of 13 feet and a width
of 6 feet the maximum speed of the car
is about 9 miles per hour
Terrax CCAT 801 this is a large double
crane which can lift weights up to 3200
tons in total it has a wheel track base
for partial movements on the
construction site
however the crane has restrictions when
moving on loose soils because of its
weight so to move to other construction
sites it has to be disassembled and
reassembled again the crane can be
controlled by several operators and it
has special equipments in the cabin
which allows monitoring and controlling
the process of lifting the loads the
boom of the crane can be rotated at a
maximum speed of 300 feet per minute
LeapPad t28 to see this heavy-duty dump
truck produced by the German company
leap hair is being produced since 2004
instead of the traditional instrument
panel the car cab has a display inside
the maximum operational weight of the
machine is 600 tonnes and the working
load capacity is 363 tonnes
the machine is 50 feet long 31 feet wide
and 26 feet high the leap 8282 C weighs
250 2 tons
the dump truck moves with a maximum
speed of 50 miles per hour and it has an
engine power of three thousand six
hundred and fifty horsepower or three
thousand five hundred horsepower
depending on the selected modification
gradall f a fire apparatus this is a
vehicle to help firefighters it's fire
hose rotates by a hundred and ten
degrees and rises to a height of a
hundred and fifteen feet when folded is
three times smaller which is convenient
for transportation the main purpose of
the machine is to provide water under
pressure to extinguish fires on the roof
of a burning building and through the
roof it goes directly into the source of
the fire thanks to a piercing nozzle at
the end of the boom of breaking through
the roof
from the same nozzle the water is
supplied on the pressure through 50
holes as an effective spray angle of 180
degrees the nozzle can also break
windows walls ceilings and even
reinforced concrete structures and thin
metal to get to the fire the machine is
equipped with four stabilizers located
on the sides all work can be carried out
and controlled remotely by one person
tarik CC 9800 this self-propelled
machine is designed for loading and
unloading operations and is based on the
CC 80 801 crane this model is the same
system of cables booms and hook blocks
as well as the CC 8800 one-way 3200 tons
the maximum length of the boom and the
jib at the CC 9800 is 512 and 390 for
free respectively
the machine can be used in a variety of
areas including the petrochemical
industry heavy industry and energy the
model provides a configuration for the
installation of an icon II 1 to 6 wind
turbines with a capacity of more than
six megawatts the load capacity of this
machine is 1600 tons
caterpillar mes 34 this particular
machine is a combination of two tractors
a driving base from a cat's tractor and
a movable base from a digger
the grader excavator is designed for
removing the layer of soil and
transporting it for example this may be
required in the preparation of
construction sites for buildings roads
and tunnels when it's necessary to have
an even surface on the air
the digger removes the ground using
blades and a chain dropping the soil
into the body of the machine the soil
can easily be poured out to the
unloading points in addition to cutting
the ground the machine has an
equalization function thanks to his body
the machine plows the ground slightly
and evenly distributes its partially
moving it from place to place
