multifunctional machine the robots
caterpillar base allows the installation
of a large number of hanging tools this
universal instrument allows carrying out
all kinds of tasks and construction this
assembling machine is designed to
perform long and effective work with a
hydraulic hammer the three sections of
the rotating arm allow the operator to
install the hydraulic hammer at a 90
degree angle on any surface ensuring the
highest possible clamping force
the conical claws the bushings the
reinforcements in the heaviest areas and
the powerful hydraulic cylinders provide
the reliability necessary to withstand
the vibration and shock loads generated
by the hydraulic hammer the electric
motor does not generate exhaust gas and
the robot can be used indoors hadrian
105 this machine can make brick work on
its own without human control its
product 70 is 225 bricks per hour four
times more than the capacity of a
bricklayer the engineers installed a
robotic mechanical arm in a heavy-duty
truck the operation of this device
resembled that of a conveyor belt or a
3d printer
the robot uses a three-dimensional model
and automatically builds a brick house
for this the machine uses an automated
3d projection system the device can
place bricks with a margin of error of
half a millimeter Road zipper this
system has been developed to increase
the capacity of the roads and to reduce
traffic jams using roads more
effectively and reducing the cost this
technology is used in controlled streets
and during the manufacturing of safe and
dynamic highways with the possibility of
changing the configuration of the road
in real time while preserving the
necessary protection barriers
this way the system can change the
amount of lanes on a road or increase in
decreases thickness according to the
traffic in the city
DXR 3:10 this machine is ideal for
demolishing buildings or for small jobs
at the open or indoors it's an ideal
solution in difficult conditions for
industrial jobs for example this device
can destroy a wide variety of material
it's ideal for the demolition of cement
and brick constructions stairs roofs
balconies and to work under difficult
conditions that enclosed spaces
the telescopic swivel arm of the dxr 310
covers a working area of about 18 feet
with the connected tool the machine has
been built with a high quality steel and
is able to extend heavy loads the
reliable and resistant construction is
been made by casting a tempered steel
cut with integrated lifting points
brach 90 this maneuverable machine can
perform demolitions in spaces where it
was only possible to use hand tools
brach 90 features a compact chassis an
11 kilowatt electric motor and a 12 foot
3 section manipulator specially
developed to withstand dynamic pressure
this construction allows working with a
powerful hydraulic hammer rock 90 can be
transported in an elevator and his
caterpillar base allows it to easily
move in areas more than 2.6 feet wide
this robot is the ideal candidate for
the best Universal demolition tool in
the world Guardian GT this robot has one
or two highly dexterous arms mounted on
a track or wheeled base it has attracted
the attention of many thanks to its
great technical characteristics a force
multiplying robotics system a load
capacity of about 400 pounds and a speed
of over 4 miles per hour
according to the developers this robot
can be used not only in construction
also industrial works but also helping
an emergency and other dangerous
situations since the operator can
control a robot from a significant and
safe distance TBMs 867 the operation of
this device has been inspired by nature
just like a worm
this machine thrusts its teeth into the
rock and lets it pass through in the
front it has a drill that uses cutting
surfaces made of tough tungsten carbide
chart carbide discs and special blades
for the sturdier rock path
the drill allows using this machine for
the creation of tunnels in mixed
terrains the diameter of the drill is 26
feet while the size of TBMs 867 is
almost 400 feet and its weight 660
tonnes GX DTC 50 thanks to its small
size this machine is very maneuverable
simple to transport and does not need
constant assistance which reduces
operating costs
the small size guarantees great
flexibility while working resulting in
greater productivity compared to larger
machines in addition the noise levels of
the GX dtc 50 are minimal
krawler 78 although this robot is
incredibly compact it can reach a
working height of 78 feet the robot is
maneuverable and able to penetrate
difficult places that other machines
cannot reach the crawler 78 can easily
enter Patheos overcome narrow fences and
descends steep slopes stairs and even a
swimming pool and despite not being very
heavy its forklift can withstand heavy
waste erode concrete this robot was
developed for fast and effective
demolition of concrete works thanks to
unique technological solutions this
robot does its work without leaving any
garbage or dust and the remaining
materials can be reused for the
construction of the buildings the robot
can do all this thanks to a water stream
with a great pressure that destroys
concrete or other building materials
turning the waste into a wet and
dust-free substance which can be
separated and act easily in special
compartments
this robot is not yet completely
finished and it's still being developed
nevertheless the concept has interested
very serious companies they consider
that a robot like this must appear in
the market</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
