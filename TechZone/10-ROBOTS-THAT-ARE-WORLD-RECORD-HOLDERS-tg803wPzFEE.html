rubik's cube in a little more than half
a second it finished the famous puzzle
in naught point six 37 seconds setting a
new world record sub one was designed by
Albert beer an engineer from Germany the
robot consoled the Rubik's Cube once the
built-in computer receives two photos of
the cube and determines the color of
each element complex algorithms start to
work and help to find the fastest way to
solve the puzzle
after that a microcontroller begins to
move and does the rest of the work
solving the Rubik's cubes in just 21
moves
alpha 1 s1 interesting record registered
in the famous Guinness Book of Records
belongs to an Android known as alpha 1 s
these robots were designed and
manufactured by up tech robotics in 2018
several groups of robots fought for the
right to be the largest number of robots
dancing at the same time the victory
went to the series of humanoid robots up
tech alpha 1s each robot is 40
centimetres high and the Alpha 1s models
are made of aluminium and plastic thanks
to this the up tech robots can perform
various movements including dancing more
than 1372 robot alpha one s's took part
in the event they did a great job and
now occupy a place in the Guinness Book
of Records
for Fears the Japanese company Omron
presented a robot that not only can play
table tennis but is also able to train
others for feeis is the world's first
robot designed to Train athletes for
this achievement the Japanese robot was
awarded an honorary place in the
Guinness Book of Records the for Fears
can move around the field using motion
sensors and cameras that move at a pace
of 80 frames per second using these
devices the robot tracks the movements
of the tennis ball the movements and
position of the opponents and it can
also calculate and anticipate human
reactions in addition for Fears can
highlight the area of the field where
the ball will fly after the impact thus
helping to work out various strokes and
combinations a rating program based on
artificial intelligence is capable to
estimate the level of preparation of the
user and create an optimum training
program
penguin robot this unusual robotic
penguin named jumpin comes from Japan
and became famous after it set a record
for jumping rope and entered the
Guinness Book of Records jumping was
created at the National Institute of
Technology in Japan
the developers presented this robot of
the Robocon where jumpin showed its
ability to jump two employees were
turning the rope for it and the
miniature robot was shown on a big
screen jumping after each successful
jump the rope made a 360-degree turn and
the robot continued to jump as a result
jump and successfully completed 106
jumps
Cheeta the world's first cybernetic
cheetah was shown in the US this robot
was ordered by the military on the
outside it's not very similar to a
living cheetah but thanks to its
capacities it's considered the fastest
robot on the planet
of course the cheetah is still too slow
to compete with a live cheetah which can
reach a speed of 115 km/h but engineers
want to bring the robots capabilities to
the level of living creatures the robot
cheetah built by Boston Dynamics
develops a speed of twenty nine
kilometers per hour this robot has a
running technique similar to that of the
real predator for example to increase
the length of the step and its speed the
cheetah can bend its back
trudeau this robot is 8.1 meters high
this robot was designed and manufactured
in the German city of Sant the walking
robot could not only walk but even
breathe fire after creating this giant
robot the company's Ola electronic AG
entered the Guinness Book of Records the
Titanic robot dragon known as Trudeau is
almost 17 meters long the robot moves on
four legs and exhales fire from the
mouth and nostrils it's also worth
noting that the wingspan of the giant
robot reaches 12 meters and the total
weight of Trudeau is 11 tonnes
mega copter this unusual drone known as
mega copter entered the Guinness Book of
World Records as the most capable weight
lifting remote control multicopter the
device in fact is a huge structure
consisting of many interconnected drones
which carry a load of slightly more than
61 kilograms at a height of more than a
meter above the ground for 30 seconds
this is an absolute world record for now
according to official data the maximum
load capacity of the mega copter is
about 150 kilograms but it's not known
how it can fly and how long it will last
in the air kirobo mini this partner
robot from the company Toyota can
interact with humans the height of the
kirova mini in a sitting position
reaches 10 centimeters thanks to its
compact dimensions the robot fits in the
palm of your hand and can follow you
around the day wherever you go the robot
can remember faces it recognizes human
speech supports conversation on
different topics reacts to emotions and
accompanies words with hand and face
gestures these functions are based on
speech and face recognition technologies
developed by Toyota for its cars but
there is more to the car over Mini
among other things it's the world's
first astronaut robot which was put into
orbit on August the 4th 2013 on a cargo
spacecraft
Keuka kr 1000 Titan the world's first
six axis heavy-duty robot with open
kinematics and unique load carrying
capacity is designed for the foundry
automotive construction and glass
industries it accurately and quickly
performs manipulation of heavy loads up
to a distance of six and a half meters
the maximum lifting capacity of the
robot is 1,300 kilograms a true record
which allows it to work with engine
blocks stones glass steel beams ship
parts aircraft marble blocks massive
objects heavy parts and their components
the accuracy of the kr 1000 Titan allows
you to improve the quality of production
and reduce costs in addition small
interference contours increase the
working area
piano tiles - robot piano tiles 2 is a
popular mobile arcade game built on the
principle of classical rhythm games
where you need to hit certain tiles in
time with the music and avoid clicking
on other elements on the screen this
game not only trains sense of rhythm but
also develops a tension the robot
playing design is quite simple the phone
camera is used to read information about
the tiles on the iPad screen during the
game while the robot attached to the
phone receives the image analyzes it and
activates small hammers that touch the
screen at the right time in place
hitting the black tiles
in the end the robot managed to break
the record of the game piano tiles to
pressing 21 black tiles a second</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
