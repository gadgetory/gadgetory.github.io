a Design College is a hybrid vehicle
that combines elements of a helicopter
and a small plane in order to fly the
helicopter needs a usual helipad and
once in the air the triple chassis
automatically hides inside the body in
airplane mode ASAP can reach speeds of
up to 220 miles per hour thanks to its
streamlined shape and additional
propellers on the wings

ball-shaped float vehicles will fly
above the ground using magnetic
levitation a sphere resembling a soap
bubble can carry one or two passengers
and you can call this unusual unmanned
vehicle with a special mobile
application two or more of these cars
can travel together using additional
external magnetic belts while the
passengers will be able to communicate
with each other using special

transparency at the surface of the
sphere which resembles a durable glass
can be changed by the user at will in
order to get more exciting and
unforgettable impressions of the ride in
this unusual transport
Smart vision eq4 - designed as a part of

ear Ingo designer Mohammed gazelle
created a three-wheeled car project it
stands out from other vehicles by the
fact that the wheels are located not in
the form of a triangle but in a row
according to the designer the car will
use mainly the central wheel which will
control any movement the other wheels
are used only if there is one instead of
two people in the car which is the ideal
number to keep the vehicle balanced in
this case the wheels simply rotate at
different speeds

sharp turns in addition there is one
small wheel on each side of the e-ring
go they are used for parking or to enter
