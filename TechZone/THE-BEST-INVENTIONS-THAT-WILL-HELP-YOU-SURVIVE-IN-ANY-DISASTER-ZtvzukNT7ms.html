problem of frequent floods more and more
acute this is why people need more
devices and ways to protect themselves
and their property traditional methods
of protection are outdated they're not
very effective and a large number of
people or equipment are needed to build
sandbag fences protective barriers like
the one you see on the screen can solve
the problem damn easy is an effective
solution for protecting your home when
the water level rises it can be quickly
and easily installed at the doorway now
after which it can block the entrance
from water and prevent it from leaking
into the crevices is noteworthy that one
person with a wrench can install the
barrier the dam easy side parts fit
tightly into the aisle sealing it and
providing maximum protection against
water up to 70 centimeters high the
advantage is that the system is
expandable and suitable for a wide
variety of passages from 78 to 110
centimeters
Watergate this is an emergency flood
protection system made of soft materials
the main feature of water cases that it
uses flood water for unfolding and
stabilizing according to the
manufacturer the system represents a new
generation of barriers and can
significantly simplify River operations
Watergate is quick and easy to install
and 200 meters of protection can be
unfolded in just five minutes the
installation doesn't require any
equipment or electricity once installed
the fence will effectively protect the
area and buildings from water and dirt
it's designed for water flow of up to
two meters high it's noteworthy that one
single water gate down provides the same
level of protection as ten pallets of
sandbags
the system can be installed on any type
of soil and is tightly attached to the
ground regardless of the terrain it can
be easily installed even at slopes
grass paving stones or gravel additional
benefits also include money saving as
the same barrier can be used several
times and it's easily repaired the
announced lifetime of the water gate is
30 years
you safe life belts are used to help
drowning people having saved a huge
number of lives in a hundred years since
its invention and although it's simple
and effective the specialists at the
Portuguese company Norris Performance
thought about how much more useful what
life belts be to humankind if they could
be controlled these thoughts inspired
engineers to create a unique
self-propelled remote control life belt
the you safe the devices use shape -
instead of the traditional circle
straight hence the name the device is
equipped with two compact water jet
propellers is possible to control the
depth from the shore berth or deck and
it's able to move away from the operator
at a distance a lot to fight kilometers
weighing only eight kilograms the you
safe can withstand loads of up to 200
kilograms which means that it can be
used to carry almost any personnel to
the water nowadays Knorr performance
engineers are working on creating more
advanced versions of the you safe
they're planning to create a device that
will be able to save several people at
once and a device that will save people
on its own without an operator
han Solo 11 and the AL pride II won
black diamond equipment is an American
company that produces equipment for
climbing skiing and mountain sports its
specialists are constantly developing
new ways to protect the lives and health
of people who lead an active lifestyle
and go to the mountains every once in a
while a few years ago two new products
were introduced known as the Han Solo 11
and the ALP ride e1 the first one is a
backpack which as it may seem at first
is no different from any other however
there is an air cushion inside which
opens as soon as the carrier presses a
button
thus in just two seconds the backpack
becomes a life saving tool and falling
off a clip it only weighs 2.7 kilograms
and is plenty of room inside to store
your belongings you can buy this
backpack for $1000
the Alfred e1 is designed for people who
prefer to spend time on snowy slopes the
backpack significantly increases the
chance to be saved in case a person is
course in an avalanche the pillow has a
capacity of 150 litres and inflates in
just three seconds when it opens it
helps the writer to stay on the surface
of the avalanche preventing him or her
from going deep under the snow in fact
an avalanche cushion is their kind of
float it's also big and elastic enough
to protect a person from hitting trees
and rocks the cost of the out Bridey one
is $1,200
puta even if you know how to swim
there's always a small risk of drowning
mostly in a natural pond the problem is
especially acute for children and
parents are forced to keep an eye on
them even during their vacation when
they go to the beach when you drive a
car you're protected by airbags when you
ride a bicycle you wear a helmets and
other protective equipment however
nothing like this has been invented for
water there are only bulkier not very
comfortable rings and sleeves
the engineers had created Pluto decided
to put an end to that when folded the
device looks like a collar it's small
compact wise only 280 grams and doesn't
prevent people from swimming the
manufacturer offers closer in three
sizes for both adults and children in
the event of an unforeseen situation
when a person feels that they're
drowning they just need to press a
button on the device special pumps for
the cushions with carbon dioxide in a
few seconds pushing the person to the
surface the tanks are also replaceable
so closer can be used repeatedly and its
price is $70
survival capsule you're looking at the
invention of two engineers from Seattle
who wanted to create a device that could
save lives curing a tsunami the
resulting rescue capsule can accommodate
up to two people who can stay inside for
up to five days without risking their
life the capsule is made of sturdy
aircraft aluminium and is airtight so no
water gets in the device withstands
blows from blunt and sharp objects and
protects people even then falling from a
height
the manufacturer offers five models of
different sizes depending on the number
of seats in the capsule all of them are
similar in appearance the cabin is
equipped with seats with seat belts and
a five-day supply of food at water also
the Captur can be equipped with solar
panels a dry toilet additional lighting
and even a music system according to the
developers the capsule always remains on
the surface of the water
and in addition the temperature inside
is kept stable and comfortable
thus the survival capsule is able to
protect people who didn't have time to
evacuate during a tsunami a Salado a
hurricane or even an earthquake</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
