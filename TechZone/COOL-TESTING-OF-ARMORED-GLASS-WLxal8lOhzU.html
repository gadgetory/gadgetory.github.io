subject to different security
requirements depending on the purpose
for which the building is used when it
comes to luxury shops banks or other
facilities that need to be well
protected perhaps the most common
measure to improve security is the
installation of anti-theft glass there
are different levels of protection the
lowest level for example is designed to
withstand between 30 and 50 hits with
blunt or sharp objects the medium level
can withstand 50 to 70 heads and the
highest level will withstand more than
70 hits this level of resistance is
usually sufficient to protect the
building from intruders or at least to
delay them long enough to be able to
call the police in time
of course to be sure of the quality of
the products the companies that
manufacture this type of glass carry out
tests from time to time in this case
that says to the glass by British
company ESG glasses shown see how 13
millimeter glass of the highest class
p8b can withstand the intense impact of
a crowbar hammers and an axe the test
takes a minutes and a half and the glass
crumbles little by little but it doesn't
lose its integrity the secrets of the
resistance lies in a complex special
construction the manufacturer uses
several layers of glass which are glued
with a special polymer film this allows
the impact energy to be distributed
evenly over the surface keeping the
broken glass pieces in place
Cessna 172 the video shows the crash
test of the American light aircraft
Cessna 172 Skyhawk the aircraft was
launched against a concrete surface from
a height of 25 meters the test was
conducted in the city of Hampton
Virginia at the Langley Research Center
owned by NASA three emergency beacons
were installed on board the purpose of
the event was to test them in particular
these beacons transmit the distress
signal to the search and rescue forces
in recent years the technology
incorporated into these beacons has
improved significantly
now the beacons can transmit their own
coordinates using information from
onboard equipment or satellite systems
the radio beacon can be activated
manually or automatically when an
emergency situation is detected
remarkably there's no way to cancel the
distress signal sent even if the beacon
is turned off and the signal is lost
unfortunately the sensor doesn't always
transmit the signal correctly and
accurately
that's why research and testing are
still ongoing and scientists are working
to minimize the probability of error
superhydrophobic protective layer
although the objects shown in this video
may seem water-resistant it's actually a
little more complicated than that there
is a concept known as ultra
hydrophobicity this word denotes the
wettability determined by the angle
formed between the surface of the
material and the surface of the droplets
at the points of contact if the angle is
less than 90 degrees then the material
is hydrophilic it can be wetted with
water if the angle is 90 degrees to 150
degrees then the material is hydrophobic
it is possible to wet it but it's not
easy
and finally when the angle exceeds a
hundred and fifty degrees and the drop
at the moment of contact has an almost
spherical shape the material is ultra
hydrophobic and impossible to wet the
drops are repelled or roll off the
surface leaving no traces the video
shows a protective layer which allows
any material to acquire super
hydrophobic properties the invention is
called ultra ever dry and it's patented
technology creates an air barrier on the
protected surface that repels water
juices oil and any other liquid
flood barriers the chance that people
will stop suffering from a natural
disaster such as a flood is very small
floods are natural processes caused by
prolonged rains tsunamis and melting
snow this is a global problem
so Humanity is inventing new ways to
reduce the material damage to the
economy and the social sphere caused by
floods the NOAA cube box wall is a
barrier specifically designed to protect
buildings from flooding
although barriers have been used for a
long time the NOAA cubox wall has a
unique design with many advantages the
barrier consists of individual
components each weighing less than three
and a half kilograms despite the low
weight and ease of installation the NOAA
cubox wall provides reliable protection
as it's 50 centimeters tall the system
is easy to install as it appears to a
solid flat surface by itself when the
water starts to rise of course before
claiming that the Noa cubox wall can
save property and even lives many tests
must be carried out
artificially a powerful flow of water is
created and then the barrier effectively
diverts it to the sides
fortified home other natural disasters
that people face too often are tornadoes
a tornado formed in a storm cloud moves
at speeds ranging from 20 to 60 km/h and
the wind can accelerate to more than 300
km/h one of the highest wind speed
recorded was 485 km/h it should be noted
that at wind speeds of more than a
hundred km/h even the strongest
buildings begin to collapse
fortunately really dangerous tornadoes
don't appear every day and people are
looking for new ways to strengthen
buildings and protect them from
destruction there's a program called
fortified home that helps people
strengthen their house engineering and
construction standards have been
developed for more than 20 years and
during this time tests have been
conducted to demonstrate the stability
of the design the tests are performed at
a special chamber with a machine capable
of simulating a natural disaster for
example scientists from Florida
International University have built the
wall of wind 12 powerful giant fans
accelerate the when to the speed of a
category 5 hurricane
carpets action and here's another
artifact also designed to protect your
belongings from flooding
sometimes even driving through a deep
puddle can lead to a car break down and
then expensive repairs in the event of a
flood water always enters the vehicle
causing it to break down fortunately
today a fairly large number of companies
are developing special banks that could
protect your vehicle from flooding
they're made of durable waterproof
fabric and are securely attached to the
surface of the car some even have
special handles for tying the cattle
tree the bags are tested using special
pools tanks are built around the car
packed in the protective bag and then
filled with water after a while the
water is drained and you can see the car
has not been damaged by the water at all
hey stop being lazy it's time to use
that brain of yours welcome to brain
time incredible facts from the past the
present and even the future the power of
nature and wild animals amazing facts
and unsolved mysteries you'll find all
