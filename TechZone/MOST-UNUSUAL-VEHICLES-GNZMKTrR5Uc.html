a motorcycle or a scooter but in reality
it is a bicycle with a stylish
aerodynamic design that also serves as
protection the electron is also equipped
with a 500 watt electric motor in the
center it's also worth noting the shock
resistant protective glass the light
vehicle is battery powered with enough
power to travel about 20 kilometers
thanks to the electric motor the torsion
of the pedals does not require much
energy while the speed of the electron
is not lower than the speed of a scooter
another advantage to consider is the
dual transmission the bike does not need
to be 50 door started separately from
the electric motor because everything
works automatically
when driving at speeds of up to 10 km/h
the vehicle uses a rear chain mechanism
like any other bicycle and when the
speed increases the electric motor
starts this allows the rider to move at
high speed without changing the rotation
tempo of the pedals the vehicle does not
rise above 80 rpm at the same time
electrons maximum speed is 32 kilometers
per hour although it was artificially
limited
w scooter the main function of this
ultra-compact kickboard is to travel
short distances in the city the small
size in the folding system allow the W
scooter to be combined with public
transport the creators recommend
transporting the vehicle attaching it to
the belt after the trip but if you don't
find this method practical enough you
can bend the kickboard and carry it
special attention should be paid to the
details of the device including the
flexible steering wheel a curved wooden
platform for a single foot and a front
suspension mechanism that folds and
unfolds during the conversion of the
scooter of course the W scooter is not a
full alternative to scooters in the big
city but it is an interesting device for
any urban dweller
the pebble American start-up better bike
offers an alternative for bike lovers
who occasionally need some of the
advantages of a car pebble is equipped
with an electric motor with a power of
750 watts which can be used in
conjunction with or instead of the
pedals in acceleration mode ie when the
user is not pedaling the bike can
accelerate up to a speed of 32
kilometers per hour
a two-hour or three hour charge of the
lithium-ion battery is enough to travel
more than 40 kilometers on the front of
the pebble there is only one adjustable
driver's seat and behind it there is
room for an adult passenger
behind the rear seat is a 170 litre
capacity luggage compartment which can
be extended by folding the rear seat the
complete car weighs ac8 kilograms and
can carry a maximum load of 159
kilograms
let's haze this unusually shaped
electric vehicle was conceived by the
creators as safe stable and easy to use
thanks to the design people feel a
perfect balance during the trip enmities
regardless of their physical form the
vehicle frame is a rigid tubular
structure consisting of aluminium
sections
the maximum weight that metas can
support is 200 kilograms while the
device can accelerate up to 24
kilometers per hour
these electric vehicles can travel at
least 95 kilometers without needing to
be recharged h2o salamander this vehicle
created by the Philippine company h2o
technologies is a small three-wheeled
vehicle capable of moving both on land
and in water in the second case a
propeller is used at the rear which is
activated by changing the position of a
special lever in the camp
the salamander is powered by 200 cubic
centimeter gasoline engine with a
capacity of 13 horsepower its maximum
speed on land is 60 kilometers per hour
and in the water the car can accelerate
to 6 knots or 11 kilometers per hour
however according to the creators the
three-wheeled amphibian is planned to be
produced in two versions and the second
will be equipped with an electric motor
along with a battery pack
when driving in rough terrain the mini
car can carry up to six people on board
in the form of a boat the amphibious can
carry four passengers including the
captain a tow ultralights and very
stable the a tow scooter can be the
optimal solution for movements in the
urban environment when folded this
vehicle resembles a small suitcase which
can be easily taken to work or
transported in an airplane to start the
scooter the owner will need about ten
seconds the weight of the a tow is
twenty eight point two kilograms without
the battery but if necessary when folded
the device can be divided into two parts
the adjustable seat height allows the
scooter owner to feel comfortable
regardless of height
Moon Rider this futuristic hybrid
two-wheeled car is driven as a
motorcycle and according to the author's
can also be considered a flying machine
the light motorcycle is a bicycle with
an electric drive and zero emission as
well as a plasma jet engine that
provides optimum power in flight mode
moon Rider is made of lightweight
composite materials which allows the
bike to efficiently fly in addition it
is equipped with two front tandem wheels
consisting of electric motors powered by
batteries according to the project these
batteries should be charged from solar
energy
