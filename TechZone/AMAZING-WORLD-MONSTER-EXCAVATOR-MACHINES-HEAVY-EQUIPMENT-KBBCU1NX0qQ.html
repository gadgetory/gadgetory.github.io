German engineering company Lee pair can
move along public roads with a complete
telescopic boom thanks to the high load
capacity reaching 750 tons and a wide
variety of boom systems it can be used
in a wide variety of situations the
maximum lifting heights of the LCM 1750
is a hundred and fifty-four meters and
the maximum reach of the boom is a
hundred and twelve meters despite the
impressive size of the machine it can
reach speeds of up to 85 km/h the crane
is equipped with a six-cylinder diesel
engine with the capacity of 300
kilowatts and the engine of the running
gear has a capacity of 505 kilowatts
with an axial load of 12 tons the LCM
1750 can carry a 52 meter long
telescopic boom - flaps and a winch the
total weight of the crane with its front
legs is a hundred and eight tonnes
trap pack this container ship provides
high-speed operation of mooring cranes
reloaders and increases the efficiency
of ground operations the machine is
equipped with a diesel electric drive
engine to reduce the noise level and the
amounts of emissions the specially
designed system constantly monitors the
speed the turning radius and the
position of the machine this provides
the driver with traffic safety
management the carrying capacity of this
model is about 60 tons the stacking
height is three or four containers and
the smooth lift lifting system developed
by the finish company Kalmar provides
highly performance the car drives right
up to the right container covering it
from all sides lowers a special mobile
loader lifts the objects and carries it
to the desired place ga 4431 Mon grass
can be cleaned in various ways depending
on the country and type of terrain this
device which is a kind of new generation
rake is perfect for this work the teeth
located around the axis ensure maximum
grass intake leveling it for subsequent
pressing to ensure that the cut stems do
not scatter around the field the
mechanical rake is equipped with a
protective screen the position of which
can vary depending on the needs of the
farmer in addition the entire device
rises to a height of up to 50
centimetres thereby overcoming possible
obstacles the rake is four point four
metres wide and it weighs 724 kilograms
since the device cannot move
independently it's used in conjunction
with the tractor
class Zairian 3,300 VC octopus this
tractor which looks like a mechanical
octopus is specially equipped for
putting roadside roads in order for
example removing excess vegetation among
the tools of the machine are four unique
tentacles with mowers that allow you to
gently cut grass and small bushes even
on complex terrain while operator can
manage all the tentacles of this tractor
alone he or she must first put all
moving tools at the edge of the curb and
start the mechanism and then the mowers
will be adjusted to the changes in the
relief in semi-automatic mode at the
same time the result does not require
any further processing since the for
cutting seals provide maximum clean cuts
at all levels
Volvo ECR 1:45 this crawler excavator is
used not only during construction works
of various sizes but also as an
assistant in logging thanks to its
compatibility with other machines the
ECR 145 can be used as a universal
machine for any type of work the width
of its caterpillar is 7 meters and the
power of the engine is about a hundred
horsepower equipped with a Kessler 20
rh2 harvester head this excavator is
successfully used in forest works as
well as on felling of the main use of
low bore forest when the average trunk
diameter does not exceed 30 centimeters
at the same time the maximum opening of
the head is 45 centimeters and 4 D
limbing knives make it possible to
achieve a reliable fixation of the
barrel and guaranteed cleanliness of the
cleaning all back diameter
mm this is one of the most powerful and
versatile wood cutters in its class
around the world with a single press of
a button the specially designed software
allows to bring the machine into working
position or movement position in just 20
seconds also it has a special drive
concept which allows acceleration up to
70 km/h the necessary safety during
braking is provided by the built-in
anti-lock braking system and is worth
noting that the car is equipped with a
16-point one weeks of Volvo engine with
612 horsepower gearboxes and hydraulics
are tuned for engine torque allowing the
diamond to be powerful and dynamic with
economical fuel consumption both during
operation and when driving on roads
designers did not ignore the operators
of the car the heated and well
conditioned cabin rises to a height of
up to four point eight meters
guaranteeing optimal visibility
additional convenience is provided by
the built-in covered system with
wife and the refrigerator
see 10:55 commander in cases where deep
trenches are required for laying
pipelines and therefore more power
trenches of increased productivity are
used the earth excavating machine t10 55
commander is equipped with a caterpillar
c-13 a sir tier 3 engine this engine is
equipped with a special electronic
control system that provides the
necessary power to level the sections on
construction online sites coupled with a
top-down cutting system this machine
achieves high efficiency and the
penetration of rocky ground with less
wear on the chain the depth of digging
is regulated by an optional sectional
boom in addition the performance is
affected by the comforts of the trencher
operator so the mobile cabin was
equipped with the comfortable chair and
air conditioner
PNH 40 100x PC the 40 100x PC electric
wire rope excavator is the preferred
choice for high-performance mining
companies around the world
it's ideal for loading career crushing
and transport systems and mining dump
trucks are the most productive models
the nominal payload at the 40 100x PC is
a hundred and eight point nine tons with

depth of this excavator is sixteen point
eight meters is worth noting that the
operator is at an altitude of 10.1
meters the manufacturer also indicates
that the optimized geometry of the
bucket contributes to the increase in
filling factors
cat 385 see this heavy hydraulic
excavator stands out for its

excavation and loading of dump trucks as
well as increased reliability and extend
its service life it's working weight is
ninety thousand six hundred kilograms
and it can reach a speed of four point
four kilometers per hour the maximum
bucket capacity of this excavator is
five point four cubic meters in order to
comply with gas toxicity standards the
cat c18 engine uses state-of-the-art asa
technology reduced noise levels lower
emissions of toxic substances in the
exhaust gas hydraulic system and the
reduction of the amounts of polluting
waste during maintenance are designed to
ensure that the machine meets the
requirements of all environmental
standards it's noteworthy that this
machine is designed to work in harsh
conditions for example at low
temperatures
mazie MUC M 5:45
this machine is ideal for work in
mountain conditions thanks to its
hydrostatic four-wheel drive the
high-tech chassis designed with
hydraulic cylinders allows the men z
mark to adjust the wheels and supports
for any type of soil preventing tipping
even in the most difficult areas at the
same time the model weighing 9.5 tons is
comparable in performance to a 20 ton
wheel excavator the fixed parts but the
function of changing the slope of this
oil terrain vehicle allow you to adapt
to a specific type of work and thanks to
this the lifting and braking force far
exceeds conventional excavators guys
