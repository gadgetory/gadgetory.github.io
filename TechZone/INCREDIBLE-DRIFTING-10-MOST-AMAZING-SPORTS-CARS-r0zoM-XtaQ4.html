Block famous race driver artist and
stuntman created a unique vehicle with a
1,400 horsepower engine this car with
incredible technical parameters is a
full wheel drive coupe a created on the
basis of a Ford Mustang it is also
equipped with a lot of additional
elements in tuning it has a 6.7 liter 8
cylinder engine
- Garrett turbines in a special methanol
injection system that guarantees higher
power
according to Ken Block this is the most
powerful and scary vehicle ease ever
driven thanks to the considerable
amounts of horsepower the car can wear
out the rear tires before the driver can
change gears the vehicle is very
difficult and even dangerous to drive
even for the most experienced drivers
Nissan gt-r Nismo this vehicle was
launched in 2017 by Nissan and is surely
the fastest car of this company it can
accelerate up to 60 miles per hour in
2.4 seconds as a 600 HP engine with a
torque moment of 652 Newton meters
thanks to its semi-slick tyres similar
to those of race cars the vehicle will
not slip on slippery surfaces and all
the wheels will not cling to the asphalt
which increases the speed of the vehicle
from the start to add even more speed
and strength Nissan used technologies
from other race cars for example
turbocharged compressors with increased
capacity ignition optimization for each
of the six cylinders a renewed cooling
system and special silences new bumpers
with aerodynamic elements in a
carbon-fiber spoiler wing increased the
aerodynamic load up to 220 pounds at a
speed of 190 miles per hour
in addition the vehicles creators did
not forget about soundproofing unlike
its analogues the engine sound of this
new Nissan is no longer as loud as he
used to be the designers also tried to
make the interior of the vehicle as
comfortable as possible the high quality
leather covered seats of a special shape
so that the driver is at ease in any
situation in addition there are fewer
buttons than in previous versions so
it's much easier to use

cars you can find on the road venom gt
spider this car is a modification of the
famous Hennessey Venom GT and as several
differences for example the roof of this
car is foldable the changes in
construction also increased the weight

engines capacity so as to not lose in
the aspect of speed the spider is
equipped with an internal combustion
engine with two turbo charges and a
capacity of 1,450 one horsepower
Creators also increased its volume to 7
liters this renewed vehicle accelerates
up to 60 miles per hour in 2.4 seconds
the hypercar works with a special
gasoline blend containing 85% of
anhydrous ethanol
the tork moment is transmitted to the
rear wheels and the vehicle is equipped
with a six-speed mechanical transmission
thanks to its features this car was able
to set the speed record among
convertible models during competitions
at Lemoore based California the Spyder
reached 265 miles per hour braking
Bugattis previous record by about 12
miles per hour ferrari enzo we can't
talk about the most powerful racing cars

design of the Enzo Ferrari is specially

aspect of this car is its price it costs
about six hundred and seventy thousand
dollars SSC Ultimate Aero TT the
creators of this sports car wanted to
break all speed records not in vain

for several years since 2007
256 miles per hour even though it has
now been surpassed the SSC Ultimate Aero
TT remains an incredible vehicle with
impressive features the vehicle can
reach 60 miles per hour in 2.78 seconds
thanks to a 1183 horsepower v8 engine
although honestly these numbers can only
be achieved using special fuel created
by the vehicle developer company in
addition to these qualities the SSC
Ultimate Aero TT stands out in
comparison to other sports cars because
it's very comfortable the loungers
comfortable armchairs instead of sports
seats and a whole multimedia
entertainment system the production of
this vehicle was also limited and most
models were in the hands of automobile
collectors worldwide rumor has it that

list was built by Tanner Foust stuntman
and Formula D champion using a heavy

aerodynamic characteristics of the
bodywork make the vehicle even faster
and more maneuverable the creators have
included changes in the construction of
the transmission and have reduced the
size of the vehicle removing unnecessary
lounge details in essence only the body
structure of the original Volkswagen
Passat remained although the model still
bears a resemblance to the original
vehicle even though many of the parts
were modified the drift car still looks
like a Volkswagen Passat inside the
vehicle is more like a racing car thanks
to the absence of details and minimalist
lounge design the black smoke w123

been modified to reduce the weight of
the construction the creators took away
all the details of the saloon and added
a safety frame that gives the body work
