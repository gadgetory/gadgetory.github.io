can be of various sizes and shapes it
can be flat or bulky welded or tight
modern construction is practically
impossible without set regardless of
whether a residential or industrial
building is being made the equipment you
see on the screen is designed for fast
almost fully automated production of a
reinforcement cage these bulky
constructions are used for the
production of reinforced concrete rings
and tubes the employee performs the
important function of loading the
machine by pushing the bars into special
holes their number can vary from 12 to
60 in this case there are 24 the more
bars are used in the production process
the stronger the structure will be the
equipment ties and welds them at the
same time the machine that you see was
manufactured by experts from the German
company and became a human mouth
moulding machine nowadays Springs clips
clamps fasteners and wiring products are
manufactured automatically on special
machines this is an automatic bending
machine specifically designed to form
pieces from wire or metal tape the
machine uses stamping this equipment is
essentially requested in large-scale
production as it provides a very high
level of productivity the operating
principle is very simple the machine is
equipped with slides each of them is
fitted with a tool that shapes the
workpiece in a certain way on the screen
you can see a numerical control machine
which means the program includes
sequences of tool impact on the
workpiece that result in the creation of
different products so all the worker has
to do is run the program and then choose
what elements he needs
a machine performs all necessary actions
on its own in addition the program knows
how much wire is needed to manufacture
each product and when it is time to cut
it the standard number of slides is
eight but there may be more it's amazing
but in one minute this machine can
create up to two hundred and fifty
elements although this amount of course
depends directly on the complexity of
the product
benda SP 1250 production line metal even
if it's not very thick is extremely
difficult to handle manually even when
using tools the person has to apply too
much effort that's why companies use
specialized lines for the production of
metal items they are powerful machines
that affects the metal were the force so
great that it takes the required shape
instantly the resulting product seen on
the screen is an expanded steel sheet it
is used for the production of floorings
fences and containers sometimes the mesh
serves as a reinforcement when applying
plaster
shoot misil is used to manufacture work
pieces it is delivered in the form of a
long role the equipment extends it by
itself and then performs two stages of
processing perforating and drawing when
it does perforating it creates holes in
the surface in a certain sequence
drawing as a process that turns a flat
piece into a hollow piece therefore the
results is a voluminous finished product
before it's rolled up the mesh is
processed by a pressure roller to make
it easier to transport this makes it
flatter stiffer and more resistant to
defamation
four key machines there are companies
specializing in the manufacture of
equipment for brush production one of
them is the Italian company bourgie and
now we're going to talk about their
products the company manufactures more
than 50 models of equipments have reduce
a wide variety of brushes and to achieve
different levels of performance in the
production plant the speed of the
machines is amazing they insert a
precise number of bristles into the
holes very quickly first of all we'd
like to show you the Heppner model it's
designed for the production of
toothbrushes it has a capacity of up to
1000 bundles of bristles per minute
producing 35 brushes every minute
another interesting model is the
automatic machine Jupiter is designed
for brushes of cylindrical circular or
rectangular shape its main feature is
the wide range of options as well as the
ability to drill and fill holes
simultaneously finally the last
interesting model is Archimedes it is
ideal for particularly large productions
as it produces brushes of any shape
vacuform vacuum former the equipment you
see on the screen is the world's first
digital desktop vacuum former in 2017 it
was launched on the kickstart a
crowdfunding platform today the vacuform
thermo former is very popular and allows
us to admire the incredible production
processes this device is designed to
create complex bulky shapes from
thermoplastic the operating principle is
very simple the form is placed on the
platform of the device the plastic sheet
is placed on top then the vacuum pumps
the air from the space between the
plastic sheets and the form creating a
high negative pressure this pressure
causes the plastic to repeat the texture
of the workpiece
however imperceptible it might be pay
attention to the size of the device
there's a reason we call it a desktop
vacuum former usually similar processes
are carried out using large powerful
industrial machines that cost at least
five thousand dollars or the vacuform
costs only one thousand dollars
hello milling Center the last equipment
we'll show you today also works with
numerical control however this time it's
a metalworking machine the hell're group
manufactures this equipment the video
shows the amazing operation of a 5-axis
milling and turning Center it should be
noted that this type of machine usually
specializes only in one process milling
or turning the fifth additional axis
expands the machining possibilities that
soul can work horizontally vertically or
even as an angle the manufacturer
highlights the high precision and
cutting power during turning the speed
of the tool is astonishing 65 meters per
minute what you see on the screen is the
process of machining a microscope
housing the device changes the cutters
repeatedly during the process to get the
correct size and shape of the holes
surprisingly all the worker has to do is
program the Machine and start it the
machine then converts a monolithic piece
of metal into a finished product on its
own
hey stop being lazy it's time to use
that brain eels welcome to brain time
incredible facts from the past the
present and even the future the power of
nature and wild animals amazing facts
and unsolved mysteries you'll find all
this and much more hair subscribe now
