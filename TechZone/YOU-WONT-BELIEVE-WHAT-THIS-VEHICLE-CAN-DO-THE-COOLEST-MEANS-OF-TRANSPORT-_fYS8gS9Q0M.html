by the engineers at the company the
Dutch amphibious transport it allows
tourists in Amsterdam to see the sights
of the city in an unusual way
the floating Dutchman plunges into the
Amstell River and swims through the
canals in addition the bus can travel
through the city like any land transport
this model is eco-friendly as it uses
diesel fuel that emits fewer harmful
substances than gasoline and in the
water the bus is powered by four
electric motors the vehicle has a
capacity of 50 passengers
Pantha this unique vehicle from the
Californian company water car is an open
four seated amphibian car this model is
based on the Jeep CJ eight scrambler
with an extended wheelbase instead of
the usual carbon steel the Panther was
built using lighter chrome o molybdenum
steel the bottom is equipped with cells
filled with expanded polystyrene which
provides the vehicle with sufficient
buoyancy the maximum speed of the
panther on water is about 45 miles per
hour and on land the car can reach 80
miles per hour in four and a half
seconds the car can speed from nought to
60 the car has a v8 Chevrolet engine and
the model has excellent cross-country
ability which allows the panther to
easily move around the Jews
and the transformation from a land
vehicle into a water vehicle takes only
15 seconds doors and openings are
designed taking into account complete
sealing reliability safe water landing
and access to land it's worth mentioning
the interior decoration of the panther
which corresponds to the design of
yachts the driver's seat rises and locks
in the design position for steering as
well
load Shrike young inventor Tyler Hazuki
had developed an unusual bike for
extreme riding which looks like a small
cart the low racing trike has three
wheels two small ones at the back and a
big one in the front it also has one
handlebar in the front and a steering
lever on the back the pedals are located
near the front wheel place slightly
forward for the convenience of the user
who can control the low in a reclined
position the maximum supported weight is
225 pounds and the vehicle itself weighs
only 33 pounds the tricycle is designed
to be written in a low position just a
few inches from the ground
and at the same time is unusual vehicle
as a high level of maneuverability the
low is very low slung and has a handle
to control the small rear wheels which
allows you to perform tremendous
maneuvers like sharp turns controlled
drifts and 360 degree turns on the spot
to brake you just need to turn the
pedals back the low trike body is made
of strong steel pipes which guarantee
stability reliability and safety while
driving and a comfortable synthetic
leather chair will provide comfort for
any driver
Swink are a spider the French company
McCann rock has developed a single open
electric vehicle with unmatched cross
country capability the swing car a
spider features a completely independent
suspension which allows the cars will
overcome obstacles and climb up or down
it's an angle of up to 70 degrees the
driver can also ride the car is an
inclination of 50 degrees or even put
the left wheels higher than the right
and move smoothly each wheel is equipped
with a 1 kilowatt or one-and-a-half
kilowatt electric motor powered by a
battery
thus when car design allows each of the
4 wheels to move independently on uneven
terrain and keep the driver's cab in an
upright position
the possession of multi-directional
movement of the wheel is convenient for
making a turn in a limited space and
when the swim car East by two turns it
leans like a motorcycle because of the
centrifugal force thereby increasing its
stability
the ultralight construction is made of
mostly aluminium and with the exception
of the power distribution system of the
four electric motors it almost doesn't
contain electronics this when car works
almost silently it doesn't produce any
harmful emissions into the atmosphere
pal v1 the Dutch company Powell V
introduced a two seated flying car with
the tandem cab meaning that the seats of
the pilots in the passenger are located
one behind the other this vehicle has
two propellers one for acceleration and
another to maintain the speed so it
doesn't need wings the pal v1 can be use
as an air transport or is an ordinary
car the flying model ice at 218
horsepower petrol engine which provides
acceleration to 60 miles per hour on the
highway in less than eight seconds the
folded rotor located at the top of the
car doesn't affect aerodynamics either
the maximum speed of the powell v1 both
on ground and in the air is a hundred
and ten miles per hour with a weight of
1500 pounds this flying car can carry up
to 500 pounds of cargo the range of
flights depending on the weight varies
from 220 to 310 miles and the fuel
consumption in the air varies from 20 to
30 litres per 60 miles
MCO sport MCO sport built this also gyro
with the help of full Lotus
manufacturing the company that provided

tandem crew arrangement while the twin
steering allows piloting the vehicle
from the front and the rear seats the
MCO sports is designed for tourist
training and patrol flights this model
holds the fai world record for
gyroplanes with the takeoff weight of up
to 1,100 pounds and in the range of
flight without landing flying 800 miles
the maximum speed of the MCO sports has
110 miles per hour while the average
cruising speed is 86 miles per hour the
length of the takeoff varies from 165 to
490 feet while the climbing capacity of
the gyro plane is 16 feet per second the
