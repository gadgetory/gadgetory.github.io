tasty so you probably need a snack to
watch it all through go right now to the
kitchen and make yourself a sandwich
ready then enjoy pizza while many
restaurants in the world specialize in
making handmade pizza big food companies
use automatic processing to create semi
finished products
this process does not require human
intervention except for possible final
adjustments or the removal of defective
products
the process is actually really simple
the dough pre-mixed in a large container
is placed in a special device that rolls
the mass a durable rubber roller with
different shapes cuts out circles of the
right diameter and sends them directly
to the source dispenses the source
pouring process is also automatic once
the Pisa base is ready it's sprinkled
with cheese and other ingredients cooked
in an oven and then in a refrigerator
the final product is packed in
cellophane
chocolates to begin the production of
chocolate you need chocolate beans which
are ground and converted into a
homogeneous mass
a high temperature and a special rate of
mixing give the chocolate its
distinctive consistency and then cocoa
butter and flavors are added the
resulting chocolate mass is distributed
into molds using a standard automatic
dispenser and shake and manually to
remove all possible bubbles after the
finished tiles are frozen they're placed
in a conveyor belts and pack to be sent
to stores
coca-cola despite the fact that cokes
final and accurate recipe has kept a
secret monitoring the process of
bottling the drink is quite interesting
the bottles arrived to the plant
directly from the bottle fabric but
they're washed one more time to destroy
any harmful substances meanwhile in a
separate container the workers mix
purified water which represents 86% of
the drink with a special infusion and
then concentrated sugar syrup is added
after that the bottles are cleaned with
gas and placed in a special device that
then fills them with coke
potato chips during the first stage of
production potatoes are washed in a
special drum once the vegetables are
peeled they're sent through a dispenser
into another machine which cuts the
potatoes into thin slices to remove the
excess of moisture they are placed in a
centrifuge and then fried in oil to give
the chips a special taste manufacturers
use a mixture of spices and flavors that
are evenly distributed over the potato
slices Dale's raw protein bars for the
production of protein bars the mixes
composition remains unknown is placed
manually in a small mixer where it's
mixed together with special syrup
the resulting product is cut in the form
of little bricks covered with chocolate
glaze then packed and placed in boxes
peanut-butter once the peanuts are out
of the shell they undergo one more stage
of cleansing to get rid of the husks
they're then ground mixed with other
ingredients such as salt and sugar and
placed in a large container with a mixer
and a stable water temperature
this is necessary to prevent the
solidification of the mass ahead of time
the final and ready to eat peanut butter
is placed in thermally treated jars
ketchup the main ingredients of ketchup
is tomato paste which arrives to the
factory in vacuum packages to preserve
freshness and taste with the help of a
special pump the mass is placed in a
special container and mixed with other
ingredients such as salt sugar
substitute vinegar and more in the next
step of production the plastic bottles
pass through a special cooling system
before they're filled with the ketchup
the machine fills 8 bottles at
assignment and the manufacturer has to
check one bustled from each lot after
the ketchup is in the bottles the labels
are glued to it
croissant on the first page of the fully
automated process of baking croissants
the mechanically mixed dough is pressed
down and sent to a special conveyor a
special mechanism rolls the mass to
create a thin layer of dough and any
excess is removed with the help of to
cutting elements located along the edges
of the conveyor
then the dough is cut into triangles
which are twisted to create the
questions each croissant is placed in a
separate cavity and baked it's also
noteworthy that the croissants are
filled automatically that is through a
series of dispensers which penetrate the
finished product
doughnuts unlike other sweets made in
big factories the production of
doughnuts requires much more human
intervention this is due to the gentle
consistency of the dough which can
easily crumple or get damaged by the
machines therefore after placing the
dough in the molds any excess is removed
manually and the workers transport the
doughnuts directly to a special frying
device the fried doughnuts are placed on
a special conveyor and sent to the glaze
dispenser section and then into a small
drum to evenly distribute the powder
ice-cream machines used in the
production of ice-cream are as different
as the different types of ice-cream they
create for example an Eskimo Pie fixed
on a stick
is not placed in a container with
chocolate butts on the contrary
stays in place while the chocolate roses
to it
another source of ice-cream is dipped in
glaze only on one side
the initial stages of production such as
placing the stick inside the ice-cream
as well as distributing the sweet mix
into moulds is also very interesting
guys it's time to recharge your brain
this is the channel brain time there
you'll find a lot of interesting and
useful facts lots of positive energy and
tons of useful information subscribe
right now we promise it's going to be
really exciting</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
