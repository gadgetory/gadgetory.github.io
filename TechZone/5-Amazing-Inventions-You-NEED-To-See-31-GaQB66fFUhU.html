project for the truck of the future was
presented at the International Motor
Show in Germany the iveco Z trucks were
very special vehicle thanks to a
futuristic interior a multifunctional
airplane like steering wheel an
interactive screen instead of usual
dashboard and the lack of any buttons
and a panoramic rear view mirror which
is not actually a mirror but another
huge digital screen besides the concept
is filled with other modern technology
according to the engineers the Z truck
will use mainly biomethane as a fuel
although usual liquefied gas will do too
the predicted range of the truck is
quite impressive 1367 miles the engine
develops 460 horsepower and features a
16 gear automated transmission with
power shift in the upper gears
electronics control the behavior of the
car on the road this way in the future
technologies and autonomous driving will
change the role of the driver who will
become more of an onboard logistics
operator
when the vehicles parked the sliding
wall of the rear slides back
automatically adding 500 millimeters of
interior length and increasing the
living space this makes it possible to
use all the features and amenities the
driver may need such as a foldable bed a
shower a kitchen a fridge a sink and an
entertainment wall tab the transit
elevated bus or tab is a proposed new
bus concept it was first introduced in
Beijing during a high-technology
exhibition according to the inventors
the vehicles not afraid of traffic jams
and it won't interfere with other cars
on the road
it remotely reminds subway trains on
mana rails but tap us a considerably
smaller prime cost
in spite of its impressive size this
huge bus will not interfere with the
traffic
allowing the rest of the vehicles to
pass underneath the bus even if it's
moving
it can have from 900 to 1200 passengers
on board at the same time
is 26 feet wide 16 feet high and a
hundred feet long
if the car underneath is more than six
and a half feet then I'll have to use a
road without halves
by the way the transit elevated bus is
eco-friendly it's powered by solar
batteries the batteries themselves
recharge at the bus stops
inside the tunnel there are a few
security systems for drivers ultrasound
waves will alarm the driver if this
vehicle is higher than it needs to be
and a laser beam inside the tunnel
controls the cars moving around or
approaching to this super bus in case of
danger it will notify the driver
Mercedes future truck 2025 mercedes-benz
future truck 2025 is a project for the
first auto pilot truck capable of doing
50 miles per hour while self steering
according to the developers the truck is
absolutely ready for commercial use
they're just waiting for the legislation
of this kind of transport
when changing its direction the future
truck will inform your bounces using a
set of orange lights if the car is being
controlled manually the lights are white
when the truck is driven by the
autopilot the lights change their colors
from white to blue
the dashboard has a minimalistic look
with displays highlighting the entire
device the rearview mirrors are replaced
by flat screens connected to the cameras
instead of air outlets there's a climate
control system with a touchscreen panel
instead of your usual switches the
surface of the dashboard is covered with
leather
the driver's chair can be turned 45
degrees to sit more comfortably while
traveling the autopilot of this car
works regardless of the traffic
the system controls by itself all the
parameters such as speed or safe
distance
this vehicle uses a scanning detector
system that provides all the needed data
the system can prevent collision with
other cars or objects so there'll be
fewer accidents caused by the human
factor
Willie transparent LCD bus advertising
on public transport can be animated
American designer Ted Orlovsky created a
project of interactive buses with
transparent LED panels on both sides the
Willie bus can transmit music videos
news location of the bus or its schedule
and can even tell tourists about
landmarks they'll be probably more than
one panel so every one of them can
transmit something different thanks to
the panel's transparency passengers can
look through them like through a usual
window but from the street you wouldn't
see anything inside the bus the vehicles
controlled via sensor screens and in the
windshield there's some useful
information wave this new truck called
the Walmart advanced vehicle experience
as a very peculiar look it's made out of
lights and materials and can work on all
kinds of fuel the cabin has an elongated
front part and an unusual shape which
improves aerodynamics the driver's seat
is placed right in the center surrounded
by LCD screens the 50-foot long trailer
is made of carbon fiber which makes it
almost 2 tons lighter than ordinary
trucks wave is equipped with fuel
flexible propulsion and can work on
diesel biodiesel and LNG also it has an
onboard set of batteries which provides
enough energy for another 60 miles on
the road using its electric motor the
truck can reach a top speed of 48 miles
per hour if you want more then you'll
need some diesel the battery capacity is
29 kilowatts the vehicle uses 13.7
percent less fuel than similar trucks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
