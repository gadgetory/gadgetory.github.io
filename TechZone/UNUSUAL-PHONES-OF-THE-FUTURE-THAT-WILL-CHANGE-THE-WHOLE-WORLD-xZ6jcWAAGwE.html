example the bend axis is sensitive to
low temperatures which means you could
easily damages in freezing weather Apple

has an amazing strength the screen does
not crack even when exposed to a huge
load the device meets the US military

Gemini for a long time it seemed that
the developers of smartphones working on
infinity displays and ultra-thin casings
forgot about the users who have to type
a lot during the day
traditional touchscreen keyboards are
not suitable for writing documents long
emails or blog entries
that's why specialists from Planet
computers created a device with a
conventional keyboard

assistant a device that was almost
forgotten it's basically a laptop that
fits in your pocket the user can connect
a mouse and even a fully-fledged monitor

pressing a special button located on the
left side and of course that both
screens can work simultaneously the two
displays are supposed to be accessed
using different methods for example the
front screen with your fingerprints and
the back one with face ID the additional
screen will come in handy during video
and photo shootings all photos including
self-portraits are taken by the powerful
main camera instead of oh not so
impressive front camera the second
screen can also be used by people being
photographed to look at themselves and
change their poses if they want see the
3d tof system of the camera is equipped
with an infrared sensor and promises
both high quality night shots and
beautiful portraits the additional
screen will also be useful for gamers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
