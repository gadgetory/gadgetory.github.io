metal processing they can be easily
transported with trawl nets and unloaded
with a crane these machines don't
require assembly or foundations as they
can be installed on any solid surface
such as a concrete ground the conquerer
500 has a double construction which
generates enormous pressure to process
scrap press scissors are designed to
perform the two main functions cutting
and stacking scrap metal
Peterson 7900 al this crushing disk
vehicle has been designed to produce
large volumes of chips when numerous
logs and large diameter raw materials
need to be cut
to date the 7900 al is the largest
crusher produced by Peterson the most
important features of the vehicle are
its four support legs which provides
stability during operation of the
machine
removable sidewalls to push the raw
material towards the crushing disks and
a remotely controlled swivel nozzle to
load the chips on top an additional
special machine makes the 7900 al the
perfect chipper in the field
CBI 5800 this machine has been
specifically designed for companies
involved in ecological waste wood waste
site cleaning tree felling and compost
collection all these very important
aspects to ensure high productivity and
maximum reliability
this machine is mainly designed for
shredding wood one of its main
advantages as a grinder equipped with a
special metal detection system so the
grinder will not accidentally grind
foreign objects and is therefore
protected against damage
pth micro crusher here we have a unique
vehicle designed to grind asphalt
concrete stones of any hardness and
frozen soil this tool is useful for
trenching laying pipes and sewer systems
building roads horticulture and other
gardening work the micro crusher has
almost twice as many crushing tools
installed as similar vehicles with the
same weight therefore the unit stands
out for its high productivity and high
crushing quality the stone destruction
equipment weighs about 660 pounds is
equipped with an engine of up to 70
horsepower
Bobcat three two three this excavator is
considered a small size construction
equipment as it's only 980 millimeters
wide allowing access to small openings
corridors through narrow doors and much
more the Bobcat three to three can
easily perform excavation work at
private construction sites in crowded
conditions and near residential
buildings the unit stands out for its
quiet operation simple joystick control
technology and maneuverability this
unit's equipped with a diesel engine
with a power of 14 horsepower enough to
perform a wide range of construction
work the tracked undercarriage
significantly reduces damage to the top
layer of soil and asphalt and increases
traction on wet and viscous surfaces
this excavator is capable of carrying
out drainage works and repairing water
pipes in muddy terrain where the use of
wheeled vehicles is impossible be mad
green cargo be mad is an innovative
European company that produces
self-propelled vehicles for harvesting
and applying solid fertilizers
one of the latest interesting
developments of these engineers was the
green cargo unit based on a powerful
sprinkler the advantages of this machine
are its high maneuverability powerful
engine and impressive load bunker
capacity
z r5 this vehicle can automatically form
a roller press and stands out for its
high maneuverability mobility and good
handling or achieved thanks to a zero
radius turning technology and it scarab
which the developers decided to place on
a suspended front axle it's worth noting
that the driver's cab is spacious
comfortable with good visibility and low
noise level a 173 horsepower engine
powers the unit and a hydro static
transmission drives the SU rear wheels
another feature of the device is that it
can automatically stop when a roll is
formed
the tailgate opens and closes on its own
after which the car returns to the floor
all the operator has to do to resume
role forming is press the start button
DFM compact feller buncher here we have
a new type of high performance logging
vehicle this machine is ideal for
working in artificial plantations and
natural forests and it shows great
results from working with large diameter
wood which is vital for equipment of
this size
the device can process several trees at
the same time thanks to a special
mechanism this machine as a high load
capacity as equipped with a cutting disc
of approximately three feet in diameter
as well as an integrated sensor that
allows the operator to control blade
speed and maximize efficiency
try bind combine harvester this
harvester not only harvest sweet but can
also transport it in its own cargo hold
it should be noted that it could carry
around 27 tons of grain the Roisin runs
on two diesel engines with a capacity of
590 horsepower each the clean grain is
sent from the Thrasher to the rear
module using a 12-inch unloader inside
the hopper the chain unloader moves from
corner to corner while in most grain
trucks the unloader is installed in the
middle this flexible arrangements of the
device makes it possible to increase the
speed and productivity of the unloading
process itself in addition the new
combine harvester is equipped with the
largest threshing and cleaning systems
on the market
giant crane in most cases large-scale
work in open areas is done with a crane
this machine is capable of lifting not
only large volumes of construction or
agricultural materials but also other
machines concrete mixers excavators and
loaders thanks to its large load bearing
capacity and dimensions a machine of
this type will be able to move any
necessary equipment to hard-to-reach
locations for example in an underground
mine or a deep well
if you haven't checked jelly gummy bears
channel yet you should do it right away
you'll certainly like all the funny
experiments with the jelly bear cool
life hacks awesome homemade stuff and
exciting adventures that are waiting for
