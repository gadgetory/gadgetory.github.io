problems people face in big cities is
the eternal lack of parking spaces the
car you see on the screen is designed to
solve this problem
the electric car city transformer is
able to fold the vehicle has two
important features first the car takes
up very little space and second it can
pass through places where any other
vehicle that gets stuck this car was
first showcased last year making an
impressive and memorable appearance
during the presentation the city
transformer arrived in a 1.2 meter wide
elevator in its default State the car is
2.3 meters long and 1.4 meters wide when
folded the width of the car does not
exceed 1 meter it can comfortably
accommodate 2 people who can travel at
speeds of up to 90 kilometers per hour
class in Mercedes V class limousine at
first glance the main feature of this
car is its ability to stretch increasing
in size however this model also has a
huge number of other remarkable features
but let's start from the beginning when
the mercedes benz v class limousine
minibus appeared on the market for the
first time it immediately gained
popularity and established itself as a
luxury vehicle
this model has become a favorite among
specialists from the German tuning
company classic the limousine you see on
the screen has been modified in terms of
comforts it almost matches private jets
inside there's a huge flat-screen
monitor a built-in PlayStation 4 a
multimedia system folding tables a
fridge a coffee machine and much more
and of course if necessary this minibus
becomes bigger for the comforts of all
the passengers
submarine car if this car looks familiar
then you've probably been offended James
Bond movies because a very similar model
the Lotus Esprit starred in the movie
The Spy Who Loved me that car however
was not designed for underwater driving
and had no air tightness the Lotus excel
on the other hand is the first fully
functional submarine car this unique
model was designed by Richard Hammond
the top gear host decided to test
whether it was possible to recreate the
legendary James Bond car the model is
equipped with retractable rear dive
planes to ensure the safety of the
passengers underwater the cabin is
insulated with an additional layer of
fiberglass
the glass has been replaced with
aviation-grade plastics they used an
interesting system to create ballast by
filling the tires with concrete the last
interesting feature is the sonar on the
road the car is driven by the steering
wheel like any other vehicle for when
the Lotus Excel is under water special
control leavers come to use the
submarine car was built to celebrate the
50th anniversary of James Bond's cars
Stella Lux and Stella V inexhaustible
energy sources are one of the main
trends of our time solar energy
technology is being implemented in all
spheres of our lives and cars are no
exception a few years ago a group of
students from the Eindhoven University
of Technology in the Netherlands
managed to create a family car powered
by solar energy the creator's call their
brainchild the car of the future and the
official name of the model is Stella Lux
the presentation of this amazing
invention took place in 2015 Stella Lux
can be simultaneously used by 4 people
it took about a year to develop this
alternative car the solar panel
installed in the roof is about six
square meters in size and acts as a
source of energy the battery provides at
least a 1000 kilometer right
the maximum speed of Stella Lux is a
hundred and 25 km/h the car weighs only
375 kilograms it was specially designed
to be light and aerodynamic however
experts did not stop there and in 2017
the world saw an updated model the
Stella fille
the new model has a similar design but
fits up to five people inside it's
noteworthy that the Stella V has fewer
solar panels on the roof than its
predecessor however that doesn't affect
the technical and operational
characteristics the car still drives up
to a thousand kilometres on one battery
charge the developers just taught the
vehicle to use energy more efficiently
it's noteworthy that the length of the
car was increased to five meters but the
width was reduced to one point six five
meters
Stella V developed speeds of up to 130
kilometers per hour
bw1 the design of golf carts was the
same for a very long time and for some
reason no one thought about improving it
and making it more comfortable until
Bubba Watson of neo Taric hovercraft
invented the golf carts of the future he
created an amazing vehicle that uses
special air cushions instead of wheels
the golf car was built in one copy to
shoot an Auckland commercial however
what was originally conceived as a fun
idea for advertising has attracted the
attention of golf enthusiasts from
around the world therefore we do not
rule out the possibility that in the
near future a bw1 will be produced in
real life a remarkable feature of this
golf cart is that it doesn't need
special transport routes bw1 loops on
water grass and sand equally quickly at
the same time it's worth noting that
this vehicle doesn't damage the lawn
which is important when it comes to golf
the maximum speed of the bw1 is 72
kilometers per hour
err fish ate a ground effect vehicle or
GeV is a high speed vehicle designed to
fly by making use of ground effect in
other words it flies at relatively low
altitudes above water
Earth's snow or ice because the surface
has shielding properties the wings
lifting power and the other aerodynamic
characteristics of the aircraft
increased dramatically
the vehicle you see on the screen was
built using patents and technologies
from airfoil development it's considered
to be one of the pioneers in the
construction of ground effect vehicles
air fish 8 was developed by specialists
from which it works and is a small GeV F
ish 8 will be used to transport VIP
passengers in Singapore only eight
passengers confess onboard as well as
two crew members
however the advantage of the vehicle is
that air fish eight moves three times
faster than a typical short distance
vehicle another feature is that the
device doesn't need any additional
facilities for takeoff and landing only
open water space the cruising speed of
this GeV is 150 kilometres per hour and
it can travel for up to five hundred and
fifty five kilometers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
