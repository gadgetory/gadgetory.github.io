robot looks like a real scorpion and was
developed by three students from the
University of Ghent in Belgium they use
the most modern technologies to create
this robot the modules for the legs and
the tail for example were printed on a
3d printer the frame of the construction
consists of two plastics six millimeter
wide plates inside the frame there are
pipes for the cables while resistant
special latches hold together the
different parts of the construction the
robot can move in all directions
overcome obstacles grab objects for this
tweezers and even attack using its tail
like a real scorpion to find the
obstacles the robot uses infrared
sensors and a frontal camera to achieve
an even more prodigious resemblance the
tail of this mechanical animal leaves a
red ink mark when attacking it's not
poisonous for humans but will let you
see the way the creature attacks Miro
this small mechanical fish can carry out
research work at a depth of a hundred
and sixty-five feet but it's also a
great tourist attraction thanks to its
bright look it's LED lights and it's
incredible and very real movements each
of these fish has two motors and for
infrared distance sensors thanks to
which the device can overcome any
obstacle this water robot can be
controlled in first-person using glasses
and a controller spider robot this huge
spider robot was designed using a 3d
printer and despite not being able to
climb ceilings and walls like real
arachnids its appearance is quite real
the toy moves thanks to 26 different
motors three on each leg and two more
located in the back of the device this
system allows the spider to move and
perform movements for this stomach the
engines are not very powerful but all
together can guarantee a movement
similar to that of a real animal
the spiders controlled with the help of
an application or a special joystick
which makes the job much easier also the
spider does not need to be programmed in
any way
the Bionic spider is simple to control
and can run lift its legs one by one
crouch down and even dance robo bees
this tiny robot can be considered the
smallest and lightest flying vehicle in
the world not bigger than a stationary
clip it weighs a hundred milligrams
that is to say 0.1 grams the robot has
to moving wings and is capable of
maneuvering in the air however it's not
completely autonomous and needs to be
connected to a base with the help of a
few transparent cables in spite of this
the small device can be considered a
true insect this effect is achieved
thanks to the frequency of the flutter
which is close to that of a real bee and
the small size is not the only advantage
of this Bionic animal among other things
the designers added the possibility of
landing on the surface of water and
swimming for a few seconds obviously the
flutter frequency which reaches 120
times per second in the air is
significantly reduced underwater the
robot is able to move its wings with a
frequency of 9 times per second in the
air and in the water a monitoring system
controls the robot with the help of
several cameras this system calculates
the flight path and converts the
calculations into commands for the
robots flying Bionic bird
unlike other more common and popular
drones which use the special propeller
systems for flight this small device is
capable of flying with the help of its
own wings when the robots in the air
even other birds may think it's a real
bird this is possible thanks to the
appearance of the device the dark gray
aerodynamic chassis has been decorated
with a beak and a pair of eyes the wings
can also flap 18 times per second and
the tail is used to control the flight
in addition the body of the bird robot
is made of elastic synthetic
resistant to scratches attacks by other
animals and possible hits during forced
landings the wings of the robot are made
of carbon fiber a durable but very light
material ideal for all kinds of
maneuvers in the air the total waste the
device is 9.2 grams while a special and
ultralight battery weighs only 1.6 grams
a special decorative egg allows you to
charge the bird the drone is controlled
with the help of a free mobile
application available for iOS and
Android there are two control modes
according to the user experience simple
and expert the control radius of the
device is 330 feet and a battery charge
guarantees 6 minutes of work at maximum
speed or 7.5 minutes at normal speed
while the decorative egg allows between
an hour and 75 minutes of charging plura
bot the company bio Rob which works in
the creation of new generation Bionic
robots has presented a brad bottig
lizard whose behavior resembles that of
a salamander to faithfully reproduce the
particularity of the movement of these
lizards the developers used x-ray images
this allowed them to accurately recreate
all the details of the animal like true
lizards which have great mobility their
mechanical analogues can also move
through difficult terrain and even swim
a waterproof skin allows the device to
remain for a long time in the water
which is why this Bionic animal can be
used for search and rescue the
construction of the robot allows
controlling each active joint separately
whereas a model of neural networks
responds for the control of the robot
the structure simulates the nervous
system of some parts of the brain of a
real salamander this approach allows the
robot to accurately copy the studied
movements in addition to performing
complicated tasks which go beyond the
possibilities of a real salamander
according to the developers they hope to
continue with their creations and
probably in the near future will show us
a robotic dinosaur
arrra kuda the company Festo famous in
the world for its robotic animals has
presented their new son the robot fish
era kuda in addition to fins motors
which allows copying the exact movements
of a real fish the device has liquid
muscles a creation patented by the
company itself these muscles have
elastic hoses made of rubber as well as
aramid fiber using compressed air the
mechanical muscles move in the same way
normal muscle tissues move stretching or
contracting is needed to muscles are
enough to begin the movements of the
rear flap of the fish robots while two
other muscles are responsible for the
control allowing great maneuverability
even in deep waters like a real fish
inside this robot there is a swimming
bladder a special cavity that allows
regulating the compressed air and
setting the fish in motion to use this
mechanical fish for 30 minutes you need
400 litres of compressed air
aqua jelly here we have an autonomous
artificial jellyfish with an electric
propulsion system and an intelligent
mechanical system which can adapt to any
external changes a transparent
hemisphere and eight tentacles with LED
lights make up the Bionic jellyfish
inside we can find a central motor to
lithium-ion batteries a navigation block
and two servo motors to control the
movement the robot is able to calculate
the power supply and when the battery's
running out of power the device
automatically sends the information to
the charging base located on the surface
and swims to it on its own to
communicate on the surface the
mechanical jellyfish uses a radio band
and when being underwater it uses a
system of infrared lights for the
working distance of about 3 feet that
way when receiving the signal from
another robots in the vicinity the
jellyfish can perform an evasive
maneuver in addition to the environment
sensors the robot has internal sensors
to control the energy level and pressure
thus calculating the immersion depth
with high at
I see a loom this robotic snake
developed by the Norwegian Institute of
Science and Technology has been
specially created to work underwater its
mission is to perform observation and
repairing works of oil facilities as
well as recording videos underwater and
investigating sunken ships a cable is
currently used to interact with the
robot but in future it will be able to
swim autonomously and perform underwater
research without an external signal the
elastic electronic construction of the
underwater device allows its use in
complicated places which cannot be
reached other than using other special
equipment that way the Bionic snake is a
cheap and practical solution to perform
technical tasks of low difficulty this
robot can help perform inspections
illuminate dark areas clean underwater
constructions and screw nuts and valves
Robo crab the creators of this unusual
robot were inspired by the ZIF Asura
one of the oldest animal species on
planet earth the device moves using a
set of small legs pushing itself away on
the surface and is able to return to its
initial position using its movable tail
in case the robot turned on its belly
right the animal prototype this
mechanical crab is not afraid of water
and can move easily in shallow waters</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
