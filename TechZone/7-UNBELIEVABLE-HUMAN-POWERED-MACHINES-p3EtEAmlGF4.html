was originally built for personal use as
a high-speed motor vehicle while still
fulfills this function but has been
slightly improved and mass-produced
the large distance between the front
wheels and the rigid suspension
guarantee good stability on the road the
sports steering wheel and the special
brake levers provide excellent control
even at high speeds and instant braking
the machine is easily disassembled so
repairing any part won't be a problem
also if you have to replace a certain
spare parts it won't be expensive
the standard version of Wow can be
adjusted to the length of the pilots
body from five to six point two feet
choosing the most optimal position
skub stir this unique mini-submarine has
a 10 foot long body made of carbon fiber
and has a capacity for one person in the
cabin according to the developers this
compact submarine weighs 66 pounds and
can descend to a depth of 200 feet the
machine is equipped with two propellers
each of which is controlled
independently by a special steering
system this underwater vehicles powered
by a pair of 10 kilowatt electric motors
each powered by 215 kilowatt let the man
battery packs the total capacity of the
batteries will ensure a trip of two
hours and the submarine can reach a
speed of five miles per hour
the range of the boat can be increased
adding additional compartments to its
hull which can also be used to transport
equipment or any other cargo
the authors of the project hope that the
electric submarines Cubs taneema would
be an excellent solution for scientists
and researchers of the ocean rescuers
Coast Guard's military and simple lovers
of extreme leisure
Atlas on July 11th 2013 the US
helicopter Society awarded Arevalo
a prize for the development of this
helicopter powered by muscle traction to
receive the prize the vehicle had to
meet the following requirements stay in
the air for at least 60 seconds and
reach a height of at least 10 feet from
a horizontal takeoff within an area of
30 by 30 feet according to the
co-founder of the Aero Velo company
Cameron Robertson the vehicle was
designed for a pilot of less than 160
pounds which can generate a power of
approximately 1 horsepower the device
despite weighing only 115 pounds has an
impressive dimensions 190 feet
horizontally in addition it's equipped
with full huge symmetrical propellers
snowbird this vehicle was developed in
Canada and is known as an ornithopter
since it allows flying thanks to the
movement of the wings the plane flies
precisely thanks to these movements and
not to the work of a propeller or engine
the plane weighs 93 pounds and is made
of carbon fibre foam and cork the size
of the ornithopter is a hundred and five
feet and to fly the peculiar Snowbird
ship is driven by a vehicle which
performs the function of a tractor but
once in the air the ornithopter flies by
itself
the movements of the wings is controlled
by a pilot who turns the pedals on the
test flight the vehicle traveled a
distance of almost 750 feet at a speed
of 15 miles per hour
Tanny wassup this submarine developed by
students at the University of Auckland
is controlled by a pilot who turns the
pedal mechanism and activates the
machine
since the submarine is not equipped with
an air supply system the pilot breathes
with the help of a diving system the
submarine is 10 feet long it's made of
fiberglass and weighs 132 pounds which
is the equivalent of an ordinary bicycle
to turn on the boat the pilot must lie
on his stomach and start pedaling after
which the upper and lower fins begin to
move pushing the boat forward the
coordinator of the design team ensures
that this vehicle can move faster than
some motor boats of the same size
project manager Ian Anderson said that
tiny wah can go faster than some similar
sized propeller submarines
elf this car was created by American
company organic transit its main
characteristic is being more like a
bicycle than a car thanks to the
presence of pedals however it also has
an electric motor and a full charge of
the batteries allows travelling up to 30
miles
alfe drivers can choose which road to
follow according to the plan of the
developers the electric motor is
designed to climb uphill or for
particularly weak users who do not have
the power to pedal elf batteries can be
charged not only using a power socket
but also with the help of solar panels
installed in the vehicle chassis
interestingly you do not need a driver's
license to operate this vehicle this
allows the vehicle to be used by a large
number of people those who do not give
much importance to speed or comfort but
he wants a cheap car to be transported
Robert Archaeopteryx the main feature of
this unusual craft is its low weight 120
pounds in the open version and 135 in
the closed version as well as several
forms of takeoff and landing the flight
control is carried out with the help of
specially adapted side leavers and
pedals the wings fan of the plane is 45
feet the weight of the takeoff can reach
420 and the speed can reach 80 miles per
hour
the Archaeopteryx can raise if the pilot
drives it with his feet from a slope if
it receives the help of a moving vehicle
if connected to a glider with a winch or
if it has an electric motor that gives a
boost to the movement of the machine in
the last two options the launching of
the paraglider does not necessarily take
place from a slope it is possible to do
it on an absolutely even surface the
plane is equipped with a small chassis
to land at low speed there is also an
option to land with the legs but to do
so you must have a good experience in
flight and maneuvers in the air
guys it's time to recharge your brain
visit the channel brain time there
you'll find a lot of interesting and
useful facts lots of positive energy and
tons of useful information subscribe
right now we promise it's going to be
really exciting</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
