furnitures finished with epoxy resin is
gaining popularity in the markets tables
are the most demanded items and this is
not surprising once finished they look
spectacular in addition this technique
makes it possible to create all kinds of
original furniture a few months ago a
master named Chris demonstrated that
even more unique furniture can be
obtained by replacing epoxy resin with
colored crayons he started making the
new table in the same way that he starts
building any other piece of furniture
first he put together several boards to
get a wide surface they need to term in
the top and the bottom of the table and
of course he hand drew a place for the
color insertion
the expert used a manual milling machine
to cut the wood and create the cavity
where the crayons will be placed then
the most interesting part begins
the master removed the wrappers from the
crayons place them in the cavity and
melted them
the crayons contain wax so under the
influence of hot air they almost
immediately become liquid the artist
created something like a rainbow river
in addition he decorated the fixing
points of the legs of the worktop with
crayons the result is a beautiful and
very unusual table shower tray flutist
systems manufactures various building
materials that can be used in floors and
showers the video shows how the master
using his skills and the company's
products creates the shower tray the
edge and the elegant drainage the Kurdi
shower system is used as the base for
the shower the polystyrene blocks are
lightweight to their size and shape are
easily changed with a knife the material
is placed on a layer of a special
solution called thin set mortar if the
pipe runs under the shower cubicle as in
this case the circular shower channel is
installed in the opening
to prevent water leaking a curb is
installed the thinset water is then
applied again to the base of the
polystyrene shower tray joining the
layers of the structure the Builder then
applies the polymer membrane layer that
performs the waterproofing function in
addition the membrane is placed in the
corners and curves of the future shower
cabin to prevent water from entering
them once the work is finished the
construction is optimally water proof
the probability of leakage is reduced to
zero after that the worker lays the
tiles
flute assistance also offers incredible
design solutions for drains that look
like usual tiles
faux stone finish although natural
materials have an extremely attractive
appearance they're not often used in
construction first of all they're not
cheap and secondly they can
significantly increase the weight of the
construction which is not always
possible however this is not an excuse
for not having a stone wall at home
because resourceful builders have
invented ways to create a finishing that
imitates stone using the available
materials the finishing process begins
when we build and marks the size and
shape of the future stones to ensure
that the final result is more realistic
a colorant is added to them also during
the mixing process first the white color
to apply the contours of the future
stone a mortar sprayer is used it
provides sufficient pressure and
traction to allow the thick mass to be
squeezed through the nozzle
when the mortar is applied it is levels
with a spatula
another dye is added to the unused
portion of the mortar this time yellow
it'll be used to form the stones the
worker applies the material in a dense
layer so that it rises above the mortar
that's been previously placed the paint
roller is used to compact the mixture
the final stage in creating the
finishing is to remove the excess mortar
using the sharp end of the spatula
finally the appearance of these stone
wall is obtained by cleaning the grooves
with a wet thin brush
EPS bricks it is not so easy to think of
a useful application for a pile of used
dirty and broken EPS however true
experts are able to easily cope with
this task for example the ones we're
gonna show you now came up with the idea
of making bricks with this material if
you want to repeat this start by
creating a grinder this was made of
plywood an old vacuum cleaner and a tube
with a large number of nails
the bag for collecting the resulting
material is attached to the grinder
using binder clips according to the
creators of this machine you can make a
lot of bricks
even a small amounts of EPS turns into a
big pile of raw materials a full bag of
EPS crumbs is enough to make just over
20 bricks 5 buckets of crumbs and a
bucket of cement are added to the mixing
molds once the water is added the
mixture becomes firm and thick the molds
are filled with a mixture and placed on
wooden panels additional bars and a
press are placed on top to ensure that
we finished bricks are of the same size
drying doesn't take too long either
these bricks are excellent for acoustic
and thermal insulation and do not sink
their low cost makes them an ideal
material for small construction projects
all decoration from time to time we show
you a variety of ways to decorate walls
however there are so many methods that
we're happy to find something
interesting again the person you see on
the screen uses the cilco sill and
magico interior paints to create a
decorative panel magico paint has a
unique ability to change color when
apply to the surface the production of
these building materials is carried out
by the company silk coat foyer from
tajikistan first a thin layer of black
silk asil paint is applied to the
surface using a paint roller after
trying the second and most interesting
work stage begins
note that the paint inside the tank is
white it's applied to the surface for
the narrow spatula the assistant presses
the tools against the decorative panel
so that the paint is squeezed to the
edges in the center this ink changes
color to obtain a beautiful bluish tone
the finished decorative panel has an
unusual appearance and will look nice in
any room and in the same way you can
finish the whole wall
scrap metal sculptures one large
companies buy used metal for processing
and carrying out a secondary production
cycle some craftsmen give metal a second
life in a completely different and
unusual way here is Alan Williams a
metal artist from the UK his sculptures
are made from metal pieces he just finds
the main tools of his work are Forge
hammers fire and a variety of pliers
he gives the bars strange shapes and
curves old gears in his hands become the
bodies of alien creatures in his own
words he enjoys especially working with
spare parts that are no longer useful
and are difficult to reuse
the artist then transforms them into
sculptures for the public's delight</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
