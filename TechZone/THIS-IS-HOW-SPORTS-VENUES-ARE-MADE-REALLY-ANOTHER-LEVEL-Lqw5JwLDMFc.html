courts begins with the construction of
the base this is a very important step
since the quality of the base determines
the service life of the product
the workers dig the trench the depth of
which usually doesn't exceed 60
centimeters a layer of slaked lime or
other fungicide is then applied it's a
chemical that prevents vegetation from
germinating the next layer is a
waterproof material and they send a
cushion about ten centimeters thick then
concrete or clay diet concrete is poured
over the sand the surface is preliminary
reinforced in order for the tennis court
to be of high quality the concrete is
poured without interruption in one cycle
this eliminates the presence of surface
joints before the surface finishes
drawing it is leveled the use of laser
leveling technology considerably
accelerates the process special
equipment uses lasers and sensors that
allow the operators to produce a
perfectly flat surface it should be
noted that the surface must have a
slight inclination
this will prevent rainwater from
accumulating in puddles after the drying
process which lasts approximately a
month the surface is polished a layer of
between two and four millimeters of
primer is applied the last stage of the
construction is the placement of the
artificial surface it can be grass or as
in this case a special material to
create a hard tennis court it's a water
acrylic solution it's usually applied in
several layers from three to twelve and
each layer can have its own special
function for example the alignment of
the base the softening of the surface
and the coloration of the school turf is
the most popular cover of modern
football fields its advantages include
that it's easy to maintain and has a
perfectly flat surface in addition it
doesn't suffer from being warped on and
doesn't need to be watered high-quality
artificial turf like the one shown in
the video does
Shyne either on the outside it's almost
indistinguishable from real grass the
wool material for the artificial grass
is polypropylene or polyethylene the
fibers are manufactured through the
extrusion process in their original form
they are enormous rolls of plastic
special machines make bundles of fiber
and then weave them together to create a
wide band for the coating to be strong
and durable a latex base is applied to
the inside of the covering after the
artificial turf is drive and tested for
quality it's rolled up it is then taken
to these stadiums in areas where the
fields will be installed in this case
the football field the weight of one of
these rolls can reach one ton so
especially equipped loaders are used for
spreading it then the layers must be
spread and leveled manually of course
the joints must be connected to each
other
a special adhesive is used for this and
pressure is applied the markings are
made of exactly the same grass but from
white fiber to do this the groups are
cousins of the finish coating they're
then filled with glue and marking strips
the final step is the application of
filler materials such as sand and rubber
granules and the final grooming these
procedures increase the stability wear
resistance and stiffness of the field
baskyball course there are several
materials available for making
basketball course however parquet is the
benchmark the highest quality material
it's eco-friendly and prestigious proper
production and installation will give
the basketball court between 60 and 70
years of operation the material is taken
to the stadiums in the form of separate
sheets it's not an easy task to put them
together either since wood is a rather
fragile material there is a risk of
damaging the parquet when it's laid
carelessly tools such as a sledge hammer
a pounding block a drift pen and a
hammer are used for installation each
panel has slots on all four sides all of
these tools are needed to insert one
slots into the other and then combine
them to make the panel's fit as tightly
as possible the wood is rigid enough
only construction must be strong this is
why parquet is laid on an elastic
subfloor or on a system of bars and
rubber gaskets sometimes to smooth the
surface once the installation is
finished it is polished next there's a
mandatory stage designed to increase the
durability and aesthetics of the
basketball cause this is a wood coating
with special varnishes and oils in
several layers after the lacquer is
dried if necessary drawings and markings
are applied to the floor
ice-skating rink ice hockey and figure
skating rinks are not always created in
specially designed places sometimes as
in this case you have to work in
ordinary and large stadiums the first
stage before construction even begins
consists of placing an enormous sheets
of plastic this is necessary for
installation the next layer is the
plastic tubes which are taken to the
construction site in the former role in
this particular case 53 kilometers of
pipes were used for construction they
are filled with antifreeze this is a
special liquid which can be cooled
considerably without turning into ice a
powerful liquid cooling device reduces
the antifreeze temperature below zero
degrees Celsius in five seconds then the
field becomes a huge generator of cold a
similar technology by the way is used in
domestic refrigerators the next step is
to start creating ice which requires
filling the entire site with water in
this case 50,000 litres were needed it
should be noted that the builders don't
immediately pour all this water into the
building site to prevent air bubbles
from forming in the ice the water must
be placed in thin layers and then you
have to wait until it freezes the
prepared ice rink usually consists of at
least 30 of these ice layers in the last
layers of the water white paint is out
it's a cover the pink chips with
antifreeze the markings are applied
during the creation of the ice rink two
more centimetres of ice are placed on
top of this layer
volleyball court there are a number of
varieties of volleyball for example it's
played on sand and snow classic
volleyball is one in which participants
compete on specially constructed course
the video shows a time-lapse
construction of the volleyball course as
well as these stands special crumb
rubber mats are placed on a concrete or
wooden base they are then spackled a
polyurethane filling layer is then
applied the only thing left to do is to
varnish the surface very often wood
plastic and special mixtures are also
used as the final coating
we'd also like to talk about building
beach volleyball courts as you may have
guessed special sand is used it's
carefully saved and there's not a single
stone or shell in all of this mass the
proper filling for a volleyball court
consists of 96% courts at the same time
the size of the grain of the sand
doesn't exceed two millimeters elastic
bands are generally used to create the
boundaries of the course this isn't soft
and elastic material that doesn't have
the players it shall be noted that the
posts of the nets are installed before
the sites is filled with sand in order
to guarantee stability
