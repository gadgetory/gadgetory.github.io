competitors models the mattress tilts
back and under it there's 2.3 cubic
metres of space for storage the space is
equipped with drawers it's even possible
to store large sized objects such as
suitcases and sports equipment it's
noteworthy that the hinged mechanism has
been carefully designed
thanks to this when the bed is open
there's enough space inside for a person
to enter thus space up is three pieces
of furniture in one a bed a night table
and a closet
