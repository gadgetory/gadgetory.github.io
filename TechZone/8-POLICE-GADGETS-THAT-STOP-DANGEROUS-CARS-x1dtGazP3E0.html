systems developed in North Carolina
automatically activate two seconds
before a vehicle approaches and can stop
it even if the car is moving at high
speed a large number of tests have shown
that this network barrier can stop a
22-ton truck traveling at a speed of 80
kilometers per hour as a result of the
blow the truck cab was completely
destroyed while the barrier was barely
affected the maximum length of this Nats
is 27 meters which allows closing roads
of any size
another more compact version of the
barrier offers a rugged cable that can
be installed from scratch in 45 minutes
and reach a length of 50 feet
this version can stop a light vehicle up
to 7 tons at a speed of 30 miles per
hour pitbull the sticky tentacles of sea
creatures as well as the spiderwebs of
spider-man the famous comic book
character inspired the developers of
this gadget for their creation it is a
simple barrier with interchangeable
studs but each of the small metal tips
is also attached to a sturdy net as soon
as the vehicle passes through the
obstacle the tacks will pierce the tires
holding and covering the front wheels
with the net stopping the vehicle
instantly
the device can stop a vehicle at a speed
of 37 miles per hour depending on the
track size and other parameters the
device can cover the entire path or be
installed next to the roadside in
addition the device can operate
autonomously and activate itself by
detecting the presence of a vehicle with
its special sensors the device is
perfect for 24-hour patrol areas as well
as for use in private areas al Costa
wedge this barrier is able to guarantee
security in any private territory
preventing the passage of any vehicle
regardless of its size or weight the AL
Costa wedge has been developed and
produced to protect government buildings
scientific and technological development
centers power stations and other
industrial sites as well as military
zones and airports
at the same time it can be used as a
means of self-defense along with other
constructions such as gates crossing
barriers and studs in addition the
barrier is perfect for installation in
the city as it's only 12 inches deep 7
inches for the base and 4 inches needed
to cover the track another advantage of
this device is that is easy to install
however despite the simplicity of the
construction the gadget is able to stop
even a truck at high speed
grappler police bumper this new device
has been developed to stop criminals
during track chases the technology used
in this invention is quite simple the
construction is installed on the bumper
of the patrol car to stop the criminal
police officers must press a special
button that activates a mechanism with
an ultra resistant nylon cable that
clings to the rear wheel of the pursued
vehicle blocking its axle this generates
a sturdy hitch that's impossible to
break in motion the police conductor
should only loosen the cable to get away
it's an appropriate distance and wait
for the criminal to be stopped
the American inventor assures that his
creation will increase the security of
law enforcement's since they will not
have to overcome criminals squeezing
them against the roadside or hitting
them with their vehicles
the developer of this unique mechanism
said he's ready to ship the device to
all US police departments
healed HD one Raptor the company that
developed this anti-terrorist barrier
received patents for its creation in the
European Union and the USA the
innovative system combines the
reliability and high safety of Road
barriers with the elasticity and
mobility of most modern inventions
during the tests the device was able to
stop a truck weighing seven and a half
tons traveling at a speed of 50 miles
per hour as a result of the experiment
the vehicle was completely destroyed
while the barrier remained intact and
could continue to be used without losing
effectiveness according to the creators
the Raptor can operate autonomously or
in conjunction with other barriers
guaranteeing safety in spaces of any
size and thanks to its sleek design the
device doesn't ruin the architecture of
a modern city in addition this barrier
can be hidden underground if necessary
allowing special vehicles such as
ambulances police patrols and fire
trucks to pass through tyre stopper this
barrier according to its creators is a
universal safety device capable of
stopping an automobile of any weight
significantly damaging its wheels
the two inches crossed teeth made of
galvanized steel and covered with an
extra layer of granular zinc are
activated by a hydraulic system that can
be operated automatically or by remote
control the parts of the device that
goes underground is also galvanized if
necessary the barrier commence stalled
next to a cleaning system with a
drainage pump allowing it to be
installed in areas with dusts chalk or
sand without harmful effects on the
mechanism in areas with sub-zero
temperatures the model can be installed
next to a steam heater it is worth
noting that the system has been
developed in such a way that it can
accurately stop any vehicle without
harming those inside when activated the
size of the teeth is 5 inches up an
insurmountable barrier for ordinary
vehicles
dinah spike unlike other devices on our
list this one is compact and highly
mobile however its small size does not
affect its effectiveness to transport
the device there must be removed from
its special aluminium case included with
the product and transported manually or
in the luggage rack of any vehicle
thanks to its small weight Dyna spike
can be installed and activated by one
person and the process of installing the
compact barrier will only take a few
seconds it is worth noting that the work
is automated and controlled by remote
control the device is made of sturdy yet
lightweight aluminium while the studs to
stop enemy vehicles are made of
stainless steel at the time was stopping
a car steal details pierced the tires
clutching and causing total air loss in
a few seconds through the tyre holes the
length of the device varies from 10 to
24 feet depending on the length of the
road and the number of tacks installed
star chase
here we have a GPS bullet used by the
American police thanks to this new
system police officers do not have to
chase criminals all over the city on the
contrary they only need to shoot once at
the criminals vehicle in order to know
its location the basis of this new
device is GPS technology the system is
activated once the police officer
presses a button on its vehicle the
button opens and opening in the car and
fires a special bullet that sticks to
the criminals vehicle basically the
device functions as a tracking system
cops can know the location of criminals
in real time once the bullets been
activated the developers of the
invention claimed that this idea is
allowed them to prevent a large number
of crimes including kidnapping of young
children and drunken driving policemen
in four states use the new system Iowa
Florida Arizona and Colorado in addition
the developers plans to introduce the
device to the European market the only
clear disadvantage of this new
technology is its price star chase
installation costs approximately $5,000
for each bullet cost $500
however specialists believe that bullet
prices will fall and that in a few years
all police patrols will have this system
