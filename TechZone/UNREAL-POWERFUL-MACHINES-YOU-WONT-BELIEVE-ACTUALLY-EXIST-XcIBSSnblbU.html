for large excavators weighing 20 to 35
tons the equipment provides screening of
materials of various types and ensures
high efficiency the MVS 18 is ideal for
procedures before and after crushing the
bucket is equipped with a front pin
which blocks the vibration of large
materials with sharp pass this increases
the carrying capacity of the basket in
addition the MB bucket loading system is
designed with a material that eliminates
friction at this stage and a flat base
for easy transport the capacity of the
mb/s 18 is almost 2.5 cubic meters and
the depth of the bucket basket is 1.2
meters the mass of this equipment is 2
tonnes TAC RAF ers 710 this is a multi
bucket excavator designed to dig and
move empty rocks and lorries the German
design of the TAC Graf ARS 710 ensures
that the bucket loaded raucous and
inside the vehicle where it's placed on
the rotating disc and then on the
conveyor belt to be sent to the wagon
the capacity of each bucket is 710
liters the bucket chain is suspended by
a system of cables and 36 buckets
driven by a 400 kilowatt motor through a
gearbox the throughput of the TAC RAF
ers 710 is approximately 14,500 cubic
meters per hour the entire machine is
complemented by a system of tubes that
also massively lubricate all the
mechanisms
trucks paid this machine is used to
transplant trees the truck Spade
manufactured by Dutchman Industries is
equipped with four special metal jaws
driven by powerful hydraulic drives the
iron blades are installed on a mobile
platform which is moved by the hydraulic
system the installation is placed around
the tree is then secured and the
hydraulic cylinders drive the blades
into the ground the high-pressure pump
pumps water from special holes in the
cutting edges of the blade providing
lubrication and facilitating the
movements of the machine's jaws when the
blades enter the soil completely they
create a semi sphere that separates the
trees root system from the rest of the
soil truck Spade can handle loads of up
to 10 tonnes and the whole process takes
only a few minutes
m5 X 400 the ways to clean up a polluted
pond or lake are one of the most
important aspects of improving the
reservoir and maintaining the ecological
balance of the environment the amphib X
400 allows you to do this quickly and
effectively this amphibious floating
excavator is a powerful multifunctional
mobile system that performs complex
operations without damaging the
surrounding ecological system the
machine can clean and augment the bottom
dig trenches for laying underwater pipes
and also functions as an ice breaker the
high permeability of the machine allows
its use in various water bodies in one
hour The Rake's and bucket facilities
collect up to a thousand cubic meters of
silt sand algae which can then be used
as fertilizer another advantage of the
amphib X 400 is that the machine uses a
special biodegradable fluid that is
environmentally friendly
Sena bogan 860m this green line series
material recharger is equipped with an
advanced diagnostic system that provides
a maximum efficiency in use and a
comfortable camp for working in all
weather conditions with good sound
insulation and excellent visibility the
operating weight of this shuttle is 71
tons and the load capacity of the Sena
Boggan 860m is twenty eight thousand one
hundred kilograms the maximum reach of
the boom is 22 meters the car is
equipped with a Cummins diesel engine
with a capacity of three hundred and
sixty-four horsepower the relocation
speed is 14 kilometers per hour and the
platform rotates at a speed of 6
revolutions per minute the German
manufacturer Senna bogans transshipment
excavator comes on a wheel chassis the
tires use a double stranded cable AMA
which prevents accidents when struck by
sharp metal debris this is why this
model is often used for loading scrap
metal and metallurgical companies and
ports
lexy owns 795 Monster Energy this
all-wheel drive combine harvester from
the German company class has been
launched and unlimited series the car
has a capacity of 585 horsepower the
maximum speed the lack see on 795 could
reaches 30 km/h the volume of the bunker
is equal to thirteen thousand five
hundred liters and the machine works in
conjunction with alexion 770 combine
harvester the model is equipped with a
special professional cutting mill and a
radial spreader the grain harvesting
technology has a unique aps threshing
system developed by class the
significant acceleration of the grain
mass flow from 3 to 20 meters per second
ensures maximum efficiency of all
subsequent processes the rotation speed
of these Lexia models is infinitely
adjustable with a rotary switch in the
range of 350 to 1050 rpm this ensures
not only a fast speed adaptation to
different crop types and harvesting
conditions but also the optimization of
the machines performance
Pantera 40502 this is a self-propelled
sprayer from the Amazon company thanks
to the 1.2 meter separation the Pantera

4,500 litres and a super l2 bar with a
working width of 21 to 40 meters the
machine is equipped with a 218
horsepower of motor capacity and a
continuously variable hydrostatic
transmission which allows it to move
comfortably at speeds of up to 50
kilometers per hour one of the main
features of the Pantera 4502 is the
unique tandem chassis with
hydropneumatic suspension which ensures
a smooth horizontal position of the rods
all four engine wheels are
electronically controlled so that even
in the most severe conditions the
position of the chassis remains optimal
despite the size of the chassis the
minimum turning radius of the machine
when moving the four wheels is only 4.5
metres
f60 this huge structure is the biggest
machine in the world capable of moving
independently this mining equipment
known as the overburden conveyor bridge
f60 has a length of 502 meters and a
weight of 13,600 tonnes the installation
is moved by two wheel chassis which in
turn move along two powerful paved rails
additional rails allow the movement of
the entire transformer substation and
their special wagons that pull the power
cables each of the two chassis has seven
hundred and sixty wheels 380 of which
are electrically driven the maximum
speed that the f60 can develop is 13
meters per minute and the speed in
production mode is 9 meters per minute
the cirtl amounts of power the
overburden conveyor bridge consumes
during operation is $27 the kilowatts in

simple transport with a folded mast and
a wide range of action thanks to the
parallel movement in addition the
machine has a reliable last which easily
senses both the Heights offered the
drill disc and the high tractive forces
at the cable feed system thanks to this
a high speed of drilling cycles is
achieved when working the weight of the
LB 28 is 98.7 tons the automatic torque
adjustment system in conjunction with
the varial speed adaptation system
allows you to adapt quickly to different
soil types this allows an optimal
drilling speed to be achieved the engine
