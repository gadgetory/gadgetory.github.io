evacuation of improperly parked or
damaged vehicles is perform by a special
service with equipment machinery and
trained personnel usually the procedure
doesn't take long
but sometimes the vehicles are in places
inaccessible to a tow truck in this case
the procedure becomes much more
complicated and time-consuming is
tracked and car tracked by multi tracks
are special vehicles designed to solve
this problem these tractors a crawler
truck which can be controlled by remote
control the equipment carefully slides a
loading platform under the car lifting
and sewing it to the right place each
tract can even transport a blocked
vehicle as well as a damaged or burned
vehicle
car track performs the same tasks and
work similarly the difference is that
this vehicle is meant the operation
moves it in front of him as if it were a
cart car track can be used on all types
of terrain - from asphalt to cement or
resin floors the manufacturer has
equipped the vehicle Moodle with a
variable frame for lifting vehicles of
different widths as well as with a
system that can be adjusted to the size
of the wheels and securely fix them
quick boat here we have a folding
portable boats that take sailing to a
new level
what everyone can afford to have their
own watercraft and one of the problems
is that you need space to store it when
folded the quick boat fits in a large
bag the boat can then fit in the trunk
of a car it's flat so it can be stored
in a garage or other similar place too
that means it takes up almost no space
it should be noted that no special
equipments or tools are needed to
assemble the quick boat either two
people can perform the procedure in just
60 seconds the device has few details so
the first time you assemble it he won't
need too much time in addition the parts
of the boat are made of plastic which
makes it lightweight the bag with a
folded quick boat weighs about 40
kilograms which means it can be carried
by one person once assembled the boat
weighs about 60 kilograms the ship is
supposed to be driven with paddles but
at the stern there is a place where the
engine can be installed the manufacturer
offers three models 3.7 liters 3.1
meters and 2 and a half meters long the
first can accommodate four people the
second can also accommodate four it is
lighter and easier to maneuver that see
when a half metre long model can
accommodate two people
the sweeper last year Israeli engineers
from ben-gurion University showed the
world for the first time a robot
specifically designed for harvesting
bell peppers the sweeper is an
intelligent robot that greatly
accelerates the harvesting of vegetables
replacing people at work is also
economically beneficial the device is
designed to move between plants on Rails
without hitting or damaging them
interestingly the special design allows
it to descend and ascend automatically
adapting to the height of each bush
the sweepers main feature is that it
scans the crop the intelligent system
evaluates each paper using artificial
fission if the machine decides that the
product is white it picks it up if not
it keeps going
preliminary tests have shown that the
sweeper performs the task successfully
in 62% of cases
Engineers of course will continue to
work and improve the machine to achieve
100% effectiveness so far the only
drawback of the robot is that it can
only work with those types of purpose
that show their ripeness on the outside
however this is a small problem as there
are quite a few varieties of this type
it's difficult to imagine the effects
that a widespread use of these robots
will have on agriculture Farms will be
able to harvest 24 hours a day without
rest and the procedure will be carried
out accurately in addition the number of
rotten vegetables which people couldn't
pick inside will decrease it is
revolutionary
Ford lane-keeping bet the average person
changes position 12 to 20 times in one
night while sleeping when two people
share the same bed problems often occur
one takes up more space in the bed while
the other sleeps on the edge this bed
developed by Ford specialists protects
both people's sleep and allows them to
sleep better interestingly automotive
technology was used to create the bed
the furnitures equipped with a system
that helps keep vehicles in the same
Lane while people sleep the system
controls the position of the bodies if a
person gets out of their Lane that is
their half of the bed the system then
reacts built in electric motors moves
the surface of the bed to the left or
right so that both partners remain on
their half split stone here we have a
hydraulic splitter designed to split
stones and rock the use of this
technique is relevant both in large
stone quarries and in small private
quarries the hydraulic mechanism
provides a clean and uniform cut even if
small pieces of rock are cut the device
is so precise that it can be used for
the final finishing of the stone to
sophisticated technology eliminates the
possibility of unwanted cracks and chips
the manufacturer offers a fairly large
number of models that differ in power
and performance in this case the Model S
100's show it is recommended to use the
split stone s100 as an accessory for a
tractor excavator or crane the patented
system makes it possible to calculate
the optimum splitting force so that the
technology splits the stone 50% faster
than conventional machines the use of
the split stone s100 is
I deal in situations where the use of
explosives is restricted the basic
models equipped with 15 wedges the type
of wedges could be changed to better
meet the customers needs as well
arrey traditionally parking at the
airport or train station is a long and
difficult process there are way too many
cars so you have to drive too long while
trying to find a suitable place
fortunately in a few years people will
probably be able to forget about this
problem forever for example at disel
Dorf Airport in Germany a single
automated parking robot has already
started operating when you arrive at the
airport just park your car in a special
place unload your luggage and then call
of robot grey arrives at the site and
quickly analyzes the size of the car the
position of location of protruding body
parts such as rearview mirrors
and then the robot lifts the car and
takes it to an empty spot in the parking
lot it should be noted that Ray doesn't
waste time searching for free spaces
either as is connected to a central
system which contains the latest data on
occupied and vacant spaces the work of
the robot can be compared to Tetris as
it's thoroughly analyzes the size of the
car and selects the right place the
system manages to place 60 percent more
cars than if people did it on their own
raised efficiency is guaranteed not only
by its intelligence but also by its
mobility the robots equipped with four
wheels which allow it to turn around its
axis
hey stop being lazy it's time to use
that brain of yours welcome to brain
time incredible facts from the past the
present and even the future the power of
