that the vehicle will go into mass
production in 2019 the designers managed
to create a sophisticated and at the
same time a very aggressive car the
exclusive multi-layer coloring of the
body added originality to the aspect of
the car its colour depends on the
viewing angle the surface is shimmering
with different shades from green suit
greenish blue
the outer body of the car is
complemented by the well recognized
elements borrowed from the M series a
double framed radiator grille Gill
shaped air intakes and jewel exhaust
pipes the car will replace these six
theories and will also challenge the
Mercedes s-class coupe a at the moment
there is no information about the
technical characteristics of the car the
only known detail is that the roof will
be made of carbon fiber is assumed that
under the hoods there will be a bi turbo
v8 4.4 engine with a power of more than
600 horsepower
Ferrari Monza sp1 and sp2 the cars that
you see on the screen were based on the
Ferrari 812 superfast coupe a and there
are almost no technical changes in
comparison to their predecessor the main
feature is their appearance
the designers managed to achieve a new
level of originality thanks to the
unusual body which has no roof or
windshield
the Ferrari Monza sp1 is a car for one
person while the Ferrari Monza sp2 is
designed for two people the dry weight
of the sp1 is 1500 kilograms and the
two-seater model is only 20 kilograms
heavier the bodies made of carbon fiber
it was decided to use the same material
for the in Syria which by the way
consists only of 812 elements the v12
six point five liter engine boast 810
horsepower and a torque of 790 Newton
meters the Ferrari Monza sp1 and SP to
go from naught to 100 km/h in 2.9
seconds just like its predecessor they
need just 7.9 seconds to reach 200 km/h
there is no information about the
maximum possible speed we only know that
it's more than 300 kilometers per hour
Ford Mustang bullet in 1968 the
legendary film bullets hit the screens
many remember the ten minute chase scene
with a dark green Ford Mustang 50 years
have passed and to mark the anniversary
Ford presented its new Mustang Bullitt
inspired by the famous car from the film
the new model differs from the serial
Mustang g/t in its appearance and
technical characteristics
the five liter v8 engine now has an
excellent control unit as well as the
wider throttle unit the Shelby gt350
these changes allowed the power to
increase from 460 to 475 horsepower the
maximum speed that the kupe can reach is
262 km/h it needs 4.1 seconds to reach a
hundred km/h the Ford Mustang bullet was
shown in early 2018 but the fans will
see it on sale in 2019

sports cars are also waiting for the
arrival of new cars in 2019 the new
Lamborghini Aventador svj will see the
light in the second quarter of next year
the car can be described by one word
ultra-modern
it's made of ultra light materials
focused on maximum performance it has
improved aerodynamic elements such as
the splitter the diffuser and the
spoiler the exhaust outlets have a
higher position in the exhaust system
inside there's a v12 engine with a
capacity of six and a half liters
interestingly the Lamborghini Aventador
SBJ is currently one of the fastest
serial road cars in the world on tests
the car covered 20.6 km/h remarkable
feature is the ceramic brakes they
reduce the stopping distance to 30
meters when the car is traveling at a
speed of 100 km/h our de trop at first
glance it may seem that this is a
completely ordinary traditional car
however LD experts have put a lot of
effort to make sure that all the details
effectively interact with the oncoming
airflow of all the details we especially
want to highlight the flat bottom the
active radiator shutters the small
external cameras on the mirrors as well
as the adaptive air suspension thus the
aerodynamic drag coefficient of the Audi
e-tron is only not 0.28 you may have
noticed that the car is a cross between
a crossover and a station wagon
as planned by the manufacturer the Audi
e-tron is a car that can easily replace
a standard crossover and the user will
need a minimum of time and effort to get
used to it inside there are two
three-phase electric motors with a
circle power of 408 horsepower the car
reaches a hundred km/h in less than six
seconds the vehicle can travel 400
kilometers on one charge the Audi e-tron
electric car was presented in September
but it will only be available in 2019

changes have affected the internal
structure the Aston Martin DBS
Superleggera has a 5 litre twin-turbo
v12 engine with 725 horsepower and a
torque of 900 music meters the 8-speed
automatic gear was refined and enhanced
the cast-iron disc brakes were replaced
by carbon ceramic instead of an
aluminium exterior panels the developers
used carbon fiber as a result of these
transformations the car lost 72
kilograms of dry weight in our ways 1693
kilograms the unique exterior features
include a modified bumper shape new
headlights thinner tail lights in a new
hood the maximum possible speed of the
Aston Martin DBS Superleggera is 340
km/h
you're gassy Devo the car that you see
on the screen is an evolution of the
bugatti chiron but visually it
technically it's very different from his
progenitor the body has acquired a new
shape painted with matte paint and the
carbon fiber parts make the car even
more stylish the 8-litre w16 engine has
four turbochargers a power of 1,500
horsepower and 1600 Newton meters of
torque experts worked on the weight of
the car and at the end the Bugatti Devo
lost 35 kilograms compared with the
sharam he now weighs nineteen hundred
and sixty kilograms but in terms of
speed the Devo isn't better than the
Chiron reaching only 380 km/h tops the
