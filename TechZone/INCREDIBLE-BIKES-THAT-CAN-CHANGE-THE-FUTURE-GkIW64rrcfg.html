manufacturers are sure that electric
vehicles are the future automobile
concerns are working on new concepts of
electric vehicles companies that produce
motorcycles don't stay behind the very
first presentation of this electric
motorcycle took place in 2014 but at
that time it wasn't possible to
implement the project due to some
technical and economic difficulties
at the end of January 2018
harley-davidson has finally made the
announcement that the motorcycle will go
into production in july 2019 livewire
considers it an advance in the
development of two-wheeled vehicles the
motorcycle offers seven different
driving modes so that everyone can
choose the best driving style in
addition the bike provides instantaneous
power efficiency when you turn the
accelerator handle this means that you
don't need to depress the clutch and
shift gears to enjoy the rides just turn
the accelerator handle the motorcycle
can be charged from a usual socket as
well interestingly livewire essentially
stimulated the development of a series
of electric bikes of the largest
motorcycle brand the company expects to
present electric motorcycles of all
categories by 2022
Honda v4 in 2008 during the inter moto
Motor Show in Cologne Honda demonstrate
how its experts believe motorcycles will
look in the future the concept words
attracted the attention of absolutely
all visitors is known as the Honda v4
pay attention to the wheels according to
the developers in the future rear-wheel
drive should be carried out by using a
roller on the wheel instead of a chain
or a curtain joint during the
presentation the company made a very
bold statement
the Honda v4 will go on sale in 2010
however as you may have guessed the
motorcycle has not entered the serial
production nevertheless it did set a
good direction for the development of
transport of the future
akira motorcycle the fantasies of
numerous designers as to how the future
vehicles will look are limitless it's
impossible to say exactly what they'll
be like but different concepts like the
one you see on the screen can give you a
general idea
this bright motorcycle with streamlined
forms was built by Japanese engineer
from Kitajima
at the show estudia his creation is an
exact replica of the motorcycle of the
protagonist of the cult 80's anime Akira
the story takes place in 2019 there for
a few decades ago the creators of the
anime fantasized about how the
motorcycles would look in the near
future 20 years after the show the same
motorcycle was really created now it
will become a prototype for the creation
of a new transport of the future
Honda motor compo we used to see that
motorcycles and cars of the future stand
out for their futuristic appearance with
smooth streamlined shapes and bright
colors however not all motorcycles that
can change the future look like that the
Honda motor combo is a very unusual
compact vehicle the surprises for its
appearance no less than amazing
futuristic designs do the bike is
designed to fit even and the smallest
luggage compartments its transformation
is amazing here we have a weirdly shaped
suitcase block weighing 45 kilograms
next thing you know it's a fully fledged
though small motorcycle originally the
Honda motor combo is designed to fit in
the trunk of a Japanese 1981 Honda Jazz
car moreover the trunk of this car was
created based on the parameters of the
motorcycle
/ / sensitives that the company expected
the but to become wildly popular but
this didn't happen
production has since ended but these
motorcycles are actually changing the
world not only do they set the standards
for compactness but also show other
companies in which direction they should
work

light communication technology above the
front lamp as a round lantern as well as
the rear light is able to transmit data
using multicolored signals it's possible
to receive the data with a smartphone
the lights transmits data at speeds of
up to 10 megabits per second at a
distance of up to 2 kilometers at that
time the technology was quite raw but it
showed that in the near future vehicles
will be able to become a source of
information
