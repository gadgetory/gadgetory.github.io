this extra heavy-duty harvester with
increased mobility is able to work even
on steep slopes and to process soft and
hard wood
all control is carried out from the
operators cab
however if necessary can be controlled
remotely another distinguishing feature
of this Harvester is the trailer which
helps to remove trees from the site of
harvesting without any additional
equipment
poncy scorpion king the creators of the
8 wheeled scorpion harvester are
primarily concerned with the operators
comfort this unique crane with excellent
visibility in all directions ensures
uninterrupted and flexible operation in
any conditions good visibility from both
sides of the cabin and allows an
efficient operation without restrictions
including selection of trees for cutting
the possibility of choosing the optimal
direction of the cutting and the
arrangement of fallen trees taking into
account their minimization of the impact
on the environment
thanks to the location of the cabin in
the center of the vehicle the operator
can clearly see as far as possible even
in dense forests the vehicle frame
consists of three elements connected by
rotating hinges and the excellent
stability of the pond scorpion is
provided by a unique active
stabilization system it works by
determining the direction and position
of the crane and then presses the rear
frame in the direction of work
Crona big x7 70 this combine equipped
with a 775 horsepower diesel engine
resembles other similar machines at the
krona group for its design but differs
from them for its increased level of
safety all details and parts in the
machine are visible
besides additional indicators are placed
in the combine harvester wings in
addition the Krone of big x7 70 differs
from its analogues by its braking system
of the cutting head of the drum which
stops the vehicle in ten seconds if
necessary
also these self-propelled combine
harvester is equipped with a special
power split system which provides
electronic control of the engine and
automatic regulation of the fuel supply
through the high-pressure ramp depending
on the load and the harvesting work thus
the power split system provides high
performance efficiency and fuel economy
the combine comes in various sets of
cutting mechanisms from 20 to 36 knives
Kong skilled a stone bear thanks to
these rock harvesters field machines
avoid breaking and stopping and also
they use less fuel and other pleasant
bonus is the increase of the harvest by
30% thanks to the improved soil quality
and its primary processing on both sides
of the machine there are special rotors
that rotate in opposite directions
picking up the soil and stones from 1 to
12 inches in diameter
gradually the stones move to the center
and fall into a special bunker with a
capacity of about two tons at the same
time all the soil is crumbled back onto
the field avoiding damage to the Fertile
layer the working width of the stone
bear can be of 13 and 17 feet depending
on the model which increases the
efficiency in speed also these rock
harvesters are equipped with wide
low-pressure tires which significantly
reduce soil compaction
Midwest Juris premium to date this
combine platform is considered one of
the widest in the world being 60 feet
wide the platform is equipped with
double synchronized knives of different
lengths as well as an air cushion that
supports the entire structure above the
ground reliable LED lamps delay to work
even in the dark and significantly
increase the safety of the whole process
tribe ein combine the tribe ein
harvester is unique in that it can
collect grain crops and also transport
them independently without the help of
an additional truck this is possible
thanks to an integrated cargo hold on
the combine which can carry about 27
tonnes of wheat
the tribe Iron Works on to Cummins
diesel engines that produce 590
horsepower each in addition the machine
is equipped with a special orga unloader
with a diameter of about 22 inches
located in the rear parts of the combine
the unloader is 23 feet long
class cougar 1400 this German car works
similarly to a lawnmower and weighs more
than 18 tons and is capable of
processing about 42 feet of land at the
same time the cutting speed is 20
hectares per hour the engineers were
worried about the comforts of the
operator so they equipped the air tight
cabin with an AC system a modern audio
system and a refrigerator the control is
carried out remotely using the
appropriate buttons and levers and the
cabin itself if necessary can be rotated
360 degrees for a better view of the
territory
five mowing blocks equipped with 35
double-edged disk knives are set in
motion by one button and this is not the
only simple control elements like most
modern heavy farm machines the Cougar is
equipped with a GPS system it's capable
of capturing mist grass patches on the
field and automatically returning to
them the electro hydraulic steering
wheel turning all four wheels that the
car makes it very maneuverable in
addition the Cougar can move sideways in
case the machine needs to be transported
from one field to another the mowing
sections can be folded thereby allowing
the vehicle to travel on roads
wood chipper machine this large garden
shredder is used for the disposal of
vegetable debris of any size branches as
well as tree trunks are fed to massive
metal gears with a moving belt and the
cutting system ensures a quick and quiet
as possible processing most of the work
is done autonomously the operator is
responsible only for loading material
crushed wood can be used as mulch to
cover garden parts under the preparation
of fertilizers
