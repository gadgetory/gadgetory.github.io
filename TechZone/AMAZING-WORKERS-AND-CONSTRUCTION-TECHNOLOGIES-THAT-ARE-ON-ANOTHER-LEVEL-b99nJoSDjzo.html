build a house you know how important
insulation is this is especially true
for the builders whose work we're
showing you now the installation process
consists of several steps each of them
should be carried out carefully and
thoroughly the first step is preparing
the wall the worker make sure the
surface is dry and then treats it with a
layer of deep penetrating primer
this composition improves adhesion
between the surfaces and protects them
from the harmful effects of humidity the
next step is installing a metal starter
strip it's important to position it
parallel to the ground otherwise the
installation material won't be laid
properly
after that the adhesive compound is
mixed and the workers start laying the
insulating material in this case
polystyrene foam sheets first glue is
applied to the inside of the sheets and
then they are attached to the wall at
this stage the Builder checks each
installed board with a construction
level in this way the entire surface of
the wall is covered the joints between
the sheets are filled with special foam
styrofoam is not a very solid material
so the wall is then polished to make it
smoother windows are also insulated the
sheets are shaped as needed using a
regular knife in the most exposed places
polystyrene foam is reinforced with a
metal mesh to avoid damage
production of reinforced concrete panel
construction that is the construction of
buildings made of reinforced concrete's
is currently very popular now I'm going
to show you how the slabs which later
become part of the buildings are created
the raw material is stone chips and sand
their ratios and types can vary to
achieve certain characteristics this
compound is delivered to a huge
industrial mixer via a conveyor belt and
is mixed to obtain a homogeneous viscous
consistency in this case a reinforced
concrete panel with a pass in is made
the template is cut out of special foam
beforehand the resulting letters are
placed on the bottom of the mould in
which the mixture will be poured later
the first is necessary to reinforce it
the workers put metal bars along the
mould the pressure on the metal is
transferred to the concrete making it
more resistant to cracks for this
purpose the bars are tensioned with a
hydraulic mechanism finally the mold is
ready for concrete casting in this case
the workers make a sandwich of two
concrete slabs and an installation
filling therefore when the first layer
of concrete is poured the insulating
foam is placed on top it is also covered
with reinforcing bars and covered with
concrete the surface is fastened and
left to dry for 12 hours then the worker
treats the pass at the surface with a
sandblaster to give the products that
required effect the concrete takes
another three days to gain strength
after which the panel is ready roof
waterproofing the construction of any
house involves the installation of a
waterproofing system
otherwise the result of all the hard
work will be ruined after the first
rainfall the video shows builders laying
a waterproofing layer on the roof
however they use an unusual material
this is shingle lament by the american
company grip right these are synthetic
roof base trees designed to replace the
felt which is used traditionally the
material stands out due to its light
weight these builders chose shingle
Ament because it's five times lighter
than felt so it's easy to lift it to
high grooves both sides of the shades
have a non-slip coating which also makes
the work easier the material has a high
tensile strength which makes it more
durable and more resistant to negative
external influences the installation
material is supplied in a large wide
role to cover as much roof space as
possible the more material the role
contains the less time it takes to
transport it take a look at the pattern
these lines guarantee and ease the
installation of the finishing material
glass tile mosaic small tiles are the
most common pool of finishing material
despite the fact that construction
workers have to install mosaics on
almost every construction site in the
world it is a complex procedure that
requires skill and experience
in this case the builders are replacing
the old coating with a new one builders
remove the old mosaic with a hammer and
a chisel and other tools before starting
the cleaned surface is smooth
glass mosaic is a flexible cladding
material consisting of a large number of
small tiles it may seem that each tile
is laid individually but it is not small
parts are fitted on a special plastic
mesh and placed on the wall in sections
the size of these sections can be
changed if necessary tiles are attached
for the special waterproof adhesive in
addition the workers grouts the joints
footpath repair concrete is a strong
durable material but even so it will
eventually collapse under the influence
of external factors the builders we're
now showing you are repairing various
types of damage to the concrete pavement
that soon as they use our simple bow so
the work is mainly done by skilled hands
first of all the concrete is mixed small
cracks are easy to treat they're cleaned
brushed and filled first with a special
compound and then coated with concrete
using a small trowel when it comes to
repairing a wider crack in his first
increased in size however strange that
may sound then it is cleaned wetted
filled the solution and leveled now the
master starts repairing the edges of the
footpath first as in previous cases the
damage is cleaned then the broken
concrete is removed because the surface
on the edges must be hard and strong
then the master drills a hole in the
concrete and sticks and metal barring
twists and then makes a supports to
shape the edge of the path the concrete
is then poured into the hole you can
even replace an entire section of the
path yourself
old concrete and excess soil are taken
out once again the worker makes a wooden
mold to pour the concrete he sprays the
wood with oil to make it easier to
remove it later first a thin layer of
sand is poured into the mold and
compacted and then the concrete is cast
bioclimatic pergola the last masters
we're going to show you today created a
complex wooden pergola with their own
hands without using any special
equipment the work begins with the
preparation of supports the first part
of the fastening element is mounted in
the asphalt the second part is attached
directly to the wooden supports
thanks to these elements the supports
can be positioned perpendicular to the
floor and securely fastened then on
these supports the builders attach the
cross beams part of the weight of the
structure is assumed by the building
which is why the beams are attached to
the wall of one end the main feature of
the future pergola is that the boards
which function as a roof can rotate to
enable the wooden blades to move the
experts fix them in special rotating
modules and they in turn are mounted
along all the cross beams beforehand
making a beautiful and very practical
pergola on a hot day you can close the
blades to keep away from the Sun and if
it's cloudy you can open them letting in
the light</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
