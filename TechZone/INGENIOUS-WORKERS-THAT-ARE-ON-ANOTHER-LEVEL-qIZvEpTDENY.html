plaster walls you need to properly
prepare the surface in order to ensure a
better adhesion of the plaster mortar to
the walls the preparation procedure is
performed by spraying a special mortar
on the walls consisting of sand and
cement the builders you see on the
screen have managed to minimize the
amount of time and effort spent on the
whole procedure the solution is mixed
using a special equipment instead of the
traditional manual method it produces
large quantities of material at once
enough even for large objects the mixing
machine can also operate as a powerful
pump the craftsman connected a hose to
it and then went up the equipment easily
pumps the solution over enough though
the hose is very long this way their
builders easily spray the morsel on the
walls like water once the materials
applied to the walls it is leveled out
for further plastering
installing briquette if you've ever seen
a clinker brick or any other similar
citing material being applied to a wall
you know it's a very messy job that
requires a lot of patience and precision
from the worker even the slightest
mistake can result in a crooked row of
bricks and then another one and so on as
a result he will have to either start
again or the result won't look good
the innovative briquette system greatly
simplifies the job of the builders while
increasing productivity on the
construction site that is because this
way of laying clinker bricks allows you
to perform the work approximately three
times faster the first stage is not
covering the wall with masonry mortar as
it's usually done instead metal panels
are mounted to the wall this is the only
stage where you need to be very precise
the panel's must be attached to the
walls strictly horizontally when this is
done you can proceed with the
installation of the bricks attaching
them to the metal panels with glue the
strip's act as a guide so that the rows
of bricks are perfectly even the final
step is to fill the joints between the
bricks with matter
concrete door most people prefer wooden
or metal doors but in some places in the
world who can find unique handmade
concrete doors in order to make one of
these a very small number of molds and
tools are needed for example to mark the
edges of the future door to metal bars
are placed on the ground parallel to
each other another metal block is used
to compact and remove excess material
the surface of the future door is
finally leveled with the help of spatula
the surface of the finished product will
have horizontal openings making it look
like a grid
in order to measure their width that
marked the location the worker uses the
same metal bar in trailers when the
future door is marked it's time to take
out the unnecessary concrete slabs for
this purpose the surface of these still
wet concrete is cut exactly along the
markings the cut pieces are lifted up
with a knife and then simply removed and
pull the site when this stage is over
the holes need to be smoothed out using
the trowel on the spatula again thus
anyone who has a basic set of
construction tools some patience and
precision can build this door
decorative walls finishing modern
construction material companies offer a
wide range of mixtures solutions paints
and varnishes their composition is
tailored to ensure that the finish is
unusual and unique in this case for
example several types of coatings are
mixed to create a surface
imitating masonry blocks moreover these
coatings are not ordinary they have a
peculiar texture all the products shown
in the video are produced by the serbian
company maxima first the wall is coated
with acrylic base roller grunt it makes
the surface coarser so that the
following layers have finish idea better
the next layer is maxi deck or
travertine Oh as a matter of fact it is
lime plaster which is usually applied in
order to increase the protective
properties at the surface but in this
case it also serves for design purposes
the material has a thick consistency and
is applied to the wall in an even and
dense layer before it dries the worker
uses a brush to create additional
texture then he traces the grooves on
the wall to achieve the effect of a
surface lined with blocks a layer of
acrylic primer is applied after that
finally the wall is covered with the
translucent decorative paint maxi decor
Velachery
the surface turns out beautiful and
original concrete flooring concrete is
probably the most flexible material you
can use when you want to create
something the video shows how it can be
used to make an interesting and unusual
flooring at first the mold is filled
with thin mortar compacted to evenly
fill the mold see the three openings in
the middle so far they remain empty but
later they will be colored the surface
is very large which is why this process
requires more complex and bulky tools
compared to the creation of a concrete
door in this case the floor is supposed
to be very dark so a dark grey dye is
applied to the concrete this procedure
has done several times
before stamping the surface is also
treated with powder of intermediate
color to make these surface look more
vivid and rich the stamp itself is
needed to make the flooring looked like
tiles when the main surface is ready the
remaining holes undergo the same
procedure the only difference is that
the dye is not dark grey but green and
orange the final stage of floor creation
is coating the surface with acrylic
sealant for protection brick' wood
houses we want to talk about a French
construction company that has
revolutionized the way modern wooden
buildings are built brick' wood has
developed a construction technique where
only one component is used to build
walls it's a wooden brick the system
resembles a Lego construction set first
a frame is made of wooden beams then
when it is time to erect the wall the
blocks are stacked on top of each other
they are securely connected to each
other through special grooves inside and
on the sides the system is passing sit
and there are bricks of three sizes
thanks to this there are no difficulties
on the construction sets notice that
during the installation of the wall one
block is placed on the outside and the
other on the inside
the strength of the construction is
enhanced by the wooden bars clamped
between the two blocks the result is a
simple economical and eco-friendly house
with proper sound and thermal insulation
