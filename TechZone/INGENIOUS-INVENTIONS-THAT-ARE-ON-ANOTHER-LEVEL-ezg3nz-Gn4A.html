make the wheels of a car slip resistant
but the simplest one is to install this
system known as spikes spider it's an
original swiss invention which received
its name not by chance the device really
looks like a spider the installation
takes only a few seconds you don't need
a jack or any other tools either the
spiked spider is mounted on the
protector after which the vehicle is
protected against slipping even if the
road is covered with ice
foldy mate our life is filled with
day-to-day chores and it's quite
difficult to escape from this routine
small household tasks don't take long
but we always have a lot to do
folding mate is a device created
especially to help busy people with it
you can forget about organizing the
closet which usually takes up your free
time folding mate folds clothes to the
perfection that only an automated
machine can provide it's important to
note that it doesn't matter what kind of
clothes we're talking about either the
device is capable of correctly folding
clothes bedding towels and in a matter
of seconds distinguishes them from each
other all you have to do is hang things
in a special holder at the top of the
device and then pick up the folded stack
of clothes at the bottom this automatic
folding device for clothes and bedding
was introduced several years ago and the
start of sales was planned for 2018
however at CES 2018 which took place in
January engineers from a California
startup showed their invention again and
announced that the miraculous device
will be available for sale in the second
half of 2019
the approximate price is $1,000 in the
course of several years of development
the folding mate has increased in size
now its highest is 125 centimeters its
width 60 and its depth 70 between five
and six kilograms of clothes and bedding
fit into a normal washing machine at
full load folding mate doubles the same
amounts of clothes in just four minutes
painting robots the introduction of
robotic machines in new areas of our
life is gradually helping humanity to
reach new levels of development robots
don't make mistakes and perform their
tasks with great precision in addition
their working speed is much faster than
that of people and they don't need to
rest these are the reasons why robots
that paint cars are becoming more and
more popular and demanded here we can
see the painting robots used by the
German company doer world leader in the
production of snow cats using them
reduces the duration of the painting by
half the robot contains a cabin in less
than an hour so the company produces up
to six hundred such cabins a year the
work is done in a special box first the
robots the eco are PLO 33 applies to
bases of primer and then after a short
drying applies the paint it should be
noticed that the engineers equipped the
robot arm with a device for
color-changing and dosing which reduces
the loss of paint when changing color
the roller transporter has a rotary
table and a tilting function so that the
robot can evenly paint the entire
surface
in form a few years ago
engineers at tangible Media Group a lab
at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology created an incredible
touchscreen concept it looks like a bold
attempt to realize teleportation
fantasies in real life the system
consists of a rectangular flat screen
and a scanner on the screen there are
pixels that can change the height and
create different shapes on the surface
special sensors which are located nearby
scan any object and then display them on
the screen the system scans objects in
real-time so that the shapes on the
screen can change and move in other
words the user can interact with the
screen with the help of fake hands while
being far away in addition the screen is
touch sensitive that is it's able to
response a pressure in the opinion of
the engineers of the Massachusetts team
the touchscreens that we all use
nowadays are just one step on the way to
the moment when our devices of the
equipment levers that pop up and
disappear inflatable buttons and wavy
dials that's what they wanted to
demonstrate with inform
let's pizza there's probably no one who
doesn't dream of a world where you can
buy a hot delicious pizza on every
corner fortunately there are already
vending machines that can make pizzas
they can be placed in shopping and
business centers airports universities
and other public places in short
wherever there are hungry shoppers this
machine prepares the pizza before the
eyes of the user who can observe the
process through a special window when
the piece is in the box
it's ready to eat the product is fresh
hot and straight out of the oven the
advantage of the machine is that there's
no human intervention so each product
has the right shape great quality and
excellent taste the cooking process
takes no more than three minutes so the
idea behind the creation belongs to the
Italian businessman Claudio tall yellow
is let's pizza machine can cook four
varieties the classic margarita bacon
ham and a vegetarian pizza
Bell Nexus we've already talked about
the consumer electronics fur which
attracts thousands of people every
January during the events the most
surprising novelties in the industry is
shown at CES 2019 the American
helicopter manufacturer Bell
demonstrated the Nexus vehicle for the
first time this unusual and original car
is nothing more than a project for an
urban air taxi with this innovation the
company highlighted that vertical
takeoff and landing solutions are
increasingly in demand we live in a
world where space is increasingly
limited and we have to take this into
account when creating new vehicles in
the future similar vehicles will replace
the taxis people use today to stay in
the air the aircraft uses a hybrid
electric propulsion system powered by
six ink lines duct fans each has its own
electric motor this design has been
chosen because it provides greater
safety for passengers getting in and out
of the vehicle in addition there's
helicopter is less noisy the Bell Nexus
is designed to carry four passengers as
well
Meiri here is an elegant alternative to
all modern intelligent home systems the
development was shown in January of this
year by the Japanese startup Mui lab the
system will be appreciated by lovers of
minimalism since Miri is essentially a
wooden block attached to the wall inside
there is a matrix of diodes so
information about climates weather and
humidity is reflected on the surface
muley makes a lot of useful features
available to the user for example you
can control the intelligent speakers by
changing the track of the volume in
addition the device allows you to
control other smart devices at home the
surface of the gadget is a touch sensor
but you can also command it with your
voice and of course Miri works with the
Google Voice assistance once launched
this device will cost about $1000
