taking your treadmill out to the street
might sound crazy nevertheless exactly
that inspired gadgets here Bruin
Bergmeister and his creation became
quite famous all over the world he
created a new and unique vehicle a
hybrid between an electric bike and a
treadmill the device has no pedals and
it uses electricity to move around to
start traveling around you need to put
your right leg in the platform and use
your left leg to gain impulse after that
a special sensor detects the movement
and the bike starts going while the user
runs on the treadmill as if we were at
home or in the gym the electric motor
allows reaching a speed of fifteen point
five miles per hour which compared to
the 2.5 miles per hour of a person is
quite impressive in other words the
owner of this bike can walk with the
speed of a bike and travel more than
thirty miles on his feet this unusual
means of transport is 7.2 feet long 1.3
feet wide and 3 point 9 feet tall the
bike works with a lithium-ion battery
with six different modes protected by
steel body at the moment you can find
the de Lappe fit walking bike in six
different colors red orange blue white
black and silver and buy it for two
thousand two hundred and thirty seven
dollars
bird-of-prey unlike other more normal
bikes in which the driver is sitting the
creators of this bike proposed the owner
to drive while lying almost parallel to
the ground
this body posture increases aerodynamics
and reduces the effort and the load in
the backbone allowing even people with
back problems to enjoy a ride the
position of the bike driver is similar
to that of swimmers or birds in flight
the body is held by the thigh and it's
quite comfortable to move the pedals the
bike also has a low center of gravity
and the frame is made of aluminium also
allowing riding even faster despite the
strange body posture this vehicle is
completely safe even if the driver has
to brake suddenly the driver would not
end up flying in the air this horizontal
bike can be bought for $4,800 quiggily
compact and foldable bikes and one of
the trends of our modern world and in
this case the lights of the bike the
better the ride this is the main idea
behind this bicycle sort of a hybrid
between a scooter a bike and a
motorcycle
the unusual construction forces the
driver to ride practically in an upright
position although there is a seat but
it's used more for support than to avoid
falling back to be honest the bike is
quite peculiar but the developers say
that this position is comfortable and
helps you to avoid overload in the
backbone the neck and the shoulders
despite its strange look the bike can be
disassembled in 10 seconds and is quite
compact measuring 21 point 6 inches by
15 point seven inches by 9 point 8
inches in its folded State the bike is
ultralight weighing eighteen point seven
pounds a lot less than similar bikes on
the market the frame is made of
aluminium the bike is equipped with
solid wheels and a plug-in handle and a
bending frame in the back it also has
enlarged compressed air tires and extra
protection in the wheels and brakes the
vehicle isn't on the market yet there
will be soon and its price will be
around fifteen hundred
the by simple this bikes main feature is
that it works without your usual chain
system in order to ride its you just
have to spin the back wheels pedals and
the bike will move as usual the by
simple works basically as a circus
unicycle but it's been upgraded and it's
great to use in the city the lack of a
chain called for a series of other
changes so instead of your usual
triangular frame the wheels are
connected by a crank arm axis with two
parallel tubes for more rigidity the
front part of the bike as usual allows
you to control the bike while the back
part comes with a seat the lack of a
separate pedal gear allowed the
developers to bring together the wheels
making the bike more maneuverable for
example this design makes it effortless
to overcome any obstacle in your way
right now this vehicle can be bought in
two different sizes depending on the
height at the driver you can buy the
basic version for $800 on Kickstarter
hal Brad this bicycle created by a
German developer has a unique
construction and looks like half a
normal bike making it different from any
vehicle in the market nevertheless the
producer assures that the hal brad is
great for city environments the device
has a big rear wheel and a small front
wheel the triangular frame makes it easy
to transport and given the size you
don't even have to fold it the bike is
38 inches tall 31 inches long and it
weighs 22 pounds the bike features a
two-speed drivetrain and a coaster brake
it also has a 35 inch turning radius and
can stand by balancing the front wheel
and pedal it's worth noticing that the
usual bike handlebar was changed by a
control leaver placed on the back of the
driver the bike comes in three colors
and its price is around $1500
running shoe bike
this unusual bike was duly noted at the
Prudential Ride London in July 2016 the
main feature of this bike which
otherwise is similar to any other bike
in the market is that it doesn't have
tires instead of tires the arms of each
wheel are equipped with six identical
running shoes so that's why many know
this vehicle as the running shoe bike
truth be told you can't find it on the
market and the bike created by traveller
Steve Biggs is considered a bumpy
vehicle Bionic runner this is another
bicycle that imitates the process of
running the Bionic runner has no seat
and uses a special construction to
protect the owner from injuries in the
feet this vehicle actually looks like a
training machine to work the middle
parts of the feet and the same muscles
you use when running but protecting them
from the load of running in hard
surfaces the device has a folding
aluminium frame and it's easy to
transport in the trunk of any car the
construction also comes with a
mechanical disc brake and an 8-speed
transmission that lets you regulate the
efforts and change your gear depending
on your necessities the bike weighs 40
pounds and the price goes from eight
hundred and ninety dollars to fifteen
hundred dollars depending on the model
walking bike sadly this bike is not
going to hit the market but is still one
of the strangest bikes on today's video
the front wheel the frame the handle and
the pedals look just like usual but
instead of a rear wheel the creator's
installed a series of metallic elements
similar to the legs of a spider apart
from the usual elements of a normal bike
the device has more than 450 metallic
pieces and 120 plastic plugs this
vehicle underwent a long making process
from being a mere 3d model to a
regular-sized bike but it's still not
going to be on the market anytime soon
the bike can reach a huge speed but can
only travel through flat surfaces
nevertheless the effect is quite cool
and has been shown in several
exhibitions Parov a low flying bike the
creators of this project have joined the
new trend of creating new weird bikes
and they've developed a vehicle that can
travel on the earth and in the air too
this singular three-wheeled bike is
equipped with a turbine an engine and a
paragliding like wing which you can
carry in a bag in the back of the driver
the person riding this unusual vehicle
can decide to travel through land using
your usual wheels and pedals combo or
better fly through the air with the help
of a powerful engine and you don't even
need a takeoff runway to fly away the
paragliding wing of the turbine allow
the bike to take off really quickly and
ten feet of free land would be enough
this unusual flying vehicle weighs only
74 pounds it can reach a height of a
mile and a speed of 24 miles per hour
the fuel would be enough to fly for
three hours you can buy this flying
bicycle and forget about traffic for
only $45,000
the jet bicycle this bicycle powered by
a homemade jet engine is considered the
most dangerous in the world and we can't
argue with that
it is as crazy as it looks said about
his creation a British inventor famous
for many other crazy ideas the jet
engine is longer than usual by 15 inches
from the backseat and the homemade
turbines and can reach an incredible
speed of 50 miles per hour making it
quite dangerous both for the driver and
the people around riding at a speed of
30 miles per hour is quite pleasant but
at a speed of 40 miles per hour the bike
is very shaky and extremely difficult to
control the tyres can't withstand the
pressure and the chances to die are
quite high</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
