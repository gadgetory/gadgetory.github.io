of training racing horses that is the
initial trainer when a young horse meant
for a good future in the sport starts to
exercise its muscular skeletal system is
still not ready
very often the owners of racehorses
who've just started their training folks
the problem that horses get injured the
problem is not only the injury but also
that its career would be shorter and
reduces its potential for reproduction
but the horses can forget about these
problems with this innovative learning
system by Kurt systems it's an equipment
that trains young racing horses
developing and strengthening the
musculoskeletal system the advantage of
this training system is that it
eliminates the risk of human mistake as
the whole training process is controlled
by a smart fine-tuned equipment studies
have shown that horses with a strong
flexible body structure suffer less for
injuries this is why curt systems was
invented tests show that a six-month
horse training program using Kerr
systems maximizes strength endurance and
adaptation to stress the system moves
along the racetrack with adjusted speed
so tired horses can't walk frisked or
gallop
badger breaker before laying down fresh
pavements you need to remove the old one
because it's a very solid layer of
asphalt the best way to break it is
impact batches state highway equipment
company launched its first asphalt
braking machine in 1988
since then the lineup is expanded the
manufacturer offers four machines now
with different capacity and workspace
with the video demonstrates the work of
the models mhb and the 8600 both are
slow-moving cars with jackhammers
attached to the rear part the MHB is
powerful enough to work using hammers
weighing from 550 to 800 kilograms each
pair of hammers has attached to a
hydraulic lifting cylinder the power of
the impact on the pavement varies from
one hundred and thirty eight to eleven
hundred and six kilogram meters the work
cycle is set by the people manually and
the hammers can make from thirty to
thirty five impacts per minute another
equipment the 8600 model delivers
increased horsepower
the width of his hammer is almost two
and a half meters and it weighs about
five and a half tons
piano left the weight of a standard
piano can range from 210 to 260
kilograms the weight of a grand piano is
almost 2 times bigger and varies from
350 to 500 kilograms of course it is
extremely inconvenient for
transportation in addition to the huge
weight the instrument has considerable
dimensions which complicates its
transporting even more it should also be
mentioned that pianos are quite fragile
musical instruments despite all the
difficulties the transportation must be
done carefully for a long time the
transportation of the instrument from
place to place was a real nightmare you
had to hire a team of workers and
sometimes even some specialized
equipment
piano lifts allows you to transport the
instrument with minimal resource and
with no headache its size and allowable
weight load will allow you to transport
a variety of models from small to quite
large carefully quickly and accurately
testing showed that the maximum weight
load that it can withstand is 600
kilograms the device is a tracked
platform to which the instrument is
attached with straps piano lift has
optimal stability and maneuverability
and is able to overcome such obstacles
as stairs
hydro combi 18 the Austrian company posh
is engaged in the production of various
equipment meant to cut hardwood logs the
lineup named hydro combi is a series of
powerful vertical splitters which are
easy to use and very fast they allow you
to split logs smoothly safely and
reliably there's about 10 models in the
lineup that differ in size and therefore
power the video shows the medium power
equipments the hydra combi 18 the
principle of operation of all models is
quite similar that they are all equipped
with a log lift and a cable winch thanks
to this system even one person is
capable of firewood production all you
need to do is attach the winch to the
log and press the button the machine
itself will pull up the log hang it and
fix it after that you can turn on the
cutter and put the log in the position
you need for cutting it's noteworthy
that each of these machines is equipped
with a system fix automatic which
independently fixes the log when it was
given a desired position that is when
splitting you don't need to hold the log
this increases safety of operation the
blade is sharp enough to cut through
even large logs as if they were very
soft Hydra combi 18 wastes 380 kilograms
and has a splitting power of 18 tons its
cutting speed is 19 centimeters per
second
p.m. 1000 URM this is an amazing massive
machine designed to perform the most
complex train operation ballast
recycling this is a mineral granular
material used for construction of the
upper part of the railways it fills the
space between the roadways and the
sleepers the rail supports as it's
responsible for vertical and horizontal
stability at the railway it's high
quality is very important the PM 1000
URM performs a complete cycle of ballast
replacement the first conveyer train
removes the top layer of ballast
straight from the ground it goes into a
special compartment where it goes
through a thorough cleaning procedure
debris and metal particles were removed
from the mass and then the stones are
given the necessary pointed form when
the processing is completed the ballast
goes to the third conveyor chain and
it's ready to be reapplied the whole
time while stones are being cleaned and
processed the second chain conveyor is
working it removes the bottom layer of
the blanket consisting of soil it's also
processed sorted and then port back when
the soil is laid out the cleaned ballast
is poured on top and then temped thus
the PM 1,000 URM allows to handle up to
1400 metres of Road per day all work is
done directly under the rails without
even damaging them the manufacturer
claims that the use of the PM 1000 erm
allows to accelerate the progress by 50%
in comparison with traditional methods
all because the source material is 100%
recycled so there's no logistic pause
zipper truck making tunnels can be quite
a complex process as construction
materials should be stored in such a way
to withstand their own load without
collapsing
it's especially complicated at the
initial stage in order for the tunnel
not to collapse during the construction
supports are used in this case a
specially equipped truck is used on the
body there's the semicircular frame
attached whose main feature is a huge
number of wheels located at the same
distance from each other so the zipper
truck performs the role of a mold on
which the blocks are stacked when each
part of the tunnel takes its place that
NIT takes its final form the truck
leaves with ease
