total secrecy by Greg Henderson and a
team of 19 people can rise from the
ground and float in the air with the
user on top but only for seven minutes
that I'm the last the full charge the
device works thanks to the principles of
electromagnetic fields similar to how
magnetic levitation trains work but
unlike trains the hando skateboard is a
lot cheaper in addition this technology
could be used in space projects and in
the construction of earthquake resistant
houses currently you can only ride this
hoverboard on aluminium or copper
surfaces it's quite difficult to control
and also generates a loud and annoying
sound similar to that of a police siren

improve these problems if you want to
