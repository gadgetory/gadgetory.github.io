thousand milliamp hour capacity the
battery can recharge a laptop up to
three times a tablet up to seven times
or power a TV for up to four hours plug
was created to pack the most amount of
power in the smallest form possible with
our unbeatable performance and longevity
Tesla battery cells were the obvious
choice in addition to using a wall
outlet you can refill the battery with
an optional weather resistant solar

none of the small parts will be lost the
tubes are made up from a highly rigid
yet delicate polymer did you not get
worn down and are stable enough to rub
away encrusted dust and dirt
dusty brush is universal with the
integrated adapter making it possible to
fit onto all vacuum cleaner tubes skully
