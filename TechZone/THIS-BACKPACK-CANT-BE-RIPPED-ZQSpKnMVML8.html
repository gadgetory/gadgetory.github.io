have other similar hobbies active and
extreme know that keeping clothes in
their original state for a long time is
simply impossible when civilization is
far away you never know when a sharp
stone or branch will tear through the
fabric making the piece less suitable
for use the specialists as Imperial
motion decided to solve this problem and
offer their customers safe clothes
preventing the user from worrying about
them this is how nano cure tech appeared
an ultra light water resistant fabric
whose main characteristic is its
self-healing capacity if the surface is
damaged it's enough to pass your finger
a couple of times over the hole for the
hole to close thus in a few seconds the
broken or perforated bang returns to its
original ideal state the secret lies in
the fabric nylon ripstop famous for its
greater resistance to damage the
reinforcement threads don't allow small
cuts or holes to become enlarged the two
layers of the silicone rip stop above
and below react to the temperature of
the fingers and close the hole Imperial
motion offers backpacks windbreakers
sweatshirts and even winter jackets made
from this fabric
zip stitch the technology we're about to
talk about will also be very useful for
people who leave an active lifestyle
this doesn't mean however that other
people can't use it the fact is that
when a person's injured cuts or bitten
by an animal it's not always possible to
seek immediate medical help if the
incidence occurs far from civilization
it's necessary to travel to the nearest
health center the problem is that before
the person gets there the wound can
become infected with unpleasant
consequences
zip stitch comes to the rescue though
it's a compact device that closes the
wound and prevents bacteria from
entering zip stitch is a great
complement to a first-aid kit but it's
also small enough to fit in any pockets
it's very easy to use as well you should
first wash your hands with soap and
water or use a disinfectant then it's
necessary to stop the bleeding it's
important to do this before using the
zip stitch by exerting pressure then you
have to rinse the room with water and
remove any remaining dirt such as stones
or spoons us finally you must dry the
skin around the wound and clean it with
the included disinfectant cloth zip
stitch was then applied to the wound and
sticks to it the only thing left to do
is to gently pull on the straps to draw
the edges of the wound together and
apply a protective patch by the way if
the wound doesn't cause discomfort it
doesn't necessarily have to be treated
by a doctor
zip Stitch allows it to heal in just a
week you can buy this for $30
phantom camera and bolts in a bot in the
last few decades video recording
equipment has taken a big leap forward
today professional high speed camcorders
can deliver an image of incredible
quality even if you have to shoot in
slow motion the video shows a phantom
camera from world famous manufacturer
Vision Research mounted on a unique
robot's lead bolt sinha bot the phantom
cameras are very different some of the
images were taken on a flex model others
on the onyx model both are included in
the line of equipment designed for the
production of audio-visual material and
2k and 4k shooting
according to the manufacturer they
provide unprecedented shooting at high
speeds and guarantee high image
resolution the Onix provides 2k shots at
a frame rates of 12,500 frames per
second and the Flex shoots at 4k of
thousands frames
bolts in a bot is a robot designed
specifically for firming it gives the
cameraman greater control and allows
even the most complex camera movements
to be performed accurately and in just a
fraction of a second the manufacturer
says that the bolts in a bot is the
world's fastest high-speed robot
together with the camera is one of the
most impressive video capture
technologies in the world today
DICE production the video shows the
production process at a factory owned by
starry games high quality acrylic is
used as the raw material and it's new
and clean so the finished dyes comply
with international safety standards
thanks to the initial qualities of the
acrylic the dice are elastic ensuring
production it's easy to control the size
shape and originality
when the acrylic melts it shouldn't be
too liquid so the percentage of moisture
and it is reduced before production if
this is not done the material won't be
flat and there'll be air bubbles inside
the die damaging the final product is
also the risk of getting a batch of
swollen dice which is considered a
defect the factory workers mix the dyes
and strict proportions daring to the
formula to ensure that the color of the
pigments and therefore the dice is
correct
experts constantly compare it to the
Pantone color models the acrylic and the
dye then mixed after which the employee
pause the math since the casting
equipment inside the material is melted
after which the machine squeezes this at
high pressure into the prepared molds as
the material cools it takes the form of
the cubes almost ready for use pay
attention to the sharp and uneven edges
of the dust which must be removed for
this purpose the cubes are treated in
grinding drums for 8 to 16 hours
simultaneously up to a hundred thousand
cubes are polished then the holes shown
the numbers should be painted on it's
not done manually a special smart
machine determines where the holes are
and fills each of them with a fair
amount of paint it should be noted that
a few years ago each bucket was painted
by hand today people have been replaced
by seven automated machines which has
increased the production capacity and
now three hundred thousand more dice
that produce per day this process is
eight times faster than the traditional
one the last stages of production are
additional
polishing first excess paint is removed
and then the surface is polished to make
it smooth and shiny both processes last
a total of 24 hours
Eco wave power humanity continues to
develop new ways of generating
electricity that are more perfect and
environmentally friendly for example
just a few years ago an alternative
energy company called eco wave power was
established as you may have already
guessed from the name and images the
company uses special technologies who
generates electricity from the waves
according to the company's founder this
idea isn't new people have already tried
to get energy from the waves but the
stations were built in the open sea
where the waves are stronger most of
them have gone bankrupt as construction
and maintenance were expensive and they
have to spend money on transporting
electricity there generated eco wave
power has come up with a way to get
electricity without having to deal with
these problems 90% of the equipment they
developed is on land and only the floats
are then placed in the water
surprisingly they can be attached to any
artificial structure such as play
quarters and docks Eco wave powers first
commercial project was implemented in
Gibraltar and in the future this system
will supply up to 15% of its energy
needs
hey stop being lazy it's time to use
that brain of yours welcome to brain
time incredible facts from the past the
present and even the future the power of
