uniform layer of thick fluffy grass is
the best and most versatile way to
decorate a house the problem is that
grass needs lots of time to grow and for
the grass to have a perfect appearance
you will need to work hard
a solution to this problem is salt or
turf which can be transported in stacks
or rolls this grass carpet is grown in
greenhouses on special shelves to make
it easier to move professionals
fertilize the grass make sure that it
germinates smoothly and basically do
everything possible to create a perfect
product
when the length of the grass reaches 8
to 12 centimeters the layer is ready to
be moved to its permanent location the
surf is simply placed on prepared ground
it takes 30 days for the grass to take
root in the soil after that it will not
differ in properties from usual grass
and it will look even better
pool cover catching leaves another
debris from the pool can be very tedious
of course you can always cover the pool
but you need a few minutes of precious
time to do so the design you see on the
screen
saves both time and effort it's a pool
cover that unfolds on its own all the
years asked to do is press a button on
the remote control the pool cover can
have a wide variety of designs some for
example look like a blanket floating on
the surface of the pool
the plastic clips on the unfolding
device prevents the cover from wrinkling
too thanks to them it fits evenly and
covers the entire pool area
another option are dense floating
shutters the size can vary and they can
be made to order so you can cover
absolutely any pool even a big one
stickit tiles
perhaps the most common material for
finishing kitchens and bathrooms is
ceramic tiles
despite its attractive appearance and
durability ceramic tiles do have
disadvantages for example the
installation process is complicated the
tiles are pretty heavy and fragile so
they can crack if handled carelessly
this means that it takes a long time for
the surface to be renewed or laid for
the first time the material you see on
the screen looks like a tile but it
doesn't have these drawbacks stickit is
the ideal choice for people who want to
quickly and easily change the appearance
of the kitchen or bathroom
the wide variety of coating types is an
advantage stick it is a tile that can
imitate not only ceramics but also glass
natural stone and even metal it is
noteworthy that the material can be
attached to almost any surface on top of
already laid tiles dry painted walls or
plastic panels the process of installing
stickit is quite simple the first thing
you need to do is measuring the work
area to know how many tiles you need
then the surface is wiped down there
should be no dirt or grease on it
finally all that remains is to remove
the protective film from the back of the
tile and attach it to the wall the
material is soft so that you can give it
any shape with a knife the last step is
filling the joints with silicon sealant
trampoline installation a swimming pool
is not the only way to have fun when you
have a big yard a trampoline can cheer
up all the family members keep them busy
for long hours and provide physical
exercise for everyone
the safest trampoline is the one you see
on the screen because it's in-ground
when jumping you don't expose yourself
to additional danger risking falling
over the edge from a height as is the
case with above-ground trampolines
another advantage of this design is that
it's quick and easy to install in this
case special equipment was used the
excavator digs a perfectly round hole in
the ground
the metal frame which serves as the
basis for the trampoline is assembled by
the workers right on the lawn when the
frame is assembled the structure is
placed inside the pet the soil is
distributed to encircle the frame and
provide stability finally the last step
is the installation of the jumping zone
on the springs by the way the material
is not elastic the trampoline works
thanks to the springs due to the fact
that the fabric needs to be drawn very
tight the procedure is usually performed
by a specially trained team
customized mailbox a beautiful yard is
more than just a green lawn and gorgeous
flowers you can literally decorate any
elements if you have the time and desire
you are seeing a method to create a
unique customized mailbox it will
delight its owners and attract the
attention of people passing by
the main material is pre-primed woods
that you can buy in any construction
store this is ideal especially if you
want to paint the wood the desired size
of the panels is achieved using a
circular saw then they're attached to
the wooden frame using nails to speed up
the work the worker uses a pneumatic
nail gun the letterbox has legs to stick
into the ground
the recommended depth is 18 centimeters
the last stage is then painting here you
can carry out any plans and ideas
mall decoration paints wallpaper
paintings wooden panels all this is of
course beautiful but it doesn't surprise
anyone anymore
people who love everything unusual and
want to stand out will like this last
idea
it is a glowing wall panel which
transforms a room using water in an
unusual way
the bubble wall has a simple
construction requires a simple set of
tools such as a drill a hammer and a
construction stapler to install it to
achieve a more impressive effect a black
fabric is attached to the wall the panel
itself is made of plastic so it is easy
to install even alone
water is poured in LED strips are
attached to the edges of the panel's
their light is reflected by the bubbles
making the whole wall of hair to be
glowing LED strips can glow with
different colors changing the atmosphere
of the room interestingly experts can
use these panels to create internal
partitions in any room</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
