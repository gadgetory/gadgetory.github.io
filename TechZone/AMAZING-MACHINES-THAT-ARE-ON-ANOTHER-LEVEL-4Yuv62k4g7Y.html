when cars had to be hand washed is over
people have been replaced by robotic
machines and every year their design is
refined the laser washed 360 plus is a
device that takes non-contact washing to
a new level with a speed of up to 20
vehicles per hour the high performance
of the laser wash 360 plus is guaranteed
by the 360 degree rotating washing arc
the three axes allow it to move along a
smooth trajectory cleaning the surface
evenly from all sides
even at rounded edges
note that the structure doesn't have a
base this is definitely an advantage as
it makes it easier to place the car
inside the washing room it should be
noted that the laser wash 360 plus can
be provided with additional equipment
for example oscillating nozzles a
tricolor phone dispenser and the flash
dry system that allows the car to be
rinsed and dried at the same time the
whole process takes no more than 10
seconds optional equipment also allows
the wheels and base to be cleaned thanks
to the large number of options and the
remote control of the laser wash 360
plus every second of watching is as
productive as possible
project elevate the Consumer Electronics
Show is held annually in Las Vegas and
in 2019 it took place from the 8th to
the 11th of January during the event
South Korean automaker Hyundai presented
project elevate a unique car that can
walk
the main distinguishing feature of this
vehicle is the presence of folding
robotic legs each of which consists of
several moveable elements these legs
allow high under elevate to mimic
walking mammals and reptiles when the
wheels are folded the car is no
different from a normal vehicle and can
travel on any road when the driver
switches the car suit driving mode the
wheels move and the vehicle increases in
height the high under elevates is
capable of climbing up a wall overcoming
an obstacle one and a half meters tall
passing a sight with the difficult
relief and even a mixed terrain it is
remarkable that in any movement and in
any position of the legs the car remains
in a horizontal position avoiding
discomfort for the driver unfortunately
today the high under elevate is just a
concept in Las Vegas the company has
shown a small model however there's
every chance that similar cars will
appear on the streets in the near future
according to the idea of the developers
this type of transport will help to make
the work of rescue services more
efficient the high on day elevate will
be able to work in natural disaster
areas moving through difficult terrain
and climbing where no other car can
climb the high on day elevate can also
become a taxi for people with
disabilities the car will be able to
approach the front door so that the
wheelchair can be easily placed inside
the vehicle
FedEx same-day bot companies around the
world are working to create robots and
machines that can take mail or shopping
to a whole new level thus in the last
days of February the logistics company
FedEx showed its new development the
same Dave bot this is a compact delivery
robots that moves through the city at a
speed of up to 16 kilometres per hour
it's powered by an electric battery
perhaps the most important feature of
the robot is that it can work completely
independently built-in optical sensors
explore the space around the robots so
that it can move through the streets
without disturbing pedestrians or
vehicles look at the front and rear
screens the same day bot uses the front
screen to communicate with people for
example to say hello the rear screen on
the other hand indicates the direction
whether the robots going to turn or stop
so now the same day bot is still in
development of FedEx spokesman said that
for now it will be used to deliver
packages between the company's offices
and its headquarters in Memphis if the
robots pass the test successfully they
will become part of a standard delivery
service in addition the companies in
discussions with major companies such as
autozone Pizza Hut's Target and Walmart
the robots expected to deliver the
products to customers who live within
five kilometres of the store
floater ten years ago we couldn't even
dream of being able to travel in the
same vehicle by land and water today
this is possible although you will have
to equip your boat with a device called
the floater it's very easy to use the
owner won't even need additional help
besides when you go from land to water
you won't wet a single part of your body
the design consists of a wheeled frame
which supports the boat and allows it to
move on land the person controls the
floater by means of a remote control can
accelerate stop and of course turn
around when the floater enters the water
and the wheels stop touching the bottom
the control changes now to move in the
right direction you use the steering
wheel to continue driving at full speed
you must lower the flow to anchor into
the water and then carefully leave the
frame therefore the floater is a mobile
dock that can be installed anywhere
there are no limits or restrictions
it should be noted that you can get outs
of the frame in the water in just a few
minutes and the procedure is really
simple in addition the manufacturer has
equipped the construction with universal
wheels that don't get stuck even in wet
sand or soft soil several different
models are available so you can choose
the right floater for your boat
sorting robots before a product ordered
in an online store is shipped to a
delivery points it must go through a
fairly complicated sorting process
classification is the distribution of
merchandise through various external and
internal channels goods are grouped
according to different principles and
conditions for example they can be
grouped first by country than by city
and even by district in turn these
groups are divided into fragile goods
not fragile goods and so on without
proper classification it's simply
impossible to deliver items quickly and
without delay
that's why global companies like Alibaba
and Amazon use special robots to do it
they can process up to 200,000 packages
a day without stopping to be charged
more than a hundred of these robots can
work in a warehouse
each compact machine is equipped with a
scanner which instantly determines the
destination of each package or box the
robot then transports the package to the
collection point of the desired fruit
more and more companies are likely to
use this type of equipment for sorting
their products every year this is not
surprising either since the robots don't
need rest or weekends they don't make
mistakes and in 15 minutes they complete
a task on which a person spends sixty to
seventy-five minutes in addition the
system saves around 70% of the costs
improving their quality of work and
delivery
