from the chaotic moon studio showed an
invention that can significantly change
people's lives the project known as tech
tats is a series of special tattoos that
can prevent people from having to
undergo medical check-ups the tech tats
developers suggest tattooing the body
once a year the built in sensors will
collect all medical information about
the body and send it to the doctors if
there's a problem the sensor will
recognize it and register it another
potential application is data storage
these tattoos can be used as credit
cards to pay at the supermarket
make your fit the invention you see on
the screen will appeal to people who
like walking barefoot these are unique
adhesive soles that can be used on the
beach or while hanging out by the pool
they provide optimum protection against
sharp objects and reduce the risk of
slipping the advantage is that the
person wearing the soles will no longer
have to constantly put on and take off
their flip-flops worrying about loosing
them make a fit ideas firmly to the sole
of your foot even if you're underwater
meanwhile the foot remains clean and dry
make a fit is heat resistant so you can
walk on hot sand and rocks without
worrying - they can even be used in the
sauna a set of ten pairs costs 34
dollars
Futuristics sink some inventions become
popular long after their creation and
this is exactly what happened in this
case this sink was created about 10
years ago but people noticed it only a
couple of months ago this unique hi-tech
sink was developed by the Turkish
specialists Osman cannas Kenley and
bottom an envelope it can be found in
the office of the developer and
president of Oz PAC the sink has a
futuristic look and will be appraised by
lovers of unusual interiors Osmo the
modern world is increasingly robotic
which makes people worried will machines
completely replace people in the future
the specialists as skyline robotics
created the invention you see on the
screen and they have a difference
opinion they believe machines will only
replace people in hazardous occupations
and that's why they're designed Cosmo
according to the creators the glass
surface of an average skyscraper is
about 28 thousand square meters cleaning
such an area using traditional methods
takes about two and a half months
meanwhile by using Osmo two operators
can do the same job in about a week it
is important to notes that the operators
control the robot from a safe place the
benefits of this window cleaner include
the ability to recognize convex objects
Osmo is aware that the window in front
of it is open and adjusts its route to
avoid damaging it computer vision and
sensors also help to recognize people
looking out of the window in order to
not hurt them accidentally
magic leap 1 the technology you see on
the screen will allow everyone to
experience augmented reality just in
case let's clarify the difference
between virtual reality and augmented
reality the first one has nothing to do
with the real world and immerses the
person in a completely new world while
augmented reality transforms the space
around us magic leap one creates
interactive elements in real time you
can organize a medieval battle in the
kitchen or have the Star Wars characters
wander around your petri currently
several manufacturers are developing
augmented reality glasses however magic
leap one has a more compact and
comfortable design than for example the
hololens or the oculus rift virtual
reality glasses magic leap 1 is a unique
device these glasses are able to
remember the location of the floor walls
ceilings and other objects in the room
this allows you to interact with the
world around you much more easily in
addition the person can place digital
objects in the space easily for example
this whale jumps out of the floor and
not out of nowhere the glasses are
controlled by the voice the gestures and
position of the head are even able to
respond to your eye movements magic leap
one can be used to play games or surf
the Internet the device is suitable for
virtual meetings with other people
expanding creative possibilities it can
also display a screen with some
information in front of the users eyes
unfortunately virtual objects do not
cover the entire field of vision of the
person but are limited to a small area
in front of the eyes still magic leap 1
works in a much larger area than its
analogues this gadget works in
conjunction with a small computer you
can attach it to your pocket or hang it
on a shoulder strap magic leap 1 can be
used by both creative professionals and
entrepreneurs
however the possibilities are almost
limitless and the manufacturer keeps
working to improve the products Scooba
just a few weeks ago
uber announced that it was about to
launch an underwater taxi in Australia
many people know that the Great Barrier
Reef can be seen from space
but now anyone can see it up close if
you are lucky of course scuba is a two
seater submarine which unfortunately
will work for a short period of time
the underwater taxi will work from the
27th of May to the 18th of June this
year a trip for two people will cost
about $3,000 for this price travelers
will be taken by helicopter to the dock
and from there the submarine will take
them in an hour-long trip near the
barrier reef at a depth of 30 meters the
transparent glass capsule will allow you
to enjoy the panoramic views it's almost
like diving but more convenient and
spectacular your visual field is not
limited by a mask there are no bubbles
and you don't hear your breathing all
the time it should be noted that
tourists from the USA Canada Australia
New Zealand as well as England and
France can win a scuba trip however the
number of trips is very limited the
developers want to see how popular the
service will be if it is successful it
will become a permanent project allowing
a large number of people to see the
Great Barrier Reef with their own eyes
blew the last invention we'll show you
today was developed by a team of
researchers at the University of
California Berkeley the blue robot
embodies the latest advances in
artificial intelligence
in addition thanks to deep reinforcement
learning the robot can solve complex
problems that for a long time could only
be solved by humans the problem with
modern robots is that they are expensive
and designed around the principle of
very high precision and repeated motions
blue doesn't have these problems the
total costs of the parts is about three
thousand dollars when assembled the
price increases to five thousand dollars
at the same time blue is a step forward
in the creation of dynamic and
responsive robots like people they will
use their eyesight and their tactile
skills to make decisions blue is
sensitive to external factors and
calculates its own strength every second
the size of the mechanized arms is
comparable to the size of a bodybuilders
arms and just like a person the robot
contends its arms or relax them pay
attention to the joints that move in the
same way as the shoulders elbows and
wrists of a human thus balloon copies a
person's movements with high precision
its dexterity is enough to prepare a
coffee although this task is still very
very difficult for the robots at the
moments blue lacks some precision and
strength
however artificial intelligence can
compensate for this deficiency
hey stop being lazy it's time to use
that brain of yours welcome to brain
time incredible facts from the past the
present and even the future the power of
nature and wild animals amazing facts
and unsolved mysteries you'll find all
this and much more hair subscribe now
