five thousand dollars are made of
platinum pink red and yellow 18 karat
gold the decoration can be made with

colors and sizes it's funny that despite
the enormous price all the phones have
rather mediocre technical
characteristics the internal memory is
only four gigabytes the image size is
240 by 320 pixels and you can use it for
no more than four or five hours it turns
out instead of a virtual phone you can
buy more than 10 new generation iPhones

the well-known singapore designer Jaron
NGO worked on the design of the black
diamond phone the step between the
keyboard and the display is strange and
unusual for the phone lies in your hand
rather comfortably the reason for the
high price of the phone lies in its
hardware at the time of its release the
Sony Ericsson black diamond was
practically a technical breakthrough but
now you won't be that surprised by its
Wi-Fi module or the 400 megahertz
processor
