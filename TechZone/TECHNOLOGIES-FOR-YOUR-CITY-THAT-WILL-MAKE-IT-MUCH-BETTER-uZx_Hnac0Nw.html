heart attack every minute of delay in
calling an ambulance reduces their
chances of survival by 10 percent the
statistics are not comforting only 8% of
cases where a person has experienced
heart failure have a happy ending this
low figure is due to the fact that
emergency services respond slowly to the
core and medical specialists arrived too
late
this invention can significantly change
these statistics and increase the number
of positive cases to 80% emergency
drones travel at speeds ranging from 60
to 100 km/h depending on the developer
in addition they don't get stuck in
traffic jams and can almost always go
directly to their destination this means
that drones are able to create an
ultra-fast response system in cities and
save many lives
according to the developers idea the
ambulance drone will reach the person
who needs help just one minute after the
call when it reaches its destination the
drone is transformed into a set of
essential devices the drone is expected
to be able to provide first aid to
people with diabetes respiratory
problems drowning people and others the
drone is equipped with a camera so that
the operator can monitor what's
happening and a loudspeaker so that
commands can be given many companies in
different parts of the world and our
manufacturing subs drones
SPS bars buildings around the world
catch on fire every day and people are
forced to face situations where their
lives are in grave danger
these statistics of deaths caused by
fires are terrible and therefore it's
very important to find new more
effective and better ways to evacuate
people SPS spars is a rescue backpack
that can assist in the safe evacuation
of a person from a heights of fifty to a
thousand meters it should be noted that
the backpack is very simple and can be
used by everyone the user puts it on his
or her back like a normal backpack it's
attached to the body with additional
straps to the person trying to save
themselves must find a way to evacuate
for example a window and attach the
security bail to the backpack to
something
for example the door handle then all the
user has to do is sit on the windowsill
with the back towards the street and
pull on the ring the backpack opens the
pillow fills with air and pushes the
person out of the window into the street
the landing is safe SPS stars can be
used even if there are cables or
vehicles underneath as none of these
would be an obstacle to the rescue
growing underground under the streets of
the capital of Great Britain London 33
meters deep there are air-raid shelters
built during the Second World War
however today they're not used to
evacuate people at all directly beneath
London it was decided to grow lettuce
and various herbs which are supplied
every morning to local shops restaurants
and canteens the decision to convert the
catacombs into greenhouses belong to
zero a carbon food as the plants are
Underground's they don't receive
sunlight instead they use energy-saving
LEDs it should be noted that these
greenhouses grow ecologically clean
products pesticides are not used and the
crops also have an interesting feature
they require 70% less water than outdoor
crops
thus shops and restaurants in London can
receive fresh herbs every day at a
reasonable price as they save money on
irrigation and transport the founder of
the company states that all greenhouse
systems work automatically lighting
temperature air flow and the amounts of
nutrients in the soil are regulated by
the computer throughout the year
regardless of the time of day or the
season the greenhouse has a stable
temperature and humidity and crops are
selected so that they can be harvested
throughout the year
cellular conveyer some time ago a
conveyor belt capable of moving objects
in any direction was invented in Germany
its name is this cell you via the belt
consists of small hexagonal cells each
equipped with three omnidirectional
wheels
according to the company
the robots playing football inspired the
creation of this conveyor belt the
developers took these robots turn them
over and use the design to create a
conveyor belt controlled by a computer
programs special software allows you to
set the path for the moving of the
object the direction can be changed
easily with just a few clicks it should
be noted that in case of failure
maintenance of this time two conveyor
belts is simple and quick the cell that
was broken is simply removed and
replaced for the new one the
manufacturers of the cellular hope that
the adventure will help logistics
companies adapt to the ever-changing
requirements and conditions of the
industry it'll make the work intelligent
warehouses factories and assembly lines
more efficient
starship delivery service in 2016 the
first tests of self-propelled courier
robots began for the aim of delivering
food and other products to the customers
door
the robots seen on the screen are
developed by estonian company starship
technologies they can be found on the
streets of london d√ºsseldorf hamburg and
burn as well as in the united states in
fact these robots are six wheeled
containers and the food or other goods
to be delivered are loaded inside the
car moves on the sidewalk at a speed of
about 6 km/h using the gps system the
way was arrives at its destination it
should be noted that only the person who
made the order can open it and take the
food it is he or she who opens the lock
of the container with the mobile
application according to the
manufacturer's idea this delivery system
should make people more comfortable and
decrease traffic jams by reducing the
number of vehicles so far the maximum
delivery distance is 5 kilometers and
the payload of the robot is 18 kilograms
so much you today skyscraper areas are
becoming denser and denser under such
conditions it's not surprising that the
interior spaces of buildings often don't
have windows or sufficient access to
daylight or natural light another
problem is that windows are so small the
daylight isn't simply enough solar tube
is a low energy lighting solution to
this problem its developers have devised
a way to bring natural sunlight into the
rules we like conducting tubes from the
ceiling the key to the efficient
operation of the equipment is a light
receiving dome with lenses which
captures the sun's rays and then
redirects them to the light pipe which
passes through the ceiling space it
should be noted that the dome is capable
of capturing not only direct sunlight
but also in general of accumulating
light this means that it will provide
natural lights even on cloudy days in
the morning or at night surprisingly
solar tube transmits light up to a
distance of 200 meters without loss
providing an exceptional transmission of
up to 99.7%
