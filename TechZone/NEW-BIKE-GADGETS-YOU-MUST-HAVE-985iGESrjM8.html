fundamentally different from road biking
city biking or any other type of biking
when riding on rough terrain but no
smooth flat roads the wheels have new
bumps or holes every second for this
reason mountain bikes were equipped with
soft shock absorbers as they
significantly increased riding comfort a
few months ago in October 2018 the US
company trust performance showed its
latest developments a bike fort called
the message it has a slightly different
design than standard Forks and you can
see it right away the message is made of
carbon fiber and weighs only a kilogram
of 980 grams
its features include bearings that have
a larger diameter as well as the
presence of poly mininum axles the
advantage is the fact that the foot
provides almost constant mechanical
movement regardless of the surface or
riding on
the fault functions as a shock absorber
thought the movement is smooth making
the ride easier and more comfortable the
cyclist practically doesn't need to
change the riding style
adjusting to the surrounding landscape
also the manufacturer emphasizes the
stability that the fork provides when
braking without dropping too much down
it's noteworthy that the message
requires maintenance after every 250
hours of riding which is approximately
five times less frequently the required
time of competing models the price of
the fork is $2,700

ordinary battery to charge a variety of
devices the manufacturer says that the
chess trailer can have a serious impact

emission of carbon dioxide into the
atmosphere by 75,000 tons per year the
same result could be achieved by
