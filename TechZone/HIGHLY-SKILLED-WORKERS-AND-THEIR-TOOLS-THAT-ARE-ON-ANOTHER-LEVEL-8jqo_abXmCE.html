finished with a +2 composition almost in
every construction sites in the world
the last step of the procedure is known
as floating before the mortar dries and
hardens the master performs the final
levelling the tool which is
traditionally used by builders for
floating as a metal or wooden trowel the
problem is that this tool is handheld
which means that the work has to put a
lot of effort in to finish the task the
plaster floating machine used to on the
screen solves this problem it's equipped
with a special rotating disc that
optimally makes the surface smooth
perfect sleekness is achieved in a
relatively short period of time on
average the machine can handle tasks up
to 70 percent faster than a person this
tool can be used for gypsum cements and
decorative leveling and other types of
fillers and plasters the rotating disc
has a removable design allowing the
leveling to be done in two steps first
the soft disc removes large
irregularities then a harder disc is
used to achieve perfect smoothness
honing machine any metal parts and tools
we use need to be finished because of
the roughness of the surface but here's
an issue some parts of such complex
shapes that it's not clear how to grind
them in hard-to-reach areas machine
tools like the one you see on the screen
come to the rescue this is a honing
machine it grinds the surfaces of
conical and cylindrical parts the video
shows how cleaning and honing is done on
an exhaust manifold of a 1993 car the
Mustang Cobra
the working principle isn't complicated
but it greatly benefits people and
relieves them of hard work the extruded
composition is a mixture of filler
material and metal chips it moves slowly
along the collector penetrating all the
working apertures this treatment brings
the old object back to life as it cleans
the surfaces and brings them to a
condition close to the original one the
results are clean perfectly polished air
intakes graininess deposits and even
burrs which sometimes remain after
production are removed
proform harness safety regulations
prescribed the use of a special
restraint belt on construction sites
safety belts are the optimum personal
protective equipment for those working
in high places however their traditional
design is not perfect the fact is that
if the person Falls the pressure of the
body weight can make the leg fastening
clamp on vital arteries in this case
every second counts even after the
person is released there is a slight
risk of fatal outcome
that's why were no ladder
has developed his own safety belts
called the Proform harness it features a
special court that's able to
redistribute the load in the fasteners
in a short time this is enough to allow
the belts to be moved down the leg and
to take a position where the arteries
are not constricted there is also a
system that reduces the weight load on
the collarbone
thus the person is relatively safe until
the rescue comes Milwaukee red stick
thus all you see on the screen is
convenient because it allows you to
perform two very important tasks at once
it's both a trowel that levels the
surface of freshly laid concrete floors
and a construction level that allows you
to control the flatness of the surface
as a result Milwaukee's red stick saves
time because craftsmen don't have to
change tools constantly the manufacturer
highlights the five centimeter white
base of the tool it has several
interesting advantages firstly the
surface is easy to clean which is
important because you have to work with
messy materials secondly it has
different edges one is rounded to make
the concrete smooth and the second one
is pointed this form is optimal for
spreading the material into even layer
also the transparent liquid flask has a
larger size so that the liquid can be
seen better
homogenous linoleum the noise absorption
properties of some rooms such as reading
halls and libraries are particularly
demanding and we're not talking about
people speaking in these places the
noise from heels and the sound of moving
furniture should not distract visitors
and staff that is why it is advisable to
install a special homogeneous linoleum
in such rooms like this it has a high
index of impact noise reduction is
resistant to furniture legs and heels
many builders choose this material also
because it's quite easy to install at
first before installation is left for 24
hours indoors for acclimatization
linoleum is glued to the floor
overlapping with the walls
this is possible because the skirting
boards for such linoleum are installed
slightly above the floor level
tools to work with drywall builders
working with drywall faced a loss of
difficulties in their work the main
problem is that these sheets of this
material are uncomfortable in size have
sharp edges and weigh a lot the French
company EDMA has come up with a solution
they offer a whole series of tools for
working with drywall
press plac pro is a support to keep the
material up Christ the lever that
secures the material is pressed with the
foot this means that the master doesn't
have to bend over all the time foot
plaque is a steel panel for lifting
drywall thanks to the lever system it
allows you to lift and carefully place
the drywall sheets on the metal frame
the design of the broad-base has been
chosen to minimize the risk of
defamation finally the block pack 2 is a
lever for lifting the drywall however
unlike the previous tool it allows not
only lifting but also fixing thus one
worker can perform tasks that usually
require more people
finishing trowels
the last tools we're going to show you
today are a most sophisticated and
technologically advanced alternative to
a tool that's widely used on
construction sites of course we're
talking about finishing travels for
drywall processing they are developed
and manufactured by tape tech the secret
to the improved is not analyzing the
robust but flexible blade and the
precise positioning of the support point
they increase the blades contact area
with the surface almost tenfold allowing
it to achieve a perfect finish the
manufacturer made sure that they design
is ergonomic in order to reduce the
strain on the rest and allow craftsmen
to work without fatigue for longer
periods of time the series includes
eight high quality finishing spatulas
they're working lengths range from 18 to
120 centimeters
hey stop being lazy it's time to use
that brain of yours welcome to brain
time incredible facts from the past the
present and even the future the power of
nature and wild animals amazing facts
and unsolved mysteries you'll find all
