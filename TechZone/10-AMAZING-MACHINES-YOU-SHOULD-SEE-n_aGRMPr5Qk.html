Norbert bozo created a unique and
autonomous field platform his invention
as an unusual self-propelled u-shaped
vehicle it moves using four wheels each
of which has its own independent
hydrostatic drive the device is
controlled by a remote control or
through a special program with GPS
support which allows the platform to
move along a previously chosen path the
car has a diesel engine with a capacity
of 160 horsepower
JM g MC 160 this self-propelled
industrial crane produced by the Italian
company JMC cranes was created to
perform operations with cargoes of up to
16 tonnes a special feature of the crane
is its unusual design the cranes wheeled
chassis as nothing in common with
similar machines and operates without
outriggers the inventions hydraulic
system has electronic proportional
hydraulic distribution and is powered by
an electric motor with a power of 35
kilowatts the user controls the device
using a joystick
arctas this Canadian all-terrain vehicle
has the highest proven all-round level
of amphibious capability in the world
created specially to work in the north
this caterpillar to section all-terrain
vehicle weighing 32 tonnes can swim and
get out of the water even on a steep up
to 3 meter high or on ice or gravel
Beach the car moves without falling into
the snow nor slipping on the ice in
addition to cargo weighing 20 tonnes the
device can carry 52 people on board to
travel on water the all-terrain vehicle
uses a water jet system that saves fuel
and allows the vehicle to reach a decent
speed steel bro this is a container ship
with a side loader the machine allows
the owner to increase the payload of
transportable containers while reducing
the time spent on loading and unloading
operations the machine can perform
transport operations without needing
additional trucks or cranes at the
unloading and loading points
the loader is suitable to work with both
20 and 40 feet containers loading and
unloading operations can be performed on
any terrain including terminals with a
ground platform it is interesting that
the machine can transport not only
containers with a maximum carrying
capacity of 45 tons the truck can also
carry industrial equipment special
vehicles and even mobile homes
brach 90 the main task of this
radio-controlled construction robot is
to work in limited spaces where there's
no space for mini loaders or many
excavators there's also a huge range of
attachments from buckets to rigs to
choose from
the robot is especially effective when
working on obsolete ceilings micro
tunnels and basements the most used tool
for this machine is a hydraulic hammer
to control the machine the owner needs a
special remote control which keeps the
operator safe
Elphinstone ez loader the Elphinstone
truck was created to transport around
logs it can carry from one to three
consecutive platforms on to three or
four axles with three points of log
loading and as a pneumatic suspension
the tractors can compactly stack one log
on top of the other in the offseason to
save space by fastening the rods on one
holding axle behind the driver's cab in
addition the same system allows the
truck to put the cargo back after
unloading when it's empty thus saving
wheels resources the total carrying
capacity varies from 32 to 68 tons and
the length of the vehicle
from 40 to 110 feet
kemper 360 plus the 20 foot long camper
360 plus was designed for harvesting
whole grain silos smooth and straight
blades guarantee an excellent quality of
the final product
during the process each plans is
directed to the chopper longitudinally
where they get evenly processed thanks
to a carefully thought-out cutting
device no plants will go unnoticed this
maximizes the productivity of the
vehicle
Kubota cm 1000 5v plug this plough
produced by the Japanese company cue
boats a corporation is currently the
most productive among similar devices
the four part construction ensures
high-quality plowing of the earth
regardless of the power of the leading
tractor the sharp teeth of the plow
easily penetrate into the ground and
don't jump out to the surface in the
process work thanks to its small size
and weight the plow is easy to transport
from place to place
Szell's planter 2016 this amazing
invention is the largest pneumatic drill
in the world thanks to its size the
device is able to cover large volumes of
ground thus processing fields in the
shortest possible time the unit is
attached to the moving machine in front
by a movable metal beam for a smooth
travel of the device behind the seeder
several machines are also around thanks
to which the drill itself becomes fully
controlled
mercedes-benz LG 1519 this off-road
truck was first developed in 1976 the
machine has a pair of a hundred and
ninety two horsepower a 5 cylinder
engine a six-speed manual transmission
and an original suspension made by
mercedes-benz the truck was originally
designed to carry military guns and
given the circumstances the machine is
also known as the artillery tractor guys
