easy to distinguish a building puts up
by professionals from any construction
made by amateurs especially when it
comes to brick buildings
bricky is a compact and lightweight
device which allows any beginner in the
construction industry to become a pro it
is easy to use and allows you to create
buildings that meet professional
standards basically brick II is a mold
in which the masonry mortar is poured
the manufacturer offers three sizes to
build a hundred and 2.5 millimeter a
hundred and forty millimeter and two
hundred and fifteen millimeter thick
walls these parameters are standard and
are widely used on construction sites
around the world
bricky allows the mortar to be placed in
a uniform and tidy layer while saving
material if there is too much mortar it
is simply moved to the edges of the mold
and used later the manufacturer also
offers a template for precise and fast
filling of vertical joints it's also
available in various sizes to work with
any bricks or blocks the price is
starting at $46
khorium brick the material you see on
the screen won't allow you to build a
house or even a small building abbs
because we're talking about facade
bricks however it's a revolutionary
material and is gaining popularity all
over the world traditionally these
bricks are dear to the surface of the
building's facade with a special
solution it is a long and messy process
the corium brick cladding system makes
the cladding process three times faster
though and the process itself is quite
simple first of all special stainless
steel profiles are fixed to the wall
with self-tapping screws each brick on
one side has slots that allow it to
attach to the metal profiles then you
just have to fill the joints with mortar
obtaining a smooth final coating without
even using construction level or other
flattening tools thanks to the metal
construction the rows of bricks are laid
evenly with identical horizontal joints
however the width of the vertical joints
may vary to suit the design
tile floor the modern market offers a
wide variety of flooring options with
different characteristics appearance and
of course cost the flooring materials
you see on the screen are economical
practical and are very easy to install
first we would like to draw your
attention to the crumb rubber tiles only
two tools are required for installation
a knife and a t-square
each tile has grooves cutouts at the
edges they interlock with each other
achieving a smooth coating another
advantage of the material is its
softness when laying the tiles near the
wall all you have to do is cut off the
parts of the tile you don't need with a
knife
this coating is equally suitable for
indoor and outdoor use for example for a
playground or a whole room alternatively
several elements joined together can be
used as a carpet the second option is
tires made of impact resistant
polypropylene the manufacturer
recommends using them for garage
flooring the final result is
aesthetically pleasing the surface is
resistant to oil grease antifreeze and
any other household chemicals each
element has slots on the edges for quick
and easy installation however to cut a
piece of this tile you'll have to use a
tile cutter
plus two leveling if a builder needs to
create a perfectly flat wall he applies
a layer of plaster one of the last steps
of the plastering procedure is to level
the surface 45 to 60 seconds after
mixing the mortar it starts to harden
which means the worker doesn't have much
time left to remove the excess material
and smooth the surface
traditionally hand tools such as a wide
metal spatula or a leveling border used
to finish the plaster however if you
want to speed up the process and make
the final result perfect you should use
a tool like the one you see on the
screen this is a rotating disc that
quickly and efficiently levels the
surface minimizing the builders efforts
the tool is similar to a conventional
wall grinder but it's most suitable for
final leveling
manhole-cover try gonna the design of
manhole covers hasn't changed in many
years it seemed to be optimal for a long
time so there was no point in trying to
improve anything this video shows the
installation of a modified manhole cover
the German company a Co passive and
ghasts manufactures this kind of
products the rectangular design provides
better access to the sewerage system and
can accommodate several people at once
pay attention to the lid itself - it
consists of four elements forming a
rectangle built in hinges allow the
elements to be open to a 100 degree
angle pay special attention to the self
locking mechanism even if you
accidentally touch the open parts of the
cover it does not slam shut but locks in
a new position this increases the safety
of sewerage work
stone floor check company nature stone
sells material for the creation of a
very unusual flooring these are smaller
stones that can have the most diverse
structure in color the manufacturer
offers materials suitable for indoor and
outdoor use they can be used to finish
sidewalks entrances terraces outdoor
stairs gazebos and pool areas according
to the manufacturer this coating has
much better performance characteristics
than for example paving slabs the stones
don't let plants sprout and there's no
puddles of a surface as the water flows
down to the ground there's no need to
renew the grouting either as is the case
with paving slabs making a floor out of
this material is no more complicated
than using any other the material can be
laid on almost any hard floor even if
it's old in this case the stone is laid
on a concrete surface colorless epoxy
resin hardener and some other substances
are mixed in a bucket the resulting
solution is then thoroughly mixed with a
decorative stone material the mixture is
then poured onto the surface and spread
evenly with a spatula the only thing
left to do is spread acetone solution
all over the layer and wait for it to
dry
timber beams slab formwork system
monolithic low-rise constructions are
becoming more and more popular all over
the world which means specialists face
an important task of improving
construction techniques one of them is
the slab formwork system you're seeing
right now on the screen simply put it's
a moles to create the floor of the
future building from concrete mixture
the installation system of the mold
allows you to increase
cost-effectiveness the workers cope with
the task more quickly so you can save
money on labor costs the main formwork
beam is a huge load bearing capacity
approximately eighty percent higher than
standard formwork beams the system is
called dhoka flex 30 stack and is
produced by the Austrian company Doka</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
