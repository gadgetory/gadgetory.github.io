dump truck that continues the tradition
of a successful predecessor they leap
head t28 to be this amazing huge machine
was shown for the first time at the mine
Expo 2016 the German company li pair
calls its product an ultra class model
the leap air t28 4 is the lightest and
strongest model in the heavy duty mining
dump truck plus the empty weight of the
machine is 237 tons the payload is 363
tons this means that the leaper t28 4
can weigh around 600 tons when fully
loaded the huge machine is powered by a
4,000 horsepower engine surprisingly
with such parameters the truck stands
out for its low fuel consumption and
environmental compliance the use of this
equipment opens up surprising
possibilities - with the reduced number
of trucks on the construction sites the
production plan can be fulfilled in a
shorter time
other interesting features include the
reliable and efficient light tronic plus
AC diesel electric transmission it is an
in-house development of lepak the
technology provides power enough for
acceleration in all conditions even when
driving uphill the relatively low weight
of the dump trucks also allows for
faster movement on the jobsite the leap
head ti-84 can be equipped with an
optional accessory kits that will enable
its work in high-altitude conditions and
operate at extremely low or high
temperatures
Falkirk wheel 4th and Clyde canal and
the Union canal are located in the UK
more precisely in Scotland near the city
of Glasgow - connects them the world's
first rotating boat left was built
you're seeing it on the screen now the
amazing machine is known as the Falkirk
wheel before instead of the lift 11
locks connected the two canals but they
were decommissioned back in the 30s this
design was chosen because the difference
in height between the channels is 35
metres so it would be difficult to
connect them in any other way the wheel
raises boats by 24 metres then it runs
another 11 metres along the aqueduct
connecting the platform with the water
the rotating boat lift was opened on May
24th 2002 only a year later the Falkirk
wheel was named the most original design
work in the world
the diameter of the boatlift is 35
meters the construction consists of a
central axis and two architectural
elements and looks like a Celtic axe the
wheel rotates 180 degrees along its axis
when this happens it lifts two gondolas
filled with water at different ends each
of them carries a weight of 500 tonnes
the vessel is located in one of these
gondolas the Falkirk wheel is a great
example of the Archimedes principle when
a vessel is on the platform it displaces
its own weight in water so the weight of
the two platforms remains the same
therefore the two parts of the lift
balance each other out
over arson TV 1000 special-purpose
equipment is developed for some very
specific tasks for example the TV 1000
snowblowers by Norwegian company over us
and a s were designed to maintain
airports some of the distinctive
features of this equipment are its
rather high driving speed up to 62 km/h
as well as its ability to work
effectively in almost any conditions
this model blows snow aside regardless
of its amount the layer can be 1
centimeter or 2 meters thick the
snowblower has an aerodynamic design and
an updated eco-friendly engine
the maximum casting distance is amazing
45 meters the working speed varies from
10 to 50 km/h the machine is powered by
a high-performance 1,300 horsepower
engine all these features allow the
machine to remove up to six tons of snow
in just an hour
the operators cabin deserves a special
mention to its location changes giving
the operator an optimal view in any
situation this function is especially
useful in bad weather interestingly
during the operation the person doesn't
feel the vibration inside the cabin even
if the vehicle is moving at great speed
this means that the operator is less
tired and can work efficiently for a
longer time
sister Meister TC 100 here's an
equipment that's both an off-road crane
and a crawler vehicle at the same time
the purpose of the machine is to
transport heavy loads on the
construction site or any other place
where work is carried out the TC 100 is
designed for the most difficult weather
conditions and terrain for example this
monster is able to transport wind
turbines even if it has to travel
through 30 centimeter thick snow however
the main feature of this machine is its
versatility the machine is able to work
in three different modes in the first
mode it performs the function of a
trailer in the second it serves as an
independent truck units with a maximum
payload of 200 tons and finally in the
third mode the TC 100 becomes a crane
equipped with a loading platform the
boom outlet is 30 meters with a maximum
lifting height of 35 meters
the cats 8 5 4k 8 4 4k + 8 3 4k when
trucks carry or occasionally some of it
falls on the road so it needs to be
removed in time as they can seriously
damage the expensive dump truck wheels
the vehicle you see on the screen is
ideal for this purpose
these are heavy but fast bulldozers
produced by caterpillar there are 5
different models of these new wheeled
bulldozers 3 of which are shown in the
video
they all have a similar design the
differences lie in the operating weight
and dump capacity which can be of 45:31
and 22 cubic meters respectively the
manufacturer highlights the durability
and maximum technical availability over
the entire service life
these wheeled bulldozers ensure optimum
performance and require less maintenance
ensuring efficiency and safety on-site
Sandvik dd4 - - i shaft sinking and
tunneling are necessary processes during
mining or construction operations the
last machine that we're going to show
today is an electro-hydraulic drilling
rig developed specifically for mining
operations it is produced by the
international companies Sandvik the
advantages of the dd4 - - i model
include improved drill and boom handling
it increases the productivity and
durability of the machine
the ergonomic cabin provides a high
level of comfort
protecting the operator from noise and
guaranteeing good visibility finally
another important feature is the wide
range of drilling automation functions
this in turn increases productivity and
reduces costs see how easily the machine
changes the drilling tools on its own
this is one of the many time saving
features</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
