and travel off road without problems
even in the wild you can be sure that
the trailer with all your commodities
will pass because it was created for
tourists who were not afraid to
challenge nature the trailer is ideal
for traveling in middle latitudes but in
reality it can be used almost everywhere
except the most extreme places in terms
of temperature the simplicity and
reliability of the design the
thoughtfulness of each element and the
high level of safety make this house on
wheels different from its analogues

err hydraulic jack ESCO hydraulic lifts
are designed to lift cars for rubber
replacement or other work air hydraulic
models can lift cars from 11 to 88 tons
using the lift it's possible to work
with both cars trucks and special
vehicles such as tractors and combines
the company produces conventional and
elongated models with a wheel on the end
or in the middle with a removable and
non removable handle increased safety is
ensured by the smooth running of the
left
mad ramps these special stair rails are
designed for loading and unloading
quadricycles from jeeps they're fixed to
the rear of the car and secured with
reliable metal bolts the main advantage
of mad ramps is that they can easily
move up and down to ensure smooth
movements of the quadricycle on the
joints of the dovetail and the car body
unlike similar mechanisms these ladders
after being installed on the machine
provide additional space for
transporting machinery in the body
extending it by about 11 inches when
transporting the loads together with the
car they can add up saving space and
after arriving you can easily unload the
cargo auto fireman this is an automatic
fire extinguisher in the engine
compartment of the car two fire
extinguishers are installed on any
suitable metal surface at two opposite
points under the car's hood using
magnets and connected by a harness
that's sensitive to temperature the
harness should be wrapped around
potentially hazardous areas in terms of
fires for example near the fuel supply
or electric wires then attach the ends
of the harness to the devices and
they'll be ready to save your life the
harness automatically responds to a
temperature rise under the hood because
it's made of a flammable material that
instantly lights up and burns reaching
the extinguishers within a couple of
seconds
they in turn react and release a
chemical reagent in the form of gas that
extinguishes the fire in less than 30
seconds
trap mats this is a new generation of
car mats their main purpose is to give
the surface under the feet a clean look
automatically removing debris and
liquids on a special substrate the mat
is made of two layers the top layer
consists of small hexagonal cells
through which any debris falls on the
lower layer which has depressions for
accumulation of debris thanks to the
fact that the rug locks in place around
the perimeter the debris remains inside
it until the next cleaning it does not
fall out and it doesn't even spill on an
uneven road the mat is made of light
rubber which does not absorb dirt
resists the reproduction of bacteria and
doesn't smell the invention is easy to
clean as well simply rinse it with water
and the mat is ready to be used together
Meeta
the most important advantage of these
chains is that they can be installed on
any car in particular those with a very
small distance between the tires and the
shock absorbers strut the chains are
universal and work with wheels from the
13 to 24 inches there is no speed limit
when using these chains they're
developed in Europe for use with all
season tires inside the supplied kit
there is a sufficient number of plates
and connecting links for the tires the
kits also comes with gloves clamps a
screwdriver a wrench a device for
putting on the chains and instructions
apart from that you only need a longer
to journal slots along the entire
circumference of the tire to install the
chains with a width of 6 millimeters and
a depth of at least 4 millimeters
Hale protector the texas-based company
Hale Protection has patented a unique
car tent with an airbag function to
protect your car from hail the
technology includes a mobile application
available for both iOS and Android it
uses information from weather services
to warn the driver 30 to 60 minutes
before the possible hail for those who
do not have a smartphone at hand the
system will send an alert via email the
tent itself consists of two layers the
first of which is secured with slings
under the car and the second forms the
pillow itself which is inflated using
four valves and a small compressor the
owner activates the system using a
remote control the compressor itself can
be connected to a double-a battery a
cigarette lighter or an AC supply the
tent is ready in less than five minutes
but the manufacturer warns that the
system can not protect the machine from
hail the size of a soccer ball in
addition to hell' protection the tent
also offers conventional protection
against ultraviolet rays water
resistance and air permeability

ground and is able to move normally the
system is made of ultra thick and
durable rubber the size of the nozzle
for the wheel as 8 inches long and 1
inch deep Catina lifting bags these
hydraulic lifting cushions are an
alternative or an addition to hydraulic
lifts and pneumatic lifts when working
with automotive equipment they're
installed under the wheels of the car
and injected with air using a standard
pneumatic supply system when folded
there are only a couple of inches thick
the pillows are suitable for working
with cars and trucks the vehicle is
lifted from four to six inches which may
be enough to obtain the necessary
additional space for the installation of
mattli supports under the axis of the
car this option can be very useful when
the wheels of the car are flat or
there's simply no space for the metal
support the pillows are quite strong and
effective to lift even very heavy
equipment like trucks tractors and
career special equipment they're
available in different designs from
three to a hundred tons of lifting
capacity
tressle Jax whenever you need to replace
a tire the brake linings or the bearings
on a heavy cargo trailer you can rely on
the trestle jack jack which raises the
axle faster than any conventional system
the whole process can take less than 10
seconds the jack uses the tractors
movement to raise and lower the trailers
as soon as the jack is in a vertical
position it turns into a support post
with a reliable workload of thirty to
fifty tons if you need to remove a full
axis or an empty trailer you'll need to
use two trestle jacks per axis in the
vertical position the jack can be fixed
in place using a belt to secure the two
front connectors to the trailer base
