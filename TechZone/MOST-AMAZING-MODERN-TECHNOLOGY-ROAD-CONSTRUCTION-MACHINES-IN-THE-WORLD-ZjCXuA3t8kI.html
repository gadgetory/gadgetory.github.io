ladder excavator designed for the
construction of canals with a width of
more than 9 meters the main feature of
this trimmer is that it performs the
functions of a standard excavator on the
construction site while improving the
quality of work as it works faster and
more accurately the vehicle allows the
shape of the channel to be changed to
reduce the loss of concrete with a power
of 300 horsepower it's possible to dig
102 180 cubic meters of soil per hour
the productivity of the work depends on
the strength of the Earth's surface the
digging depth is three meters in one
pass the operating speed varies from
naught to seven meters per minute and
the vehicle can accelerate to a maximum
of 18 meters per minute the buckets have
interchangeable teeth which
significantly extends the life of the
excavator it can work on both flat and
sloping ground while the angle of
inclination is easily adjustable
go MOC OCC 1200 curb cadet the vehicle
you see on the screen is a slip form
designed to build a curb the special
additional equipment allows the go mock
OCC 1200 to press the asphalt and
concrete curb its main feature is the
ability to work even with complex
concrete it's able to move independently
but is also compact and suitable for
transport with special loading equipment
the operator has manual control of the
front wheel equipped with a tracking
system and hydraulic drive for greater
mobility the press moulds can be
replaced quickly and easily speeding up
the work process and allowing the
vehicle to be used for different tasks
standard molds allow the construction of
a sidewalk between 305 and 356
millimeters high with a working radius
of six hundred and ten millimeters the
curb can be positioned from the left or
right side of the vehicle
in addition the position of the molds is
adjustable allowing work even on narrow
roads and in confined areas
next wrench OD 250 and dat the vehicle
you see on the screen is offered by the
manufacturer in three different versions
the maximum working depth of the next
trench rd 250 is naught point eight
meters and the working width varies from
eight to thirty centimeters the next
trench Rd 200 and dat have the same
digging depth but the working width of
the first version varies from 15 to 20
centimeters and of the second from 8 to
30 centimeters this is a hinged piece of
equipment for an excavator the vehicle
is designed to work with different
materials for example concrete and
asphalt it should be noted that when
working the disc trencher uses only one
lane and therefore doesn't seriously
interfere with the traffic the vehicle
has a high performance and can operate
even in difficult conditions for example
on rocky terrain the sidewalk is cut
precisely and cleanly so that the trench
ideally matches the dimensions required
for the project
camacho gp3 the creation of this vehicle
has been possible thanks to Camacho's
fifty years of experience in the
production of concrete pavers the jeep
III is one of the smartest road
packaging machines in the world designed
to pave floor coverings up to nine point
one four metres wide it adapts easily
and quickly to change size the vehicle
is equipped with smart telescoping for
maximum frame expansion and automatic
steering configuration a sensitive
sensor system provides high performance
and optimized fuel consumption
practically all the details of this
machine are regulated and the vehicle
adjusts to any task and working
condition
in addition operating speed can be
controlled while with and other
processes are automated which greatly
simplifies operation and also increases
productivity the caterpillar bearings
are not only adjustable but can also
rotate around their shaft this makes it
possible to achieve continuous concrete
placement even under extreme conditions
stim contour 700 TPK here we have a
universal vehicle for marking tracks
from the Belarusian company Steph the
contour 700 TPK is designed to apply
horizontal road markings to asphalt and
cement roads
unlike other similar machines that work
with a particular type of paint this
vehicle can apply thermoplastic and
quick drying enamels with reflective
glass beads the machine is equipped with
2 pints and two spray guns the mark can
be applied on either the left or the
right side the operating parameters are
adjusted according to the task and
operating conditions the TPK 700 con saw
is capable of drawing lines with a width
of 5 to 40 centimeters the valve opening
control system allows the application of
continuous and intermittent lines
changing the profile and pattern the
working speed is between 1 and 5 km/h
and the vehicle reaches 12 km/h it is
operated by two people but can work
without an operator
movable barrier system every day people
all over the world spend millions of
hours in traffic jams the vehicle you
see on the screen gradually solves this
problem is designed in such a way that
it quickly changes the position of the
barrier between the tracks this allows
you to change the number of lanes in
each direction adjusting the path to the
current situation
most of the Road barriers installed by
this vehicle resemble zippers this
special vehicle has an extraordinary
load capacity as the weight of the
barrier segments can reach 450 kilograms
inside the equipment's there is an
s-shaped transport channel which lists
the barry's segments and then transfers
them to the other side in one pass this
type of barrier machine can move
segments from one point two to seven
point three meters the speed of work
varies from five to 10 miles per hour it
moves within the same lane without
interfering with the movement of other
vehicles
Python 5,000 pothole patcher here we
have a self-propelled vehicle designed
to fix the patches on a damaged Road
compact and economical the vehicle
allows you to keep roads in good
condition at low prices a standard
asphalt mix is used to place the patches
the equipment is capable of continuously
repairing long cracks and joints in
roads the entire work cycle is carried
out by one person it has a high
performance and on average the creation
of a patch takes about two minutes the
hydraulic roller ensures optimum
compaction of the asphalt mix so that
the patches have a lot of service life
an indisputable advantage is the ability
to work at low temperatures and even
during rainfall
Kumiko 4,400 barrier paper here we have
a concrete mixer designed to create
barriers on the road the Gama Co 4400
has a ninety nine horsepower engine
which runs at 11 meters per minute the
manufacturer offers additional moulds
for the construction of not only
barriers but also parapets sidewalks
gutters and curbs its main feature is
the unique management system that allows
you to control the direction of leg
movement and its height and width design
the maximum height of the barrier is 1
meter and the width of the asphalt is 2
and a half meters this vehicle was
created to provide reliable safe and
productive work
