up with the idea of growing certain
crops for food if not in today's video
we'd like to tell you a little bit about
this in particular about rice after all
its history is very rich and profound
and the methods of cultivation differ
from country to country and surprise us
with their uniqueness initially rice was
a wild plant domestic cultivation
started about 9,000 years ago in
Southeast Asia it's not known how many
rice domestication centers existed
however most scientists agreed that
there were two of them in southern China
one subspecies of rice was created the
other was found to the south of the
Himalayas presumably in eastern India or
in western Indochina two millennia later
rice was cultivated as a food crop still
in Southeast Asia in the territory of
modern India and China rice spread all
over the world a little later in the
second and third centuries BC in the 2nd
and 3rd centuries BC it reached Central
Asia in the 8th century it appeared in
Europe and in the 15th to 16th centuries
in America in Shores is an extremely
ancient cereal crop which still enjoys
great popularity in the world
Mazal classification includes a huge
number of rice varieties it's grown even
in Africa for more than two or three
millennia however African rice is not in
great demand as it's almost completely
displaced from the market by Asian
source according to data from 2016 China
is the country that produces the most
rice in the world in just one year two
hundred nine point five times of rice
are grown here India is in second place
with a hundred and fifty eight point
eight tons on the third with a huge gap
Indonesia with seventy seven point three
tons Bangladesh Vietnam Myanmar Thailand
and the Philippines are also among the
countries that produce the largest
amounts of rice however it is grown
almost all over the world simply in
smaller amounts for example in Spain
Italy Greece Turkey Russia and the USA
rice is a very moisture loving and
thermophilic cereal crop growth and
development take an average of 150 days
the exact number depends on the species
at the same time all days the
temperature should not exceed the range
of 22 to 30 degrees Celsius this unusual
way of cultivation you see on the screen
is common in China India Japan Java as
well as in some places in Transcaucasia
here rice is not immediately planted on
the plantations at first it's grown up
in greenhouses
workers put shallow trays on a special
conveyor belt it connects several types
of equipment the trays are first filled
with soil the loading machine is
operated by a person who changes bags of
soil as they are emptied the row of
brushes on the conveyor belt is needed
to evenly distribute a layer of soil on
the tray and at the same time to
compress it the next step is the role of
treatment which creates a series of
furrows in the soil it's located
directly in front of the equipment which
plants the seeds directly into the soil
this machine is also operated by a
person who constantly refills the tank
with new seeds
notice that the roller and the
equipment's are calibrated so that the
seeds are evenly distributed in the
furrows throughout the entire conveyer
process the soil level and the trays is
controlled by rollers this is important
because the pallets will then stand on
top of each other in the next step
special brushes mix the ground of the
seeds they work effectively enough to
guarantee that 99% of the seeds will be
under a thin layer of soil and will be
able to sprout in the final stage the
trays run through several watering lines
the farmers then collect the trace and
take them to the greenhouse
interestingly they determined that the
rice is ready for planting but the help
of the most common rulers finally the
height of the sprouts reaches 15 to 20
centimeters then the rice arrives to the
special plug stations which are divided
into two types there can be permanent in
which case the land it's always under
water and the rice is sown there every
year
it can also be its temporary plantation
which means farmers plant rice therefore
a maximum of 2 to 3 summers and then
they choose another less water-loving
crops as so there is a reason why some
of the plantations are temporary
the fact is that rice is basically a
marsh plant that needs a lot of standing
water rice fields are under water for so
long there's a certain risk of swamp
formation first it can lead to the
spread of diseases secondly a lot of
water is spent on maintaining the fields
it should not be forgotten that for many
countries water is still a scarce
resource in addition rice cultivation is
not a cheap process either wet rice the
most popular variety requires 2 to 5
times more water than other crops the
plantation may be located in a
mountainous area or as in this case on a
flat land the fields are treated to
ensure uniform irrigation and good
drainage
it's then divided into sections by
rollers the water is poured through the
canal system the workers make sure that
the field is flat
even after has been filled with water to
this purpose a tractor with special
attachments is used the excess soil is
simply removed
the water layer on such plantations
usually reaches six to eight centimeters
rice is planted here from March to June
depending on the region it's noteworthy
that no fertilizers are used for rice
cultivation traditionally it's believed
that the most common water supplies
sprouts with sufficient nutrients rice
used to be planted by hand on the
plantations today
planting machines are used for this
purpose they are loaded with trays with
sprouts the operator then directs the
machine along the field each sprouts is
picked up and then placed into the
ground even rows of plants are formed at
the same distance from each other the
workers at the plantation constantly
monitor the condition of the water from
time to time the water is discharged
fully or partially in order to fill us
up again the procedure is performed
every third fourth or tenth day in some
cases depending on the climate of the
type of voice the water is changed even
less often
removing weeds and spraying herbicides
is preferable and the water is trained
in the past a procedure was always done
manually
now herbicides are increasingly being
sprayed on the fields using agricultural
drums like this one by Yamaha before the
harvest the water is completely drained
signs of maturity are the yellow stems
and leaves and white grains in Central
Asia this usually occurs in late August
or early September it's important to
harvest the rice and thyme the dried
spikes break off very easily so part of
the crop is lost the right rice is cut
or as in this case pull for this purpose
specialized equipment is used the spike
is dried within two to three days after
harvesting excessive moisture causes
mold to appear at this stage the cereal
is not like the rice we see at the shops
it is brown because of the holes
covering the grain after drying it is
milled and checked for quality it's now
considered to be ground ie unhulled
before the rice goes to the shops it's
differently cleared of foreign matter
the whole mass is then passed through
the millstones where the husk is removed
and finally the last stage of rice
processing is in a polishing machine 74
percent of the raw materials harvested
from the field are pure rice the
remaining twenty six percent are holes
and seed buds hey stop being lazy it's
time to use that brain of yours welcome
to brain time incredible facts from the
past the present and even the future the
power of nature and wild animals amazing
facts and unsolved mysteries you'll find
all this and much more hair subscribe
