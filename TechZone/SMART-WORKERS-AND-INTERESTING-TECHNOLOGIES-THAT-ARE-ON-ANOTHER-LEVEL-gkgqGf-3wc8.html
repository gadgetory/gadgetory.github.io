operation even when it comes to roads or
sidewalks requires well coordinated work
at the same time technological equipment
is used to increase the speed of work on
the site here you can see the unusual
combination of human labour and an ideal
piece of equipment first pay attention
to the mini loader which is used for
unloading it's equipped with a special
clamp for laying a construction material
the clamp lifts eight paving stones at
the same time and takes them to the
right place without losing the integrity
of the pattern the loader is used
because the site is located far from the
unloading place so that people don't
have to carry the stones by hand or to
use bulky and uncomfortable trolleys the
loader is maneuverable and compact and
can work even in confined spaces
secondly pay attention to the work
coordination builders have enough time
to fill the gap in the surface in
addition they quickly adjust the paving
stones preparing the site for laying new
ones in just a couple of minutes they
can pave a few square meters of surface
in this way
Waku equipment almost all construction
work involves the use of step ladders
the problem is that their traditional
design is not perfect so every year a
large number of people get injured
specialists from the German company Waku
have found a solution to the problem
today their products are used by the
most inventive and advanced builders the
ladder you see on the screen has three
advantages the first is that there are
holes for the tools in the lifting stand
secondly the user can hold on to the
special crossbar during operation which
reduces the risk of falling and the
third is that the special legs are
secured on the floor only under pressure
which facilitates transporting the
ladder and here is a removable platform
on which you can put a can of paint as
well as stand up it pulls out with the
slight movements of the foot and doesn't
interfere with climbing up or down this
is an additional elements that's
securely attached to the ladder
transforming it from a two section
ladder to a three section one here we
have another stand for the paint with
telescopic legs which is fixed to the
ladder from above the ways of the ladder
itself can reach up to 50 kilograms
which makes it difficult to transport
the solution is these removable wheels
with special spikes they also make it
possible to secure the ladder more
stable e on the ground
the last wacky product I wanna show you
is the telescopic platform that allows
you to get a unique surface to work
comfortably for several hours installing
drywall the tool you see on the screen
greatly simplifies work with a popular
building materials such as drywall the
German company worth manufactures this
equipment the lifts securely fixes the
plasterboard preventing it from slipping
falling or being damaged the maximum
weight this tool can lift is 75
kilograms it lifts the panel's to a
height of three and a half meters the
person therefore doesn't have to make
any effort all they have to do is spin
the special coil the working width of
the equipment is adjustable so it can
lift panels of different lengths from
eighty two to three hundred and six
centimetres the folding design greatly
facilitates transportation
however even when unfolded the lift
doesn't take up much space and passes
easily through the doors
Bessy tools today more and more
companies are developing auxiliary
equipment to facilitate the construction
work the german manufacturer bessie is
one of them here we have two interesting
tools this company offers two builders
who want to improve the quality and pace
of their work the first one is a clamp
that will come in handy when working
with wood is designed for gluing sheet
materials together as it puts a loss of
pressure on them the tool is very simple
to use
so it's placed on these sheets holding
them together and then you have to turn
the handle to apply pressure the second
tool as greater versatility and it's a
clamp for transporting panels the fact
is that they can be made of fragile and
heavy material and have sharp edges
these circumstances make them difficult
to move to this clamp is a great
solution its payload is 75 kilograms the
rubber coating on the moveable parts
prevents slipping the tool is suitable
for working with panels from 10 to 65
millimeters wide
repairing stairs there are a number of
variations of staircases that can be
installed in residential buildings if
the design is sinful and straight
repairs are usually easy but if it's a
complicated design like a spiral
staircase there are often difficulties
because each step has its own size and
shape for example they may have
different angles or be curved the German
company wolf crafts offers to buy a
template for steps which can turn anyone
into a construction genius the template
consists of metal profiles which are
placed on top of the step in the first
phase of the staircase repair they set
the correct length and width wood has
the property of changing its size
slightly due to external factors and for
this reason a deformation joint is made
when the stairs are installed which is a
few millimeter gap this joint is made in
the planning phase with special fixtures
this is the element used to indicate the
future salience of the step
all these manipulations create a
template from the profiles with
parameters that precisely copy the
dimensions of the future step the only
thing left to do is to transfer the
shape to the board and do the cutting
the template can be any shape and it's
individually adjusted to each step
shock transyl's soundproofing the key to
a comfortable life in a house or
apartment is good and reliable
soundproofing however it's not only
walls ceilings and floors that need to
be covered with insulating material the
German company sherk also offers
insulation for staircases in apartment
buildings a special material known as
shirk transyl has been developed for
this purpose it is a ready to install
soundproofing system that provides
optimal protection for all residents
according to the manufacturer its use
makes it possible to quickly and
cost-effectively meets the strictest
soundproofing requirements for the
staircases the design of the system
ensures optimal connection to adjacent
structures even the joints are insulated
they have a tidy appearance and are
protected against stones and debris the
material is resistant to fire and its
effectiveness has been proven in
numerous tests the system is suitable
for straight and spiral staircases the
different elements are designed to
suppress all types of noise for example
you can sound proof of space between the
stairs and the landing between the
stairs in the wall or between the
staircase in the baseplate the material
used is high-quality elastomer that
doesn't lose its properties even when
exposed to heavy loads
