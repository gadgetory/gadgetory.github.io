experts from the company revival cycles
of Texas created this unusual BMW
motorcycle for a special customer the
main idea behind the creation of the BMW
landspeeder was to make it a lighter
vehicle than the original one and to
increase efficiency and speed to achieve
that the developers used the engine of
another motorcycle notably the display
version does not use a battery or
generator instead the motor was
connected directly to a magnets on the
other hand the vehicle was equipped with
an individual frame of the long
wheelbase a stainless steel body of four
an adjustable rear shock absorber a soft
speed switch and a custom front wheel it
should be noted that the steering wheel
brackets controls and many other details
were created manually unfortunately we
couldn't find out the cost of this
unique model stand up very bike this
unusual means of transports is a kind of
hybrid between a foot bike and a very
bike allowing you to not only push the
ground with your foot but also to
control the front wheel using special
handles developers have provided several
modes including a hybrid mode in which
the user uses his or her legs and hands
the source of inspiration for the
creation of this device was different
types of physical activity such as
rowing and skiing with the help of
stand-up very bike you'll not only be
able to move comfortably through the
city and beyond you'll also be able to
get in shape and train all the muscle
groups at once another advantage of this
device is its great mobility if
necessary you can pick up the bike in a
few seconds and place it in the trunk of
a car or under the desk in the office
the device is folding frame is made of
lightweight aluminium so the weight of
the entire structure doesn't exceed 10
kilograms you can buy this unusual
vehicle for $1000
big twin 2714 this motorcycle is a
faithful reproduction of an English
vehicle made in the early 20th century
as no models survived to this day the
Czech engineer Pablo melinek created his
motorcycle based on photographs and
ancient drawings the work done is
remarkable not only because the bike is
a perfect copy of the old model despite
being made with modern materials but
also because there are few specialists
in the world capable of reproducing a
vehicle using images from more than a
hundred years ago the process of
creating the motorcycle took more than
two years and the bike has already
successfully passed the track tests
unfortunately the value of this replica
remains unknown Poli style bike although
this powerful motorcycle was assembled
at home it has caught our attention the
creator of this unusual car bob maddox
specializes in similar devices he
designs real high speed monsters with
jet propulsion the approximate weight of
this model which bulb developed over
eight years is 250 pounds and the engine
has a capacity of over 200 horsepower to
huge turbines located at the rear of the
motorcycle turn it into a reactive
vehicle and therefore it's not suitable
for use in the city in addition the
noise level produced exceeds the
permitted level significantly however
this motorcycle can serve as an
excellent addition to a car show all
used during filming
although the Creator prefers not to
reveal its price Joe hammer J 1 an
Austrian company has created a unique
electric motorcycle that can cover a
distance of up to 186 miles on one
charge from its battery this is a
significantly higher level than any
other model available on the market this
unusual vehicles equipped with an 11
kilowatt nominal engine with a maximum
power of 16 kilowatts the maximum speed
of the bicycle which weighs 350 pounds
is a hundred and ten miles per hour and
can reach 60 miles per hour in just
seven
the electric motorcycle comes with a
powerful battery that charges in about
two hours the advantages of this vehicle
include a polypropylene housing and a
special steering system without
dashboard it's worth noting that all the
data is sent at the special screens
mounted on the rear view mirrors and the
rotation of the gas handle in the
driver's direction includes regenerative
braking in addition the owner can use a
parking assistance system the vehicle is
available in two versions with different
battery capacity and costs almost
$26,000 moto bot a robot capable of
riding a motorcycle was presented at the
Tokyo Auto moto exhibition interestingly
the electronic device called moto bots
does not operate an ordinary motorcycle
but rather a fairly powerful model a
Yamaha sports bike with a 200 horsepower
engine the device stands out for its
titanium connecting rods a ten and a
half liter air filter a titanium exhaust
system and a sliding clutch however the
main feature of this new generation
motorcycle is this electronic wiring
which includes a wheel slip and control
system and anti-lock system and much
more it's worth noting that this robot
managed to drive the Yamaha sports bike
on the track at a speed of 125 miles per
hour using the latest technology this
robot driver will be able to travel on
unknown routes surpass other vehicles or
any other obstacle during the trip the
robot processes the information received
from the census monitors its balance and
simultaneously evaluates other traffic
aspects motor bot is equipped to the GPS
RTK sensor to track its location in
real-time
unfortunately the robots cost is unknown
however the price of the bike is sixteen
thousand five hundred dollars DC try
according to the developers this is the
world's first three wheel electric
motorcycle that can be ridden standing
upright on the outside the novelty
resembles a bicycle from which it
inherited the suspension for the
steering wheel and the wheels however it
doesn't have pedals seats or usual frame
the creators claimed that their vehicles
in universe or motorcycle which can be
used for everyday travel as well as to
perform various tricks
in addition engineers offered EC trial
models for people with disabilities you
can ride this
like in a wheelchair and another
characteristic of this creation is the
presence of a motorized wheel which
allows reaching a speed of 15 miles per
hour in addition the vehicles equipped
than eleven and powered battery
guaranteeing enough energy for a 30-mile
journey another advantage of this
unusual device is that it's equipped
with a shock absorber that prevents the
steering wheel from vibrating during
travel it's worth noting that the
invention has a special built-in
computer that displays the current speed
and battery charge the cost of DC try is
fifteen hundred and thirty-three dollars
Humminbird for those who have always
dreamed of an easy and comfortable
vehicle a group of British engineers has
created a unique folding bike the main
feature of this design is that it weighs
only 15 pounds developers claim that
this is the world's most compact bike
being 7 pounds lighter than its nearest
competitor the vehicles made of carbon
fiber a much lighter material than other
analogues it also absorbs shock
vibrations better the hummingbird is
available in two versions one with one
speed and one with a five-speed gearbox
the models are equipped with 16 or
20-inch wheels each however there's
latest version weighs a little more
about 15 pounds this miniature vehicle
can be fully folded in a matter of
seconds thanks to an innovative

not only of its frame fork and carbon
fiber wheels but also of its light pro
rims and special tires the creators
presented this new vehicle in four
colors and the bike can be purchased for
$1,300 moto Pogo here we have a one
wheel electric scooter it's quite simple
to use to move the user must tilt the
body forwards and to slow down he must
tilt backwards special sensors and
accelerometers inside the structure
register the drivers location
information and adjust speed to maintain
the center of mass which helps to
maintain balance it should be noted that
this model is equipped with a 60 volt
lithium battery which gives power to a
500 watt alkaline motor
thanks to this one charge of the
device's battery is enough for five
hours
continuous operation at the same time
