mining excavator in the world is
designed for mining operations of high
complexity and can work on any surface
this mountain excavator has 216 cylinder
V engines with a capacity of 1492
kilowatts each thus their total capacity
is 2984 kilowatts or 4,000 horsepower
and they need 20,000 litres of diesel to
work at its best
the maximum working way to the leaper
are 9800 is 810 tonnes this mining
excavator stands out for its reliability
and high productivity in addition this
model provides a reduction in
operational down times thanks to its
reliability increased safety and high
build quality the machine is made of
high-quality durable materials forward
and back scoop dippers have the same
size their volume is 1500 cubic feet and
the maximum turn speed of the AR 9800
platform is 3.6 rpm
then tech desert rig this drilling rig
is designed to work in desert conditions
the machine has high performance and
extreme weather conditions and thanks to
its robust and versatile design the been
tech desert red can be used for a whole
variety of tasks the machine has a
cantilever masked with winches and
lifting ropes the base of this vehicle
can lift and lower structures of any
size and the built-in hydraulic system
raises the mast at the base the been
take desert rig is capable of operating
in temperatures from minus 20 degrees
Celsius to 55 degrees above zero this
giant machine is equipped with a draw
work from 1,500 to 3,000 horsepower the
load that the hook can hold varies from
350 to 650 tons and the drilling depth
at the benthic desert rig is 30,000 feet
it's also worth noting the compact
dimensions and self unfolding design at
the drilling rig which ensures the
convenience of its transportation and
quick installation on the spot
lorem cutting machine the famous
american corporation lorem founded in
1954 specializes in the production of
track vehicles for construction
maintenance and repair of railways very
sound for this massive device is
processing gravel piled on both sides of
the railway tracks with the help of
metal blades located on the drum stones
are taken for their filtration inside
the machine larger pieces of gravel are
returned on the railway for further
processing
while small stones are thrown aside
after that the gravel is leveled using
two wide plates that make it look like a
smooth rut at the end the cleaning of
the railway track is performed by means
of a mechanical brush which removes the
gravel from the rail so that it doesn't
interfere with the passage of the Train
PNH 2650 CX this is a hybrid excavator
that uses an innovative combination of
diesel and electrical equipment the
electrical motors control the basic
functions of movements such as lifting
turning and pressure the 2650 CX model
is equipped with a huge swivel clamshell
equipment with a payload capacity of 65
tons allowing loading a 240 ton dump
truck in four passes the P and H 2650 CX
differs from traditional large diesel
excavators for a significant reduction
in hydraulic equipment the excavator has
a swivel bucket with six teeth and a
hydraulic control which increases the
selectivity of work and tare force the
car has an engine with a capacity of
3,200 horsepower the nominal suspended
load of the PNH 2650 CX has a hundred
and twenty seven and a half tonnes and
the maximum unloading height is 38 feet
during the loading cycle the fuel supply
is switched off for a significant period
of time thus reducing his consumption
and the zero level of the load on the
engine during this time also increases
the useful life of the engine
l√©a pair r9 54 b this crawler excavator
is equipped with an NPK s 23 XC our
bucket where the length of almost 8 feet
which can break structures and buildings
of any complexity the power of the
engine is 685 horsepower and the maximum
speed of this excavator is 3 miles per
hour the rotational speed of the rotary
motor is 8 revolutions per minute the
vehicle is controlled from the cabin
which is equipped with modern technology
which allows you to increase the speed
of performance the bucket gently grabs
the surface pulls it to the side and
gradually destroys the object
finlay see 1545 this high-performance
machine from the american company
Tarek's includes a cone crusher equipped
with a direct hydrostatic drive with
adjustable speed an automatic locking
system and a hydraulic system for
adjusting a minimum width of the
discharge slot in addition a built in
forward-looking module for removing
fines from the feed material can be used
in conjunction with this equipment one
of the advantages of the finlay see 1545
is that the hopper can be hydraulically
adjusted to directly feed material into
the can crusher compartments the machine
also has a fuel efficient direct drive
system via hydraulic coupling and an
automatic reset function to protect the
camera and reduce downtime also its Air
Act's Finlay see 1545 is equipped with a
metal detector on the feed belt which
has an automatic stop function and
protects the cone from metal waste and
the metal particle removal system allows
you to remove foreign particles
leaper p99 five this excavator from the
German engineering company Lee pair is
used mainly in hydraulic engineering
construction the working way to the P
995 is approximately 380 tons and the
excavator itself is mounted on an mp40
pontoon placed on support posts the
pontoon is 20 feet long and 6 feet wide
and the height of the walls is 13 feet
this model of excavator is equipped with
an MTU diesel engine with a capacity of

working equipment of the Liebherr p 995
consists of a one-piece five foot long
boom a three point six foot long handle
and a capacious bucket of 390 cubic feet
this modern and high-tech equipment
provides a maximum digging depth of 74
feet the cutting force of the excavator
is 655 kilonewtons and it's Air Force is
774 kilonewtons
bagger 288 this rotary excavator is one
of the largest self-propelled devices in
the world the car was built in Germany
back in 1978 the bagger 288 is designed
for open excavation that is for working
in quarrys the excavator removes a layer
of rock with a bucket rotor and
transfers it by means of a conveyor belt
to the loading point the bagger 288 is

cubic feet each the diameter of the
rotor itself is 70 feet in one day the
machine can extract and load up to 240
thousand tons of coal approximately
2,400 wagons the bag of 208 moves slowly
its maximum speed reaches naught point
four miles per hour the excavators
mounted on 12 crawls 12 and a half foot
wide each
and thanks to this the pressure on the
ground is insignificant despite the fact
that the total weight of the machine is
