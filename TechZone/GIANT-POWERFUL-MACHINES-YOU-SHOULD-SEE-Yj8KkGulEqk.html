independent Drive
li pair are known for force see this
crawler excavator with an optimized
hydraulic system is equipped with a leap
her d9 260 e diesel engine which
provides high efficiency the maximum
depth of digging is 6.2 5 meters and the
maximum digging radius at the parking
level is nine point nine meters the
excavator develops a speed of up to five
kilometers per hour
and as a weight of thirty three point
nine tons the machine is capable of
operating over a wide range of
temperatures from minus 40 to plus 65
degrees it's mainly used for performing
loading and unloading operations on
objects where buildings and structures
are being dismantled the manufacturer
offers a large number of additional
equipment and chassis options so that
the excavator can adapt to a variety of
tasks increased stability Ally pair r94
4c allows you to work with rock material
and other heavy duty materials
chieftain 2200 the self-propelled
screening unit from the world leader in
the production of crushing and screening
machines power screen is equipped with a
unique patented system for securing and
driving the screening shaft this system
provides high performance even when
working with dirty sticky materials
basically the machine is designed to
work with raw materials not exceeding
150 millimeters the unit is mobile
enough maneuverable easy to transport
and has a high deployment speed the
volume of the loading hopper is eight
cubic meters the diesel engine
caterpillar c4 point for a turkey use
stage 3a allows the user to achieve a
performance of up to 650 tons per hour
for greater stability the unit is
equipped with hydraulic supports
cat 99 4k this wheel loader manufactured
by caterpillar is designed to capture
load and then transport construction
materials and debris it has three
forward and three rear gears these edge
shape bucket tipping mechanism provides
the operator with an excellent view
which makes it possible to achieve high
work accuracy swivel joints of the boom
are made of solid cast parts which
increases their strength and durability
the vehicle comes with additional
cooling equipment for work in hot
conditions the operator's cabin is
equipped with a heated and ventilated
seats rubber mounts and air suspension
seats effectively reduced vibration
which makes the operator less tired
l√©a pair l5 6 6 X power the wheel loader
from the German manufacturer is equipped
with an innovative transmission which
ensures low fuel consumption tires and
brakes also wear out less the vehicle is
designed to increase the productivity of
work at the site reducing operating
costs and improving profitability the
bucket capacity is 4 cubic meters of
working ways is 23.1 tons and the
overturning load is 15.5 tons for
greater comfort the operators cab is
equipped with air conditioning
this model belongs to a compact class of
special equipment the design is
reinforced with steel components for
more reliable and confident operation in
addition the manufacturer managed to
achieve a calibrated ideal weight
distribution this feature distinguishes
L 5 6 6 X power against competing models
which with the same operating weight
have a less tipping load
hatachi e^x 8006 this mining excavator
from the Japanese manufacturer of
special machinery is designed to work in
mining quarries it's equipped with two
Cummins qsk C's 60c engines which
provide high performance the maximum
digging depth is eight point four meters
and the bucket capacity is forty-three
cubic meters the model is able to work
around the clock
and the total working resource exceeds
90,000 hours a significant advantage of
the machine is its low power consumption
the e^x 8006 is equipped with an idling

most economical in its plus the control
is made by an electric joystick each
hydraulic system is equipped with a
hydraulic filter
li pair lah this is a series of mobile
productive Fulton loaders a distinctive
feature of the series is low fuel
consumption the LH series has more than
22 models which differ in working weight
dimensions and other performance
characteristics for example the LH 30 M
as a boom radius of 14 meters and a
maximum working weight at 29.1 tonnes
the LH 20cm model as a boom radius of 11
meters is capable of working with a
weight of up to twenty one point nine
tons also there are models LH 24 LH 26
and 35 in the series they belong to the
class of compact special equipment
designed for handling and sorting of
solid household waste each model has a

stability and vigorous performance of a
wide variety of work tasks the advantage
of these trucks is a large number of
additional equipment easy to adjust the
practical needs of any production site
to ex-virgin w2 50 this special
equipment is designed for cold milling
in road construction this model is
classified as a large milling cutter it
was launched in 2011 maximum Drive
performance and modern control system
give the model a huge working resource
2x vert and W 250 is equipped with two
motors for different power for different
modes of operation the machine is
equipped with an intelligent drive
control system and also with the vehicle
has a built-in traction control system
which makes it stand out for its high

leaper a 9 to 2 rail the wheel excavator
produced in Germany is mobile and
compact and its total weight is 24
tonnes the engine power is a hundred and
ten kilowatts and the bucket capacity is
1.5 cubic meters the main feature of the
rail model distinguishing it from the
standard excavator a 9 to 2 is the
presence of an additional pair of wheels
for driving along the railway tracks
this makes the a nine to two rail
indispensable in the construction of
Railways the machine can also be used
for road construction the application
depends on situations where intensive
earth moving is required
the excavator a 9 to 2 as a powerful
hydraulic system positive control this
allows the driver to move the working
equipment quickly but smoothly the model
is characterized by increased carrying
capacity and is able to operate with a
weight of up to twenty two point eight
