loads on the joints ligaments and spine

but still enjoyed great popularity in
certain circles initially they were
designed to facilitate the training of
runners to reduce the impact on the
choice

kilograms you can buy them at a price
between 80 to 200 dollars depending on

shift wear sneakers shoes are the
elements of our clothing that allows us
to express our individuality the
manufacturers of these sneakers known as
shift wear claim that their shoes will
allow everyone to express themselves
regardless of their preferences the fact
is that each boots has an integrated
screen on the side on which using a
special mobile application you can
project to any image including moving
images according to the developer even
videos can be shown on the surface of
the shoe the mobile application is
connected to the worldwide network
allowing you to share a unique and
personalized image on your shoes as well
as using designs from other shift wear
owners
a notable feature of the screen is its
flexible design although it displays an
image in hd-quality it cannot be broken
if you try to fold the shoe the shoe
uses electricity to project the image
that the energy produced by walking is
used to recharge them the main charge is
Wireless to start charging the shoes you
just need to place them on a special
platform that comes with them it's worth
noting the shift where sneakers are
compatible with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth
connection the company has developed
several models of shoes all of which
differ slightly from each other
or for smart these are unique shoes that
do not have any analogs they differ from
other shoes for the technical content
designed to provide a fundamentally new
experience when walking or dancing
nearly hundreds of individually
controlled LEDs are mounted on the sole
their color is configured by special
mobile application which can be
downloaded after purchase all you need
to do to connect is to put on your shoes
and touch the ground with your toe a
couple of times the application will
allow you to choose a combination of
colors from those proposed or even
create your own there are really many
LEDs which can relate in a different
order and at different speeds this means
that you can customise them in the most
unique way so that no one else has
exactly the same fears a notable feature
is that the movement can be converted
into music a certain melody is assigned
to the lake movement and can be changed
every time the user takes a step the
smartphone plays the specified sound so
with the help of a pair of similar
slippers you can create an improvised
Orchestra the office smart will appeal
to dancers in particular allowing them
to create special effects for the stage
you can buy these amazing shoes for four
hundred and fifty dollars
our lace the creators of these shoes you
see on the screen think that our world
is getting better every day the more
advanced appliances more advanced houses
automobiles but for some reason few
people are engaged with the production
of advanced shoes most of their lives
people spend in Footwear and it's time
to improve that teeth
that's how power lace slippers were
bought outside they're virtually no
different from any other sports view the
secret of uniqueness lies in the
technical content these are shoes that
fit optimally to the leg the wearer
doesn't need to bend down and bend
constantly to correct the position of
the laces power lace is equipped with an
innovative system that independently
adjust the shoes under the foot all you
have to do to navitor shoelaces again is
to just adjust their position when you
put these shoes on for the first time
from now on when the slippers are on
your feet they will fit perfectly to
them when the shoe is not on the foot
the laces are loosened so that inserting
the foot is as easy and convenient as
for example in house slippers we have
already said that power laces are simple
and discreet designed but this is
definitely an advantage because not
everyone needs fantastic shoes with a
futuristic look
nike hyperadapt 1.0 a few years ago Mike
showed off its first sport shoes with an
electronic adjustment system it provides
a perfect few position for the foot in
total the development took 10 years when
you open the box you'll see that the kit
includes a few charger it connects
directly to the boot this can hardly be
considered a disadvantage as the shoes
must be loaded approximately once every
two weeks at any convenient time you can
find out the load of the used night
hyperadapt 1.0 pair to do this press any
button and then pay attention to the
color the sensor last blinked with blue
indicates the Lotus fault the light will
flash in the middle if the load is
approximately half and when the shoe
needs to be charged the light turns red
interestingly the slippers automatically
adjust as soon as the foot is placed
inside and the heel touches the insult
you only need to adjust your shoes for
the first time and then they'll remember
the position you chose and return to it
each time you wear them the developers
of nike hyperadapt 1.0 state that this
is just the first step in creating an
ultra comfortable and print or shoe the
cost of these sneakers is around seven
hundred and twenty dollars
