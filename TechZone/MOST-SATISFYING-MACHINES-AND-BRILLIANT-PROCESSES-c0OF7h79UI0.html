inside of the car tire is protected from
punctures and damage it must be provided
with a tread its other function is to
create an optimal contact patch on the
screen you can see the worker restoring
the tread on an old tire the fact is
that the tire frame is almost unlimited
service life in the process of operation
only the patent wears out that's why
today there are many cars with restored
tires especially trucks it's noteworthy
that the restored tread doesn't differ
from the original one biased performance
since the procedure helps to
significantly reduce the cost of
maintenance at the car it's not
surprising it's so popular
the old tread is removed from the tire
the unnecessary rubber is simply cut off
then the frame is repaired eliminating
punctures and other defects after that
its surface is ground until it acquires
a rough texture a layer of liquid rubber
is applied on top of it it ensures close
contact at the frame with the tread a
layer of natural rubbers applied to the
resulting surface as a primer finally
the worker applies a pre-cut red tape to
the tire first it's attached with
brackets and in the last stage the tire
is wrapped in an envelope together with
the chamber and the rim and then send
for vulcanization this method of reach
reading is called cold welding
Cheng's
new materials for the production of
chains are delivered to the plants in
the form of purified tight thick metal
wire chains of different sizes can be
produced at one workshop the process and
stages of production are the same for
making really large chains is a longer
process and is much more extensive the
first stage of production is performed
by a special machine that cuts off
pieces of wire the required length then
they are bent to form links and
connected to each other according to
manufacturers there is no room for
accidents at such plants machine tools
were extremely calibrated each piece of
metal cut off from the wire has a
strictly defined length so the finished
links are identical in size to each
other the next step is to welds the gap
of the link if it's emitted high loads
can lead to the disconnection of one
link from the other in order to
guarantee the durability and reliability
of the finished product the third step
is testing the chain is placed in
another machine which tightens it
according to the permissible weight if
any of the links are unusable and break
down they removed and replaced with new
ones after the test has been passed the
last step is the heat treatment in the
furnace thanks to it the metal becomes
even stronger
pasta these dried dough pieces can have
a variety of shapes and sizes but in any
case at the factory it all starts with
wheat grains from which the flour is
made however there are also factories
that miss this stage by buying
ready-made flour in any case it must be
sifted and cleaned before production
begins with the help of special machines
in order to achieve a really high
quality of the finished product the
employees of the factory checked the
humidity color percentage of nutrients
in the flour every 60 seconds if the
quality of the flour meets the standards
saucer is added to it then the dough for
the pasta is made special machines then
compact it and press it the finished
moist mass is chopped up after which the
Pasteur acquires its familiar look the
type of machine processing the dough has
determines what kind of Pasteur it will
be before the pasta gets the packing
Department and it's ready for
transportation to the store it's dried
and then cooled the factory you see on
the screen produces about 119 megatons
of penne pasta every year spaghetti is
produced at around 59 megatons per year
French macaron although this French
pastry is often made by hand in bakeries
there are factories where production is
partially automated the first step you
see on the screen is the preparation of
the ingredients sugar is mixed with
water and then heated to a temperature
of 106 degrees Celsius and cooked at the
same time liquid and dried egg whites
are mixed it's considered to be the main
ingredients in the preparation of this
dessert the combination of liquid egg
whites and powder is chosen because it
reduces the amount of moisture in the
finished product
after the whites have been mixed for 10
minutes a mixture of water and sugar is
poured into them a special machine mixes
the resulting composition until its
temperature drops to 40 degrees another
mixture consisting of almond powder dye
and sugar is added to the mixture which
has acquired a thick dense texture the
composition is almost completely ready
its then poured into the machine which
shapes the future cookies the discs are
then sent to the oven where they spend
20 minutes at 121 degrees Celsius the
only thing left to do is to join the
biscuits together and fill the gaps the
fillings made of a mixture of chocolate
and cream
leather cases creating seemingly small
and familiar to everyone phone cases is
a much longer and more complicated
process that it may seem at first glance
most likely that's why about eighty
percent of the cases on the market are
plastic and only twenty percent are made
of leather a piece of leather is cut out
of the skin with a special stamp the
surface is processed until it's three
millimeters thick then another stamp is
used to form a pattern on the surface
the edges are reworked to achieve the
required thickness then the leather is
soaked for three hours after that an
aluminium mold is placed on it imitating
the size that the smartphone having
previously made a mark up for us
the edges of the workpiece are bent
future outlines and curves that the
cover are formed to give it its final
shape the edges of the workpiece is sewn
together the shape is fixed with the
help of clamps in which the cover spends
about ten minutes to dry the skin the
covers run through the oven three times
and then left under the fans to finally
dry it for two hours now
when the skin is fixed in the right
position the excess material is cut off
and the worker also makes holes for
buttons connectors and the camera then
it's necessary to polish all the edges
the surface and put on a logo
Jewellery the production of chains made
of gold and silver alloys as a process
that resembles the production of
ordinary big chains which we've already
shown today the main difference is of
course its size automated machines
perform jewelry work on cutting metal
creating pieces of links and welding
this method is called anchor chain and
the machine connects up to 600 links per
minute the specialist randomly checks
their quality to the operation and the
machines is different and depends on the
final strength of the chain for example
there are machines that twist several
gold pieces into a dense bundle the
resulting workpiece is covered with the
special powder to prevents it from
sticking together during the next stages
of production and then heated to 815
degrees Celsius
next the machine or a person attaches a
lock to the end of the chain and is
branded with a whole mark the final
stage during which the metal acquires
its usual thing is the treatment in full
tanks with chemical substances</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
