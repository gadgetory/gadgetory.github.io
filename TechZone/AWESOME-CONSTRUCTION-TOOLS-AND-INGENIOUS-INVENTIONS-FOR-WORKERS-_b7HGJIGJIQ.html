are one of the most common materials for
bathroom decoration however few people
know that it could be easily replaced
with ornamental stone moreover not just
along the perimeter of the room floor
but even in the shower cabin the
construction of a shower cavern using
such stone is shown in the video you can
even use pebbles in this case the
Builder uses small flat stones this
material has a very significant
advantage pebble stones are cheaper than
tiles to guarantee the durability of the
surface you have to choose the right
building materials for example these
cements on which the material is laid
must have water repellent properties
only then it will be able to withstand
the damaging effects of water for years
or even decades the process of laying
the material is long but the results is
worth it
as each stone has a unique shape the
master has to select one by one so they
would lay close together creating a nice
pattern after all the stones have been
laid the master uses mortars to fill the
gaps or a special flexible grouts to
guarantee each stone will be firmly
fixed in its place
trax Porter TX 2500 a variety of bulk
materials is used on almost any
construction sites like roads or
backyard areas the problem is that not
only large companies with big expensive
specialized equipment work in that field
that is why the loading and
transportation of bulk materials in the
case of small construction projects is
often very complicated the track sports
at CX 2500 is a small machine capable of
solving such a problem the principle of
operation is similar to that of a dump
truck but at the same time the vehicle
is compact maneuverable and has a
relatively small cost the manufacturer
recommends using trucks Porter for
transportation of stones crushed stone
and gravel
the 1.5 cubic meter tank can also carry
wood despite its modest size the
equipment is capable of carrying
materials weighing up to two and a half
tons the maximum speed of movement is 12
kilometers per hour but it is fully
compensated by the amazing possibility
of the machine
the wide crawlers allowed to drive on
bumpy roads overcome obstacles and even
to drive through shallow water the
operators seats together with the other
controls rotates so the mini dump truck
moves equally well in all directions the
body which rotates at an angle of 180
degrees is also an advantage
delta level system if you've chosen to
decorate a room with tiles you need to
plan the work properly ideally the
builders need to have an appropriate set
of tools to perform the work in the
shortest possible time
however speed of work should not affect
the quality of the finished coating this
fast tile lang system from ruby is
exactly the tool that you need it's a
box with reusable wedges strips and
nippers the system can be used for both
laying ceramic tiles on horizontal and
vertical surfaces working with the
system is pretty easy too
the red plastic strips are installed in
the seams between the tiles as they are
laid a wedge is inserted into the hole
and push through with the nippers to fit
tightly the procedure guarantees that
all the tiles are on the same level the
system also prevents the tiles from
accidentally shifting during the
hardening of the mortar as a result the
surface is perfectly flat and the
builders spent less time and effort
textured wall an original wall finishing
is the application of an unusual and
beautiful texture on the surface this
process doesn't usually take long but it
requires ingenuity from the Builder
modern manufacturers create a paint with
the special composition with the help of
a special roller a textured pattern is
created for example in this case the
worker uses Berger Paints products the
entire procedure takes no more than a
couple of days first the worker covers
the wall with a special acrylic primer
it takes two hours to dry then it is
painted using a special roller for
emulsion paint when the layer is applied
to the wall it's left for 10 minutes to
settle and then it's treated with the
texture roller now you need to leave the
wall to dry for six to eight hours after
that the procedure is repeated to make
the person more pronounced interestingly
the resulting surface has water
repellent properties so it can be washed
with a damp sponge if necessary
concrete machinery despite the fact that
concrete is one of the most popular
materials in the construction industry
the technology for its preparation and
transportation has not changed for a
very long time builders have to use
shovels to fill the raw materials in the
high mixes the most common way to
transport finished concrete is by hand
the system you see on the screen makes
the work of the builders much easier and
faster first of all pay attention to the
hydraulic hopper which lifts the raw
material and pours it into the mixer
it has a large opening for easier
filling it's also low enough and has
optimal capacity this means that workers
make less effort another device solves
the problem of transporting concrete to
a high place this is a special buckets
attached to a lift into which the
concrete is poured directly from the
mixer all the equipment shown on the
screen was manufactured by the Indian
company JP
changing grass if the grass in your
backyard lacks colors and grows unevenly
at first glance it may seem that the
solution to the problem will take months
however you don't necessarily have to
reseed the grass you can simply replace
it just like the workers you see on the
screen did the whole procedure took them
no more than a couple of days
the first step is removing the old grass
layer along with the topsoil using a
regular shovel next the boundaries of
mark to make the area more tidy this
barrier can be made of wood concrete
brick or metal before laying a new layer
of grass the surface must be properly
prepared this area is filled with water
so first the whole area is evenly
covered with gravel it will serve as a
drainage system
then it's compacted to remove the air
pockets next the workers water the area
and then cover it with a film to protect
it from weeds the lawn is supplied in
the form of rolls which are simply
rolled out so that the edges of the
grass strips touch each other then the
sand is pulled to stabilize the lawn it
also has a good effect on its durability
the grass has then brushed outs to make
the sand set better</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
