is a miracle of physics it can repel all
kinds of liquids including oil and mud
making it very useful in all areas of
human life for example it can be used to
protect your clothes the surface of your
dishes your shoes and your vehicle's
body from mud and mold
the materials impermeable effect works
thanks to the characteristics of the
molecules inside it which try to avoid
any contact with water
some plants behave in the same way they
don't get wet and the drops of water
stay on the surface try a dyed one of
the most explosive elements on the
planet is nitrogen triiodide which looks
like a mixture of black and brown
crystals of a duct and ammonia
despite its innocent appearance this dry
mixture is very sensitive and explodes
at the slightest contact if you touch
the mixture with a wand or drop a
balloon on top of it you'll see an
explosion accompanied by a purple cloud
of vapor
because of its instability the material
is used in some chemical tricks but it's
not something fantastic hydrogel these
colored balls at first glance look quite
small
however immerse them in water wait a
little while and you'll see how the
hydrogel fills up with moisture and
increases in size significantly filling
the entire container nowadays this
product is actively used in gardening
flora culture and landscape design
adding it on the ground next to the
fertilizer thanks to the hydrogel there
is no need to water the plants all the
time or worry about its growth
developers say it is safe for humans and
can work for up to 5 years without
having to be changed you can buy the
hydrogel at any fertilizer store or
order it online listen all this nickel
titanium alloy has a characteristic that
scientists know as shape-memory if an
object made of nitinol for example a
clip is deformed it will recover its
initial shape when heated to a
temperature of 104 degrees Fahrenheit
the same thing will happen if you place
the object in water
in addition nitinol as a resistant and
elastic product but unfortunately it is
quite expensive and difficult to make
nowadays nitinol is used in medicine to
hold broken bones gallium
gallium is not just another element of
the periodic table of elements it's also
a methyl that can melt right in your
hands its melting temperature it's 86
degrees Fahrenheit and it's heavier than
water and has minimal toxicity nowadays
this material is used in electronics
military industry and medicine although
it's not cheap at all in 2005 a tonne of
gallium cost 1.2 million dollars
aerogel
the most solid material on the planet is
aerogel so the touch it feels like light
foam but solid or fragile expanded
polystyrene with a great resistance and
low thermal conductivity in spite of
that aerogel is a solid with extremely
low density it consists of small
particles of silicon dioxide
cross-linked by pore networks aerogel
plates are used in interplanetary
stations by NASA for collecting cosmic
dust the DES material can be purchased
by anyone depending on the size and
shape a piece of aerogel that fits in
the palm of your hand is somewhere
between 25 and 125 dollars magnetic
plasticine this substance resembles the
common plasticine used by children it
can be softened spread and used to
create all kinds of figurines if you
create a ball it will bounce against the
wall or floor like a real ball but the
really impressive thing is that if you
put a magnet near it the plasticine will
approach as if it were alive if you
leave the magnet for a long time the
material will end up eating the magnet
completely this plasticine contains
millions of magnetic particles that
react to magnetic fields
the stronger the magnet nearby the more
interesting the reaction of the
plasticine using a normal magnet the
plasticine will simply be attracted but
when interacting with stronger magnets
the plasticine can be charged become a
magnet and attract small metal objects
ferrofluid ferrofluid also known as
magnetic fluid is a curious and
mysterious substance of dark color
composed of magnetic nanoparticles and
an extra material that does not allow
the particles to fall apart when a
magnet is brought closer to the
ferrofluid the small particles arranged
themselves in lines creating a figure
similar to a liquid Hedgehog the more
powerful the magnets the more
interesting the figure will be this
strange substance can be acquired on the
Internet but be careful because it can
stain things easily meta material
scientists from Amsterdam and Tel Aviv
created the first programmable
mechanical metamaterial it has great
resistance flexibility and mechanical
memory
this kind of meta material can be used
in soft robotics and in the creation of
medical prosthesis it's also very useful
in creating devices that we use every
day such as smartphones and watch it
non-newtonian fluid this liquid can be
created at home using potato starch and
water mixed together the main feature of
non-newtonian fluids is that they behave
differently depending on the pressure
force if you hit the liquid surface with
your fist it'll feel like a solid and
elastic material but if you repeat the
movements slowly the liquid will behave
normally and you can easily place your
hand inside
this happens because of the structure of
the substance and the bonds between the
molecules inside it
