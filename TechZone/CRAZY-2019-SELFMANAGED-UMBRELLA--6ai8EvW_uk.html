in the rain you've probably thought
about how cool it would be you didn't
have to hold your umbrella in your hand
all the time of course it's not heavy
and not so difficult to hold but it
still keeps your hand busy sometimes
both of them limiting your movements
Mulla and the illusionist from France
thoughts about that too he remembered
that he occasionally uses unique self
moving umbrellas for his performances
and he decided to use them in real life
saying thanks to the team from augmented
Magic drone briella was created
essentially it's a small drone and
attached to an umbrella it can be
controlled using a specially developed
mobile application you can order the
device to stay in place fly around or
recharge but most important commanders
of course follow me
the drone loans the users location by
the position of their smartphone and
then flies directly over their head
protecting that plane or rain it's
noteworthy that the drone can follow the
person walking or riding a bicycle so
far drone Briella is just a prototype
that in the near future the project will
be launched in a crowdfunding platform
and must production with again
bring builder 3000 you are looking at an
automated multifunctional work center
and an innovative tread recovery system
this device is produced by the Italian
company Marangoni and the model on the
screen is the rebuilder 3000 in
operation it uses rain shred technology
this means that raw material is put
inside the equipment to directly restore
the tread and in the end you can get a
ready to use time also the work center
allows you to fill unwanted cavities and
damages with insert rubber thus
preparing the time for the curing
process
the undoubted advantage is that the
machine unites all the phases of the
repair process until one reducing human
effort to a minimum in addition to tires
can be processed simultaneously the
manufacturer offers several models which
differ in size and production capacity
the ring builder 3000 is the largest
machine in the line and it's designed
for large companies engaged in tread
restoration among the key features of
the model are higher throughput capacity
and a higher level of automation
compared to their competitors
mobile stair lifts ladders even small
ones are a real challenge for the
elderly and people with disabilities for
the foreman there are special elevators
going up and down and for the latter
special ramps or elevators are installed
on the stairs
unfortunately however such equipment
isn't available everywhere so we have to
come up with new ways to handle the
situation at first glance the mobile
stair lift looks like an unusual
wheelchair however its unique design
makes it possible to go up and down
stairs with convenience for both the
person sitting in the chair and the
person carrying it the equipment is
delivered in a large box and doesn't
require any additional assembly which is
certainly a big advantage you can start
using it as soon as the chair is
delivered
in addition beach share has a different
design from the other models as no need
to install special rails of the stairs
which is often a long and difficult
process the mobile stair left has a
maximum load capacity of 226 kilograms
with one battery charge sufficient to
cover 100 flights of stairs
it only takes four hours to fully charge
as well the seat belt provides
additional safety for the person the
mobile stair lifts can be used on any
staircase regardless of the material
ukb tools on the modern market as a
large assortment of various equipment
designed for bending sheet material
depending on the type of equipment and
the templates used is possible to obtain
a variety of details of very complex
shapes the video shows the operation of
the equipment of the German company you
qaitbey it's specialists have been
working in the field of bending presses
for more than 25 years according to the
experts the aim of the company is to
create equipment that will combine high
productivity with precision and high
quality of the resulting work pieces
it's noteworthy that ukb offers tools
with different mounting systems covering
the whole range of vending equipment
manufacturers market for example the
templates can have pivoting support
elements which means that no tool marks
are left on the material surface during
bending furthermore it's possible to
bend around a punctured hole without
stretching or deforming it
iron ox for the first time information
about this farm where only robots work
appeared in October last year the
startup was named iron ox and it's
specialist created agricultural
manipulators capable of growing herbs on
hydroponic plants on their only the
robots perform a harvesting function
they can lift and relocate the units
with the plants
the robots are fully automated too but a
lot of effort has been made to make the
machines so smart the process is shown
on the screen other results two and a
half years of development and testing
specialists have set up a system that
monitors crop growth equipped it with
sensors that monitor the operation of
hydroponic plants the system is
controlled by a client service through
which robots know when to harvest and
how to do it note how well the processes
are organized for example the
manipulator moves the containers slowly
and smoothly so that the water doesn't
spill out the farm shown on the screen
allows to produce up to 26,000 blocks
per year which is 30 times more than the
yield of an urban farm
z-man climb a few years ago the US
government asked the engineering firm
Draper to develop new equipment that
would allow special services to climb
the walls easily and quickly without the
use of complex fasteners and all sorts
of waves this is how the equipment for
the Zeidman climb appeared
thinking through the principle of its
operation the engineer's watch the
geckos which easily climb on any surface
using their feet if you look closely at
them you can see millions of tiny hairs
flexible and very strong when the animal
brings them close to the surface on
which they crawl the Van der Waals force
takes effect ie the atoms when in close
contact creates a temporary attraction
this method of movement is undoubtedly
effective so it was decided to apply it
to humans said man climbs suction cups
are made of silicon imitation gecko skin
however conventional suction cups didn't
allow a person to hang in one place so
they were complemented by a system of
stirrups connected to pumps
when the stirrups oppressed the pumps
set air out of the silicon suction cups
this allows them to press against the
walls hardly enough to activate the Van
der Waals force transferring body weight
from one ounce or the other allows to
move along the world like a gecko</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
