allows paralyzed people to stand and
walk this is a motorized device that's
placed on top of your clothes at the
same time the devices legs are fixed
with the help of special staples and
straps wrapped around the shoulders and
waist this device comes with a battery
and a computer placed in a backpack
charging ensures three and a half hours
of continuous operation it should be
noted that this device is quite simple
to operate
the oldest movements become the joint
movements thanks to a series of special
sensors the user only needs to select
the required mode using the control
panel which is located on a wrist
bracelet
the owner can choose actions such as get
up sits walk get down and climb it
should be noted that read walk could
also be used as a simulator for patience
and physical rehabilitation
Panasonic assist robots this exoskeleton
was developed by Panasonic
the device will be of great help to your
back muscles reducing the load on the
spine caused by intense and regular
physical effort mainly associated with
lifting and carrying heavy objects with
the help of this device the user can
easily lift loads of up to 15 kilograms
and at the same time preserve their
health the built-in sensors
automatically record and even anticipate
people's movements when lifting and
transporting heavy weights the sensors
send a signal to the built-in motor
which in turn helps the person flex and
keep the back straight without strain
this exoskeleton also allows users to
change the position of their legs in
seconds preventing fatigue and injury
talking hands for millions of deaf
people communicating with the world can
be a serious problem especially if they
don't have an interpreter or a piece of
paper for that reason a group of Italian
engineers have developed a unique device
to make more easy the lives of deaf
people the product is a kind of glove
equipped with special sensors that react
to the movements of the users hands and
fingers before using the invention the
user needs to install a special
application on his or her smartphone to
communicate with other people the device
can transmit data in the form of voice
and text it should be noted that this
development is capable of translating
hundreds of different gestures the built
in battery provides six hours of
continuous operation other advantages of
this hand for the Deaf include its
functional design simple construction
and high product quality
powered jacket mk3 the Japanese
companies Segawa electronics recently
introduced a new robotic exoskeleton the
product is made of aluminium and carbon
fiber despite its impressive height of
7.3 feet the product weighs only 55
pounds the device accurately reproduces
the onus movements the user controls the
exoskeleton using special joints
and it's worth noting that these
original machined hands are capable of
lifting objects up to 33 pounds new
computer technologies allow this human
controlled robot to make small runs and
even pick up an egg without breaking it
the developer explained that its
creation could be used in the military
industry as well as an investigations to
rescue people in life-threatening
situations or in an emergency here at us
Japanese engineers from suidobashi Heavy
Industries have developed another
incredible exoskeleton very different
from those presented by the competition
this 13 foot high construction weighs 5
tons has six wheels and runs on diesel
fuel
the invention consists of 30 hydraulic
connections and is controlled through a
smartphone but can also operate
autonomously inside the robots we find a
special cockpit for the pilots with a
control panel and a touchscreen it
should be noted that kuratas is equipped
to the machine gun to fire plastic
charges it should also be noted that the
13 foot tall device moves at a speed of
6 miles per hour
the user will have to pay more for
additional attachments in particular the
robots mechanized arms the manufacturer
claims are there's only one mechanical
coffee of this robot and it has a price
of 1 million dollars uwm lorica the
australian company sure on globalists
developed a new high-tech armor that
allows you to fight using knives
lorica is an armor with separate parts
that fit into a specially designed
underwear set this armored suit has
several layers of protection the outer
layers made of high-strength
carbon-fiber
virtually impossible to pierce or cuts
with cold steel the inner layer which is
in direct contact with the fighter's
body is made of a plastic material
capable of cushioning and reducing shock
it's worth noting that this suit is
quite light and doesn't limit movement
so fighters can move freely it should be
noted that this product is capable of
withstanding even the most severe in
price in addition the armors equipped
with 52 sensors which evaluate the force
of each stroke it makes it possible to
generate a health scale for the fighter
similar to those found in fighting video
games with each stroke received health
declines and are stronger the blow the
more the users health reserve decreases
nko one Chinese scientists have created
a very realistic armor of Iron Man the
invention is silver black and developers
claim that the product has as many
functions as its analog on the big
screen according to the engineers this
invention can even fly although not at
great distances are not as fast as in
the movies this should be noted that
piloting and control of the disguise are
carried out with a helmet
which is activated only when the pilot
is present
however the designers plan to equipped
their development with an autopilot
function the developer also specified
that the robot is produced only after
the person has pre-ordered it since it's
essential to take into account the
parameters of the person who will wear
the unusual suit
guys it's time to recharge your brain
