four wheels and two bases with ordinary
bicycle frames in addition to the
standard pedals there's bicycle can ride
independently thanks to the electric
motor the creator of this invention is a
guy named John pepper who clearly knows
a lot about bikes apart of this bike on
John's YouTube channel you can also find
a couple of interesting homemade
inventions
super fast car : FERS is widely known
among technology fans and his videos
have millions of views on his YouTube
channel thanks to his incredible
homemade inventions
in this video we want to show one of the
unusual vehicles created by him a
super-fast machine similar to those used
on the attraction altered Rome according
to different tests this car can develop
a speed of more than a hundred miles per
hour entering the Guinness Book of World
Records as the fastest means of
transport of this type
helicopter despite the fact that this
self-made Russian helicopter looks like
a frame from a full-fledged machine it's
still able to rise to the air at a small
height with the help of standard blades
in the upper and tail sections after
takeoff the helicopter can travel a
short distance for them leap one pilot
unfortunately the name of the person
behind this unusual aircraft remains
unknown but you can find other insane
Russian inventions on the YouTube
channel
meanwhile in Russia the link is in the
description electric motorcycle this
unusual 5 wheeled motorcycle with a low
landing was designed by inventor mark
diver whose YouTube channel to date has
only a thousand subscribers
according to the creator as a basis he
used an electric skateboard and a
children's bicycle
however this strange combination allowed
mark to assemble a vehicle that can
reach 50 km/h and move freely along the
road as a power source the low speed
motorcycle uses a battery for the
capacity of 10,000 milliamp hours
crosscountry vehicle both these vehicles
are the result of a long process of
remaking trucks the vehicles were
equipped with massive wheels to overcome
any obstacles on the road also some
parts of the hull have been replaced
with parts made of a more durable
material which provides high throughput
and increased safety inside the cabin
after the makeover these trucks became
real all-terrain vehicles which will
perform their functions for a long
period of time you can see these cars
overcoming incredible obstacles on the
channel off-road 4x4 fails crashes
electric boat this hovercraft assembled
by inventors from the channel the
real-life guys is equipped with an
electric motor with the capacity of nine
kilowatts which operates on special
rechargeable batteries
a grid protects all propellers installed
in the vehicle the base which is easily
inflated with an electric or hand pump
has received steering and it's possible
to ride this ship with an air cushion
both on land and on the water
three meter bicycle many people complain
that when they ride a bicycle they have
a narrow view and therefore it's
difficult for them to see the road for
example in a stream of cars as a
solution to this problem the owner of
the tall twin bike channels suggests
using a modified bicycle
with the help of iron bars and four
pedals
he created a two-seater vehicle with a
height of three meters only the driver
controls the bike but the passenger on
the lower seat can help reach a higher
speed these and other unusual bicycles
can be found on the YouTube channel of
the creator
children's can't the parents of a child
they wanted to give him a truly unique
cards created this compact car
therefore the boy's mother designed the
car and the father built the model using
various items that were stored in his
garage working four hours a week the man
built a card for two months the wooden
case with iron parts is equipped with an
electric motor with a power of 350 Watts
allowing the small car to reach a speed
of 18 in km/h the process of creating
the cart can be studied in more detail
by clicking on the link in the
description
wooden bicycle the people from the
channel exposure came up with the idea
of building this unusual vehicle the
team of high school students spent four
weeks building the bike during the
assembly wooden boards tools ordinary
nails and screws as well as wheels were
used the invention doesn't have pedals
therefore it's best to ride it on an
incline surface for example from a hill
or catching a rope to the body of a
scooter
Multi wheeled motorcycle this vehicle
was created in Indonesia based on an
ordinary Vespa motorcycle the vehicle
received a gas-fired engine and a long
body with a large number of wheels in
Indonesia these inventions can be found
at the annual carnival of unusual and
extreme scooters and motorcycles
unfortunately no one knows who the
author of this vehicle is but if you're
interested in looking at other self-made
models then we recommend you to visit
the channel Indonesia extreme scooter</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
