Turkish city of Gavi with the province
of yellow v''e was built by six
different companies at once five of them
were Turkish and one Italian and some
other foreign partners were also
involved
this suspended construction 2682 metres
long was erected in the narrowest part
of the Gulf of ishm it the opening took
place on July the 1st 2016 and thanks to
its amazing size the bridge became the
longest bridge in Turkey and the fourth
longest suspension bridge in the world
by the length of its central span in
total the construction took about 39
months the giant weight of the bridge is
supported by several 252 meter high
supports the width of the roadway is 36
metres over 8,000 people worked on the
construction of Osman Gazi about eleven
billion dollars as well was spent on the
construction it should be noted that
Osman Gazi was built in one of the most
earthquake-prone areas in the world
therefore there were special
requirements for reliability and
durability to provide the bridge with
increased stability the steel pylons
were placed on a special concrete
foundation the base in turn rests on a
layer of gravel
thanks to this design the pylons can
slip slightly during particularly
powerful earthquakes without endangering
the entire structure also the bridge was
equipped with built in seismic sensors
that would raise an alarm in case of
excessive vibration other sensors
respond to the load of the road identify
any even the smallest defamations so
that they can be quickly detected and
eliminated 85,000 tons of steel were use
for the bridge and to prevent corrosion
all metal parts were equipped with
sensors for its detection
hello girl and the construction of the
bridge on the screen is still ongoing
it started in February 2013 initially
the opening was planned for spring 2018
but in the end it was postponed to
October hello girl and is a suspension
bridge crossing the fjord of ROM barkin
located in Norway in the municipality of
Narvik being a part of the european
route ao6
it will allow to move around the country
not only faster but also safer as roads
in that area are exposed to snow
avalanches its value is estimated at 2.2
billion Kronus at the time of
construction a logger land is the
longest suspension bridge in the Arctic
Circle the length of the finished bridge
will be 1533 metres at the same time the
length of the central span is eleven
hundred and forty-five meters
the width of the road is 18 meters the
government had to sign two separate
contracts to build this road via ducks
with a total length of 400 meters have a
concrete surface the concrete surface
will be covered with two layers of
standard asphalt the part of the bridge
located above the water is made of metal
therefore it will be covered with
another mixture resistant to water the
bridge is held by two cables being 1621
meters long and 47 centimeters in
diameter according to the engineers this
design provides greater safety the
supports of the bridge are 120 metres
high and inside they have 1020 tonnes of
reinforcement and more than 40 420 cubic
meters of concrete were used for the
erection
youngster gang the construction of this
bridge began in 2013 and it will end in
2019 it's located near the city of Wuhan
where the Yangtze and Han rivers merge
its unique feature is that it's a
two-story bridge at the top of the
bridge there'll be six road lanes and
six more will be on the ground floor
it's planned that after the completion
of the construction the Yangtze Gang
bridge also known as the stairway to
heaven will become the longest two-story
bridge in the world
its length is four thousand three
hundred and seventeen meters while the
length of the main span is seventeen
hundred meters in total the construction
will take fifty four months with an
investment of about eight thousand
billion yuan this is a suspension bridge
so the main supporting structure is made
of flexible elements working on tension
the roadway is suspended on it in this
case the main load-bearing structure is
constructed of steel cables folded into
a single span metal track
Maputo and this bridge is located in the
south of mozambique when it stretches
over the Maputo bay construction works
began in 2014 and the opening was
planned for June 25th 2018 but in the
end it was postponed to the end of the
year once completed Maputo will be the
longest suspension bridge on the African
continent it is interesting that the
project was created several decades ago
but the construction couldn't start
because of problems with financing in
the end the project was backed by the
Chinese government and the Chinese road
and bridge corporation is in charge of
the construction according to China
daily the project created 2,000 new jobs
the bridge crosses the bay at an
altitude of 60 meters its length is 3000
and 41 meters originally the pylons were
going to be placed directly in the water
but this would prevent shipping so the
project was changed to thousand three
hundred and sixty-one meters of the
bridge is a viaduct that is the road
rises above the land above the water
there's a span of six hundred and eighty
meters carrier cables are attached to
anchor blocks from the north and the
south side of the bay and the load on
the structure would be extremely high so
pile foundational platforms with a
diameter from 1.5 to 2.2 meters are used
the piles are deepened into mud stone at
110 metres the pylons have a height of
141 meters the carriageway is made of
separate steel prefabricated parts each
of them were set up in a factory in
China and delivered to the Maputo Bay by
ship these components have a width of 20
5.6 meters an electric 12 meters in
total the construction of the bridge
will cost 726 million dollars
do J this bridge was also built in China
it crosses the bye pan River and is
located on the border of the city
districts of Q Jing and Lu Han shui
its total length is 1341 meters and the
length of the main span is 720 meters it
is the fourteenth longest main span in
the world on a suspension bridge and the
eighth in China it's amazing that the
roadway is at a height of 564 meters
above the river thanks to this the
doogee is one of the ten highest bridges
in the world it has a double peaked
cable state structure and from the two
sides it's replaced by sections of beam
construction because of its unusual
location the tower supports of the
bridge have different heights the
eastern one Rises 269 meters in the air
and the western one 246 and a half
meters to increase the stability and
load carrying capacity of the structure
it was decided to place a rod and frame
system from below more than a thousand
engineers and technicians took part in
the construction this is one of the
first suspension bridges built in Asia
the construction began on September the
10th 2013 and on December the 29th 2016
the bridge was put into operation</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
