urban GC 1 it might be hard to believe
but this bike is made entirely of
recycled paper according to its creators
they sought to create a completely
environmentally friendly transport in
which its owners could move freely
through the city in order to protect the
paper structure from getting wet during
rainfall the bike is covered with a
dense layer of recycled polyester this
vehicle comes with an environmentally
friendly cover for your smartphone and
comes in a specially designed package
that can be reused or turned into
something useful
however the creators have not decided
into what exactly the bike is available
in 9 different colors the cost of this
unusual Mexican invention is a hundred
and eighteen dollars
our a HT racer an inventor from
Minneapolis created this unique means of
transportation which is a hybrid of a
bicycle and an electric vehicle it has
equipped both with an electric motor and
with a pedal drive which can work either
separately or simultaneously
complementing each other as a result of
this combination this hybrid bicycle can
reach the maximum speed of a hundred and
sixty kilometers per hour
which allows it to even compete with
conventional cars this vehicle has a
streamlined body made of composite
carbon materials now however instead of
having four wheels as a conventional car
this bike has only three which greatly
increases its maneuverability the
batteries allow it to travel up to 80
kilometers on one full charge but the
use of the pedal generator significantly
increases this distance a typical adult
can maintain a stable speed of up to 48
kilometers per hour just by pedaling in
a moderate rhythm the cabin of this
unusual bicycle is equipped with airbags
and seatbelts two seats a luggage
compartment and even an on-board
computer the cost of this vehicle is
$5000 Rhinoceros future bike concept the
concept of this futuristic bike was
created by a designer from India and it
looks more like a vehicle from an outer
space saga than an ordinary bike that
will ride the roads of the earth it's
streamlined phone clearly suggests that
the device will be able to develop high
speeds and the seating position hints
that the driver will have to lean
towards the handlebar as in a race
bicycle the smokeless wheels are
equipped with some additional lights
along its contour and as we already know
many of the most original and crazy
concepts have eventually been made into
reality
perhaps this ultra-modern bicycle will
not be an exception what will be if we
wrap around and round with scotch tape
throw the whole package into a microwave
up roaster quite
you got to a giant hungry well after
that drown you in the ocean then bury
you alive shaken the bottom of the
Mariana Trench there's no time to
explain
