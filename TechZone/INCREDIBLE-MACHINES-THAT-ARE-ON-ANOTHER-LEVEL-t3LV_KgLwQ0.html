the screen is highly popular at Stone
mining sites it's produced by the
Italian company Fantini there is a huge
number of models of different capacities
and sizes some use chainsaws and others
bow source
there are even models for tunnels and
places with limited space the 7tb you
see is a self-propelled machine moving
on caterpillar tracks it's able to cut
the material vertically it can be
equipped to cut stone up to 4 meters
deep
the hydraulic stabilization legs give
the machine extra stability the main
advantage of these 7cb you see is that
it can move through the quarry on its
own when making cuts and soaring out
squares the machine does not use water
which is also an advantage another model
is the Turner Fantini mounted on a JCB
tractor the four wheels allow the
tractor to move significantly expanding
the range of operation this all
processes stone blocks on the ground
even if they are in different parts of
the quarry the video shows just how easy
it is to cut hard materials such as
marble and limestone handle robots
engineering company Boston Dynamics has
been surprising the world with its
achievements in the field of robotics
for many years one of their creations is
handle a robot that was presented in
2017 at that time this 2 meter tall
robot has already demonstrated its
impressive capabilities handle could
reach speeds of up to 15 kilometers per
hour and overcome obstacles despite its
size the machine had no difficulty
balancing even moving on an uneven
surface handle could easily lift objects
weighing up to 45 kilograms with its
front limits to
it's been three years since then and the
engineers keep improving their creation
in late March this year they showed the
new capabilities of the machine this
latest model lost its arms but now has a
suction cup
the video shows handle using it to lift
boxes and carefully move them from one
place to another the robot weighs 105
kilograms and it's able to lift loads
weighing up to 15 kilograms this robot
is designed for working in the warehouse
computer vision allows the machine to
analyze the space around it searching
for objects and finding places for
storage
the AG cormorant in August 2018 it was
announced that agricultural workers
would soon have a special assistant when
Israeli companies tactical robotics
limited and Adama
revealed their unmanned aerial vehicle
it was named the AG cormorant the
engineers spent years adjusting the
equipment for agricultural use the
device is based on another drone
developed by these companies designed to
carry wounded soldiers for the
battlefield this drone was modified for
example the stern was equipped with
pipes and nozzles for spraying
pesticides it can take off and land
vertically which means there's no need
to spend money on a runway to use it
traditionally the farm fields are
treated manually or using ground
equipment the AG current will increase
the working speed the spraying tubes are
foldable too so that the drone can be
transported by small trucks the maximum
load capacity of the machine is 500
kilograms or 764 kilograms if you count
the fuel
quick cuts there are two traditional
ways of harvesting herbaceous plants
cutting each plant by hand or using
expensive and cumbersome equipment
that's the reason why small agricultural
enterprises need an inexpensive
effective alternative and it is here
this is quick cuts a compact mobile herb
harvesting machine using it one person
can do the same amount of work as three
or four people without it the capacity
of the machine is 80 kilograms per hour
another advantage is that the device
cuts the plants more evenly than people
do the design is quite simple a rolling
macrame brush gently pulls the
individual leaves into the blade and
then throws them into the basket the
brush is powered by a standard drill
placed on the side contact with the
blade is minimized which makes quick cut
very safe the cost of the device is five
hundred and sixty dollars
pyaare 100 industrial scale production
requires powerful equipment this is the
only way to manufacture products quickly
enough and in the right quantities to be
profitable the pr 100 is a commercial
juicer designed to increase productivity
it optimally combines a compact size a
great performance and a reasonable price
to allow even small companies to afford
it the equipment uses a rotating metal
disc to cut fruits and vegetables the
holes you see will shred the pulp too
careless use of such a device can
results in serious injury though that's
why the pipe is so long to keep your
hands as far from the blade as possible
while the equipment is in operation
surprisingly
the juice press has enough power to
juice a whole unpeeled pineapple so you
prevent the vegetables from getting
stuck the worker pushes them closer to
the blade with a special press again
keeping your hands far from the sharpest
parts when the vegetables and fruits are
shredded the second stage of production
begins the pulp collected in the bag
then undergoes a pressing cycle the
press applies 14 tons of force to
squeeze out the liquid the video shows
how nine kilograms of fruit and
vegetables produce almost seven and a
half liters of juice the remaining pulp
is almost completely dry which means
that absolutely everything that was
inside the products was squeezed out
lyza wash 360 these days a car can be
cleaned without using manual labor of
course this is possible at car washes
that use equipment like the laser wash
360 that revolutionized the markets of
contactless automatic car washes the
equipment can apply a detergent solution
and then wash the car surface with
high-pressure water jets it then applies
an active foam a layer of wax and even
dries the vehicle
the whole washing process doesn't take
more than three minutes that's five
times faster than normal
therefore the device is capable of
washing from ten to sixteen cars per
hour the equipment uses the resources
efficiently - as a result water and
electricity consumption at the facility
is reduced by up to 60% a manipulator
with 18 integrated nozzles is used for
water and detergent supply it rotates
360 degrees ensuring that the car is
perfectly clean on all the sites the
laser wash 360 does not require any
maintenance staff either the program
itself was able to calculate the amounts
of work done and the revenue and the
payment is made through its terminal
this wonderful machine was designed by
Chinese engineers
hey stop being lazy it's time to use
that brain of yours welcome to brain
time incredible facts from the past the
present and even the future the power of
