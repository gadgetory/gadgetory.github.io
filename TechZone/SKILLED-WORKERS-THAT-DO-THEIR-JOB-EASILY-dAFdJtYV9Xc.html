fastest way to flatten a wall is
covering it with drywall the finished
surface is so smooth that you can start
painting on it right away
the main advantage of this method is
that workers don't need to work with wet
plaster drywall lining requires less
technical knowledge than traditional
plastering also a relatively small
amount of water is used that's why this
method is also called dry lining
however the workers you see on the
screen of Connie's step further and
decided to improve the technology the
fact is that most often drywall is
attached to a special frame made of wood
or metal profiles here as you can see
there's nothing like that this method
has plenty of advantages firstly unlike
the frame it doesn't thicken the wall
stealing a few inches secondly the
mounting work is significantly faster as
you can guess it takes a while to
assemble and fix the frame and thirdly
this method saves money because less
building material is used nevertheless
the builders have to be more careful
when using the frameless method the
slightest mistake can cause that the
angle between the wall and the floor
won't be ninety degrees that is why
after installing each sheet the worker
measures everything again
the sheets are fixed on the wall with
the help of either self-tapping screws
or as in this case with adhesives
natural texture wallpaper in order for
the wall to resemble a natural pattern
such as wood you don't necessarily need
to use wooden panels there's a much
faster easier and cheaper ways to do it
choose a special wallpaper like the work
you see in the video a great deal of
patience and precision has been shown
during the work resulting in a high
quality finishing first the worker makes
sure that the wall is dry and flat work
should start from the middle so the
master draws a line perpendicular to the
floor at the starting point then the
height of the wall is measured the
wallpaper sheet should be 10 centimeters
higher the backside of the wallpaper is
wetted with cold water so that it's
easier to glue then the worker folds the
wallpaper allowing the water to soak in
and starts working on the glue
the glue has to be applied more
carefully near the floor and the ceiling
therefore a brush is used under the rest
of the surface a microfiber roller is
used finally the master proceeds
directly to the wallpapering the
wallpaper is rolled up with the back
side facing outwards it's glued to the
wall along the previously drawn line in
order to flatten the wallpaper the
worker uses a rubber roller the roller
moves from the center of the wallpaper
to the sides getting rid of the bubbles
under its surface before cutting off the
excess
a worker treats the edges with the
special roller for a tighter fit after
each sheet has been put up on the wall
the skirting boards are washed with cold
water removing the glue in the same way
the whole room is wallpapered the seams
between the sheets are treated with
another special roller
mosaic installation if you want to turn
a wall or a floor in your house into a
work of art you should choose mosaic as
the finishing material especially
because modern manufacturers offer a
variety of options to speed up and
facilitate the work for example you can
buy a pattern and the elements to
assemble it in this case you can lay
them on the floor by yourself then when
the drawing is ready a layer of adhesive
film is applied over it in order to fix
the elements of the mosaic in place this
way you don't have to carry them from
place to place individually they are
transported in sections if you decide to
decorate your room with a more complex
pattern it would be more convenient to
buy it ready-made look how many tiny
elements this mosaic at
not every builder is creative enough to
assemble a whole painting out of tiles
that's why it's recommended to buy them
ready-made they are made by workers in
special workshops and builders on the
site are spared the need to maintain the
integrity of the drawing the mosaic is
applied to the wall on us the same way
as wallpaper and at the end it only
remains to carefully grout the surface
domes sealing assembly here's another
basic construction technology that turns
an ordinary ceiling into a piece of art
at first sight installing a dome ceiling
looks rather complicated and indeed the
process does have a lot of details it
would be much easier to make the same
frame for example using aluminium
profiles
however the workers you see on the
screen have chosen a more complex and
time-consuming option which would be
extremely difficult for most people you
have to work with a lot of bent timber
moreover every elements of the ceiling
has a different radius and it's
important to select it correctly in each
case
the more intricate the ceiling looks the
more effort it takes to assemble it
wooden elements can be curved concave or
even undulating in order to somehow
speed up the process of work workers use
air nailers to fix the beams
Road flattening works smarter not harder
is the motto all genius builders follow
that's why we show people who use
interesting and advanced equipment in
their work like for example this grader
it's a trailer capable of leveling and
moving soil snow and in this case gravel
there are two types of graders mounted
and self-propelled this video is clearly
showing the first type mounted graders
in turn are also classified into front
and rear notes how fast this equipment
works the large working width allows you
to level large areas
shower cubicle installation take a look
at the built-in shower cubicle in almost
any home and you'll see that it usually
has special curbs to prevent water from
spilling over the entire bathroom floor
while this is a traditional design there
is another more economical but less
reliable solution look how the craftsman
installs a curbless shower cubicle
that's on the same level as the rest of
the floor to minimize the risk of
spilling water all over the bathroom it
is important to install the shower tray
correctly typically it's placed in a
specially designed with recess below the
floor level first to the water drain
pipe is laid and then it's covered with
mortar the tray itself is then placed on
the bonding compound and the master
carefully seals all the seams
this step is particularly important in
the bathroom where all surfaces are
constantly exposed to moisture once the
tray has been installed the work is
almost done you only have to install the
walls and the door if you want one
