there are several procedures that can
significantly improve the attractive
appearance and quality of a lawn one is
called aeration the fact is that for
grass to grow normally air water and
minerals must flow to the roots
accumulated soil in the lawn prevents
all vital components from reaching the
roots the aeration process at least once
a year prevents the formation of
sediment and ensures that there are no
gaps in the lawn surface there are
several ways to aerate your lawn one of
the most convenient devices for the
towers can be seen on the screen this is
an accessory for a lawn mower tractor
the Australian company paddock machinery
manufactures this equipment the experts
offer three similar models which differ
in the number of spikes Andy working
with and vary from 91 to 150 centimetres
the price respectively can be up to 800
and $1000 the depth of the spikes in the
ground is 7 centimeters importantly the
spike aerator allows aeration at the
speed of the mower which saves a lot of
time compared to other known knowing
methods it also saves effort for the
person being simple and easy to use
pay attention to the opening on the side
of the equipment through which the water
is poured in this option is useful in
cases where the soil is dense and rigid
the water increases the weight of the
aerator making it more effective when
drilling into the soil
Aaron's drone the cleaning of external
surfaces especially buildings and high
structures is a rather complicated
procedure traditionally it's carried out
by specially trained people who although
they work with insurance to some extent
risk their lives in 2018 air owns showed
a special remote-controlled drone which
can simplify skyscraper cleaning and
make it safer for people the device on
the screen has a payload of 200
kilograms and is capable of spraying
water at a pressure of 10 to 500 bar
the maximum height at which the drum can
work is 350 meters this means that the
Aaron's device is capable of cleaning
the surface of any skyscraper on the
planet
it should be noted that it's advisable
to use this type of drone also for the
maintenance of windmills as it's an even
more complex procedure the device is
capable of working in any climate with
temperatures above and below zero it can
be used to clean the ice from the blades
which often causes turbine downtime
according to the manufacturer erroneous
drones allow the task to be tackled five
times faster and cheaper than
traditional cleaning methods while air
can be used to apply specialized
compositions to the surface extending
the life of the blades and reducing the
rate of ice and dirt accumulation on
them
kiru sound leveling and compaction are
activities that often accompanies
various stages of construction and
landscaping this is a compact and
portable motor grader that can be used
to level loose building materials in a
short period of time and with minimal

comfortable and effective tool that will
be suitable for the alignment of all
surfaces its use can significantly
reduce the number of hours of work and
labor as a results it also saves money
after use the surface is perfectly
smooth and homogeneous this is due to
the fact that excess sand stone or
crushed stone fills the void in all sand
layers thanks to dense tamping
a working width of kiru is a hundred and
twenty centimeters and you can buy it
for a thousand dollars
aqua rocket the secrets of the working
speed of cleaning companies is the
powerful equipment created especially
for large volumes of work among them is
the aqua rocket a universal device
designed for industrial cleaning this
means that it can handle all types of
contaminants quickly efficiently and on
virtually any surface
it should be noted that the water jack
can be sprayed under pressure from a
hundred to two hundred and seventy five
bar it is so powerful that it not only
instantly removes the toughest dirt the
alcohol rocket is able to clean weeds
and grass between paving slabs as well
see how this equipment can transform
entrances garage doors stairs fences
doors walls and more the manufacturer
highlights the strength and durability
of the nozzle which provides the
declared power of the water jet
it's made of stainless steel and
tungsten carbide sir can withstand even
the heaviest loads and the harshest
conditions
the service life of the aqua rocket
industrial turbo nozzle is several times
longer than that of the ceramic muscle
as well
cowboy robot in 2018 us food company
Cargill thoughts of creating equipment
that could serve as castle herders
improving human safety in animal welfare
that's how the cowboy robot was
developed today the company's employees
don't understand how they worked without
it before traditionally people have used
random means to move livestock from the
corral to the milk collection area for
example plastic bags to create noise and
attract the attention at the animals in
addition they use their voices to hurt
the castle the cowboy robot combines
everything that cattle herders are
accustomed to using it moves on wheels
controlled by special ammo control
waving bags while the built-in speakers
allow it to drive the animals with its
voice the most important advantage
provided by this robot is safety cars
are large unpredictable animals that can
weigh up to 600 kilograms in the event
of an unforeseen and dangerous situation
the robot will suffer not a person it's
remarkable that the robots easy to
operate as well according to the
company's employees the remote control
resembles the joystick of a video game
console
