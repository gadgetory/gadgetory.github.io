bell as 75 710 was launched and it was
considered to be the largest and most
load lifting dump truck in the world
however in 2018 a new truck which will
be able to break this record was shown
and now it's being developed at full
speed the novelty was presented by the
Slovenian company ETF mining equipment a
unique feature of this dump truck is its
modular design each of the modules can
be moved on its own and together they
form a train with a payload of up to
eight hundred and seventy tons for
comparison the payload of the Ballet's
75 710 dump truck is four hundred and
fifty tons
the ETF mt 240 has other interesting
features too for example according to
the manufacturer the vehicle will be 25%
more fuel efficient while productivity
will increase by 12% the MT 240 dump
truck has a four-wheel drive chassis
each of the five pairs of wheels is
controlled individually this huge car is
also powered by several engines at once
repair and maintenance cost walls to be
reduced thanks to the design of the
manufacturer the engine the gearbox the
frame the suspension and other elements
can be replaced quickly and easily
liebherr p99 five pontoon excavators are
special equipment designed specifically
to look at sea and phibian excavators
like the one you see on the screen are
manufactured by the German company Leap
air it's operating weight is 380 tons
the backhoe volume ranges from 8 and a
half to 18 cubic meters the maximum
digging depth is 26 meters the first
excavator of this type was put into
operation in 2004 and has since
established itself as an economical and
high-performance vehicle that can handle
all kinds of tasks in hydraulic
engineering
the LeapPad p95 is most often mounted on
pontoons and supports inside the machine
there's a diesel engine with an outputs
of about twenty three hundred and fifty
horsepower
now most PTC 200 DS the Dutch company
managed specializes in the production of
strikingly large lifting equipment the
challenge for its engineers or is to
develop vehicles that will increase
productivity and ensure more efficient
handling and load installation tasks the
PTC 200 DS ring crane is used where
oversized and heavy objects need to be
moved and installed in confined spaces
notable features include a high payload
of 5000 tons a large boom extension
flexible configuration relatively fast
mobilization and a compact size the size
of the ring base can be changed to suit
the construction site and the tasks at
hand
its diameter can either be 30 metres or
41 metres as a rule it takes three to
six weeks to prepare this crane through
operation
the weight of the equipment is 6125
tonnes although such cranes were put
into production in 2011 the model is
still being improved for example in 2018
engineers were able to improve their
performance
now the crane can lift monolithic loads
weighing about 2,000 tonnes which
previously could only be lifted if it
was divided into sections
the leap 8284 in 2004 li pair launched
the production of the t28 - dump truck
the model was so successful and popular
that it was decided to create a new
similar whole truck that were continuous
tradition that's how the Li pair t28 4
appeared it was first shown at the min
Expo 2016 it is the lightest but at the
same time the most powerful member of
the heavy duty mining class this means
that it has a relatively low unladen
weight of 600 tons and an outstanding
payload of up to 300 and 63 tons
despite the fact that there's a 4,000
horsepower diesel engine inside the
LeapPad suite for features low fuel
consumption and meets environmental
standards the manufacturer claims that
the machine was designed to save time at
construction sites by using fewer trucks
Berthe the vehicle you see on the screen
is the world's largest
tunnel-boring machine in 2013 bertha
started working in seattle and was
tasked with drilling a 2.8 kilometers
tunnel underground the drilling began in
June 2013 and was expected to be
completed in December 2015
however due to unforeseen malfunctions
there was a two-year delay as a result
drilling was completed in April 2017 the
vehicle weighs 60 100 tons has a
diameter seventeen and a half meters and
is 99 metres long the principle of its
operation is quite simple though the
rotor is equipped with 260 cutters for
various purposes some of them break into
the ground destroying it others move it
in dig up boulders while others scoop up
the loosened massive soil and stones and
then directed into the EPB chamber from
there the soil is transported on a screw
conveyor and then carried away by a belt
conveyor the power of the structure is
25,000 horsepower Bertha's productivity
is impressive as well it's able to move
forward 10 metres per day it's
noteworthy that digging up the land is
not the only tasks that the vehicle
performs further simultaneously with the
excavation works places concrete blocks
of lining on the tunnel walls each of
them being 60 centimeters thick thus
Bertha performs a colossal job using any
other equipment in this case would cost
more and the construction itself would
take much more time
the leaper lb 16 180 and here is a
compact rotary drilling rig capable of
performing a variety of tasks it has a
lot of advantages its applications
include Calabar drilling continuous
flight auger drilling and twin rotor
drilling
pay attention to the design the leaper
lb 16 180 has simple fast and therefore
relatively inexpensive transport needs
if the mast and drilling driver folded
the red can be transported using a
standard low frame trailer when the
crane arrives at a construction site
start-up time is minimum if the height
of the construction site is limited the
lb 16 180 can be equipped with a shorter
mast the vehicle weighs 53 tons the
maximum Calabar drilling depth is thirty
four and a half meters notable features
include a sturdy torsionally stable mast
this means that the unit is designed
specifically for heavy construction work
hey stop being lazy it's time to use
that brain of yours welcome to brain
time incredible facts from the past the
present and even the future the power of
nature and wild animals amazing facts
and unsolved mysteries you'll find all
this and much more hair subscribe now
