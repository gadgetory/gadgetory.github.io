disadvantages the first is that very
often they contain large and unhealthy
amounts of sugar and even if you buy
regular water from a store another
disadvantage is the disposable plastic
bottles which are polluting the
environment the vending machine for ice
and water is a great alternative you

use it again and you have to bring your
own bottle the machine is designed for a
one-time supply of 19 liters of water or
less if you wish it is noteworthy that

dirt repellent car paint a few years ago

dirt repellent car paint this is a
special Ultra ever dry complex that
includes fat and water repellent

between the body and the surroundings
preventing stains the coating is
resistant to temperature changes rain
and snow and there's a chance that such
paint will be among optional equipment
of Nissan cars in the future protect
anti-theft devices have not changed much
in recent years it's still the same
alarm system that makes a sound and
alerts the police however before they
arrived the intruder often has enough
time to steal valuable items and escape
protect is an innovative system to
protect homes warehouses and commercial
spaces in the event of a break-in
it doesn't make a sound but quickly
fills the room with a dense fog it's so
thick that the intruder loses the
ability to see and in some cases even
loses their spatial orientation
this means that they won't be able to
take anything of value even if they
wanted to because they won't be able to
see or find it in addition protect works
especially well due to the surprise
effect the attacker is scared by the fog
and hurries to leave the room as soon as
possible it is noteworthy that protector
leaves no residue on furniture walls or
other surfaces and doesn't contain any
harmful substances it is harmless to
people and animals alike and doesn't
damage plants or electrical appliances
the manufacturer offers various
protection options to fill rooms of any
size with fog the fog stays in the room
for an hour which means in most cases it
can even detain the intruder before the
police arrive for the system to work
again

special liquid in the sprayer

leads to losing control of the car X net
is a high-tech fiber net measuring 5.3
meters when the car drives on it the net
wraps around the front wheels first it
pierces the tires in several places and
secondly it wraps around the wheels
axles preventing them from spinning
at a speed of 80 kilometers per hour the
average stop distance is 55 meters the
lower the speeds the shorter the
distance the deceleration is not too
abrupt so the driver does not get hurt
