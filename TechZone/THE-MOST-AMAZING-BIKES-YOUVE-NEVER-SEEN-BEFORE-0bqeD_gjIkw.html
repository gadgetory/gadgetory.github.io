might think that this is an ordinary
bicycle with nothing special about it
however if you take a closer look at it
you'll discover a more compact design
and realize that it doesn't have a seat
there is virtually no distance between
the front and rear wheels the upper and
lower tubes are shortened thanks to this
unique design when unassembled to the
bike takes up little space and fits
easily even in a small bag the pedals
may appear to be built into the rear
wheel but this is not entirely true the
pedals have a non-standard design which
is more than an aesthetic decision of
the developers turns out that this
design significantly increases the
number of revolutions at the wheels
compared to the number of turns of the
pedals in other words in order to
develop a higher speed or to make a long
trip on the run bike the user will have
to make less effort than if riding a
standard bicycle since the rider cannot
sit while riding his or her body takes
on a special straight position which
facilitates movements the run bike is
suitable for people of all ages and all
physical conditions
sandwich bike to create this bicycle the
engineers did not use standard materials
the frame made of wood gives this model
and extremely unusual and very
attractive appearance it's worth noting
that this original selection of
materials doesn't affect the ability of
the bike to gain speed or carry loads
the surface has been treated with a
special solution so that the wood is not
damaged resisting water sunlight heat
and cold it is therefore possible to
travel on the sandwich bike in the same
way as on a standard bicycle since the
frame is made of aluminium the
developers of the model worked hard on
its creation and added one more feature
to the final version it is possible to
assemble the sandwich bike manually and
independently and the developers ensure
that this simple procedure does not take
much time
as the person builds the bicycle they
can properly understand how the
components are made and also appreciate
their beauty it is worth mentioning that
each bicycle is in a sense unique the
frame uses natural wood so the surface
stands out for its beautiful pattern
since in the world there are no two
identical trees nor that zoo identical
sandwich bikes the manufacturer offers
some slightly different models and their
prices range from 1040 to $1,600
String bike the creators of this bicycle
are sure that the bicycle chain is a
technology of the last century and it's
time to replace it so for the rotation
the wheels on the string bike a unique
and special mechanism with nylon ropes
is used when the pedals are pushed the
ropes are stretched winding and
unwinding alternately on pulley is
located on both sides of the rear axle
this balance system allows for greater
smoothness and efficiency when traveling
the string bike travels much faster and
easier than any other traditional
bicycle it should be noted that changing
the chain for a nylon rope also reduces
the amount of noise emitted by the bike
when you travel you'll only hear the
crunching of the tires on the asphalt
and nothing else
other notable features of the string
bike include a 19 gear speed system
gears can be changed in motion with the
help of the same rope the bike has an
asymmetrical design so that the rider
can achieve as much torque as possible
regardless of the position of the pedals
the string bike series has four models
and the minimum price is $3,100
you can also buy a bicycle with a speed
for one thousand and ninety dollars
car2go riding a bicycle is an excellent
and not too difficult way to get a dose
of cardio
however the bicycle only trains a
limited set of muscles from the calves
to the buttocks but does not allow the
muscles of the upper bodies of work the
creators of this bicycle known as the
card ago decided to rectify the
situation during movement the front of
the bicycle retracts 25 centimetres so
the cyclist has to pull it towards
himself constantly this movement creates
extra tension in the muscles of the
upper body training the abdomen back and
arms therefore a trip on the car to go
is comparable to a complete workout
including a large number of muscle
groups in addition the additional parts
not only creates endurance to train the
muscles it also helps to move the bike
forward with an additional push this
allows the car to go to travel much
faster with less effort the developers
of the bicycle claim that its invention
is suitable for people of any age and
sex offering hundreds of hours of
effective training regardless of the
level of physical fitness
the resistance of the mobile front is
adjustable and has three levels by the
way at any time the card ago can turn
into a traditional bicycle to do this
you just need to turn a lever
by simple the creators of this bicycle
of thoughts about the fact that our life
becomes increasingly complex
technological and loaded with each
passing year to balance our life in some
way they decided to make the simplest
invention in the world that's how the by
simple bicycle appeared the vehicle has
a minimalist and compact design the
small size not only makes the bike more
maneuverable but it's also much easier
to store and move the bikes unique
design includes a very short detachable
frame without a chain and a unique
optimum speed externally the bike
resembles a unicycle with a front wheel
although it is far from that riding the
by simple is like riding a bicycle the
person who worked on the creation of the
model admits that if you're looking for
a fast bike that allows you to get from
point A to point B as fast as possible
the by simple is not the best choice its
creation is inspired by memories of a
happy childhood when the bike was fun
and no one was in a hurry the by simple
is not capable of developing an
impressive speed but it is an
interesting and fun vehicle the price of
the bike is eight hundred dollars
bell cycles today we've already seen a
bicycle that was not equipped with a
seat turns out that this is not the
limit and the engineers involved in
bicycle developments have gone much
further bell cycles is a unique vehicle
a bicycle that doesn't have a
traditional handlebar while driving the
user sits upright like in a chair with
the hands by the sides along the body
just below the seat is a large front
wheel at first glance bell cycles may
seem uncontrollable the lack of the
handlebar makes turns impossible however
there is a steering wheel under the seat
so you can control it without stretching
or changing your body position the model
has two traditional wheels but the rear
can also be replaced with a platform and
two wheels turning the bike into a
three-wheeled vehicle in this video the
bike shows that it's ideal for
transporting goods you can buy it for
$300
