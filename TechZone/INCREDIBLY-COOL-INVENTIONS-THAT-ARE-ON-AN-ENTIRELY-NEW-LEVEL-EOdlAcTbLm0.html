eco-friendly it doesn't pollute the
atmosphere or the soil secondly it can
cope with fire much faster than
conventional fire extinguishers
amazingly it instantly lowers the
temperature of the object that was on
fire a few seconds ago immediately after
extinguishing it you can touch the
object without getting burns eliminating
