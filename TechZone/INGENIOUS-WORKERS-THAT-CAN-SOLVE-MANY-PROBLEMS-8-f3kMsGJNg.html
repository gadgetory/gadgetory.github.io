to cover ceilings with panels fixed to
the surface with screws the panels can
be very different soundproof made of PVC
or plaster board in any case regardless
of the type of panels the work is
usually done by two people one worker
can't hold the material in the correct
position while fixing it to the ceiling
the Builder you see on the screen
doesn't face that problem though he can
work alone thanks to the use of a
special roof panel lifter the design is
quite simple but effective it's built
with ordinary wood the worker places the
panel on top of the lifter and then
turns the handle the panel ends up
pressed firmly against the ceiling note
that the builders hands remain free so
that he can immediately start fixing the
panel another advantage of the design is
that it takes up almost no space when
folded
painting the roof in order to give your
house a new and more aesthetic look you
can paint the roof of the building
however this procedure carried out in a
traditional way takes quite some time
it's also much more complicated and
dangerous than it may seem at first the
fact is that the surface of the roof
covered with slate or tile is riffled
the unevenness and cracks of the roof
make the use of a roller inefficient
it's much easier and much more
convenient to use a sprayer like the one
you see on the screen first pay
attention to the length of the tool it
is enough for the boulder to be able to
work in a comfortable position while
standing
when painting the roof with a roller in
the traditional way the worker must go
down on his knees we'd also like to
mention the high speed of the work the
surface is painted at the same speed as
the Masters hand moves as the paint is
sprayed onto the surface at a wide
powerful jet in addition the microscopic
paint droplets evenly cover the entire
surface the unevenness of the roof in
this case is not an obstacle to a
perfect coating
thermal insulation with polyurethane
foam in order for the room to be less
exposed to temperature variations and
for people to feel comfortable at any
time of the year
walls must be covered with thermal
insulation laminated cork rock walls
basalt plates these and many other types
of insulation have one thing in common
they are difficult to transport and
their installation is very
time-consuming the material is delivered
in sheets and rolls he must first be
brought into the room and then fixed to
the surface the professionals you see on
the screen have solved the problem once
and for all instead of insulating with
sheet material they chose special foam
insulation
it is a universal synthetic material
belonging to the group of gas expanded
plastic today polyurethane foam is
increasingly used in the domestic
industrial and construction sectors when
it comes to insulating buildings this
foam offers many more advantages than
traditional materials first when sprayed
the foam creates a uniform seamless
layer not only does it provide thermal
insulation but it also performs the
functions of water and sound insulation
polyurethane foam is light weight so
there's no additional load on the
structures it has no nutritional value
for rodents and other pests and it
doesn't lose its shape and does not
collapse over time phone you can easily
insulate irregular and inaccessible
areas to besides the procedure is much
faster the video shows the work done in
an attic however any element of the
building can be insulated with foam
whether it be a basement foundations
walls inside and out and ceilings
painting templates the decoration of
walls floors than any other surface with
drawings is a common technique in repair
work which is used all over the world
the problem is that not everyone has
enough skills to draw something really
beautiful on the wall on the other hand
professional artists charge a lot of
money for their work the templates you
see on the screen are a universal
solution with their help anyone can
decorate a room with a sophisticated
design the manufacturer offers a large
number of different templates
thus with their help you can create
almost any design
interestingly templates are also an
economical alternative to wallpaper and
tiles which are sometimes used to create
mosaics you will surely agree that it's
much easier to buy a template and a
couple of cans of paints than buying a
bunch of tiles or dozens of meters of
wallpaper the main thing is to be
careful and systematic during work the
template must be in close contact with
the surface so that the paint doesn't
drip off the templates are made of dense
but translucent material so that the
worker can always see exactly where the
stencil should be placed
image you building technology the system
that you can see on the screen has many
advantages with this help you can build
a variety of buildings from residential
complexes and industrial facilities to
affordable housing
the mhu provides effective thermal and
acoustic insulation at the same time the
system lacks the deficiencies of
traditional insulating materials the Mau
modular panels are made of polystyrene
foam coated on both sides with
galvanized steel wire they are
lightweight allowing the building
foundation to be lighter ie less
building material it's used the low
weight also facilitates transport and
installation of the system the
manufacturer recommends the use of emma2
in areas with high seismic activity a
lighter building with optimum resistance
and critical situations is much less
threatening to human life the material
is flame proof and blast resistant high
energy efficiency is combined with
respect for the environment to the
panels can be single or double and the
manufacturer also supplies floor and
stair panels you can even order a curved
panel
pre-stressed reinforced concrete
although concrete as a material widely
used in all construction sites around
the world
it has one significant disadvantage its
inability to withstand a significant
tensile stress this is why the
technology for the creation of
pre-stressed reinforced concrete's has
been developed if we compare the two
materials mentioned above you'll see
that they have exactly the same
resistance however the pre-stressed
material curves the less and is more
resistant to cracking the video shows
how builders produce this concrete
during the construction of a high-rise
building
the procedure is performed with steel
reinforcement which has a high tensile
strength a special device stretches the
reinforcement after which the concrete
mixture is applied once it dries the
prestressing force of the metal is
transferred to the concrete
therefore it is compressed
hey stop being lazy it's time to use
that brain of yours welcome to brain
time incredible facts from the past the
present and even the future the power of
nature and wild animals amazing facts
and unsolved mysteries you'll find all
this and much more hair
