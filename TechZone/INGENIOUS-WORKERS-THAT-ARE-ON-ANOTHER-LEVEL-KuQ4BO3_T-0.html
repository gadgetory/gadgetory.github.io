building materials including bricks is
mostly an automated process however
there are places where manual labor and
traditional methods are preferred over
specialized equipment the raw material
for making bricks is clay it would be
quicker to use an excavator to quarry it
but the workers you see on the screen
work with an ordinary hoe the soil is
taken from the walls of the pit and then
watered the worker mixes the soil with
waters who make a thick viscous clay
when its consistency is perfect they
start making bricks a special wooden
formwork is used for this the master
compacts the clay into empty cells
during this process he exerts pressure
repeatedly on the surface and smooth
sets to ensure that the mold is filled
evenly and no voids will form the edges
of the bricks must be smooth therefore
in the last stage the master flattens
them with his wet hands once the bricks
have been removed
they must be dried in a factory they
would be steam treated in special
chambers but when using this method
they're simply left in the Sun for three
days during this time the bricks Harden
but this is still not enough
they are then placed in rows so that
they can take up less space and are left
for about a month the bricks are covered
with a tarp so that the Sun won't crack
them only after that the bricks are
ready for baking
the master cuts off the excess material
from the side so that they're also flat
then they build a kiln with these bricks
and set a fire inside this heat
treatment lasts approximately 12 hours
after that the bricks are ready and have
the reddish-brown color we all know
reinforced concrete production the
stability and reliability of residential
industrial and other structures are
subject to very strict requirements the
concrete itself is a strong material but
under the influence of external factors
it can be gradually destroyed that is
why it's additionally reinforced with
iron the builders you see on the screen
make reinforcement using rods this
technique requires the creation of a
steel rod frame this frame makes it
possible to distribute the weight evenly
over the entire surface of the future
concrete piece the builders place the
frame and then pour the concrete
composition over it the layer is then
flattened however this construction site
is quite unusual this is because these
builders have chosen a special
reinforcement system called pro lock it
makes the job easier and faster the fact
is that the rods are normally fixed with
special wire or clamps
in this case the distribution bar frame
is delivered ready from the factory and
installed in a matter of minutes
larger rods along the structure are
fixed to the grid by means of a passing
set fastening system
stone cladding finishing materials are
used in construction to give surfaces a
complete and aesthetic appearance stone
cladding can be done on almost any wall
and changes its appearance drastically
builders must have design skills of
creativity and be able to put puzzles
together the work begins by laying the
insulating layer which will protect the
wood structure from moisture workers
then attach a special galvanized steel
grid to the wall surface to reinforce it
in the next stage the puzzle solving
skills we mentioned earlier will come in
handy the fact is that in this case each
stone element has a unique size and
shape that's why they're first placed on
the floor to shape the future layout
there are several rules for the correct
laying of the cladding stone for example
large stones are placed next to small
ones while thick ones are placed next to
thin ones it should be noted that the
size of the stone element if desired can
be changed
finally the wall is covered with
concrete mortar directly on top of the
mesh after this it is left for 24 hours
giving it time to dry and Harden only
then the cladding is applied Builders
wet the back of the stone apply a layer
of adhesive mortar and Adir it to the
wall the elements are placed from the
bottom up so the pattern will be exactly
the same as the one filmed on the floor
the last step is to fill in the joint
between the stones in this case to get a
more original look the resulting surface
is also painted
reinforced concrete installation the
creation of structures from
prefabricated reinforced concrete
elements is a complex process in which
manual labour is combined with machine
work in this case the builders use
special double walls they consist of two
outer layers of concrete connected by a
well bit mesh the fact is that a wall of
this type has a much lower weight than a
normal wall made only of concrete this
feature allows using cranes with low
lifting power on site and therefore
saving money during assembly the entire
weight of the reinforced concrete wall
is assumed by the crane the workers
place it in the right place and then fix
it with special supports this is a
difficult stage workers make sure that
the panels are level and strictly
perpendicular to the ground after
installation the space in the reinforced
concrete structure is filled with
concrete
the result is a monolithic wall
resistance to external factors
footpath repair these experts use paving
techniques to give the backyard of a
house and absolutely new and stylish
look they lift the old concrete slabs to
put the new ones in place the repair
takes much less time than creating a
path from scratch this is because there
is already a base beneath the old slabs
that is suitable for paving the surface
is covered with a layer of stone chips
the worker distributes them carefully so
that the material to be applied
afterwards is distributed evenly the
chips are then additionally compacted
with a board notes that stones used are
unusual the stones are connected to each
other by a special grid this ingenious
designer saves time instead of laying
each stone individually the future path
is divided into sections the stone
structure on the mesh can be reduced if
this is necessary to adjust the size of
the section before laying the stone
structure a layer of cement is applied
over the stamp chips the stones are then
placed and forced into the cement when
the entire path is paved the only thing
left is filling the cavities between the
stones with a special mix
underfloor heating finally we will show
you a unique way to install a heated
floor the tiles which normally cover the
floor are heated by the cables
underneath the electrical system is
better than the water heating system
because it allows you to adjust the
temperature traditionally the cable is
fixed to the ground with a stapler in
this case the master uses special ditra
heat membranes it's really easy to cover
the entire floor surface with them even
if the room has a complex shape the
membranes are cut with a knife or
scissors to the desired size the cables
are then placed on the surface using a
flat spatula but they can also be placed
manually these membranes help to lay the
cable in flat lines keeping them as an
exact distance from each other

present and even the future the power of
