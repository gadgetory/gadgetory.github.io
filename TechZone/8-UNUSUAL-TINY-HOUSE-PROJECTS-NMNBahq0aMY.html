a low-cost sustainable building that can
easily be built anywhere

shelters by its unusual hexagonal shape
as well as the availability of
electricity and water
solar panels on a roof provide lighting
and power for appliances and according
to the developers the hexagonal shape of
the roof makes it possible to maximize
the performance of the panels the sun's
rays fall on the photovoltaic battery
from three different sites throughout
the day rainwater is collected through
the built-in gutter and enters the tank
through a drainage pipe with a hand pump
water can be obtained for domestic use
according to the developers these
services make people's lives more
comfortable
the hacks house is designed for
long-term use from 15 to 20 years it can
be dismantled at three parts and is
easily transported to any location
assembling the construction is not
difficult and only simple tools are
needed the main parts such as the wall
and ceiling panels are connected to each
other using built-in slots in addition
the house will install separately or
combine in special beehives forming a
welcoming community therefore the hex
house is suitable even for the
construction of temporary villages
