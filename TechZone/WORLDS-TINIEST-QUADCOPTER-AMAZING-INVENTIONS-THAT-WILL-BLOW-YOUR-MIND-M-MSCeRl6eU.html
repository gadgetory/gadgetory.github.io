this quadrocopter can fly almost
anywhere the jet jet ultra has a
built-in controller which allows you to
broadcast live and to see what the drone
sees in real time in addition the drone
is equipped with built-in LED lamps so
it can fly even in the dark the device
is equipped with three convenient modes
of flight sensitivity which makes it
Universal for primary secondary and high
level pilots jet jet ultra has four
rotors with adjustable sensitivity of
the gyro this allows the quadrocopter to
maneuver in the air with a high level of
stability and accuracy the range of
control of this drone is up to a hundred
meters and the flight time is about five
minutes it's worth noting that the jet
jet ultra charges via USB in just thirty
minutes
kilobots the self-organizing systems
research group at Harvard University
presented the kilo box swarm which
consists of a thousand and twenty four
kilowatts of about three centimeters in
diameter
they can be lined up in different
two-dimensional figures without the help
of a human being
each kilobyte is a device that's powered
by 3.4 volt battery the robots have
three rigidly fixed legs with two
vibration motors the kilobots
communicate with the legs using infrared
signals which are perceived by all
nearest neighbors of the robot that
emitted the signal according to the
developers the behavioral model of
robots is limited to four types of
commands grouping gradient formation
calculation at the distance from the
starting point and localization in
addition each micro robot monitors the
position of its nearest neighbors
Oh's Oh bot the main feature of this
miniature robot is its control in order
to control the movements of the ozo bots
you just have to draw lines with a
marker in different directions and the
device will follow them on the side
there's a single control button that
turns the device on and off and guides
it by holding it's in calibration mode
on the bottom of the robot there are
special photo sensors responsible for
recognizing the colors and lines by
which the arrow bot moves on its wheels
markers are also designed to create
color coats for the robot ozobot average
price is about $50 and it's programmed
for different actions such as turns
zigzags and other movements therefore in
order to make the robot act you need to
give it a signal the wallet drone this
quadrocopter which cost less than $40 is
one of the smallest in the world it's 4
centimeters wide and about 1.5
centimeters tall the device can be used
almost anywhere in the flying time of
this quadrocopter is from 5 to 7 minutes
after a full 20 minute charge and you
can charge it using a USB cable or from
4 batteries in the docking station the
device has three preset speed modes the
possibility of free rotation around the
vertical axis gyro stabilization on six
axes as well as a trick mode that allows
the drone to make rolls and loops easier
kino a team of scientists from the
massachusetts institute of technology
developed a new kind of intelligence
accessory which they call living jewelry
while a person wears them they move they
change their appearance and create new
patterns on the fabric Kino is a set of
miniature robots that move around the
clothing with magnets and perform
various functions for example they
change the appearance of your outfit by
moving the scarf or changing the
position on the clothes
within each robot there's a sensor that
allows it to adjust to the situation the
movement of the robot is connected to
the pattern of the fabric the living
jewelry is able to recognize the pattern
and the route thanks to the inside of
the fabric another function of these
intelligence accessories is the ability
to create new patterns on the fabric
itself for example on velvet robots
leave visible paths while moving on us
clothing acquires a new pattern
robo bees Walmart company presented
these autonomous robotic bees which
technically can be called unmanned
aerial vehicles Robo bees can pollinate
different plants in the same way that
bees in nature do miniature drones carry
pollen from one plant to another using
sensors and cameras to locate crops Robo
bees are able to artificially pollinate
crop fields at absolutely any time it
should be noted that this Walmart
creation also has a remote control and
automatic pollen detection
ma be designer Adrienne Perez the Potter
created an automatic system for house
cleaning Maya is a bowl filled with
water and a chemical agent the device
scans the premises determines where the
cleaning is needed and sends the flying
robots to the task the cleaning solution
is distributed among 908 miniature
robots equipped with propellers having
received all the necessary materials the
miniature devices are sent in search of
places of accumulation of dust and dirt
the many robots clean the surface with a
touch wetting it with a drop of water
and grabbing dirt particles as a result
everything collected by the robots is
transferred to the ball it's worth
noting that these autonomous devices are
powered by solar energy through the
solar cells on the wings also according
to the idea of the author map can be
programmed for different cleaning cycles
and synchronized with mobile devices
sky pica the company TRND labs created a
drone that weighs only seven grams the
length of one side of this drone is only
two point two centimeters the sky pico
which costs about $50 is designed for
children and beginners rather than for
fans of aerial photography the device is
controlled by ready-to-fly technology
and has three levels of sensitivity the
four rotor drone not only can rise and
fall up and down but the sky Pico has a
six axis stabilization and the
sensitivity of the gyroscope is adjusted
automatically the console controls the
device and the maximum flying distance
is 50 meters the drone has a built-in 80
million power battery which is enough
for about 8 minutes of flight
spero mini this device is a high-tech
robot ball which can be controlled using
a smartphone or tablet the peculiarity
of the model is that the ball can be
used as a controller in various video
games in addition the user can
independently write code for the Sphero
mini using the special applications Faro
edge you using it you can program the
robot using java the device is
controlled by an iOS or Android
smartphone using wireless bluetooth with
a range of up to 10 meters you can
control the movements of Severo from the
application in two ways manually drawing
a path on the screen of your mobile
device or using the function of face
drive for this the application uses the
front camera of the smartphone the
system recognizes the facial expression
and the position of the user's head and
depending on this the ball changes
direction
Revell nano quad there's another small
device a light quadrocopter weighing
only 12 grams the nano cord is equipped
with an electric motor four rotors and
you can control the flights at this
drone with the help of the remote
control the model has a battery capacity
of about a hundred million powers which
provides a maximum flight time of about
five minutes at the same time the range
is about 50 meters the Revell nano quad
can also be used in the dark as the
device is equipped with a case lighting
