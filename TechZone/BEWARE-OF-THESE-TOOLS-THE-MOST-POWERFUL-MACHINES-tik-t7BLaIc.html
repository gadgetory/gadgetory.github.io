storm drains and discharge pipes are
integral parts of the drainage system of
any modern city allowing its who quickly
cope with the effects of precipitation
thanks to them water does not have a
devastating impact on the surface of the
road and it will last longer the problem
is that all drains and pipes get blocked
up at some point
their maintenance and cleaning is a
dirty and difficult job that's why
people invented the equipment you see on
the screen the 1500 s electric drain
Jetta from the British company more
clean is a device that quickly and
efficiently removes even complex clocks
of dirt its efficiency is guaranteed by
powerful water jets spraying in four
directions one forwards
the other three sideways the equipment
can be used to clean pipes with a
diameter ranging from 45 to 110
millimetres when folded the device fits
in the trunk of any car also the device
works almost silently
qf compacts this is probably the most
compact laser cleaning machine on the
market manufactured by the Belgian
company P laser the cleaning technology
is environmentally friendly and energy
efficient qf compact can remove rust
from a metal surface it can clean stone
and can be used for the maintenance of
casting and compression molds the device
also removes paints or other similar
coatings from the surface it can be used
to decrease any surface before applying
a d6 and paints the laser will also be
indispensable even in industrial scale
food preparation facilities allowing the
user to clean the surface of stoves and
ovens quickly and efficiently despite
its many advantages laser cleaning
technology has not yet become really
common probably because it's relatively
new the surface is cleaned by
irradiating it with a laser beam it's
energy causes dirt and other
contamination to evaporate while the
surface remains intact that is why the
qf compact can be used for cleaning
metal elements building stones cement
plastic glass ceramics etcetera in
addition the machine runs quietly it
doesn't require the use of consumables
and does not produce any waste
SolidCAM complex metal parts such as
wheel rims and casting moles are
manufactured on CNC lathes and milling
machines when processing a workpiece the
equipment knows exactly what shape it
needs to be and what has to be done to
achieve the desired result that's
because the machine operates according
to a CNC code special tools such as the
Solid camp application are used to
create such programs all the machines
you see on the screen have been
programmed using this complex system the
program supports a wide variety of metal
processing methods such as index seola
simultaneous multi-sided machining
high-speed surfacing turning and turning
milling processing and electro erosive
processing solid cam is designed for
enterprises where metal parts are
manufactured on a commercial scale the
user can create and assemble a machining
template and then use it repeatedly the
cutter will perform the specified
operation over and over again creating
identical parts these systems are
particularly highly demanded in the
electrical engineering electronics
automotive and machine building
industries
c20 hydraulic splitter the German
company Dada specializes in the
production of demolition equipment the
video shows the operation of the C 20
hydraulic rock splitter it can be used
on construction sites including civil
mining and marine projects
traditionally explosions have been used
to dismantle structures and split large
boulders drilling and blasting is a
dangerous complex and dirty job though
the C 20 hydraulic splitter can do most
of the demolition job without needing to
carry out blasting operations too often
the equipment supplies 1,500 to 1,800
tons of splitting force on the surface
thanks to this it can be used to drill
tunnels dig trenches and carry out
excavations the C 20 hydraulic splitter
is a revolutionary way to break rocks
you don't have to worry about the
shockwave excessive vibrations noise or
dusts that such equipment usually
produces the installation process is
simple and fast it's recommended to use
it in combination with five ton
excavators or bigger equipment can also
work in water
vacuum master vacuum lifts and
manipulators can be used to optimize
gripping handling and positioning the
objects you can use for example the
device you see on the screen the video
shows the work of the vacuum Uster basic
however the German manufacturer schmaltz
offers a number of other models to solve
a variety of problems the load capacity
of the vacuum a stir basic depends on
the equipment the most powerful version
of the equipment can lift objects
weighing up to 750 kilograms the device
is equipped with a vacuum generator an
audible warning device a vacuum gauge
and a motor protection switch these
components are placed in a robust metal
casing which guarantees safe operation
and extends the operating cycle vacuum
master is ideal to move really heavy
oversized objects the vacuum suction
cups keep the object balanced to all the
operator controls the movement and
transportation
drum cutter DC mm the equipment you see
on the screen is perfect when you need
to break down a concrete wall dismantle
a structure or level a surface is also
used for trench digging frozen soil
excavation and mining operations in
summary this is a powerful efficient and
most importantly multifunctional tool
the Swedish company Atlas Copco
manufactures the drum cutter DC mm the
machine can be used in situations where
traditional methods of material
processing are ineffective or when it is
difficult to achieve the desired results
with impact systems it's noteworthy that
the cutter can be used underwater at a
depth of up to 30 meters no additional
equipment is required the machine's
features include low noise and vibration
levels
thermos tea here's another amazing tool
created by more clean we've already
mentioned this company at the beginning
of the video thermos steam is also
designed for cleaning tasks however in
this case it's done using high-pressure
steam instead of water it is the perfect
tool so remove graffiti from walls
however in addition to this task thermos
team can remove ingrained dirt on bricks
or concrete interestingly the steam is
powerful enough to remove Moss dirt and
paint at the same time it's delicate
enough to not damage the surface
underneath thermos steam is
environmentally friendly and safe no
chemicals or solvents are required the
steam cleaner has a relatively low water
consumption rate to about 5 liters per
minute for comparison other cleaners use
from 15 to 20 litres of water per minute
thermos steams water tank can hold 500
litres of water so you can work non-stop
for a long time
