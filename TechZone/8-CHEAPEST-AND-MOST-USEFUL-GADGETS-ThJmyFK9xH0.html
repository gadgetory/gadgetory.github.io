fortunately most tools are made of metal
specialists from Texas worked on this
problem and came up with a simple
solution to this complex problem their
invention is the mag pad it's a flexible
pad with a scratch resistant coating but
the most important feature is a rather
powerful magnets with two useful
properties firstly it can be attached to
almost any surface of the car and
secondly it reliably keeps the tools in
place not allowing them to fall or
interfere at work interestingly enough
the magnets power is enough to keep the
tools hanging in a horizontal position
