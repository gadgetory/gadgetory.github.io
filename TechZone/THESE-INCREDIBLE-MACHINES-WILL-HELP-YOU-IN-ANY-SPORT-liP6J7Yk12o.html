golf your goal is to use clubs to drive
special little balls into holes they're
usually 20 centimeters deep and have
special holding chips inside this is a
machine that allows you to make holes of
the needed size and depth in the ground
in a matter of seconds that soul is
equipped with a fixing mechanism ez
ratchet and it's made of very durable
material and reduces the effort you have
to apply by 50% thanks to its super
sharp blade and smooth surface the tool
penetrates the ground without condensing
the soil the holes turn out perfectly
smooth and neat and the extra soil
doesn't fall out of the instrument and
doesn't stain the field
every B MSI protocol cutter is designed
and manufactured at the plant in Luton
England it cost a little less than $1000
it's noteworthy that for different types
of soil different tools are used they
differ in their power and sharpness
which is quite logical since it's much
harder to make a hole in the ground in
the winter when the soil is frozen than
in summer so the tool must have a higher
capacity tena bot tennis is a very
popular game worldwide people love it
because of the amazing feeling of
triumph when you finally get it right
however to learn to make a perfect serve
you have to practice a lot which means
lots and lots of tennis balls scattered
around the court so when the cool part
which is training ends you start the
tedious routine of collecting the balls
the creators of tena BOTS wanted to
offer tennis fans something that would
make their life easier and the time
spent on the court more enjoyable
Santa bot is the world's first
intelligent robot specially designed to
collect all the balls it has a compact
design and provides great
maneuverability it moves independently
on the court finding the balls and
collecting them into a special tank
enough for 80 bores
the robot could be programmed to switch
on independently at a certain time that
you can set or you can turn it on when
necessary using the mobile app or the
SmartWatch interestingly the Tenny bot
not only collects the balls but it also
keeps track of workouts and runs its own
schedule which is available at any time
the battery lasts for four to five hours
despite the fact that charging only
takes 90 minutes one of its advantages
is its portability the handle allows you
to carry the robot as if he were a
suitcase in addition the balls can stay
inside during transportation so you
don't have to take them out
it's a flying machine there's quite a
large number of companies that
specialize in making sports surfacing
this is a complex process that requires
trained people and a large number of
different specialized equipment the most
well-known company engaged in production
of such equipment is SMG based in
Germany the company has the following
machines the sand Matic B 1505 is an
automatic machine which evenly dispenses
sand or granulated rubber over
artificial grass the turf roller is a
device for transporting and uncoiling
rolls of artificial grass the simplicity
and efficiency of operation are provided
by a hydraulic lift turf set is a set of
tools used for professional grass lane
turf can be laid both on asphalt and
sand and gravel base for best results
it's crucial to use a firm smooth based
surface
it allows you to avoid bends and bumps
on the launch surface the coils are laid
end-to-end and then glued together and
this goes in the following way the edges
of the lawn are then folded back and
then a special glue is put on the bottom
when it dries up the edges are lowered
then the seam is processed by a roller
when the lawn is lays they start making
the markings for this purpose strips are
cut from the grass and then replaced by
other grass painted white the result is
a smooth seamless surface ideal for
sports stadiums it is noteworthy that
with the help of such equipment you can
also create a golf course tennis court
machines as during the construction of a
tennis court a huge number of very
different equipment is used we'll show
you just the building process this video
demonstrates the renovation of old
tennis courts located on the territory
of one of the schools in Dublin Ireland
the construction begins with the most
common excavator passing on the ground
to dig a pit no deeper than 60
centimeters then the dimensions of the
future field are measured to create a
perfect shape special laser equipment is
used it helps to mark the perimeter as
precisely as possible the edges that the
future courts are framed by a wooden
fence then two layers of polyethylene
film are laid on the base
the whole structure together with a
cable bridge which performs the function
of internal drainage will be the frame
the concrete base the mixture is brought
by a special truck equipped with a mixer
it's necessary to stir the liquid
asphalt mix during transportation so
that it doesn't thicken
the court is poured with concrete
flattened out and a week later when the
surface is hard enough they proceed to
the construction of the fence it usually
doesn't require any specialized
equipment later at least 28 days after
the concrete placement the surface is
ground and prepared for primer and paint
coated with a special emulsion and
waterproofing basketball shooting
machine during training players don't
always divide into teams and compete
with each other
there is a special equipment designed to
help improve the skills of catching the
ball and getting it into the hoop what
you see here is a small machine
developed by the company dr. desh
basketball it's an excellent solution
for the preparation and training process
of both players and coaches it's
installed near the basket and a special
mesh is put on top the player throws the
ball in the basket from where the ball
gets into the machine
during operation is continuously
rotating to shoot the balls in a random
direction the players task during
training is to catch the balls and throw
them into the hoop another option is to
place the device over the hoop in this
case the task becomes more difficult the
player has to catch the ball throw it
into the hoop and then throw it again
this time into the machine
it is noteworthy that some advanced
models can connect to mobile
applications and show the efficiency of
you training how many attempts were made
and how many balls in total hit the
target it also comes with a special
sensor that monitors the physical
condition of the person counts the
heartbeats and also tracks and shows
other important information</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
