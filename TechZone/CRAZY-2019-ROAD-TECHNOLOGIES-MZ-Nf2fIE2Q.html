drivers or pedestrians know that driving
in the dark in poor light is dangerous
and can a serious and very unpleasant
consequences this is why huge sums of
money are spent every year on lighting
roads with lanterns it's therefore
logical that humanity should begin to
think of alternative ways of lighting
streets that are safe economical and
environmentally friendly
one such method is the use of paint that
glows in the dark the idea is that the
surface treated with a special compound
accumulates light during the day as the
darkness falls the energy stored is
released in the formula delicates but at
the same time noticeable below it
doesn't blind it doesn't affect the
environment but it increases the level
of Road Safety it should be noted that
the luminous markings allow the driver
to see the road well even if there are
no lanterns at all
you can already find similar roads in
some countries around the world for
example the m3 2/9 Road in the
Netherlands has been illuminated in this
way since 2014
interestingly it's possible to
illuminate not only the roads but also
the sidewalks in the pathways for
example at 2017 Singapore launched a
pilot projects in which 100 metres of
pedestrian walkway were covered with
strontium aluminate although this road
is not illuminated by lanterns in the
dark it's clearly visible so people can
feel safe the project is still under
development and in the future a park
with 24 kilometers of illuminated
footpaths will be created a similar
sidewalk can also be found in the UK at
Victoria Park in Cambridge as well as in
Denmark and the province of north ribbit
rides that honk
for the vast majority of people the hunk
of a car is quite unpleasant to sharp
and associated with some catastrophe
although this Sun does accompany traffic
accidents in India on the Jammu Srinagar
Highway it has been successfully saving
lives for several years the fact is that
this road is one of the most dangerous
in the world sets on the mountain it's
built in a zigzag shape with a large
number of steep and sharp curves behind
each of them there can be a danger
hidden in the form of another vehicle
going at full speed if the car goes off
the road the driver has almost no chance
of survival the slope of the mountain is
too high and too steep
fortunately local company HP lubricants
has proposed a solution that can reduce
the number of traffic accidents on the
jammer Srinagar highway smart radar
poles were installed on both sides of
each turn they emit electromagnetic
waves and continuously measure their
length when a car or truck is nearby the
waves collide with the surface and the
wavelength changes
thanks to this change the intelligent
Pole realizes that a vehicles heading
towards it on the road and the pole on
one side of the turn is connected to the
pole on the other side therefore when
both detect movement a strong signal is
activated for all drivers when they hear
it
drivers know they need to slow down and
be careful when turning despite the
simplicity of the design these system
works and actually makes the road safer
wind turbine lanterns we have already
talked about how important it is to find
new and better ways to illuminate the
streets of the cities technologies for
obtaining electricity from the Sun and
air aren't new and are used more and
more often however it's only recently
these technologies have been used for
street lighting these are lanterns that
don't need power stations to operate
this is because each of them is equipped
with a windmill which allows it to
generate electricity
with movement
according to the Creator the system has
many advantages please include an
elaborate design durability resistance
to strong gusts of wind and low
operating costs distinctive features
include the design of the mill but
rotates independently of the direction
of the air the blades capture wind 360
degrees unlike traditional horizontal
axis wind turbines in addition the mill
operates even if the wind speed is very
low and the operating rate is 1.9 meters
it should be noted that the system
stores electricity during a windy day
the lanterns generate enough electricity
to run for two days without wind today
this technology is very popular in China
but other developed countries are
gradually beginning to implement it
asphalt paving road construction is a
complex and time-consuming process in
which many different methods can be
found they differ in cost duration of
work as well as in the equipment's and
techniques used in the process only the
work carried out at a professional level
allows us to obtain a reliable
high-quality and long-lasting pavement
this video shows the laying of asphalt
by Chinese workers the use of special
equipment and the high qualification of
the employees make you possible to cope
with the tasks in the Shores as possible
time
this process is interesting because the
dump truck and the paver move
synchronously with the same speed so
that the pavement is placed very quickly
but without sacrificing quality
erode Arlanda although the first
electric car appeared even before the
internal combustion engine
ie in 1828 for many decades these
vehicles were not in demand only in the
21st century could people fully
appreciate the advantages of vehicles
that use electricity to drive now we
just need a little improvement to make
people's lives easier and make charging
electric cars simpler faster and more
efficient in April 2018 for example it
became known that Sweden had built the
world's first electric road
it's unique feature is that the
construction allows passenger vehicles
and even trucks to charge on the go the
principle of the road isn't too
complicated either under the roadway at
a depth of five to six centimeters
special underground rail is connected to
an energy source for laid for the car to
start charging it's necessary to extend
the manipulator at the bottom of the
vehicle and connect it to the rails if
the car is overtaking or leaving the
rails for any other reason the
manipulator automatically disconnects it
should be noted that the system is
absolutely safe for animals and humans
according to the developer there is no
electricity on the surface and the
charging process is similar to that of
an electrical outlet
electricity is only received by the plug
whose function is before by the
manipulator experiments have shown that
even if the road is filled with salt
water which has a high conductivity the
level of electricity on the surface will
increase very little this means that you
can even walk barefoot on such a road
the project is still under development
erode our Lander is now only 2
kilometers long and is located near
Stockholm of course the system is not
free either the system automatically
calculates the charge of the car so that
the owner then receives the bill
hey stop being lazy it's time to use
that brain of yours welcome to brain
time incredible facts from the past the
present and even the future the power of
nature and wild animals amazing facts
and unsolved mysteries you'll find all
this and much more hair subscribe now
