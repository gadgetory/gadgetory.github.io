is a long painstaking process and a lot
of people are involved in it first
artists draw sketches of the exterior
and interior then they're transfer to a
computer improved using additional
effects and a model is created with the
help of a 3d scanner if there are no
more changes the most interesting part
of the process begins the manual
creation of a clay model experts say
that this process is similar to the
creation of a sculpture a team works for
several weeks their task is to create a
real sized prototype which would help
the designers understand how the
finished car will look like
this method is used by almost all modern
car manufacturers such as Aldi Volvo and
Ferrari the video shows the creation of
a Porsche clay prototype interestingly
this stage in the production hasn't
changed in 60 years the volume of work
is enormous and during the process of
process I think the shape of the car can
change each company spends up to 90 tons
of clay per year
finally the specialists finish their
work then factory workers create the
most complicated parts of the car body
also some elements such as glass are
produced with the help of machines they
are applied over the clay prototype
the body is then covered with a
protective film and painted all this
just to show it in the design center
experts assess the finished car from all
sides and in different lighting
conditions
road surface marking Jove echo markings
manufactures thermoplastic forms that
are applied to the asphalt quickly and
relatively easily they used when it's
necessary to mark a road a parking lot a
warehouse complex a school or in
adjacent territory the manufacturer's
catalog contains the most common road
markings for example children and
general caution it's noteworthy that
road markings are performed by people
signs like the ones you see on the
screen are hand-painted by workers first
the form is applied to the right place
and outlined this is necessary in order
to determine the work area next the
primer is applied to the delineated area
and a thin layer to better fix the shape
the last step of marking is heating the
form thermoplastic melts under the
influence of heat and is sprinkled on
top with glass chips if all stages have
been executed correctly and accurately
as in this case the form is securely
added to the surface of the road
stamped concrete in order for a wall to
have an aesthetically appealing coating
you don't have to spend money on
expensive facing materials today good
masters with the right equipments are
able to imitate a stone surface on
concrete the work is carried out in two
stages first the master applies a dense
even layer of concrete to the surface as
long as the material is wet it is
malleable enough you can then give it
almost any shape you can see how the
worker applies a special stamp to the
wet concrete its inner surface is
embossed and the pattern imitates the
natural pattern of the stone if the
master works carefully and is not in a
hurry it's almost impossible to
distinguish such a wall from real stone
in order for the finished surface to
look more plausible the worker sprinkles
the forward dry dye it sticks to the wet
surface and doesn't crumble when it
dries out it is noteworthy that the
stamp can take almost any shape in the
same way it's possible to imitate for
example bricks or wooden panels
fluid acrylic painting recently it has
become fashionable when the paint
chooses on its own what kind of picture
it will turn out to be it may seem that
the person does almost nothing only
pause the paint and spin for canvas
however in fact acrylic painting is much
more complicated than it may seem at
first plants to get a really beautiful
picture you need to be able to combine
colors choosing the right proportions
you also need to know when to stop which
way to turn the canvas to make the paint
spill in the most interesting way to to
create such paintings special polymeric
emulsion is used called fluid acrylics
the composition includes water and
pigment bound together with acrylic
resin
depending on the density of the paint's
it can imitate painting with watercolor
or oil for the paintings you see on the
screen the artist has chosen liquid
acrylic paint the technique is known as
fluid acrylic to create particularly
beautiful drawings masters use a variety
of techniques for example they add soapy
water to create beautiful lines or use
gas torches to make the surface bubble
would sculptures creating sculptures out
of wood is a complex painstaking process
just like creating sculptures from any
other material softwoods are usually
chosen for this purpose with the help of
cutters knives and chisels people give
small logs the right shape they
described a method is the simplest and
requires relatively low energy
consumption masters who want to show
their high level of skill and strength
choose another technique they use a much
more sophisticated tool an electric
chainsaw
just imagine how difficult it is to give
would elegant shapes using an electric
tool and yes real masters can cope with
this task take a look at how a bulky saw
in the hands of a sculptor performs the
most accurate work not only the general
outlines are sharpened but also small
patterns and reliefs as a rule huge wood
stumps are used as work pieces before
the craftsman starts sculpting
he removes the bark and assesses the
quality of the wood then he soars off
large pieces of wood and only then
begins the painstaking work the final
touches are then made with gas torches
grinders paint and varnish
autistic glassblowing the last craft we
will show you today is valuable because
masters work with dangerous materials
and tools the technique of artistic
glassblowing shown here involves the use
of furnaces in which Colossus eats at at
temperatures ranging from seven hundred
to one thousand four hundred and eighty
degrees Celsius of course any even the
slightest mistake can lead to a burn
when the glass mass becomes soft and
supple different techniques of formation
are used for example the material is
rolled first so that the edges are even
then they use a blowing technique the
master holds the glass on a special
hollow tube through which he blows air
into the glass lump under the pressure
that the air creates the glass then
changes its shape the walls become
thinner
different tools are then used to give
the glass a more precise shape the glass
is pulled out and squeezed with special
pliers the technique is somewhat
reminiscent of the creation of clay pots
the glass workpiece is constantly
rotated and pressurized to change your
shape if it's necessary to add
additional parts they heat up new pieces
of glass and attach them to the
workpiece another technique is pressing
molten glass is placed in a special mold
to give the surface a texture the master
who creates a truly complex piece of
glass combines different techniques only
in this way is it possible to achieve
unique strange shapes glass is an
amazingly flexible material that allows
for making figures of almost any shape
it can even be painted for this purpose
in the manufacture of glass die is added
in the quartz sound</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
