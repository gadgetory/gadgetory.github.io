developed by specialists from the
electric transport laboratory at Keio
University in Tokyo led by Professor
Hiroshi Shimizu the name Alika is an
acronym that stands for electric
lithium-ion car this 8 wheeled electric
car was first shown to the public in
2005 with a presentation at the Tokyo
Motor Show in addition to its let's say
very original appearance the car has a
number of very interesting features for
example the engineers installed eight
electric motors on it one for each wheel
each of them makes 80 horsepower
therefore the car has 640 horsepower
also they installed lithium ion
batteries with a capacity of 55 kilowatt
hours by the way this part of the car is
one of the most expensive AC battery
cells and four blocks represent 30% of
its cost it takes 10 hours to fully
charge the Alika it's noteworthy that a
household power supplier can be use for
tragic apart from that the cars are
fairly standard design inside the car
can accommodate four people including
the driver and weighs twenty four
hundred kilograms the elite car goes
from nought to 100 km/h in 4.1 seconds
during the tests in 2004 on a special
rooting isolate the electric car managed
to reach a speed of 370 kilometers per
hour
Reliant Robin
to put it mildly driving this
three-wheeled car is not for everyone a
person who is not accustomed to such
vehicles will try it once and probably
give up it may seem that the Reliant
Robin is a car created by some crazy
experimental engineer it's hard to
believe that from 1953 to 1973 it was
mass produced by Reliant Motors in
Tamworth in the UK moreover during all
those years the Reliant Robin was very
popular especially among the miners from
the northern parts of the country part
of the reason is that despite looking
like a car in the UK the Reliant Robin
is considered and operated like a
motorcycle
due to its tricycle construction and a
weight of about 700 kilograms many
miners didn't have a driving licence so
they were inside so to use motorcycles
but not cars in winter it gets very cold
in the north of England so the Reliant
Robin helped the miners in a different
because of its low weight the vehicle
didn't get stuck at the snow so you
didn't waste time cleaning snow off the
car and had only to get in and go today
this car occupies a special place in the
culture of the country and is considered
a symbol of British eccentricity
Myers motors nng serial production of
this original and very compact electric
car began in 1999 initially that company
Corbin Motors was producing them so the
cars were known as the Corbin Sparra
unfortunately much fewer copies than the
creator expected were sold
therefore in 2004 financial difficulties
forced the company to sell the
manufacturing rights they were purchased
by Myers motors that's when the electric
car got its modern name the Myers motors
nmg this is a three-wheeled single-seat
vehicle the abbreviation nm G stands for
no more gas the maximum speed that this
small car can develop is a hundred and
twelve pollicis per hour the energy of a
single charge is enough for the Myers
motors nmg to overcome a distance
between 32 and 64 kilometers the cars
that have been produced since 2009 are
equipped with an improved lithium
battery it increases the range of the
car almost twice of to 97 kilometres
p45 the inspiration for the creation of
this crazy car was the peel p50 a
three-wheeled car which is considered
one of the smallest vehicles on the
planet only one person and luckily one
bag will fit inside the car you see on
the screen has even smaller dimensions
than the peel p50 so it was renamed as
the p45 interestingly the idea of its
creation belongs to Jeremy Clarkson an
English TV presenter and journalist
first known for its Top Gear show
Jeremy's kidding
this little guy even has a GPS navigator
for a wipers but don't forget to take
them with you because the GPS is in your
phone and you can use a glass scraper as
a wiper is also interesting that the p45
can be refueled without even getting up
from the driver's seat the only problem
is that the capacity of the fuel tank is
only one point six liters while usually
you have to buy at least two litres at
the station although it is legal to
drive this vehicle on the road the
driver admits that it is quite scary to
do so especially on roads and highways
with busy traffic the maximum speed of
the p45 is only 34 km/h not too fast but
you can save some time when searching
for a parking place according to
Jeremy's calculations the creation of
this car costs 4000 pounds sterling
which is about 5,300 dollars
the Brubaker box the idea of creating
this KITT car belongs to California
resident Curtis Brubaker just in case
let's make it clear that a KITT car is a
vehicle that's assembled manually either
by the buyer or though can entrust the
task to a third party the creator of the
car has always believed that a vehicle
should be practical in this regard he
was satisfied with the Volkswagen
minibuses so he decided to modernize
their concept on the frame which the man
designed himself he attached factory
units from the Volkswagen Type 2 he also
strengthened the suspension to increase
the ground clearance and the result was
kind of a crossover the body consists of
13 separate parts a unique feature of
the car is the only dual that moves is
on the rocket site the Brubaker box was
first shown to the public in 1972 during
the international motorsport show in Los
Angeles
Brubaker was going to start mass
production and sell each car at a price
of about $4,000 but instead of the
planned 400 cars they had time to
produce only 100 the company created by
Brubaker went bankrupt due to problems
with investors
the rover James the last car - oh you
today is intended for one particular
category of drivers the elderly every
detail of this waiver James car is
designed to meet their needs
for example the passenger and driver's
seat covers are made of waterproof
material in case of any unexpected
incident the standard rear seats were
removed in replace with comfortable cozy
chairs which of course were then
equipped with seat belts note the
special handles attach the rear doors to
the passengers can lean on them when
guessing in or out of the car or some
old people often find it difficult to
park therefore there's no rear bumper it
soared and the car is also equipped with
a special airbag when you park in
Reverse it opens when an obstacle is too
close interestingly the rover Jones
doesn't even make it necessary to bend
over straining the weak joints to load
the wheelchair into the trunk it can be
attached to the back of the car there is
a bright lamp in the cabin - to help see
better it's no coincidence that the
front bumper is so strangely shaped in
order to simplify the parking procedure
the idea of creating this car also
belongs to Jeremy Clarkson already
mentioned today as well as Richard
Hammond another Top Gear host the basis
of the Roger James is the Fiat Multipla
2006
