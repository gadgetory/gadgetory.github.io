VR glasses and helmets appeared on the
market manufacturers around the world
began to actively work on technologies
that would allow us to immerse in the
virtual world even more fully the
manufacturers of the axon VR exosuit
device understood that the first desire
of a person who's found himself in the
virtual world is to interact with it
however early technologies didn't allow
full interaction so the idea of creating
a VR exoskeleton appeared
acts on VR exosuit is lightweight it
weighs about the same as your standard
clothes however it allows you to
interact with objects in virtual reality
touch them feel their size shape and
even hardness
moreover the developers supplied the
exoskeleton with the system that even
allows you to understand whether an
object is cold warm or hot in addition
the exoskeleton allows the user to truly
walk while playing and not just move at
one place as it usually happens with the
axon VR exosuit you can walk climb
stairs and kick objects as it reacts to
even the slightest movements
viii are free the device which will now
show you is also based on the idea of
making the interaction between humans
and virtual reality as natural as
possible VR free is a glove with sensors
the independently register the movements
of the palms and also the fingers
allowing you to use your hands fully in
virtual reality VR free gloves are so
accurate that you can even play musical
instruments with them just like in real
life the developers say that the main
advantage of the VR free system is that
you don't need much time to learn the
interaction is absolutely natural and
simple and the user has the opportunity
not only to play for a character in the
game but to be one of them if you wish
the VR free system is compatible with
all modern virtual reality glasses and
costs around $400
Clau most modern controllers for VR
systems have an uncomfortable design and
quite limited functionality they're
difficult to handle and very often the
game causes you more anger than pleasure
claw our innovative touch controllers
that offer a completely you gaming
experience with them you can grab
objects feel their size shape and
resistance with claw contact is felt in
a new way and you can also feel the
texture of an object the protruding
parts and their irregularities most
surprisingly however claw allows the
person to feel the texture of the
objects they touch as they interact with
the virtual world the controllers are
designed to make the immersion deeper
the most interesting thing will be to
place shooter games as they will allow
you to feel even the recoil during
shooting claw provides four modes of
interaction these are grabbing touching
feeling textures and pulling the trigger
switching from one mode to another is
very simple and fast so the process of
training and getting used to it doesn't
take more than a couple of minutes
feel via today's virtual reality
immersion controllers won't surprise
anyone especially if they have a
standard look but this system of
steering wheels and pedals created to
work with VR glasses are a relatively
new and interesting system here we have
filled VR a system that allows the
person sitting in their living room to
feel like a true professional pilot a
set of two steering wheels and pedals
cost $900 but for this money field VR is
able to deliver a completely new and
unique gaming experience this kit is
compatible with all current popular
racing simulators the system increases
the responsiveness in virtual reality
and allows you to react to everything
that happens on the track as quickly and
accurately as possible
the advantage is that the wheel has
unlimited rotation angle and a higher
rotation speed the pedals almost
perfectly simulate the pedals of a
racing car as well so the kit accurately
imitates the physics of a real car
unless you truly enjoy the race
and VR kit here we have a universal
system for virtual reality games which
adapts optimally to the needs of the
player the aunt VR kit consists of
glasses a controller and a lithium
battery and the whole set costs around
two hundred and seventy dollars
the modern controller can change shape
acquiring the right look for each game
it can perform the function of a gun a
joystick a standard controller and even
a racing wheel the aunt VR kit glasses
provide a hundred degree overview thanks
to the widescreen LCD screen and the
device offers incredibly rich colors in
a clear image as if you were in the real
world are not in virtual reality
vr glove here's another device also
created to feel virtual reality with
your own hands vr glove our futuristic
looking gloves that once in your hands
will make you forget about the usual
controllers they're lightweight
comfortable and wireless the battery
allows about four hours of interaction
and the surface of the gloves is full of
motion sensors that with an accuracy of
one centimeter
transmit the movement of the hands to
the game VR glove responds to pressure
and feels the characteristics of the
surface in this way it eliminates the
last downsides of virtual reality
freeing us from dealing with the
annoying mechanical drawbacks
manufacturers believe that that product
will make the virtual world more like
the real world and of course more
credible now objects can be easily
caught when you fire you feel the recoil
and even when you shoot with a virtual
bow you can feel its resistance you can
buy a pair of such gloves for $300
nolo there are devices that allow you to
immerse yourself in virtual reality
only with the help of your mobile phone
one of these devices is nolo it costs a
hundred and fifty dollars and after you
buy the system all you have to do is
connect the mobile phone and the
cardboard box after which you can start
playing immediately
nolo is compatible with all android
smartphones it can also be used with
some headsets for personal computers the
user starts the game puts on the virtual
reality glasses then takes the
controllers in his hands and can now
play any game as if he were inside it
the base station monitors the signals
from the sensors which are located on
the smartphone helmet and controllers it
processes them with minimal delay so the
virtual reality is optimally
synchronized with reality so you can
play anytime anywhere because the system
is absolutely portable
