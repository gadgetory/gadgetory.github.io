of physics if you place two magnets next
to each other they begin to interact how
exactly they interact depends on the
magnets themselves and on their position
relative to each other these same
magnetic poles such as north and north
or south and south repel each other but
at the same time different magnetic
poles ie
north and south are attracted to each
other everything we've just said is
known as the law of magnetic poles
experimenting with them it is possible
to create various interesting devices
in this case two large neodymium magnets
have been used and although the weight
of each of them is only one point eight
kilograms
when attracted to metal that can affect
it as if it weighed 300 kilograms if you
place a neodymium magnet on top of
another one facing the same poles to
each other and throw it down you can see
the throwing magnets swaying of the DEM
when the magnet stops that hangs at a
distance of 150 millimeters from the
other magnet if you do the same thing
that place the magnets opposite poles
facing each other the force of their
mutual attraction is so destructive that
at the moment of contact both are split
into pieces
hi Kirby the device you see on the
screen isn't called the hyper B by
accident it is a hyperboloid which is a
second-order surface and a
three-dimensional space in mathematics
the concept is rather complicated we do
agree but with hyper-v everything is
much simpler it's a stick rod with two
plastic disks on both ends these circles
are connected by a string pulled through
the holes in the disks
plastic what metal beads have put on
this string and then the magic begins
which the Creator had the vehicle's
mesmerizing kinetics when a person no
tapes the toy the beads begin to slide
on it the pattern in which the sliding
beads are lined up resembles the
infinity symbol it's noteworthy that
it's not so hard to assemble such a
device with your own hands the
manufacturer of hyper-v offers detailed
instructions on the website and if
someone doesn't want to bother and spend
time assembling one you can buy a hyper
B for twenty or thirty dollars
and gravitational toy we've already said
that by experimenting with magnets you
can create a variety of unusual toys the
device on the screen is the results of
such experiments here as in the first
case they use neodymium magnets the toy
is quite simple the magnets is thrown
inside a tube with thick bolts after
which it slowly begins to fall in rotate
as if denying the laws of gravity in
fact of course nothing like this happens
it behaves like that because of the
thickness length and diameter of the
tube which are selected to make a lenses
law coming to effect it was discovered
in 1984 and it's quite generic so it's
applicable to a variety of physical
situations in this particular case in
simple terms the magnets interacts with
the metal tube around it slowing its
movement this effect is achieved because
of the size of the tube is matching the
size of the magnet
the price of this toy is $25
gyroscopes although today's videos about
cool toys the device shown on the screen
is also used to need professional
environment it's used in navigation
systems such as altitude and gyro
compasses a gyroscope is a device
capable of responding to changes in the
body's orientation angles in relation to
the inertial frame of reference
simply put rotation gives the device
stability in space that is that allows
to counteract the deviation from the
axis of rotation as a toy the gyroscope
is very interesting as it can rotate at
any angle and on any surface its cost is
$15
for aaalac this clock is based on the
use of ferromagnetic fluid it's known
for its ability to react to magnetic
fields the fact is that the colloidal
system of this liquid contains
magnetized particles are very small size
using this knowledge Dutch designers elf
colmar managed to create an amazing and
incredibly beautiful clock the numbers
are made up of droplets that move around
the doll like living creatures the
secrets are the watches that the
ferrofluid is trapped between two bits
of glass behind the screen in the
invisible pass at a clock there are
moving magnets the fluid reacts to the
external magnetic field they create
which then causes the droplets to move
thanks to natural dynamics the fluid
moves in an unpredictable way which only
increases the unusual effect it's
noteworthy that this principle can be
used not only to create clocks
the liquid will move after any magnets
in any direction that is you can get any
shape and passive you want a total of 24
clocks have been created but they've not
been made available to the public the
designer sells that fair alike as a work
of art for a lot of money
store today there are clocks in every
home and establishments which is
probably why engineers are looking for
new ways to make them stranger and more
unusual the dial of story by flies is
made of natural wood but a stone its
main feature story shows that time using
a levitating clock hand which is
actually at 4 since there are no
divisions on the surface that would show
the exact time the manufacturer offers
to adjust the clock in a variety of ways
for example the ball can count the days
of the year or the number of days to a
certain event
there's an LED backlight too you can
turn it on or set it to activate
responding to a motion as you might have
guessed the ball is a magnet it floats
thanks to a special field created by the
electromagnetic systems hidden under the
wooden dial you can buy the story at a
price from 650 to 700 depending on the
type of board you choose
acoustic levitation sound waves can
affect small light objects with enough
force to make them hang in the air the
stable position of a way ciub jekt in a
standing acoustic wave is known as
acoustic levitation people first learn
to this force in 1934 of course
engineers and scientists are trying to
find practical applications for this for
example
acoustic levitation could be used to
transport small objects such as liquid
medicines
modern specialists with the health wave
power can even force an object to move
in the air or perform a planned rotation
and although in the future acoustic
levitation will certainly benefit people
right now it allows to create very
interesting and unusual toys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
