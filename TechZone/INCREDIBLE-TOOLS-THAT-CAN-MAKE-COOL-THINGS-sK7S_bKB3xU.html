cutting tools such as saws and drills
planks chisels and knives are used
craftsmen who after do a lot of work
resort to laser machines however all of
these tools can now be replaced with a
simple yet innovative tool
here's a CNC profile cutting machine it
was developed by a man's life it can
handle a wide range of materials such as
solid wood veneer chipboard plywood
laminate and parquet the cutting
accuracy of the machine is naught point
four millimeters the advanced edge of
the machine is its simple construction
which consists of four elements a side
drill the moveable body weights and a
chain gear system the machine moves
along the working surface changing the
length of the chains on which it hangs
the maximum working area is 120 by 240
centimeters the maximum cutting speed is
120 centimeters per minute although it
certainly depends on the hardness of the
material you could buy a Maslow CNC
machine for $500

lumberjack tenon cutters before people
invented cements mortise and tenon
joints were widely used to erect
structures around the world wooden parts
were ground from the ends in a special
way some of them had mortise holes or
grooves others were made in the form of
Tenon's then the tenon was inserted into
the hole the craftsman adjusted their
dimensions so precisely that they were
securely fastened although the
technology is used less frequently today
people have come up with improved tools
for it they allow to grind word in the
shortest possible time so that you can
get a tenant the company lumberjack
produces special drill bits by spinning
they give the desired shape to the logs
in a matter of minutes several series
are available to the standard one for
home use totals three noses
they're cutting diameters are 2.5 4 and
5 centimeters the production series
includes 6 models for the cutting
diameter of 2 and a half to seven and a
half centimeters it is noteworthy that
the nozzles can have different shapes
for a wide variety of finished spikes
the cost of one cutter ranges from 120
to 425 dollars
Hilti SDM one and two workers who need
to do a lot of work every day know how
important it is to use high-tech tools
they are easy to use and significantly
increase the speed and productivity on
the construction site these tools
include the screwdrivers with magazine
attachments you see on the screen the
Hilty company based in Liechtenstein
offers two models the SD m1 and the SD
and two the first one is suitable for
screws from 25 to 35 millimeters the
second one is for larger ones from 25 to
51 millimeters they have the same
capacity of 25 screws thus all is
designed for internal finishing works it
is used to fasten plasterboard wooden
panels and external covering sheets the
magazines are compact and lightweight so
as to not increase the load on the
workers hands the speed of work is thus
increased the work for us to stop less
frequently to reload the advantage is
that switching from the magazine modes
at the single screen mode can be done in
one simple movements the price of its
oil is $99
Kirk wrench initially the tool you see
on the screen was designed for plumbers
it was supposed to help them to Tyson or
screw valves or washers even in the most
hard-to-reach an isolated places such as
under a sink or behind the toilets
after a while the Kirk wrench LLC team
decided to improve the tool and now has
a much wider range of use the modern
Kirk wrench will become an invaluable
assistant to car mechanics aircraft
engineers as well as any other people
whose work involves repairs
despite its versatility the tool has a
fairly simple design
- arches are attached to the handle one
fixed and the other flexible the last
elements that the construction is the
ratchet mechanism which creates a
rotational movement thus the Kirk wrench
can take almost any shape necessary to
adapt to the working situation this
means that this $50 tool can handle
virtually any repair task
pipe cut 170 battery tools capable of
soaring high Hartman's materials don't
necessarily have to be bulky and heavy
this is the pipe cut 170 battery pipe
cutter the finished company exact tools
manufactures such equipments the tools
perform fast accurate cutting of metal
and plastic pipes the thickness of the
metal walls which it can handle is 6
millimeters the plastic is 14
millimeters thick the advantage of this
pipe cutter is the high speed of blade
rotation the idle rate is four thousand
revolutions per minute this allows the
operators to process metal and alloys of
different strengths for example acid
resistant and stainless steel cast iron
aluminium copper another advantage is
the compactness and portability the
version of the pipe cuts are shown here
is rechargeable which means that the
operator doesn't have to bother with
wires or look for an outlet the blade
diameter is 140 millimeters that's
always 5.7 kilograms and you can buy it
at a price of twelve hundred and seventy
five dollars or higher
storm series rescue services find
themselves in different situations in
their work it's difficult to predict
what kind of trouble a person will have
to be rescued from so there should
always be a diverse set of tools at hand
last year CNC rescue systems introduced
its own set of tools known as the storm
series this video shows how easy it is
to fix a damaged car body using these
tools the storm series includes expand
us of various sizes they're designed to
expand cracks in the joints of difficult
to move objects they can also hold the
loads deform and shrink material and
make way through debris pliers Universal
shears and cutter scissors are designed
to cut metal on pipes they'll also be
able to cut through steel fittings some
of them are powerful enough to lift a
load and fix it in the desired position
it is noteworthy that cutting the front
pillar of the car takes no more than 10
seconds with this cutter hydraulic
wedges are used in situations where it's
necessary to apply very high pressure to
an object for example they use to press
down steel doors and widen gaps the cost
of each tool that we showed is about
$10,000
now geezer peepee 200 the last tool will
show you today is a hydraulic bending
press for cold forging it's produced by
the Spanish company now jeiza the pp 200
is able to bend cold workpieces as well
as fold cut and shape them also the
model shown can stretch and compress any
kind of metal tools like the NAR gays of
pp 200 are needed of factories that
manufacture pipes sheet metal profiles
and rods the press affects the work
pieces with a force of 20 tonnes it's
noteworthy that traditional bending
machines for strip steel don't allow the
complete bending of parts and metal
elements
then our gazer pp 200 does not have this
disadvantage as roll forging is allowed
to be combined with hot forging machines
a for mold bending die comes with the
press and additional molds can also be
purchased this significantly extends the
range of operation the price then our
gaze of pp 200 is $11,000</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
