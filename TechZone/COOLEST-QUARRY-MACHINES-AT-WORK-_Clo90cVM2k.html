self-propelled full turn excavator with
a single bucket
its creator is PNH one of the leading
companies in the production of equipment
for mining the machine performs
stationary loading but its main feature
is its huge bucket its capacity is a
hundred American tonnes this guarantees
unprecedented performance the 4100 si
boss needs four minutes to fill a 300
ton truck pH managers say that it's
advisable to use their extractor in
facilities where it's necessary to move
a large amount of material quickly and
with minimum expenses another feature of
the model is that it can work even in
difficult weather conditions the
excavator is resistant to the freezing
of hydraulic oil making it weather
resistant the height of the machine is
amazing reaching 14 point 7 meters
bucket-wheel excavator here we have a
rotary excavator for soil treatment it
can be used with various attachments for
example buckets scrapers or cutters
which are fixed on the rotary wheel the
rotation process can destroy even hard
rocks on the video
a rotary rifle excavator is used to
develop weakly resistant overburden the
mechanism allows to move the rock from
the rotor wheel to the conveyor where
it's then transported to the disposal
site the diameter of the wheel can reach
18 meters and in particularly large
models the bucket capacity is 1600
liters it has a huge productivity
developing up to ten thousand cubic
meters of soil per hour it's noteworthy
that the biggest machine in history is
the bagger 293 wheel excavator it has 20
buckets each of which holds up to 15
cubic meters of soil which is about
15,000 liters
LCM 11200 9.1 LeapPad let's take a look
at the mobile crane LCM 11200 9.1 from
the german manufacturer liebe hair until
2015
this mobile crane had the longest
telescopic boom in the world measuring a
hundred meters
moreover the vehicle can be used with
various grid extension cables the crane
has a y-shaped boom which gives it an
increased carrying capacity up to 1.2
tonnes it moves on an automobile nine
chassis the main purpose of the crane is
the installation of heavy loads it's
dimensions are impressive the width of
the running gear is 3 metres and the
transport length is 4 metres the
construction of the LCM 11200 9.1
consists of two parts a rotating part
and a stationary part the first includes
the frame and the running gear and the
second includes the boom and it's
mechanisms and also additional equipment
they are connected by a pivoting device
which transfer the load
caterpillar are 1700 G here we have a
forklift designed specifically for
underground mining caterpillar engineers
made suede to give the model a high
performance and reduced operating costs
the body is not only compact but also
very durable so the machine has a long
service life reduced maintenance costs
for example for repairs and stronger
maintenance for the our 1700 G the
manufacturer chose the c11 a search
engine at 1800 rpm the doubts away to
the loader is 52 and a half tons and it
withstands a payload of up to 14 tonnes
for the convenience of the operator the
cabin has an ergonomic layout built-in
rollover protection soundproofing and
temperature control for every situation
the bucket is selected individually
between two different kinds it's
noteworthy that the buckets have cutting
edges which increase the service life
and wearability
ix 1906 Hitachi Quarry excavators have
increased wear resistance and protection
against external factors since they are
used in particularly difficult
conditions these are the characteristics
of the e^x 1906 excavator by Japanese
manufacturer Hitachi this large vehicle
is designed for operation in mining
quarries and it's used for intensive
work with a large volume of rock it has
only one bucket and its capacity reaches
12 cubic meters the great level of
bucket effort guarantees short working
cycles high productivity and low
operating costs the Cummins qsk 38 C
engine provides a power of 1086
horsepower the operating waist of the
backhoe is a hundred and ninety-two
thousand kilograms and the direct shovel
weighs a hundred and ninety 1000
kilograms this giant hydraulic excavator
can perform even complex tasks large
volumes of work and breeze productivity
to a new level
leaper L 586 X power this interesting
wheel loader combines innovation
performance efficient fuel consumption
as well as strength and comfort the
tipping load is twenty two point five
thousand kilograms despite the fact that
the working weight reaches thirty three
point six thousand kilograms a unique
feature of this technology is the
powertrain transmission which makes it
possible to work productively showing
maximum efficiency the vehicle is
powered by a Tier four F engine with a
capacity of 354 horsepower the engineers
at Lee pair have done a tremendous job
to ensure that the power between the
hydro static and mechanical drives is
distributed evenly this reduces the load
on all elements of the machine
increasing its service life the
transmission is supplemented by the leap
air power efficiency system which
reduces fuel consumption by 30 percent
buckets are selected for the type of
work in addition to the standard bucket
there is a label for light materials and
high discharge
Bauer mc12 8 here we have the crawler
crane mc12 8 by the german company bauer
designed for special fundamental works
the total weight of this giant machine
is about a hundred and seventy two tons
the powerful caterpillar c27 engine
delivers 1,800 RPM it has two winches
and the length of the boom is fifty four
point four meters the maximum carrying
capacity is as much as 200 tons and the
operational weight at 172 tons the
driver's cab provides a high level of
comfort reducing operates a fatigue and
improving the accuracy of work it has an
ergonomic seat excellent visibility air
conditioning temperature control and
sound insulation
del mag RH 24 to 70 the drilling rig RH
24 to 70 is produced by another German
company engaged in the production of
machinery del mag typically these
machines are used for piling but the
dimensions of this machine allow it to
be used for working with casing strings
the toes away to the del Mac RH 24 to 70
is 79 tons and it has an engine capacity
of 276 kilowatts
the depth of drilling reaches 40 meters
- expands the functionality and
performance the rotary head is equipped
with the docking system which provides a
quick and easy setup when working the
machine uses special hammers and the
principle of impact spraying a
distinctive feature of the rh 24 270 is
an adjustable fuel pump for precise
control of the piston stroke and impact
energy this guarantees more efficient
changes in soil formations</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
