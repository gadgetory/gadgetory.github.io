place where highly-skilled people prove
they are the best in their field however
not only athletes want to be recognized
and rewarded for their talents here we
have a construction contest it was
celebrated in 2017 by the Mason
Contractors Association of America the
video features a speed competition for
placing breezeblocks only the best
craftsmen were invited to participate in
its ornament these people are not afraid
to show their skills or compete with the
most talented workers each Mason's task
was to build a nine meter long concrete
block wall only 20 by 20 by 40
centimeter concrete blocks can be used
they could also use construction mortar
the contestants who place the most
blocks in 20 minutes would be the winner
participants had to demonstrate their
skills only using hand tools as well
these competitions demonstrate the
importance of teamwork to achieve a
perfect result each competitor was
allowed to have two assistants the
craftsman did the main work themselves
the helpers were needed on-site to
prepare the blocks and mortar the first
place was given to a man named Gerardo
Pat Lam who placed a hundred and
nineteen blocks
the person in the second place placed
115 blocks this competition is held
every year in 2018 corrado ranks second
and in 2019 again first with a record of
a hundred and thirty three blocks
stamped concrete the unusual finish of
concrete surfaces is becoming
increasingly popular in construction
work there are a variety of ways to do
this some are more complex while others
are less the most commonly used method
is to create a relief of the surface
with special stampings however it has
certain significant drawbacks the
working speed is quite slow for the
person to be complete and accurate the
worker has to apply part of the stamping
to the already existing pattern the
method you see right now does not have
this disadvantage workers use a special
large template it allows to process even
a large surface in a very short time the
sim plates on the screen imitates a
brick wall the first the workers apply
some of these templates they do have to
be very careful though placing them next
to each other the slightest mistake can
make a relief look unnatural or they
will have to remove the stencil smooth
the surface you do it all over again
the template is then pressed against the
wet concrete with the help of special
rollers to give the finished surface the
relief and also the color of a brick a
layer of dried dye is added
the trowel is used to rub the diets of
the concrete after the application of
the wet mortar the template is immersed
even deeper into the surface once it's
removed it's necessary to clean the
pattern with a jet of water the final
stages are plastering and collating coin
floor in today's market it's hard to
find flooring materials that can
surprise someone so if you want to make
a unique floor to amaze all of your
guests you need to use unusual materials
for example this craftsman has decorated
the floor with coins to understand how
many coins you'd need first you have to
choose the denomination of the coins in
this case for example British 2p coins
were used by the way you can find
special calculations online that can
determine the number of coins based on
floor area and coin diameter first of
the material are des to the construction
glue when liquid it's white and clearly
visible and as it dries it loses color
and becomes transparent
placing the coins is probably the most
difficult and longest stage of the whole
process
next the grouse is used to carry out
various functions first it insulates the
floor ensuring no water enters the gaps
between the coins
secondly it creates a beautiful contrast
and thirdly it makes the surface
smoother which improves the quality of
the final coating the layer should dry
before moving on to the next stage the
application of epoxy resin the fact is
that the resin can react with the grout
and spoil the appearance of the floor
later the quality of the finished job
will depend on how well the worker
dilutes the epoxy solution the procedure
must be performed with great care
strictly following the instructions in
addition you need to work very fast the
first portion of the epoxy resin is Port
to make the layer look beautiful the
next portion is made right after that
all to ensure that the resin on the
floor doesn't dry making a smooth even
surface the results of this long
laborious and difficult work is an
unusual very beautiful and smooth floor
3d pedestrian crossing for the first
time the idea of creating
three-dimensional pedestrian crossings
originated in India the advantages were
then recognised in countries such as
Iceland Switzerland Belgium and France
for pedestrians such as ember crossing
is just a few lines but in fact they are
an optical illusion drivers seen large
concrete slabs blocking the road
obviously the driver reduces the speed
making the pedestrian crossing safer it
should be noted that these lines are
firstly more expensive and secondly much
more difficult to apply compared to a
standard crossing road workers must be
careful and attentive it is necessary
not to make mistakes with the corners of
the lines and also to choose the right
colors the optical illusion works only
if all stages of the marking are carried
out flawlessly as you can see the work
is shown in the video are professionals
of their craft
laminate on walls today the construction
market offers more and more options for
a quick and relatively simple finishing
of walls one of them is laminate
matching the floor surface there are
several ways to install laminate on the
wall the most efficient one is mounting
it on an aluminium frame in this case
the worker installs the guide rails at a
distance of 50 centimeters from each
other it is very important that they are
fixed strictly perpendicular to the
floor in order to ensure the laminate is
perfectly flat the main tool for
installing the frame is the construction
level when the frame is securely
fastened the laminated panels are
installed on the rails here the level is
used again to make the laminated panel
look more appealing an aluminium frame
is installed along the edge of the
structure the advantages of wall
laminates over standard siding materials
aren't obvious first the laminate is
much stronger than standard PVC so it's
not as easy to break secondly the wall
laminate adds extra sound and thermal
insulation to the room
and thirdly it's easier to maintain than
wallpaper for example you can use
detergents to clean laminate
