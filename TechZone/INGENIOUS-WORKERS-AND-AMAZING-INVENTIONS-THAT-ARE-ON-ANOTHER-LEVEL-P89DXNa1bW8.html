that ingenious construction inventions
cost a lot of money and have to be
bought or ordered on the internet but
the wall decoration technology you see
on the screen will change your mind in
fact you can create this interesting and
functional tool by yourself in this case
a woman carved a 43 centimeter high
hexagon out of foam board which is quite
a cheap material as you well know she
managed to decorate the walls of the
room in a very unusual way here the
hexagon works as a stencil it's applied
to the wall and then a pattern is
created around it with a decent tape
this procedure is carried out until the
design is finished the only thing left
to do is paint each hexagon in this case
pink turquoise and lilac paints are used
afterwards you have to remove the tape
and the wall is ready
by the way using these homemade stencils
you can creates a variety of drawings
and patterns you are limited solely by
your imagination
drywall taper properly sealing the
joints of a plaster board construction
will determine both the service life of
the surface and its final appearance
this stage is mandatory regardless of
the type of construction traditionally
to seal the joints people use paper tape
applied over the filler in that case the
procedure is divided into two stages and
requires certain skills from the worker
the tool you see on the screen can
considerably speed up the work the
drywall taper by Delco tools combines
two processes in one applying the filler
and sealing the joints with paper tape
this is possible thanks to the special
design of the device inside the tool
there's a gap where the filler is placed
the paper tape passes through the
container with the filler so it's
applied to the joints along with the
filler the forrester that's all is a
hundred and sixty dollars
aardwolf slab lifts transporting
materials to a construction site is a
recurring problem on any project the
heavy weights the unusual size and shape
makes certain materials very difficult
to load unload and transport the
vietnamese company aardwolf
offers several solutions to this problem
here we have the 50 a slab lifting clamp
and the 2500 concrete pipe lifter the
first device is patented and is designed
to work with any regular forklift
another advantage is the integrated
automatic locking and unlocking
mechanism this means that the device
automatically picks up and holds the
slabs and also automatically releases
them when the material reaches the
surface the clamping mechanism is
compact and the slabs can be placed
close to the wall the maximum load
capacity of the device is 1200 kilograms
the second lifter is a fast and
efficient device designed to safely
elevate concrete pipes without requiring
an additional hydraulics system the
single person can lift and remove the
pipes the maximum payload of this model
is 2,500 kilograms the device is also
adjustable so lift pipes of different
diameters from 750 to a thousand
millimeters
stabilizing stepladder installation
painting and many other construction
works are only possible with the use of
a special ladder the problem is that
traditional ladders are not very stable
moreover even though they are used all
over the world their appearance has not
changed much over time experts from the
Indian companies Soria safety decided to
put an end to this developing terrain
master an innovative ladder stabilizer
capable of maintaining balance on its
own its use significantly increases the
level of safety on the construction site
creating new opportunities for workers
with this device the ladder can be
installed on uneven surfaces even in
that case it gives the worker more
stability than a usual ladder the ladder
stabilizer is able to take almost any
position the distance between the legs
is 1.3 meters which also contributes to
the stability of the structure using
terrain master is especially convenient
when working outdoors the ladder can be
installed anywhere even on unpaved
ground thanks to its folding design a
ladder equipped with terrain master
takes up no more space during
transportation than any other studies
have shown that a ladder equipped with
this device provides 40% more stability
windbag air wedge the tool you see on
the screen has a much larger safety
margin than it might appear at first
glance here we have an air wedge
designed for a wide variety of
construction tasks initially the idea
was to help builders install Windows
before in order to level a window frame
they are to use uncomfortable wooden and
plastic wedges when bag was designed to
solve this problem the size of the
cushion changes in seconds making the
job easier wind bag is used to hold and
lift large heavy objects to create
pressure and to perform installations
using a builder level the material for
the air wedge has been carefully chosen
so that it can be used repeatedly and
over a long period of time the wind bag
is made of a special fiber reinforce
material not only does the device
facilitate and speed up the work but
also protects objects from damage and
guarantees a precise exact and
trouble-free adjustment of the materials
using wing bag a single person can
install a window you can buy this tool
for $20
concrete extruder the latest invention
we will be showing you today has been
designed to accelerate a facilitator
road construction this extruder is a
press machine that forms a continuous
line of cements to create a curb at the
side of the road like in this case the
procedure involves several stages first
the workers dig the trench then the
concrete is mixed next the workers start
laying the curves the machine moves
slowly along the road leaving a smooth
solid curb maintaining the same width
and height over its entire length as you
can see workers make several cuts in
some places these are expansion joints
this is a very important step as it
allows concrete to adjust to the natural
earth movement at the same time the curb
retains its aesthetic appearance despite
the cuts imb Brazil manufactures the
extruders you see on the screen the imb
900g master is their most popular model
it can be used to create staircases low
partitions and concrete you type water
channels
hey stop being lazy it's time to use

present and even the future the power of
