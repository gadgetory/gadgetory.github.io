microphone that isolates wind noise a
Bluetooth speaker and bright LEDs at the

shocks top hand numbness is one of the
most common complaints among cyclists
the reason for this may be the handlebar
vibration due to potholes on the roads
over the past few years various
companies have tried to solve this
problem with the help of different
suspension arms using spiral Springs
pneumatic shock absorbers and elastomers
but their appearance is sometimes quite
strange but the handlebar suspension
shocks top is here to change that its
body is made of forged aluminium alloy
inside of which there's a turning points
in two removable elastomer cushions each
suspension has several sets of cushions
with different degrees of rigidity when
the front wheel hits a pothole on the
road shock stop absorbs most of the
energy moving a couple of inches the
deviation degree is determined by the
stiffness of the cushion
selected by the user based on his
personal preferences and the driving
conditions as the developers say shock
stop is designed primarily for road
driving it's also important to notice
that it doesn't allow the handlebar to
bend sideways so overcoming road bumps
does not affect the driving the device
