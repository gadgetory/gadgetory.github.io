for cyclists is equipped with a built-in
microphone that isolates wind noise a
Bluetooth speaker and bright LEDs at the
top and the back of the helmet all these
features enhance the safety of the
cyclist and make cycling more
comfortable and enjoyable if something
happens to the owner of the helmet on
the road and he falls off his bicycle
the built-in helmet accelerometer will
detect the accident and the gadget will
turn on an alarm and notify about the
trouble
at the same time a smartphone connected
to the helmet via bluetooth also sends
an audio signal and the owner of the
helmet has to confirm that everything is
in order if there's no answer the
smartphone sends messages to selected
contacts with an SOS signal and
coordinates of the place where the biker
found on the back of the smart helmet
there are colored LED lights the service
Direction indicators for turns a remote
control will help you control the helmet
and your phone while driving without
being distracted from the road the
remote control is attached to the
handlebar of the bicycle and it's always
at hand
the cost of this rode assistant is $200
shocks top hand numbness is one of the
most common complaints among cyclists
the reason for this may be the handlebar
vibration due to potholes on the roads
over the past few years various
companies have tried to solve this
problem with the help of different
suspension arms using spiral Springs
pneumatic shock absorbers and elastomers
but their appearance is sometimes quite
strange but the handlebar suspension
shocks top is here to change that its
body is made of forged aluminium alloy
inside of which there's a turning points
in two removable elastomer cushions each
suspension has several sets of cushions
with different degrees of rigidity when
the front wheel hits a pothole on the
road shock stop absorbs most of the
energy moving a couple of inches the
deviation degree is determined by the
stiffness of the cushion
selected by the user based on his
personal preferences and the driving
conditions as the developers say shock
stop is designed primarily for road
driving it's also important to notice
that it doesn't allow the handlebar to
bend sideways so overcoming road bumps
does not affect the driving the device
can be pre-ordered for $89 parkies
parking your bike after a day out is not
an easy task bikes are usually pretty
big and if there are several cyclists in
the family storage becomes a real
problem the creators of this project

vertical racks to cable structures but
these constructions were too complicated
and not very easy to use so they decided
to create parkus a universal parking
bike system

in a vertical position literally with
one hand without superfluous efforts the
front wheel of the vehicle gets placed
on one of the platforms and a special
mechanism lifts it up the rear wheel
goes on the lower platform and you just
have to fix the bicycle to the rack and
place it next to the wall thus freeing
up more space a simple model without a
turning mechanism will cost future
owners about $300 a stir this is not
just a backpack it's a multifunctional
device and a whole security system for
any cyclists on the road the backpack
has a four thousand milliamp hour
battery enough of 15 hours of work the
device comes with side lights or stop
lights and turn signals on the back

analyzes when you slow down if this
occurs the rear brake lights light up
brighter and the left and right turn
signals can be controlled with a simple
Bluetooth switch on the handlebar in

waterproof and the rigid outer layer of
artificial leather will keep its form

lenses in this model the transition time

second the glasses are resistant to

cyclists who often suffer from small
stones flying out from under wheels the
frame is made of a strong nylon and the
control elements and the rechargeable

all this the glasses weigh only 50 grams
