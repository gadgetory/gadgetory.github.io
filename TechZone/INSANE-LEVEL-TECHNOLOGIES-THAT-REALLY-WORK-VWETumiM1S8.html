boom stationary laser screed machine in
the world produced by the American
company Samara this machine was first
shown earlier this year during the
annual world of concrete construction
exhibition sky screed 25 is designed
specifically to screed on structural
high-rise and slab on great applications
in addition it's capable of spreading
foundation slabs and floors on the
ground according to the manufacturer
unique design solutions have been
implemented when creating this laser
screed for example the lower frame was
equipped with three stabilizers so the
equipment is stable regardless of the
type of surface it's standing on the
upper frame and the working units are
able to rotate around their axis to
therefore the machine is able to work
along walls and around columns and other
protrusions sky screed 25 levels the
concrete to the entire depth of the slab
and automatically screed to the desired
angle thanks to all of these features
any construction site will significantly
increase productivity and reduce labor
costs while improving the quality of the
concrete
plant eggs ground grid geogrid is no
longer an innovative building material
this geosynthetic product looks like a
two-dimensional or three-dimensional
cellular structure and it is quite often
used in road construction and in the
railway and oil and gas industries
nevertheless the building material
market changes every day the products
offered up becoming more technologically
advanced here we're showing you the
plant X ground grid by the american
company dupont it is an innovative
flexible three dimensional grid it's
capable of holding the filling substance
such as stone gravel or soil in an
optimal way the use of such material
makes it possible to achieve a stable
surface for pedestrian zones it can also
be used for access roads paths private
parking lots golf courses and sports
grounds plant X ground grid does not
lose its properties even when a car
passes over the surface the manufacturer
claims this grid is highly durable even
when it is stretched also the plants X
ground grid avoids setting and doesn't
retain water
brick staircase in modern indoor
construction staircases are often made
of metal or wood they're also cast in
special factories for the production of
reinforced concrete then they are
brought to these sites and installed in
the chosen place here's another way to
build a ladder and it requires only one
person to implement it we only have to
use bricks and mortar to fix it the
bricks are stacked on top of each other
and leveled in order to create a step
the work begins at the bottom after the
worker finishes the first step he starts
working on the second one the work is
complicated by the fact that the bricks
need to be laid on a sloping surface but
parallel to the ground therefore the
lower bricks have to be given a certain
shape
the master hits the bricks removing
unnecessary parts all the empty spaces
and gaps formed as a result of laying
the bricks on a slope are carefully
filled with water
waterproof jointing mortar if you want
to make sure that the paving stone or
tile covering will please your eyes for
many years you should choose the right
building materials paying special
attention to the jointing mortar it
binds the elements of the covering
together keeping the surface stable in
addition it prevents plants from
sprouting through the joints and
spoiling the appearance of the parts the
waterproof solution used to fill the
joints in this video is produced by the
international company quick mix not only
does it have excellent performance but
it's also easy to apply the surface is
moisturized before starting to work
regardless of the material be it
concrete tiles or ceramic tiles or
bricks the worker then carefully closes
the joints using a rubber scraper or
spatula this is an important step the
dense liquid must fill each seam deep
and tight is worth noting however that
no additional sealing is that required
the consistency of the mortar allows it
to fill the empty space on its own the
excess solution is then removed so that
only a very thin layer remains on the
surface the curing time is only 30 to 90
minutes depending on the ambient
temperature and weather after that the
surface can be cleaned which is quite
easy it is moistened and treated with a
rubber scraper then the remains are
washed off with water the whole process
doesn't take more than two hours
immediately after cleaning the surface
is ready for use
faux brick wall in recent years the
industrial style in interior design has
become more and more popular its main
distinguishing feature as the bare walls
showing the bricks the building is made
of however it's not always possible to
uncover it and sometimes the building's
not made of bricks and you really want
to decorate the room here is a way of
making a faux brick wall that allows you
to solve this problem quickly and easily
to begin with the master marks the
selected wall he needs to attach thin
adhesive tapes where the brickwork
joints would be the easiest way is
creating a grid on the wall then the
master uses plaster from the Turkish
company easy stone this is a special
powder that only needs to be mixed with
water after drying it imitates stone
brick or concrete in texture and color
depending on the style you choose the
surface is covered with a thin layer of
this material and after that you only
need to remove the adhesive tape
pour a therm ceramic blocks in order to
make a house more comfortable to live in
after the walls are erected they need
sound and thermal insulation this
procedure delays construction time and
increased slaver costs however if you
replace conventional building materials
with poorer therm ceramic blocks you can
skip this stage German comfort Avena
Berger is engaged in production of such
blocks poor Arthur blocks have many
outstanding features firstly they don't
need additional thermal insulation they
provide maximum efficiency with minimum
wall thickness maintaining the perfect
microclimates inside the room they are
also certified to eco material green
standards which means they offer high
standard chelation
the use of this material increases the
speed and cost-effectiveness of
construction that's because the blocks
have a porous structure so the
insulation is right inside each brick
notes that the vertical joint is not
filled with mortar the manufacturer
offers more than 15 varieties of blocks
for any construction site for example
five hundred and ten millimeter thick
blocks are suitable for external and
internal walls there are also blocks of
four hundred and forty three hundred and
eighty three hundred and 250 millimeters
thick the smallest size is 200 by 120 by
eighty millimeters they're ideal for
single row partition walls despite the
fact that inside the blocks there is
insulation they can be sawn like any
other similar building materials you can
also use drills rotary hammers and other
drilling tools for this purpose
