this unusual car was first shown at the
American Championship 24 Hours of LeMans
ace in which cars with a non-standard
design take part one of the brightest

upside-down
Camaro this is basically an inverted 99
Chevrolet Camaro the wheelbase and the
engine remained in place and the body
and additional dummy wheels were placed
upside down for racing the car is
equipped with the not very powerful 1.3
liter four-cylinder engine and a chassis
from a 94 Festiva the engine power is
about 60 horsepower
car pool deville this car was invented
and built by Duncan Forrester and Phil
yka based on a 69 Cadillac DeVille they
work for almost six years to create a
real outdoor swimming pool on wheels
it's worth noting that even in this
guise the car is able to move along the
hallway reaching a maximum speed of 80
km/h in order to avoid the water filling
the car bath at high speeds the Cadillac
DeVille frame was significantly
strengthened and the interior is
completely sealed the water is heated by
a heat exchanger which uses heat from
the exhaust gases by the way this
unusual car into the Guinness Book of
Records as the fastest bathtub in the
world
barbegal oxo 1 this vehicle is a hybrid
between a car and a bike this model was
developed by Italian designer Giorgio
Barba Gallo the one piece barber Gallo
xo1
is a three-wheeled electric bike that
uses an electric motor the power of the
motor increases when the cyclist twists
the pedals one full charge of the
battery which is also removable is
enough for 4 hours all 70 kilometers on
the road the maximum speed of the barber
Gallo XO 1 is 25 km/h among other
features of the velomobile it has a full
lighting system front and rear shock
absorbers a small cargo bay and disc
brakes on all wheels peel p50 this
three-wheeled microbial motocross was
released in the 60's by peel engineering
company the car accommodates one adult
person with a small bag the p50 has only
one door to the left and only one
headlight the machine is equipped with a
handle at the back to manually unone the
car or drag it into a room the peel p50
is equipped with a 49 kilogram
two-stroke dkw motorcycle engine with a
power of 4.2 horsepower it can reach a
top speed of 61 km/h however it should
be noted that the speed also depends on
the weight and height of the person the
engine is located at the front on the
right side and is connected to a
three-speed manual gearbox without a
rear speed
the boost the American company Ford
decided to install one of its most
modern EcoBoost engines on a skateboard
thanks to a 1 liter gasoline engine the
person on the skateboard can reach a
speed of about a hundred kilometers per
hour according to the creators of the
device the EcoBoost skateboard EcoBoost
can develop a higher speed but it might
be dangerous for the person riding that
device the three cylinder engine has a
power of a hundred and forty horsepower
and the maximum sort of this unusual
vehicle is 210 Newton meters also there
are versions with a reduced performance
of 125 and a hundred horsepower
so like the Canadian company
electromechanical
developed a new project the urban
electric cars solo this is an electric
car for one person ie the driver by
removing the passenger seats the car
became as compact as possible it's three
metres long and only one point two
meters wide the electromechanical solo
has a three-wheel configuration with two
wheels at the front and one at the rear
from naught to 100 kilometers per hour
the electric car accelerates in about
eight seconds and is maximum speed is
120 km/h 160 kilometers
rrrow cycle one of the main features of
this three-wheeled vehicle is its
steering system when the frame is tilted
around its longitudinal axis the front
wheels move to the corresponding side
thus the row cycle does not have a
steering wheel the driver can also
control the vehicle with his weight
making the car more maneuverable for an
even more comfortable use of the row
cycle the dimensions of all elements and
the angles of their inclination can be
adjusted individually for each user
some doors evie this fully electric
model from sun doors electric cars a
three seater car equipped with a variety
of lithium-ion batteries according to
the manufacturers they can be charged
from a 110 or 240 volt outlet depending

front and one in the back
ampair one these startup company and
pair motors has created a vehicle that's
according to the manufacturers is an

participated in the design of the model
of the heart of the machine is a tubular
frame made of fiberglass in carbon the
electric car is equipped with three
wheels two front and one rear suspension
is made on double wishbones and the
ampere motor one can accelerate from
nought to 100 km/h in eight seconds and
its maximum speed is 120 km/h in the
basic configuration the electric vehicle
one does not have a roof or even a
windshield if you want they can be
installed as an additional cost
outrider horizon designer jesse lee has
created a three-wheeled electric bicycle
that provides high mobility to fans of
extreme sports with disabilities the
outrider horizon is able to easily
overcome dirt and grass descents and
steep ascents and is controlled with a
joystick and hand or foot pedals the
tricycle can operate in different modes
as well the electric mode uses only the
energy of the batteries also the user
can ride by rotating the foot or hand
pedals themselves the traction modes
there with the power of 1500 watts

Rison which can reach a speed of 40 km/h
a 48 volt high-capacity battery provides
mileage without recharging up to 48
kilometers
Blizz wheel this is one of the most
portable electric vehicles in the world
the device is fast foldable and can
easily overcome with short distances
it's worth noting that in a folded state
the thickness of the device is only
seven point eight centimeters using
Blizz wheel is pretty simple it's enough
to assemble it fastening and tightening
the belts on the shoes speed control is
carried out with the help of a
controller mounted on the finger to
accelerate you need to bend your finger
and to slow the course just straighten
it
another control option is a portable
controller with a joystick the control
panel on each controller shows the
current and maximum speed distance
traveled and remaining battery life in
addition the developers have created a
special application for the smartphone
which collects data from the controller
and displays all the statistics on the
screen horse-drawn hummer not so long
ago 32 year old artist Jeremy Dean from
New York purchased a secondhand 2003
black Hummer h2 for fifteen thousand
