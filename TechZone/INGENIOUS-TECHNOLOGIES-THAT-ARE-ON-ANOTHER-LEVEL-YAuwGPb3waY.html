technology to tow storage containers was
invented in Prescott Valley Arizona
essentially it turns a container into
its own trailer at the same time it is
efficient cheap and has a simple design
the cheetah lift is a four wheeled
platform the container is installed by
two people with the help of one's hoe
truck first the platform is assembled
from one side of the container
the tow truck then lifts the container
from the other side and a person places
a special rack in the middle book of
withstand heavy loads now it works as a
seesaw when one side of the container is
lowered the other side is lifted after
that's all you have to do is attach the
wheeled platform to the container the
technology is designed to handle
containers of different sizes and the
maximum safe lifting capacity is three
thousand one hundred and seventy five
kilograms
ultra skiff the invention you see on the
screen will open up many new
opportunities for fishing enthusiasts
the main problem with most boats is
their large size which makes it
difficult to move them around sometimes
even carrying the boat from the car to
the water can be challenging ultra skiff
is a personal mini boat that has a round
shape and solid abrasion resistant edges
thanks to this you can roll it next to
you thanks to its small height you can
push ultra skiff even into a narrow
space the boat is so compact that it
easily fits in a pickup truck
interestingly the construction is strong
enough to overcome obstacles such as
fences barriers
in addition it weighs only 56 kilograms
which will be an advantage when
encountering obstacles the manufacturer
offers eight different models ranging in
price from 1,500 to 1,900 dollars they
differ in such things as the motor and
the seat design the design of the boat
was developed for a very long time and
it is passing sit surprisingly the
structure doesn't flip over even if you
stand on the very edge although it does
tell us a lesson thanks to this feature
it's not difficult to get inside for the
water as well to get out
digits global companies keep surprising
us with their projects on how delivery
will look in the future just a week ago
Ford agility robotics and engineers from
the Oregon State University demonstrated
their joint brainchild the digits
delivery robot concept unlike many other
similar inventions digit is not a
walking robot the device works in pair
with an unmanned vehicle the address and
other important information about the
customer are entered into the system by
a worker when the car arrives at its
destination the robot gets out of the
car takes the right box out of the trunk
and brings it right to the door
thus the developers managed to cope with
the main drawback of modern delivery
robots there's almost no limits to
digits area of operation as the car
moves freely around the city in the
future the device will allow people to
save a huge amount of money
since robots don't need salaries lunch
breaks or sleep they only require timely
maintenance Eco capsule modern people
now prefer a minimalistic lifestyle they
also choose housing that's not tied to a
particular place eco capsule is a
project most Slovak engineers which will
help everyone to make a giant step
towards a new life it is a unique
egg-shaped mobile home such compact
dwelling is designed for one or two
people surprisingly in this tiny 6.2
square meter room you can find
absolutely everything you need for a
comfortable life it has a small kitchen
a sink with running water
a toilet a hot shower a workplace and an
extendable double bed eco capsule was
designed to be as autonomous as possible
this means the capsule can be placed
anywhere
there is no need to connect it to the
electricity and sewerage networks the
house is self-sufficient the Eco capsule
is equipped with a wind turbine and a
solar panel to generate electricity it
also has an energy saving system and a
high-capacity battery so you will have
electricity even on cloudy or windless
days the spherical shape is chosen to
collect rainwater around you which are
then filtered in addition the eco
capsule is compact enough to be used
with a car trailer
MCP driver at naked prosthetics
specialist develop amazing prostheses
that help people with disabilities to
feel fully functional the company's
product line includes three prosthesis
mCP driver is the largest of them as
it's designed to replace up to four
fingers the device restores the middle
falange
and the nail bar each prosthesis is made
individually it's amazing how the
prosthesis literally brings people's
hands back to life allowing them to do
things that require fine motor skills
mCP driver is attached to the back of
the hand the functional power of the
mechanical fingers depends on how much
force a person can exert studies have
shown that the average man can exert
about 3 to 4 kilograms of force on
objects with each finger it is also
noteworthy that the prosthesis allows
the user to lift even heavy objects as
the load is evenly distributed on the
wrist silicon tips imitate the natural
surface of the fingers preventing
objects from slipping out
line-x the last invention that we are
going to show today was developed
primarily for vehicles however any
object can be covered with line axes
protective compositions after which it
will gain unsurpassed strength and
resistance to any impacts car owners
know how unpleasant it is to find new
scratches on the surface of your car and
of course it's well known how easily the
surface gets damaged especially if you
have to drive off-road
line-x protects the surface from
scratches and chips has a high level of
water tightness and is UV resistant in
addition the compound guarantees that
the surface will not corrode it is
possible to coat any material with this
protective solution be it metal plastic
glass or composite the shape of the
object doesn't matter either the
compound will be evenly distributed in
any case
the video shows the most extreme tests
of the protective coating a camping
fridge coated with lionex survived a
fall from a big height even though it
hit rocks repeatedly in the process
traditionally special inserts are used
to protect a pickup truck body
however they do not look very appealing
and the screws holding them become more
loose at the time the creators of lion
axe offered to cover the inside of the
body with their protective composition
the color is chosen to match the car so
it won't affect its look but it will
protect it from all impacts even a milk
jug treated with a composition becomes
strong enough to withstand multiple
blows with a bat</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
