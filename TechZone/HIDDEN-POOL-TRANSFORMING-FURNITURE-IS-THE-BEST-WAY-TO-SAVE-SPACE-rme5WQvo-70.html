in their backyard often the problem is
not lack of money but simply lack of
space if you put a pool there there's no
room for anything else the Israeli
company AG or engineering offices a
solution their experts have discovered
how to build a pool that doesn't take up
much space
turns out they simply had to make it
transforming pressing a button activates
the wooden pool cover you can walk on
the roof of the pool which can support a
significant weight when closed the pool
is not visible and doesn't occupy any
space in the backyard
it's important to note that not only AG
or engineering is developing
space-saving solutions
dr. deck specialists can build an
elevator in your yard that can lift
different furniture or hide it under the
floor in this case the retractable
barbecue grill is demonstrated the
manufacturers website indicates that
this solution is ideal for people who
don't like it when something ruins the
view but at the same time love to
receive guests and arrange receptions
here's another invention from the
company dr. Dax in this case under the
floor is not a barbecue grill hidden but
a bench note that the same materials are
used for the surface of the bench and
for the floor this allows the bench not
to be visible when folded when looking
at the wooden planks nobody will even
suspect that there's something hidden in
that place and this platform has been
created in honor of the Seattle Seahawks
a professional American football team
the construction as a decorative
function but if desired it can be used
as a table
one of dr. decks most useful inventions
is this phantom staircase as defined by
the manufacturer after pressing a button
the mechanisms are activated moving the
steps so that the staircase becomes a
ramp in this way it can be used by
people with disabilities at the same
time it saves space as a ramp separated
from the stairs takes up a lot of space
here we have nano wall SL 82 it's a
fiberglass construction that has won a
variety of design awards the most
honorable of these is the red dot award
as a result the Nano wall sr8 2 has
become the standard for all companies
producing similar panels the nanowar SL
8 there is a sliding folding panoramic
window that takes up the entire wall
space from the floor to the ceiling when
needed the window folds like an
accordion
note that when folded the design takes
up almost no space
here you can see how transformable glass
partitions work this design allows you
to divide the room flexibly and
therefore use it as efficiently as
possible
in this case the partitions function as
the walls of the room in their original
form they're securely fixed in a certain
position and don't differ in appearance
from the partitions of a standard
construction
only the support track located on the
ceiling gives us a clue of the ability
of the wall to transform suddenly it
turns out that the wall has several
components that can be moved along the
track separately and fixed in the
desired position using patented locks it
should be noted that the operation is
automatic so the process of assembling
and disassembling the wall takes almost
no time
most modern furniture the transformer
ball design is designed to save space
the bed especially if it's a double is
the largest piece of furniture in the
apartment so it's not surprising that
engineers look for different ways to
hide the bed to free up space we're all
used to sofa beds which really do help
save space
however specialists from the French
company fed-up came up with a
fundamentally new solution here we have
a bed that's attached to the ceiling the
basis of the designs a sturdy steel
frame a special mechanism raises and
lowers the bed where necessary for
greater stability during sleep the bed
is equipped with retractable legs the
bed you see on the screen is placed on
the table which can be complemented with
nearest shelves and lamps
it should be noted that before lifting
the bed to the ceiling it's not
necessary to even remove the blankets
the lifting system can support up to 80
kilograms of weight
here's an automatic ladder designed to
simplify and speed up attic visits
traditionally such ladders have a
foldable structure and needs to be
raised and lowered manually precision
ladders LLC is developed a mechanism to
remove or place the ladder with minimal
effort the material chosen is durable
yet lightweight aluminium you can change
the position of the ladder using the
control unit which is installed on the
nearest wall the ladder you see on the
screen was designed specifically for
residential buildings and can be
installed on ceilings with the height of
2.4 to 4 meters it's capable of
supporting up to 226 kilograms as well
another advantage is that the
transformation is completely silent
the Italian company filigrana already
produces kitchens in which literally
every centimeter has a specific function
the external panels can be easily
removed for washing the shelves of the
upper drawers can be extended and
lowered so that the user doesn't have to
reach out or stand on a chair the
workshops are equipped with hidden
retractable sockets in order to not take
up too much space with the extraction
system the manufacturers decided to
install it on the table at any time when
it's necessary it can be pushed back
some drawers for convenience have a
secret bottom
pay attention to the top shelves whose
doors open and close at the press of a
button
in addition these cabinets can be opened
by touching the sensors it should be
noted that all furniture is equipped
with lamps for additional lighting the
color of the light can be changed from
cold to neutral or warm with the help of
a control panel hey stop being lazy it's
time to use that brain of yours welcome
to brain time incredible facts from the
past the present and even the future the
power of nature and wild animals amazing
facts and unsolved mysteries you'll find
all this and much more hair subscribe
now you won't regret it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
