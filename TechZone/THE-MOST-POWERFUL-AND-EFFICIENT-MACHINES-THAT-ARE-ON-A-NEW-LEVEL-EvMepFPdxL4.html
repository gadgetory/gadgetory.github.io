I'm gonna be the voice in today's video
thanks for your understanding
chick lifts the structure you see on the
screen right now cannot be found
anywhere else in the world except in
Russia the shift lift of the Krasnoyarsk
hydroelectric power station is the only
ship lift in this country it was built
in 1976 and put into operation in 1982
this unique utility was built to ferry
ships along the Yenisei River the
structure consists of an outer harbor a
lower access canal the lift and a
turntable the lift is a platform that
moves along the rail track the track
width is 9 meters it is noteworthy that
each rail is supported by separate
overpass the platform is powered by
electric traction the loader is suitable
for weights up to 1,500 tonnes loading
and transportation takes place as
follows the platform is lowered below
the water level the vessel enters the
lift then the platform starts to move up
the overpass when the platform reaches
the top it moves on to the turntable it
moves the platform to another track so
that it turns around and lowers again
below the water level the boat then
leaves the lift amazingly the
construction lifts the ships to a height
of a hundred and four meters
Sandvik ds4 11 anchoring is almost
always carried out during mining
operations the main element of an
anchoring system is a rod made of metal
reinforced concrete's polymer or wood
mounted in such a way as to reinforce
the rock mass of course there are
special machines for anchoring the video
shows the ds4 11 drilling rig produced
by the swedish company
Sandvik it is used to mount the most
common types of anchors if necessary it
can be used along with steel mesh the
rock anchoring process is fully
mechanized and controlled by just one
person one of the benefits of this
equipment is a certified protective
visor which provides the operator with a
higher level of safety the diameter of
the hole can vary from 33 to 45
millimetres
the robust and reliable boom allows for
the installation of several rows of rock
bolts from 1.5 to 3 meters in length
without changes to the configuration got
Oni SBC 100 marble as well as similar
quarried materials can be very hard
that's why people use particularly
powerful machines for its processing
here is a stone cutting machine from the
Italian manufacturer alpha scene got ona
the SVC 100 is designed for cutting
dimension stones from solid rock in
quarries and mines such equipment is
usually classified according to the type
of working body in the god oniy SBC 100
the cutting tool is a chainsaw the
height to which the saw can be lifted is
2.2 meters the horizontal stroke of the
tool is 1.8 meters the cutting depth is
3.4 meters
surprisingly the 12 ton machine has
excellent maneuverability thanks to the
crawler tracks the machine moves quickly
around the site in addition the rack
allows the tracks to rotate 360 degrees
which means the machine can even move
sideways thus the machine can be used
even in the most confined spaces the
operator controls the movement of the
saw as well as the cutting speed via a
remote control
another advantage is the fact that no
water is needed to cool down the cutting
area also all operations are carried out
by just one person
skid-steer forestry mulcher this
attachment can be installed on virtually
any conventional mini loader turning it
into a real wood exterminator skid-steer
forestry mulcher is a mulching disc
developed by the american company
diamond mowers if you don't know
mulching is the process of covering the
soil with mulch to protect and improve
its properties mulch can be different
materials grass hay straw leaves but
most importantly bark and wood chips the
tool you see on the screen makes mulch
the device easily copes with trees and
branches up to 15 centimeters in
diameter the cutting wheel has a
diameter of a hundred and fifty-two
centimeters which is it's working with
cutting is performed thanks to 44
hardened steel teeth a remarkable
feature of the tool is that it works
like a flywheel accumulating kinetic
energy thus high cutting efficiency is
achieved because two types of energy are
combined accumulated energy and energy
created by the hydraulic mechanism
sound the QJ 341 here's another machine
from the Swedish company Sandvik the QJ
341 is a mobile jaw crusher designed for
a wide range of applications the
powerful and efficient engine can cope
even with high loads which is an
advantage a jaw crusher is a universal
machine for crushing rocks of any
hardness and the principle of operation
is based on compressing the working
surface the resulting high compression
and shear stress destroys the rock the
QJ 3:41 has a reversible crushing
function it is ideal when you need to
shred sticky material or eliminate
clogging it is noteworthy that the
hydraulic drive allows the crusher to
start even when it is already loaded the
manufacturer offers a variety of jaw
crushers but the QJ 341 is the flagship
of its range hydraulic supports allow it
to work on even the most uneven surface
ptc 200 DS this ring crane has a similar
design to other cranes but is aimed at
particularly large construction projects
the main difference lies in the presence
of a ring shaped salute pivots instead
of the usual wheels and tracks the base
of the crane is very wide in this case
for example its diameter can reach 90
meters thanks to it the crane rotates
and remained stable even under enormous
loads the PTC 200 DS is a ring crane by
Mamet its maximum payload is 5 tonnes
while the ballast way is 3.5 tonnes this
crane is used in situations where heavy
and oversized objects need to be
installed or where space is relatively
limited the boom is a hundred and forty
metres long but it can be equipped with
an additional section that varies in
length from 25 to 106 meters
CAD truck the construction of unpaved
roads is a much more complex process
than it may seem at first glance
first of all geosynthetics should be
rolled out on the surface to stabilize
it
moreover the material should be laid
tight without wrinkles the difficulty
with the next step is that as long as
the first bulk material is poured the
sheet must remain in the same position
the machine you see on the screen is
part of a patented system to lay roads
it was developed by specialists from
conveyor aggregate delivery truck note
how it rolls out the material and at the
same time stacks the bulk material on
top a dense and smoother laying is
possible thanks to a steel chain grading
that runs on the top
hey stop being lazy it's time to use
that brain of yours
welcome to brain time incredible facts
from the past the present and even the
future the power of nature and wild
animals amazing facts and unsolved
mysteries you'll find all this and much
more hair subscribe now you won't regret
it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
