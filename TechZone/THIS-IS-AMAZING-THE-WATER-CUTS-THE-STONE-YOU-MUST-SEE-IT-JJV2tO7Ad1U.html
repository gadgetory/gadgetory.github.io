machine in the world its name is the
true laser tube 5000 fiber the device is
equipped with a solid laser for the
production of tubes and profiles of
different classes it's characterized by
the precision of the cut which makes it
possible to produce very high quality
products they have an attractive design
and are therefore used for the
manufacture of furniture agricultural
equipment sports equipment machines and
various devices it should be noted that
the machine is equipped with an
intelligent system in order to produce
profiles more quickly even with complex
geometries in addition the machine is
designed in such a way that a single
cutting edge can cut materials of
different types and thicknesses
this compact universal laser seen on the
screen is mainly used for the production
of tubes of various types it should be
noted that this is one of the first
machines of its kind designed and
manufactured in North America for the
needs of the local consumers the vclt
100 is the optimal solution for creating
small volume round tubes as well as rods
with a diameter of up to 100 millimeters
in addition the machine can be used to
cut sheets with the size of five hundred
and eight by six hundred and nine
millimeters the main feature of the
machine is its compact dimensions so it
can be used in almost any production
area
now you'll see how decorative elements
for a wooden house are created fine
birch plywood is used as the raw
material for the production of this
decoration the pattern is only a hundred
millimetres long but due to the
abundance of small pieces manual cutting
of the wood would take quite some time
the use of a special laser machine can
significantly reduce production time the
cutting shape is set by the program
which means you can make elements in a
wide variety of shapes and sizes
ultra fast and highly accurate paper
cutting machines use lasers up to a
hundred watts of power the machine you
see on the screen is the boss LS 2436 it
has many configurations so cutting is
fast with minimal energy costs it should
be noted that this technology allows
even cutting at high speed without
leaving traces of burns or soot in the
mode you see on the screen the machine
cuts 35 millimetres of paper per second
using only 15% of its capacity among the
advantages of the machine is the use of
special DXF files that can be easily
found and downloaded from the internet
the boss LS 2436 can also be used to cut
soft and hard wood process metal acrylic
plastic leather and fabric when used to
its full potential
the machine is able to cope with really
complex materials such as granite marble
stone and glass fiber the video shows
how using only 75% of the power the
machine easily cuts birch plywood which
is about three millimeters thick the
working speed at the same time is 25
millimeters of material per second
brass is a material that can be cut
easily but to make a patent with many
details you must choose the right
machine so to create the rider that you
see on the screen a numerically
programmed device was used the nozzle
with a diameter of two millimeters has a
titanium coating which allows the
engraving to be carried out in such a
way that the high working speed doesn't
affect the precision and quality of the
final product
here we have an equipment that cuts car
discs using water jets it should be
noted that the water jet is the cutting
tool in this type of machine the fact is
that the water in the form of the thin
stream and under great pressure has
excellent cutting qualities therefore
it's possible to achieve high working
speed and precision without the use of
laser machines
a jet of water under really high
pressure is capable of cutting not only
metal but also stones the video shows
the jets edge water jet cutting machine
this device releases water a suppressor
of approximately 60 900 Pascal's
sometimes if very hard metals need to be
cut several materials are added to the
water the machines for the automatic
faceting of precious stones are designed
to increase the productivity of the
companies that produce jewels the time
has passed when it was necessary to make
a similar cut by hand
there are many teams of this type which
differ in power and configuration
the automatic gemstone cutting machine
which you see on the screen can make
approximately a hundred and eighty cuts
per minute a notable feature is the
ability to work in two modes the first
one allows strips to be left on the
surface of the stone and the second one
creates holes thanks to the flexible
configuration a wide variety of cuts can
be made with the help of a single
machine here we have the Platinum fiber
laser cutter designed to handle small
and medium width metal feet cutting
metal up to five millimeters thick where
this machine saves up to 30% at the time
cutting sheets thicker than 5
millimeters reduces the processing time
by 40% the machine is equipped with a
fiber laser whose power varies from 2 to
5000 watts it has high performance and
the laser moves along the axes at a
speed of a hundred meters per minute
numerically programmable milling
machines are designed to work with
complex and hard materials such as metal
wood glass and natural stone with their
help office boards logos advertising
structures and various elements such as
letters or patterns are created here we
have equipment frequently used in the
production of jewelry for the
manufacture of bracelets and rings the
creator of the cf9 CNC model is the
turkish company oz manly Makena the
machine is able to change the cutting
tool itself very quickly and therefore
operates in different modes with this
help you can cut patterns drawings
different engravings and even simple
points on the metal the laser heads are
connected to two axes who's working
angle is 180 degrees this design greatly
expands the possibilities of engraving
guys it's time to recharge your brain
this is the channel brain time there
you'll find a lot of interesting and
useful facts lots of positive energy and
tons of useful information subscribe
right now we promise it's going to be
really exciting</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
