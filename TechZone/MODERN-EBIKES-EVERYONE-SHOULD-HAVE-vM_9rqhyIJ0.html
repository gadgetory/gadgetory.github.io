switching from a regular motorcycle to
an electric bike Sol Motors specialists
decided to attract motorcycle
enthusiasts and created additional
incentive to switch through a more
environmentally friendly vehicle when
creating pocket rocket they put all
their effort into the original design
the bike was named the pocket rocket
because it really looks like a rocket
the electric bike is light weights only
55 kilograms mainly because the body's
main about the iminium the manufacturer
can equip the vehicle with two motors
depending on your needs
one develops six horsepower and the
other 8.5 horsepower depending on the
engine the motorcycle can reach speeds
of 50 or 80 kilometers per hour
cruising range varies from 50 to 80
kilometers depending on the
characteristics of the bike and your
driving style you can buy us a surprise
of six to seven and a half thousand
dollars
Scrambler fans of retro motorcycles will
definitely like this model from the
company juiced bikes scrambler is a
modern fast eco-friendly electric bike
with a body of a retro motorcycle it has
excellent technical characteristics so
that for relatively little money you can
drive even faster and go even further
the manufacturer offers three models
similar in appearance but with different
characteristics count City and hyper all
three motorcycles have a lightweight
open frame a long seats and a powerful
lithium-ion battery also the electric
bikes are equipped with a bright
built-in headlight LED display hydraulic
brakes
and a special anti shaking fork the camp
model is designed to ride over rough
terrain it can reach speeds of up to 45
km/h the city model is more suitable for
city driving its maximum speed is also
45 km/h the hyper model is the fastest
and more powerful traveling at speeds of
up to 54 km/h the price of the first two
bikes is $1,700 and hyper can be bought
for $2,700
moto spirit UPC the motorcycle which you
see on the screen was developed by
students of the California State
Polytechnic University it's noteworthy
that it was crowd funded through
Kickstarter about six thousand dollars
were donated for the project
moto spirit UPC has an aerodynamic
design it's equipped with an electric
motor the Heinzmann PMS 150 and a
six-speed gearbox there's no data about
the maximum speed however in the 2012 to
2014 season the motorcycle took fourth
place in a motorcycle race and in the
2014 to 2016 season it won first place
dehl fast modern electric bikes have
many advantages however almost all
models in the world have the same major
drawback a small power reserve on
average electric motorcycles can move at
a maximum speed for just a few hours it
might be enough to ride around the city
but no more Dell fast the bike you see
on the screen doesn't have this problem
it was designed specifically to beat all
power reserve records the manufacturers
manually selected every detail and
refines them to create a bike with
excellent technical characteristics
amazingly on a single charge Dell fast
is able to travel 380 kilometers
moreover this record was achieved on a
real Road and not in ideal conditions of
a test site Dell fast is available in
three models the prime model speeds up
to 55 kilometers per hour and can travel
380 kilometers the top model travels at
a speed of 80 kilometers per hour for
280 kilometers and the simplest light
model reaches a speed of up to 42 km/h
and can travel up to 180 kilometers
their price is fifty two hundred sixty
nine hundred and forty two hundred
dollars respectively
DC try on the screen you can see the
first three-wheeled electric bike in the
world at least according to the
developers a little more than a year ago
it was shown on Kickstarter is being
developed by inventors from Charlotte to
us the unusual design of the bike is
striking at first glance and you might
think that the DC tri has nothing in
common with a motorcycle nevertheless
the developers still call their creation
a motorcycle and highlight one unique
feature you can drive the DC tri is
standing the electric motor allows the
vehicle to reach speeds of up to 24 km/h
the battery capacity is enough to travel
50 kilometers and the three wheels
guarantee increased stability the super
Drive Safely for a long time and with
pleasure without any effort a notable
feature of the DC tries the display of a
handlebar which allows you to always
know the speed the travel distance and
the remaining battery power pay
attention to the bicycle fork with shock
absorption it reduces shaking and
vibration which ensures an even more
comfortable ride the price of the DC try
is $2,100
shop II the name of this vehicle clearly
states its nature the first part of the
name the word chop means that it's a
chopper the second pass the letter e was
added in because this is an electric
vehicle the vehicle is 2 meters long you
have to drive it almost half lying down
just like a real chopper the chopper
weighs only 63 and a half kilograms it
develops a maximum speed of 32 km/h and
on one charge of the battery located in
the rear the bike can travel up to 56
kilometres to the footrests attached to
the side of the front axle although they
give the bike an external resemblance to
a bicycle they don't spin they allow you
to position your legs comfortably
interestingly all the models shown in
the video are only prototypes the
project was launched on Kickstarter in
2015 and the developers said that the
trophy will look almost the same but
they're going to make some minor changes
and improvements

manufacturer this electric bike would
give you a fundamentally new riding
experience and would replace a couple of
exercises in the gym it's noteworthy
that they step up bike has a unique
design thanks to it the person during

centimeters tall

step-up bike an excellent vehicle that
will suit people of any Constitution</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
