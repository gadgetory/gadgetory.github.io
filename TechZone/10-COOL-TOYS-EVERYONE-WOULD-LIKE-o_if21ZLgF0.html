compatible with Lego toys was designed
to teach the basics of programming to
children from an early age it's worth
noting that you can play with this
device even without knowing how to read
because each element is identified with
symbols that are intuitively
understandable even for the youngest
children the secrets of programming are
learned without coding instead the child
has to organize the toy blocks in a
certain way following the instructions
it is possible to assemble all kinds of
robots baptized by the creators as algo
bots each robot has motors and sensors
that allow it to come to life algo BOTS
can be programmed to move rotate place
sounds or switch LED lights on and off
the sensors can react to light sound
contact or the presence of an object in
the proximity the game is compatible
with Lego products so algo bricks can
grow using them the device comes in
different versions in its price ranges

minutes the device comes with a small
special joystick that's placed on the
phone screen using a suction cup you can
buy this remote-control toy for fifty
eight and a half dollars
Foton like other toys capable of
teaching the basics of programming this
robot is controlled using a special
mobile application photon that combines
two visual programming languages scratch
and block play which allow children to

immediately the recreational parts of
the device has been developed based on
research by psychologists and experts in
the use of games in different areas of
life according to the story created by
the developers the photon spacecraft
landed on earth in an emergency and the
robot needs help to be able to work
again in the process of performing
different tasks photon will learn new
things and receive new possibilities
such as the option of avoiding obstacles
or following a specific path the
included sensors allow it to react to
different levels of light sound and
touch in addition the robot can develop

located in the geometric figures so that
each detail is connected to another
exactly at the edge a very interesting
additional function is the possibility
of attaching it with magnets to other
metallic surfaces such as a refrigerator
thanks to this the Builder does not
limit himself to using his own elements
and can be used in conjunction with all
