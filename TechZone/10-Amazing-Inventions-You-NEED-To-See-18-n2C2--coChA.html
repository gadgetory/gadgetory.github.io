of neutralizing vomit-inducing stinking
gas right to the face the lock hasn't
been tested in the field yet but the
developer as an honest person test
on himself and a few volunteers all of
them were impressed by the result the
smell is truly disgusting and the first
reaction is to run as fast and as far as
you can the gas doesn't bother anyone
except the intruder but can attract
attention of random strangers -
