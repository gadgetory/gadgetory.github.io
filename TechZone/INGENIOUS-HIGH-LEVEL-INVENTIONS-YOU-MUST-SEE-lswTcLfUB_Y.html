I'm gonna be the voice in today's video
thanks for your understanding
nagisa MC 650 metalwork pieces are used
in a wide variety of industries usually
they're used to create products such as
tables chairs doors handrails and fences
to get them section vending machines
like the one you see on the screen are
used this is a machine from the spanish
company nard esse specifically the model
MC 650
it is made of high-strength welded
sheets which guarantee the stability and
durability of the entire construction it
is ideal for creating items of the most
complex geometry it can be used to make
parts for sheds and bicycle parking lots
railing and pulls easily and quickly the
manufacturer states that the shaft
diameter electronic control and some
other performance characteristics make
the MC 650 one of the best pipe and
frame benders on the markets
note that the bending itself is carried
out directly by the rollers while the
metalwork these moves in between a total
of nine pieces are included in the sets
various combinations allowed to achieve
different forms of the finished product
thus it is possible to make a shaped
pipe a square a strip a circle a tee
profile a u profile or an angle
Jim line tape machine the marketing of
sports grounds is subject to very strict
requirements so it is almost impossible
to perform them correct by hand each
lane in the line must be precisely
aligned and in the right place up to a
millimeter that is why special equipment
such as the one you see on the screen is
used for marking first specialist
measure the space to understand where
the marking should be done then a
special machine which puts the adhesive
tape in the right place is used wheels
make it work faster and it's even easy
to apply the tape in a circle one person
holds the metal rail firmly and is
responsible for ensuring that the
machine moves in a smooth circle another
person drives it directly further on the
specialist paint the strip between the
tapes with a special roller when the
paint dries all that remains is to
carefully remove the adhesive tape the
result is a filled with the needs even
stripes
water jet cutter the inspiration for the
creation of this kind of equipment was
the erosion process people have noticed
that water flows can destroy soil and
even rocks they decided to experiment
with it so they invented water jet
cutter as a cutting tool water jets or a
mixture of water and abrasive material
are used the stream goes out at a high
speed at under high pressure and can
easily cut even the hardest materials
here you can see how dynamic robotic
solutions equipment works in the off
hours the experts decided to try to
create something beautiful out of a
steel ball and the result was a sphere
with continents engraved on it the
working pressure of the equipment you
can see on the screen varies from three
to four thousand bar it is carried out
by a means of a hydraulic pump with
electric drive the jet can move at a
speed of a hundred to five hundred
millimeters per second the width of the
resulting cut is adjusted by the
focusing nozzle and varies from 15 to 35
millimetres
Poole live a are modern people are
increasingly using devices that employ
augmented reality in one way or another
thus last year we learned how to
diversify the billiards game with the
help of augmented reality a special
projector with the camera is placed
above the table after that it tracks the
movement of the balls and the position
of the cue projecting on the surface of
the table various lines and patterns
Poole live AR will be most useful for
beginners who are not yet very confident
when playing billiards the point of this
device is that is able to determine
which trajectory the ball will roll on
relying on the position of the cue
thus the program can be used for
training and better understanding of the
principles of the game however pool life
AR will also help professional players
to hone their skills and on top of that
the projections in the table look very
beautiful and unusual
fiber laser marquee machine the German
company triumph specializes in the
production of special marking systems to
apply inscriptions and patterns on metal
and other materials such lasers are
widely used in the modern world for a
wide range of tasks thus they are ideal
for welding cutting or surface treatment
in this case a not too powerful laser
designed for shape cutting of thin sheet
material is used the equipment you see
on the screen can simulate text or
pattern using a laser diode with the
visible red light this allows you to see
the future result of the marking and
therefore place the part more
conveniently and accurately the laser is
controlled by a monitor a keyboard and a
mouse which means that the work would be
familiar to most people and it won't
take too much time to learn
and mill the equipment you see on screen
is manufactured by the German company
goo ring the end mill is designed for
processing flat surfaces ledges and
grooves and it can have large or normal
teeth the large teeth are used when
roughing metal on the other hand the
normal teeth are used when finishing or
semi finishing ledges and grooves
this particular end mill is the Goering
RF 100 it is a multifunctional tool with
an in feed angle of up to 45 degrees and
has an uneven spiral pitch this design
reduces the vibration level during work
in addition the irregular spiral pitch
allows for improved surface quality
during finishing operations
Custom Fit earplugs it is not uncommon
for headphones as well as usual and
sports earplugs to be uncomfortable to
use because they are too big or too
small to solve this problem custom
silicone earplugs were invented each
pair is made individually for its owner
the buyer comes into the workshop where
they make it cast over their ear the ear
sink is filled with silicone compound
previously protecting the ear canal from
getting deep into it the person spends
about five minutes with a mixture in a
still state during this time at a
hardens and the cast is ready then it is
sent to the manufacturer where the
earpiece itself is made
thanks to this unique design the
finished product fits perfectly in the
ear does not fall out it is noteworthy
that the earpiece can be used for a
variety of purposes for example you can
buy custom-made headphones they are used
to make personal monitoring systems and
headphones that musicians wear during
performances and of course these devices
can be used to protect the ears for
example while swimming</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
