harvester is equipped with a
high-performance spherical rotor and a
13 and 1/2 litre powertech engine with a
capacity of 530 horsepower the loading
area for grain has a capacity of 11,000
litres the s 690 i provides high
performance with low operating costs the
grain is placed into the separator in
three different ways
which leads to a reduction in the
bonding and agglutination effect and
also reduces energy consumption
as a result the translation speed can be
increased so it's possible to work under
almost any conditions regardless of the
conditions of the grade the unique rotor
design of the combine harvester with a
small number of moving parts reduces
energy consumption and ensures less
damage thanks to the gear spacing this
vehicle created by John Deere improves
grain and hay quality
Hue's go flex cover combi the truck of
the Dutch manufacturer DAF trucks NV in
combination with a semi-trailer produced
by Hugh Scott creates an innovative
agricultural vehicle this combination
can be used not only for the transport
of silage grain and fertilizer but also
for the transport of bulk items such as
building materials the truck body is
made of aluminium and can be expanded by
a modular design with flexible storage
capacity to allow the transport of
liquids and solids the vehicle uses a
special class scorpion telescopic loader
which increases the work rate
my LSB 850 this vehicle with a
super-heavy 25,000 pound bucket is
designed to collect and shape limestone
slabs the LSB 850 is equipped with a
unique clamping device in the blade
system which reduces machine maintenance
costs and shortens changeover times
between different operating modes thanks
to the design with a full convex blade
the model performs well and requires no
additional elements the bottom beam of
the Nile SB 850 provides optimal
conditions for the pick up of limestone
slabs and in addition the bucket is
equipped with a special mallet which
from the beginning divides the surface
of the stone or does not obstruct the
passage of the car with debris expand
our five on 90 this olive harvesting
machine uses a special technique that
consists of shaking the tree trunk the
process takes an average of 30 to 60
seconds while manual assembly usually
takes several minutes
the combine harvester works in
conjunction with another machine
equipped with a special mechanism first
of all it has an automatic folding
grooved surface of 36 by 30 feet on
which the olives fall after picking the
contents is sent to the combine
harvester where by means of a conveyor
belt all the fruits end up in the
container and are subjected to further
processing to remove the excess of grass
winter wheat harvest this combine
harvester is an excellent tool for
harvesting and processing winter wheat
this agricultural machine makes it
possible to increase productivity
considerably it's also worth noting that
it guarantees minimum losses when
working with large quantities of weeds
and other cereals the vehicle is
equipped with a special 100 knife
threader which processes the raw
materials for a reduced period of time
in addition this high performance
combine increases the harvesting rate
thanks to the automated working process
switching from grinding mode to roller
mode is possible by pressing a single
button a rotating element tilts the
stems toward a rotating cutting unit
installed at the bottom of the machine
in the next step the wheat is sent to a
special container which then returns the
processed content to the field while the
active spreader ensures uniform
distribution over the entire field
tulip bulbs harvest like many other
agricultural tools this vehicle also
works in conjunction with another
vehicle in this case we're talking about
the potato harvester the AMAC zm4 which
extracts flower bulbs using a method
similar to that used to extract potato
tubers from the soil after that the
contents are automatically poured into a
conveyor belt where with the help of
special technology excess soil and long
roots are removed while the material
obtained is washed and dried other
functions include packing the bulbs and
boxes and storing them until next year
asparagus Harvester Strauss
although asparagus harvesting is mainly
done by hand heavy vehicles can also be
used this tractor equipped with a
special self-propelled combine harvester
moves through the field in a straight
line his trajectory is calculated in
such a way that the protective whip
covering the asparagus is above the
height of the workers so as not to
interfere with their work
the metal rollers prevent breakage and
the arrangements of the wheels ensures
that the vehicle is protected from
damage during harvesting the mobile belt
installed along the entire combine
transports the asparagus upwards after
which the crop is packed by hand in
small boxes
ditch cleaning system these specialized
vehicles with several accessories were
developed to maximize the use of Natural
Resources with minimal costs in the
first stage a pit full of water is
cleaned removing excess grass and other
contaminants at the same time the bucket
increases the trench width by means of
braking movements and other working
technique is then used to carefully
process the trench
it's distinguishing feature as a special
device equipped with a caterpillar
mechanism our side saw the machine
performs two functions at the same time
firstly foreign objects have filtered
out and secondly the lawn is mowed along
the trench the entire process is
completed with the tractor that extracts
water from the trench and processes the
land
asphalt destroyer this vehicle uses a
special technique to cut and load
asphalt the thin metal disc makes it
possible to cut the required space for
the greatest precision and make a smooth
cut with precision in the next stage the
asphalt surface is fractured the
equipment clearly follows the
preliminary cut so the nearest sections
remain intact then with rowing movements
the broken asphalt is loaded into a
special container which by means of a
manually controlled mechanism sends the
contents to the wagon it is worth noting
that the vehicle has a hard brush to
remove asphalt debris if necessary
Brill Maya lawnmower this vehicle from
the German manufacturer Bria Maya can
mow the grass and organize it in a
certain way the lower parts of the
lawnmower is a combination of rubber and
metal studied wheels that allow easy
passage through any agricultural area
also the equipment is equipped with a
special compartment to process the Mount
grass using a large number of cutting
knives it should also be noted the easy
management's of the equipment which is
carried out remotely
