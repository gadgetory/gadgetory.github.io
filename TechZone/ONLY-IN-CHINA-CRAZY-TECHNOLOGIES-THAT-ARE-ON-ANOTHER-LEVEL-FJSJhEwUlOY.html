traditional public transport is that
buses or trams take up as much space on
the road as several cars a large number
of buses and trams make the traffic jams
on the road more critical but the
Chinese have figured out how to solve
this problem in August 2016 the Chinese
province of Hebei passed the first test
of a vehicle that many people called the
bus of the future the transit elevated
bus is a public transportation service
that moves above the roads over the car
flow which means it's not affected by
traffic jams and doesn't interfere with
traffic
the main task of this unique innovative
glass is to unload the Chinese roads the
model that was used for the tests is 22
metres long and seven point eight meters
wide the heights of the tracks laid for
the bus above the ground is four and a
half meters that means that cars less
than two meters high will be able to
pass under the bus with ease one
elevated bus can accommodate 300 people
as well according to the developers when
people ride the transit elevated bus
they'll feel the same as if they were
riding on the top floor of a
double-decker bus
solar panel expressway for several years
now key lu transportation development
group has been developing and building a
unique project solar panel highways the
first project was completed in September
2016 in Jinan in the Shandong province
the construction took ten months in
December 2017 the second project was
completed and the 1.6 kilometre long Jin
an expressway was covered with solar
panels the road you see on the screen is
one of the first solar highways in the
world
the roadway consists of three layers the
first is an innovative material with
these structural properties of asphalt
often referred to as transparent
concrete the middle layer is actually
the solar panels and finally the third
layer the bottom one is an insulating
material that protects the panels from
the damp ground the most important in
remarkable feature of such a road is
that it can charge electric cars while
they drive on it it's noteworthy that
although the solar panels themselves are
quite fragile the roadways designed so
the large vehicles such as medium-sized
trucks can move along it as well
floating solar farm solar power can
provide invaluable benefits to the world
as a renewable energy industry right now
China is the country that has the
highest installed capacity of solar
power this is where a huge number of
solar panels are produced and
commissioned even more than in Germany
Japan and the United States despite the
fact that these countries are considered
the leaders in green energy one of the
reasons for this is the incredible
degree of air pollution in China which
affects millions of people every day
refusing to extract and place as : favor
of using solar energy for China is not
so wavy butter processing most likely
this was the reason for the appearance
of the world's largest floating solar
farm this solar plant is located in the
city of whine man in the antique
province right above the flooded coal
mines the advantage of such a solar farm
is the fact that they produce a large
amount of electricity while not
occupying a place on agricultural land
and other valuable areas the farm was
commissioned in May 2017 and has a
capacity of 80 megawatts
hema Alibaba is a large Internet
commerce company based in haengju with
almost everyone in China using its
services in 2018 the company began the
process of uniting online and offline
commerce so a store chain called Hema
appeared it's rapidly expanding and last
year there were more than 60 such stores
their first glance these are the most
common supermarkets but they have a
number of unique features as they're
equipped with advanced innovative
technologies shopping is done for a
unique mobile application customers go
shopping and scan barcodes of goods they
want to buy
the app shows all the important
information about the products and can
also show recipes that use the products
being scanned when the order is placed
you can pay with your cell phone and at
some points there face-recognition boots
installed it's noteworthy that the
information about the purchase goods is
stored and the shop uses it to offer
online products with home delivery to
its customers the store staff puts the
purchase products in a bag and places
them on a conveyor belt from where they
are sent to the delivery center
according to the managers of the store
delivery to the buyers home within a
radius of 3 kilometers from this door
takes a maximum of half an hour
camera surveillance network if all the
technologies we've mentioned today are
admirable the technology we're going to
show you about now is unloving China has
developed the world's largest network of
surveillance cameras the video shows a
police station in cui yang city in the
grigio province it took the police
exactly 7 minutes to find and arrest a
man who is set up for an experiment
the fact is that the cameras installed
on the streets of the city are not just
normal cameras they use artificial
intelligence to scan and recognize
people's faces some cameras can also
detect approximate age height ethnicity
and gender and recognize clothing and
color the cameras also read numbers
colors and some other parameters
vehicles police officers have at their
disposal a huge digital catalog which
contains images of people permanently
residing in the city
the cameras are connectors at a global
network which means that at any time the
authorities can find out the location of
any person they want also these
surveillance system allows them to find
out who the person communicates with
where they are most often and how they
spend their time
fast the equipment you see on the screen
is the largest telescope in the world
with an area competetive 30 football
fields and a diameter of 500 meters the
full name of the construction is 500
meter aperture spherical telescope
abbreviated as first developments of the
project began in 1994 the construction
started only in 2011 the cost of the
project is estimated at 1.8 billion won
which is about 269 million dollars it
took about five years to build and on
September the 25th 2016 the radio
telescope was finally inaugurated in the
Grisha province the goal of the project
is to search for signals from
extraterrestrial civilizations to study
pulsars
high stakes Robot Wars for several years
now the DJI company has been holding a
large scale and very spectacular
competition in China called Robo masters
when the championship was held for the
first time it immediately attracted the
attention of robotic fans from the
United States
UK Canada Asia and other parts of the
world today young engineers from all
over the world take part in the
competition with as many as 200 teams
participating in 2017
although Robo masters is not the only
event of its kind the scale and
spectacularity of the competition is
simply astonishing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
