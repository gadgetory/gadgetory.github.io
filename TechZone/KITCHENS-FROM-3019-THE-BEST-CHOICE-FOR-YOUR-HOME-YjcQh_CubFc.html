however these sink is used much less
frequently than other surfaces in other
words almost all the time it takes up
precious space in the kitchen
specialists from the Australian company
Kim Duff InDesign offered their
customers a simple and effective
solution to the shortage of free space
in the kitchen they equipped the table
with a sliding mechanism when necessary
the surface simply moves to one side
giving access to the sink here's another
solution also designed to save space the
surface of the sink is equipped with a
sliding mechanism it should be noted
that the water doesn't extend over the
table surface but disappears into the
grooves
this hidden sink from franca USA has an
even simpler design than the ones we've
already shown however it solves the
problem of saving space just as well the
sink is covered with a lightweight
Universal door it could be used as a
cutting board also placed dishes it
should be noted that the design allows
the kitchen to be kept neat and tidy and
if you urgently need to hide dirty
dishes you can close the sink door a
special strainer can be installed on the
sink surface which greatly simplifies
the cooking process
this is an intelligent induction cooktop
for the total of eight zones it should
be noted that the two zones are flexible
which means that the stove analyzes the
surface of the pots and heat the exact
space this feature saves energy the
induction zones are joined together to
cook even in a regularly shaped pots the
temperatures change with a touch slider
on the stove has 19 power levels the
booster function allows you to heat the
pots quickly this grundig induction
panel provides a high level of safety as
the surface temperature around the
cookware is not heated
here's another invention by the German
company grundig it may seem to be just a
table but it has a very wide
functionality that has a built in object
recognition function when they use up
places of frying pan a pots or any other
cooking vessel on the surface the system
projects an interface in order for you
to select the cooking mode don't try to
find buttons as there are none the
control is simple intuitive and the
interface responds to the movements of
the hands once the cooking mode is set
the surface begins to heat up but only
where the pot is it should be noted that
the system can project videos on the
table too so that for example you can
follow the recipe on the Internet
another function of the table is the
electromagnetic field when an electrical
device such as a toaster blender or
speaker is placed here the system
recognizes them and also projects an
interface all of these devices are
wireless they work and our charge using
the electric field on the table
the extractor hood is an essential
element of every kitchen but if it has a
traditional design it takes up a loss of
space as a general rule the device
occupies the same space as a standard
cabinet the Italian company ellika
invented a way of making the extractor
compact and space-saving
that's how the induction panel with
included nikola tesla extractor appeared
it's Maine remarkable feature is quite
obvious the outer grill covers the
extractor equipped with ceramic forces
during the work the extractor uses the
circulation principle the air is sucked
in cleaned and sent back into the
kitchen it should be noted that Nikola
Tesla deals more effectively with food
odors as it is closer to his sources
than normal exhaust hoods
in addition the manufacturer offers a
model that takes dirty air from the
kitchen to the street curiously the
extractor adapts to the work of the
stove adjusting its power independently
the grid can be easily removed the
filters can be cleaned or replaced when
using the stove you don't have to worry
about the liquid that can come out of
the pots and fall into the extractor for
these cases there's a special
compartment that collects water and
doesn't allow it to reach the vital
parts of the mechanism the additional
benefits of the Nikola Tesla include the
function of connecting the cooktops
it is always more convenient to store
the most important objects in the
kitchen such as knives coffee and sugar
in an open and accessible place that
they're always at hand the only problem
is that when stored in an apron shelf
they accumulate dirt and dust if you
store the products in cans there's no
problem but dusty knives aren't very
pleasant the Canadian company moveable
spaces has devised a way to keep these
objects on hand avoiding dirt the
kitchen cabinets were equipped with
lifts so that when you need the utensils
you can easily reach them when you don't
need them they move around the inside of
the cabinets and don't accumulate dust
it's important to note that this system
among other things safe space because
the kitchen work surface isn't full of
objects the company also came up with
the idea of integrating the lifting
mechanism into other work surfaces in
order to be able to adjust the height of
the table and the cooking surfaces
here we have kitchen furniture whose
functionality is many times superior to
that of any standard kitchen the sink
has supports to dry the dishes it
consists of metal tubes in which you can
stack the wet dishes so they don't take
up too much space this area is also
suitable for the installation of a sip
the video also shows two functional
sinks one has a flexible faucet with a
holder and in the second the faucets
equipped with a shower hose which can be
taken out so that the water can be
pulled from any desired position at any
angle
the food and beverage cabinets are
spacious and they can have different
opening mechanisms the shelves and the
upper cabinets can be easily pulled out
and lowered this is convenience if the
kitchen owner is not tall or has
children some of the cabinet's thanks to
a special paddle can be opened with the
foot this feature is especially useful
because in the kitchen the hands are
usually physik in addition thanks to the
folding design of the doors that slide
into the special holes inwards a loss of
space is saved
