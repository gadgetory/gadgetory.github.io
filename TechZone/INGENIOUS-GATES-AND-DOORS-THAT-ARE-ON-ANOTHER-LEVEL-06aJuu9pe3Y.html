installed in the Italian municipality of
Volterra in Tuscany they're three and a
half meters tall pay attention to the
design though which was developed
individually for the customer
the advantage of these gates is the fact
that they save space when folded the
wings don't take up too much space the
fan like opening system allows you to
open and close the doors in seconds
today's door and gate manufacturers are
increasingly focused on saving space
this is most likely due to the growing
popularity of very small residential
areas when living space is limited all
interior and exterior elements must work
in order to save space chrome doors
manufactures such gates the wings are
hydraulically operated this case in
particular can be found somewhere in
Chicago USA even though these doors of
course save space by moving aside from
the wall the manufacturer opted for a
spectacular appearance and an unusual
construction at first glance when the
doors are closed the construction
doesn't differ from a proper gate the
amazing thing starts when the doors open
each of them consists of two squares and
those in turn are divided into two
triangles they're linked together so
that they can rotate interestingly the
wings can be manually operated by a
person or using a remote control
curiously gates with an unusual design
that first glance don't seem to be
anything special a person passing by
this closed gate wouldn't think that
they're unique in any way this case is
no exception it may seem that they open
to the side like any other but no they
folds like an accordion
the manufacturer of the gate that you
see on the screen right now spends a lot
of effort making them invisible and
indeed while all the other gates even
those with the most unusual design fold
to the sides or upwards fancy fences
disappear underground and are not
visible at all despite its unusual
appearance the construction is quite
simple the gate consists of a large
number of poles placed close to each
other each placed above an individual
hole of the asphalt when the owner
presses a button on the control panel a
hydraulic mechanism is activated which
fully pulls the poles down into the
ground
notably the fancy fence can be open
enclosed in response to a sensor mounted
on the owners vehicle the gate detects
its proximity and opens itself then when
the car drives away the poles returned
back to their place on their own the
manufacturer offers to use fancy fence
not only as a gate but also as a fence
in this case at any time when you want
it can be hidden for example in order to
enjoy the view from the window the
company that came up with this idea is
located in Poland at the moment
fancy fence is only available in the
u.s. South Africa Australia New Zealand
Finland and of course Poland
this is a high-speed door manufactured
by the British company Cova security
gates in general this manufacturer
offers a variety of doors with different
designs and appearances but we would
like to draw attention to the models CS
g10 685 this gate is similar to others
that we've shown you before because they
also close and open like an accordion
nevertheless the folding system is
unique
traditionally such gates use a special
truck on the ground or on the ceiling
for the wings this model does not need
such tracks which greatly simplifies and
speeds up the installation procedure
note that the gate doesn't even have a
frame the folding process is carried out
by a mechanism mounted directly on the
door as this mechanism is located at the
bottom of the door the upper part is
free so that it can be fitted with forms
barbed wire or decorative elements if
required
Deluxe has been manufacturing all kinds
of modern gates since 2009
this company installed the first you
negate in Malaysia it is a folding
accordion like design but without a
frame or tracks as well creating such
opening and closing mechanisms is much
more difficult than it may seem at first
glance as a rule that gates made of
heavy materials to ensure that the door
is strong and fully functional in terms
of security
the finished construction has a
considerable weight which means the
employees had to make sure that the gate
would not sag despite having only one
support point
they managed to cope with the task after
all you negate does its job perfectly
even though the past width is quite
impressive 9.1 meters the manufacturer
highlights the durability of the design
two tests have shown that the you negate
can withstand up to 50,000 cycles of
opening and closing the secret of
durability of the design lies in the
special holders which are made with
German technology in addition the Gators
attach to the fence at 12 points the
increased level of protection is
provided by an additional locking system
at the bottom which fixes the wings in
place please note that in the middle of
the road there's a platform needed to
fix the position of the closed gate
the accordion light design can be used
not only for gates that protect the home
from the outside world and unwanted
intrusion the same folding principle is
used by some companies that produce
doors leading to balconies or Gardens
pay attention to the tracks on the top
and the bottom of the construction they
make it possible to move the leaves and
provide stability the main feature of
these doors is that they practically
remove most of the wall erasing the
boundary between the interior and
exterior space
we've already told you today that many
accordion folding gates use frames
attached to their lower part although
this design can be considered
traditional it doesn't mean it's bad the
gate you see on the screen is mobile
opens and closes in just a few seconds
and is also very compact</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
