time-consuming and sometimes very
dangerous process traditional metal
cutting cells have a loss of
shortcomings they're expensive eat the
surface to a dangerous temperature and
send sparks in all directions due to the
fact that the tools have great power
their movements are difficult to manage
so the cut metal often is a great margin
of error the manufacturers of this
cannibal wanted to create an equipment
for cutting metals without all
previously listed disadvantages the
result is a powerful flexible tool with
a patented cutting method
it was created in order to perform the
work of metal cutting faster easier and
safer the blade located under the sheet
during operation removes small pieces of
metal at tremendous speeds and then cast
them aside this way it forms a clean
smooth flat edge the cutting process
takes almost no time at all the blade
bites into the material with such ease
as if it weren't even metal but
something softer the power of the tool
is enough to work with two millimeter
thick metal but this is not all Knebel
can be used for cutting sheet or
corrugated metal pipes profiles and
angles cutting capabilities of virtually
unlimited because the blade works
effectively with a variety of materials
it easily cuts stainless steel powder
coated materials copper aluminium
regular or fireproof plastic
moreover canibble is suitable for
working with fiberglass leather
cardboard paper or jeans
Diablo Steele demon the cussing action
in reciprocation source is achieved
through a push and pull or reciprocating
motion of the blade the working
principle is most similar to a handsaw
but the working part is driven by a
mechanism not by a human this allows
achieving the best results even when
soaring challenging materials steel
demon by American company Diablo is a
carbide blade that can be purchased in
different sizes its length can be 10 15
22 or 30 centimeters blade size is
chosen depending on the tasks that must
be performed carbide is a
high-performance very durable material
which provides the blade with greater
efficiency and durability
the tool is designed to demonstrate the
amazing impact resistance in addition
this blade was created to make even the
most difficult cuts with a minimum
vibration the manufacturer claims that
perhaps the most important advantage of
their blades is economy the fact is that
the Diablo Steel daemon is so durable
that it will last 50 times longer than
any standard blade besides not only does
it last longer but it cuts much faster
it's suitable for cutting three to
twelve millimeter thick metal it can cut
cast iron stainless steel high strength
alloy pipes and metal angles
the malkos esmd turbo fear the undoubted
advantage of this metal cutting tool you
see on the screen is that it doesn't
require purchasing additional
complicated and expensive equipment
interestingly at the same time the blade
makes two cuts at a small distance from
one another it cuts a narrow strip which
eventually twists into a spiral this
technology allows you to achieve a
perfectly clean straight edge on both
sides of the cut a notable feature is
the fate of the nozzle head rotates 360
degrees is possible to choose the most
comfortable and suitable working angle
the metal is cut from either end and you
can stop the work at any time you need
the tool is easily removed and doesn't
get stuck after that it's just as easy
to return it was working position to
continue cutting from the same place
it's suitable for sheetmetal even if
it's bent as well as for roofing panels
it ensures a 100% perfect result even
for 90-degree angles the material of the
blades is carbon steel and it
significantly contributes to their
strength and durability the process of
changing the blades is also simple and
takes only a few seconds the
manufacturer focuses on patented compact
telescopic clamps which minimizes
vibration and resistance and makes it
easy to operate either with one hand
rigid re sixty the manufacturer of this
tool claims they have created the most
versatile and flexible electric metal
cutting tool in the world amazingly
we're just a single tool you can perform
three different tasks cutting wire
crimping lugs or punching boxes that
first sites these advice resembles a
hand drill the tool comes with three
interchangeable heads it's noteworthy
that changing these heads takes only a
few seconds the one that looks like
curved scissors is designed to cut even
thick multi wire cables they are made of
high juicy metal and provided with very
sharp blades it's powerful enough to cut
through copper and aluminium building
wires up to 50 millimeters in diameter
interestingly the head grips the wire in
such a way as to fix its position
the wire clamped by the rigid re 60 is
not able to turnin hence the cut is
smooth and clean the second head has a
crimping head which just in a few
seconds is able to perform crimp lugs of
up to 300 square millimetres
interestingly it has a compact design
and therefore is able to work in
confined spaces the last one is designed
for punching in a matter of seconds it
punches holes with a diameter of up to
sixty three and a half millimeters in
three millimeter steel is worth
mentioning that the interchangeable
heads rotate 360 degrees to provide
greater comfort the device is also
equipped with a built-in lights and a
diagnostic system so that every time you
can perform a full working cycle
exact 360 air so cuts off pipes of large
diameter you have to use a special
instrument as the only way to ensure
optimum level of safety efficiency and
speed the exact 360 air is a
professional pneumatic pipe cutter that
works quickly and safely its main
purpose is cutting pipes in trenches so
it will be useful when laying or
repairing the pipeline it's noteworthy
that the tool is able to work even with
fixed pipes and tubes with water under
pressure inside
power tools can be dangerous when
working with water however the exact 360
air operates without using electricity
cutting a cast-iron pipe of 250
millimeters in diameter doesn't take
more than a minute the diamond blades of
the exact 360 air are strong and durable
can handle steel any kinds of plastic
stainless steel iron and aluminium
Hey stop being lazy it's time to use
that brain eels welcome to brain time
incredible facts from the past the
present and even the future the power of
nature and wild animals amazing facts
and unsolved mysteries you'll find all
