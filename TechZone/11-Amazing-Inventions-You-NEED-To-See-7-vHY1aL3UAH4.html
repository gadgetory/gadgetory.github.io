are some of the practical applications
of the new device Hydra light according
to the Environmental Protection Agency
more than three billion batteries are
thrown away in America each year Hydra
light is an alternative to traditional
lanterns as it uses salt water instead
of replaceable batteries as a source of
power at the core of the lanterns energy
cell is a carbon film cathode and a high
energy density alloy anode called the
power rod when salt water and
electrolyte is added the reaction
between these elements creates an
instant and continuous flow of
electricity the lantern features 16 LEDs
along with a USB outlet for charging
devices such as smartphones you can use
both seawater and regular tap water
that's mixed with a bitter table salt
one rod can power the lantern for over
250 hours before it becomes consumed and
shrinks in size when that happens the
rod is removed and a new one is inserted
making the cell like new and ready to
generate power
