that something used for safety could
also be fun monkey lyrics monkey lights
are rugged practical high-performance
bicycle lights that keep you visible in
all weather conditions the device is a
black weatherproof circuit board that
straps to your spokes and displays
full-color graphics on your bike wheel
monkey light takes advantage of a trick
of human vision called persistence of
vision creating thousands of amazing
patterns in a spinning wheel use a
web-based software to create your own
images and animations or choose from the
collection of custom artwork
the system has various sensors to track
the speed heads-up position and rotation
direction which allows it to keep the
display stable at different speeds
during acceleration and braking and even
if you ride backwards
Seavers cycle Adam bicycle power
generators are not a new concept by the
ones already on the market are often
bulky and can't charge at all when the
pedaling stops Sivas cycle Adam is a
highly efficient bicycle generator and
rechargeable battery pack designed to
power any of your electronic devices by
a USB whether it's your smartphone bike
lights or GPS gadgets plug it into the
siva cycle adam metal recharge as
quickly as it would from a wall socket
so how does it work a small gear inside
is engaged by the spinning of the back
wheel which then activates a generator
the rotation produces current which as
it passes through the internal
electronics is converted to usable
electricity the unit can be used in two
different ways charging your devices

distance of 250 meters
meanwhile the automatically activated 30
LED brake light is 2 times brighter the
LEDs are wirelessly connected to the
handlebar sidekick gadget with an

locks as a whole are sort of a losing
battle the extra weight of a u-lock is a
cumbersome distraction when you're
trying to focus on the trail and a cable

steel bands reinforced by Kevlar and
covered in santoprene plastic to protect
your bike from damage the locking head

lock which can be set to the numbers of
your choice the steel bands are quite
thin and layered in a manner that allows
the lock to be flexible and robust yet
resistant to cutting according to the
testing auto lock is able to handle
attacks from bolt and wire cutters
and it takes over 400 pounds of force to
pull apart the lock lane site
lane site is designed to offer increased
riding safety and comfort is the first
and only system that will provide the
cyclist with detection warning and
recording of potential traffic conflicts
Lane site constantly scans the road
using computer vision technology once
the approaching vehicle is detected the

taillights this alerts alternates
between red and white LEDs to help
ensure the driver sees you
simultaneously the system sends an
audible and visual alert to you on your
smartphone so that you also know that
the vehicle is approaching the device
measures and displays the lateral
distance from vehicles as they pass your
bicycle if for some reason the vehicle
is unusually close to the bike lane and
may possibly hit you the alert system
flashes at its fastest speed and records
the video footage onto your phone's
memory card that way you can always show
the footage to authorities in case of a
dispute Kobe Kobe is the first
integrator system which intelligently
connects your smartphone with your bike

experience
Koby consists of two parts a handlebar
mount with integrated battery headlight
and a thumb stick controller and a
software app that runs on your phone to
control it all the smart cell phone
mounts attaches to the bikes handlebars
wrapping around and over the stem it
packs a portable charger powerful enough
to top off an iphone about four times
the headlight uses a photocell to
automatically dim or brighten based on
ambient light conditions
meanwhile an optional réalité
functions is both a turn signal and
accelerometer control brake
with this the Kobe app covers the rest
routes with turn-by-turn music weather
and even basic theft protection
ride air ride air makes tire inflation a
much simpler and quicker task by
allowing urban cyclists to inflate their
ties on the go ride air is the perfect
solution for your bikes daily air
pressure maintenance and sudden flats
that always catch you off-guard no hand
pumping is required one such of a button
and it will fill a completely flat tire
within seconds its 650 milliliter
aluminium air tank can hold up to 21 bar
with a built in dial gauge displaying
its current pressure when done inflating
just stick the pump into your backpack
or in a standard sized water bottle cage

compressed air supply you just fill it
up again at a gas station bike shop or
elsewhere
the device can also be utilized for
tasks such as inflating sports equipment
and inflatable toys which does add to
its value CT lock one of the major
downsides of bicycles is that they get
stolen and if your bike doesn't get
stolen your saddle most likely will CT
lock addresses both problems at once
being a bicycle saddle that transforms
into a 1 meter solid lock simply unhinge
the saddle open the foldable lock and
lock it surround the bicycle and post CT
lock is made of steel overlaid with
plastic to protect the bike frame
placing the lock underneath the seat
ensures the device is located in the
bicycle center of gravity meaning the
riders won't feel like they're carrying
any extra weight each cc lock comes with
a universal adapter that enables easy
compatibility to any standard bike on
the market
