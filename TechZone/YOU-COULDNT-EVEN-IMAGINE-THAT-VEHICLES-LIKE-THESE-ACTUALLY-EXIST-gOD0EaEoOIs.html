healthier alternative to other types of
transport as it's possible to move
around the city receiving the necessary
dose of daily physical effort however in
adverse weather conditions cycling is a
problem so in Sweden they invented the
pod ride pedal car this vehicle will
allow you to exercise and at the same
time drive comfortably as if you were in
a car
ha droid is small and maneuverable able
to pass even narrow places the
four-wheeled velomobile is equipped with
a naught point 3 3 horsepower engine
it's covered with a soft surface which
not only protects against wind rain and
snow it also gives the vehicle a toy
look it should be noted that pod wide
provides a more comfortable ride than a
normal bicycle the user can sit in a
wide soft chair leaning against their
back handling is done by levers that are
just under the arms without the need to
reach the luggage compartment is not
very spacious but a trolley can be
attached to the bicycle the way to the
vehicles only 70 kilograms and the
heights doesn't exceed 145 centimeters
and the width is 75 centimeters the
manufacturer even installed heating on
the front mirror and a manual windscreen
wiper there's a fan to keep the windows
from fogging up as well hot rod
accelerates to just 25 km/h and one
charge is enough to travel 60 kilometers
the velomobile is not yet on the market
as the developer is looking for
investors however we can reveal that the
price will reach $3,000
yo smart connecting carts whoo some
people think that mini cars are the
future after all they are compact and
maneuverable take up little space both
on the road and in the parking lot and
are also more economical and affordable
modern manufacturers are therefore
spending more and more time developing
vehicles that have very small dimensions
one of them is a car known as the EO
smart connecting car to the small
vehicle is distinguished not only by its
original appearance but also by the
unique structure of its wheels which can
rotate 360 degrees in this way the EO
smart connecting car too can be moved in
any direction even sideways and
diagonally this makes it an ideal
vehicle for the streets of a city full
of cars - people confess insiders four
engines power the vehicle as well one
for each wheel the car is electric and
its power is provided by a lithium ion
and phosphate batteries its charge lasts
approximately 50 to 70 kilometers while
the full charge takes four hours the car
moves at a speed of 65 kilometers per
hour which means that it can be used on
most roads both inside and outside the
city
earth-1 for a long time only large
vehicles could boast of the ability to
transform earlier this year the world's
first transformable mini auto was found
it was developed by a group of engineers
for the Japanese company for Link
systems it should be noted that the art
is cuneo a Kawara author of the animate
Gundam worked on the design of the
vehicle for this reason the appearance
of this car is often compared to an
anime robot but back to the most
interesting thing the transformation
engineer's have provided the earth one
with a remodeled frame and is normal
mode the car is compact and maneuverable
it can even pass through the narrowest
places however after pressing a special
button the elements of the cus separate
making the car longer when unfolded the
car is less maneuverable but can reach a
higher speed at the moments the cars are
passing the last tests after which
they'll be mass-produced according to
preliminary estimates the price of this
transformer will be $70,000
LSE V in the spring of this year a car
was shown for the first time most of the
visible details of which were printed on
a 3d printer
this is LSE V it weighs only 450
kilograms and has an extremely compact
size 1.5 metres wide and two and a half
meters long it should be noted that Li
CV is not just a prototype created to
demonstrate 3d printing technology the
creators have built a printed car which
will soon go into series production
literally in the second quarter of next
year
the cost of the car will be
approximately 7,500 dollars surprisingly
the only elements that were not created
through 3d printing were these chassis
seats and windows the unique design of
the car significantly reduced the number
of parts LRC V is assembled from only 57
components while a standard car requires
about 2,000 details it's also worth
mentioning that the development of a
standard car takes three to five years
the idea of Alice Eve Eve became a
reality in just one year
despite its unique design the car is
fully functional can reach speeds of up
to 70 km/h and travels up to 150
kilometers on a single charge
Smart vision eq4 - in 2017 smart
presented its new car project in
Frankfurt as part of the presentation of
the smart 2030 generation like other
cars of the future vision EQ is
completely electric and completely
autonomous the main feature of the car
is that it's designed exclusively for
car sharing the need for traditional
taxis is supposed to disappear in the
future
we will call an autonomous car indicate
the destination after which all we have
to do is sit back and wait for the end
of the journey vision EQ as a compact
size its length is only two point six
nine meters however it is quite spacious
as there's no steering wheel pedals or
other control parts in the cabin the
dashboard has been replaced by a 24 inch
screen which shows all the necessary
information about the route and status
at the car the grid has also been
removed - and replaced by a 44 inch
screen which displays several messages
city transformer here's a car that was
shown this summer at the Tel Aviv
innovation week
techno exhibition it's size is so
surprisingly small that the city
transformer arrived to the presentation
using the passenger elevator the car
weighs only 450 kilograms but at the
same time it can reach speeds of up to
90 km/h the distance between the axles
has a folding structure ie the car is
transformable and can slightly change
its own dimensions and adapts to the
road
unfortunately these cars will not be
available for sale in the near future
the developers claim that city
transformer is a prototype which will
serve to produce an unmanned vehicle in
the future
