can be very different but it turns out
you can get an adrenalin rush without
even leaving your car although the car
should be special for example this green
rock dog the vehicle that you see on
your screen is an electric prototype
such cars have not yet been
mass-produced nevertheless this
hydraulic all-terrain vehicle stands out
for both its appearance and outstanding
technical characteristics this unique
design of the wheels allows the car to
overcome obstacles of up to two and a
half meters high at first glance the
green rock dog evokes associations with
a spider and just like these creatures
the car is able to move in very
difficult terrain
the car is the result of the long work
of a man named Alec Jaeger an Abbott
rock climber when folded the green rock
dog is quite compact its width is about
one and a half meters when the car
expands the wheels its width increases
to 4.2 meters
it's noteworthy that each wheel has a
completely independent suspension
that is its height and the trajectory
just depend on the movement of the upper
wheels it can move on rough terrain at a
speed of 60 km/h however of course while
overcoming obstacles the crawler moves
much slower
hum rider everyone has been in a traffic
jam when the cars barely move and you're
dying to get to your destination at such
moments people usually dream about
vehicles that could overcome traffic
jams so such a car already exists it's
the hum rider this vehicle can be
considered a jack car a transforming car
and even a car for future all thanks to
the unique structure of the wheels after
pressing a special button in the cabin
the car spreads its wheels and then
rises to a height of slightly less than
2 meters in this state it's able to pass
over passenger cars without touching
them the vehicle was created by the
American company a to z FX and
unfortunately it's the only model
creates it not even for sale but just to
attract attention the basis for the
transforming car was a Jeep Grand
Cherokee
Gibbs amphibians at the moment most cars
are not built in a way that would allow
them to swim on the water as easy and
simply as riding on the roads however
there are companies that are developing
and influencing such a technology one of
them is Gibbs and fib Ian's the most
significant work of its specialists are
their sports amphibians the Quadski and
the Quadski XL according to the
manufacturer the Quadski XL is the
world's first two-seater quad that can
move both on land and on water it can
easily reach speeds of up to 72 km/h
cutting waves or leaving behind a column
of dust at first it may seem that the
quad Suki XL is a common ATV with the
standard design but everything changes
when it goes into the water
the driver presses a special button
after which the wheels are folded and
then pulled inside that wheel arches the
transformation takes only five seconds
and the developers paid special
attention to the safety of the structure
special sensors determine the surface on
which the ATB right and don't allow it
to take out the wheels in the water or
vice versa to pull them in on land such
vehicles are on sale now and you can buy
them for $40,000
but the motorcycle at the same company
called the buy ski is still just a
concept now the company Gibbs amphibians
is looking for investors to mass-produce
its sports amphibians this model is more
suitable for fans of high speed driving
as on lands the buy speed develops a
speed of up to 128 km/h the speed of
driving on the water is much less up to
60 km/h but this is actually still quite
progressive on lands the buy ski looks
like an ordinary motorcycle and in the
water it's more like a scooter it's know
worthy that this transformation doesn't
take more than five seconds
interestingly the company gives
amphibians has been producing amphibious
vehicles since 2003 when they created
their first unique amphibian they were
inspired by James Bond movies
at a karma 7900 function motorhomes can
have very different sizes and designs
not every model can boast of having a
specially equipped parking lot in a rare
compartment but the Atacama 7900
function can moreover this house on
wheels is also equipped with a hydraulic
lift which despite the considerable
weight at the car raises and lowers it
it's amazing that competing models are
able to accommodate only a passenger car
in the parking compartment
the Atacama 7900 function is equipped
with a spacious parking space which can
fit a Suzuki Jimny in it's not very big
but it's still unless you make such
vehicles are produced by the Austrian
company action mobile the 7900 function
belongs to the model range of motorhomes
Atacama and combines creativity and
amazing functionality according to the
manufacturer the company action mobile
produces quite a large number of
different mobile homes
the Atacama 7900 function is one of the
largest models mainly because the
parking environments has a very
impressive size
aeromobil 4.0 for a long time people
have been dreaming of cars that could
soar into the air
in recent decades various global
companies have been developing new
technologies to finally reach this
future where we will fly to work instead
of walking or taking a bus
a new prototype of a flying car the
aeromobil 4.0 was shown in Frankfurt
about a year ago it is amazing but
according to the manufacturer very soon
this model will be available for alder
the very first process up the arrow
mobile 1.0 was shown to the public in
1990 it's expected that in 2020 the
first real flying cars will be seen on
the streets however the cost is quite
high about one and a half million
dollars for one vehicle
the arrow mobile 4.0 has a futuristic
appearance the wings are equipped with
solar panels that power the battery as
well according to preliminary data the
power reserve of the arrow mobile 4.0 on
land will only be a hundred kilometers
but by air it will be able to move up to
a distance of a thousand kilometers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
