twisted in a variety of ways and some
companies do it by hand just like in the
old days of course this process is
extremely time-consuming it takes a lot
of time and effort to process one metal
element the video shows the work of
specialized equipment that performs
metal rod twisting without human
assistance a fairly large number of
companies produced such machines here
you can see a universal machine tool
with computer numerical control by
American company Hebo
this is blacksmith equipment to perform
a variety of tasks for example it's able
to perform torsion that is to produce a
twisted pipe from a conventional round
steel one the use of special stamps
allows you to make metal curls for the
equipment other functions of the device
include easily and quickly rolling
Endings bending work pieces are making
baskets it's noteworthy that two
different types of forging cold and hot
are used to process different results
for example in order to roll out the end
of the rod it's heated so it's processed
by the method of hot forging in other
cases cold forging is used when the
desired strength of the metal is given
by force
candy-making due to the nature of the
production the preparation of any type
of candy is a very exciting process in
this case you can see how the American
sweet salt water taffy are made they
were produced and sold for the first
time in the 1880s in Atlantic City of
the Jersey Shore the main feature of
this product is it's sweet and salty
taste despite the name in the production
of saltwater taffy salted ocean water is
not actually used water and salt are
added separately during the production
condensed milk is mixed with corn syrup
then regular sugar is added as well as
inverted sugar
the mixture is constantly mixed in an
industrial mixer and when uniformity is
achieved 100 percent chocolate is added
when the mixtures ready it's poured on a
special tray for rolling at this stage
smoked sea salt is added mixed and the
rolling begins when the future candy
cools to 36 degrees Celsius it's a gang
placed on the equipment for rolling here
the product is saturated with air the
dark part of the candy is ready the
light part is made in the same way but
butter and liquid smoke around it to the
mixture this is how the classic candy is
made and additives are used to get other
flavors when both pieces of candy are
ready they look like long thick strips
that have folded together twist it and
then pulled out until they're thin he
remains only to cut the thin strip into
small pieces and pack them
calligraphy calligraphy is one of the
branches of art that goes back to
ancient times there are many types of
calligraphy such as European and East
Asian calligraphy
also there's Japanese calligraphy as
well as Arabic Armenian and Indian
calligraphy here you can see the
creation of Turkish ornaments using a
special marker the main difference from
a usual marker is the ink it doesn't
spread on thin paper it doesn't leave
traces therefore allows you to
accurately perform even the most
delicate work note that all patterns are
done with the left hand
marker calligraphy is only one of the
varieties of this art in order to create
patterns masters also use brushes and
special fountain pens
non Newtonian liquid non-newtonian
liquid is a substance with special
chemical properties thanks to them if
you interact with the substance quickly
and abruptly in the cup
solid if you do it slowly it acquires
the properties of a liquid there are
quite a few substances that have
properties of non-newtonian fluids of
various extents
these include toothpaste butter jam
ketchup mayonnaise and yogurt if we talk
about natural non-newtonian liquids we
should mention larvae and honey
interestingly even our blood has similar
properties to some extent
to demonstrate the work of non-newtonian
fluid a substance called blue black is
often used because it has the most
pronounced properties it's very easy to
make as well water is just mixed with
cornstarch the video shows the world's
largest swimming pool filled with
Oobleck to fill the 8 metre long pool
that took nine tons of new black see how
the liquid maintains the person and the
cyclist on the surface when they push
off hard enough but it doesn't hold when
the cyclist ceases to act on the surface
with sufficient force
sports protection since recently a new
material that can absorb the energy of
impact has begun to be used during the
production of armor for soldiers and
players in American football
at first glance it may seem that this
orange slime is a children's toy for
this material is able to bring the
protection of the human body to a whole
new level goo was developed by
specialists at the British company d3o
this material has unique shock
absorption abilities when it's at rest
the molecules inside move freely and
chaotically the lump is flexible viscous
and has properties similar to water
but if you try to hit it the molecules
form a structure locking into each other
this hardens the material instantly
absorbing the impact energy when the
impact stops the lump returns to its
original relaxed State this material is
used to create inserts for protective
clothing sprinkles there is a huge
number of confectionery toppings but the
production process for most of them is
approximately the same first warm water
is poured into the industrial mixer and
confectionery fat is added the resulting
mixture is poured into another mixer
where there's sugar powder and food
coloring the amounts and color of the
dye determines how the sprinkles will
turn out within 50 minutes the
ingredients are mixed and then they move
to the extruder
this is a special equipment that
processes the resulting mass and turns
it into a homogenous mixture it's pushed
through the holes to turning into tiny
thin sausages then they're dried and
load it into a special drum which breaks
the dried sticks so that they acquire
the usual size of sprinkles the
resulting mass is covered with a special
glaze so that their sprinkles won't lose
their color then it's passed through the
filter only the sticks suitable in size
are selected after that it remains only
to mix the sprinkles of different colors
and send them off for packaging
curling stones the production of heavy
stones is for curling begins in a
granite quarry a monolithic piece of
granite is chosen in this case the size
of a car and cut into thick strips each
strip is painted marking the diameter of
the future curling stone next special
machines for cutting stone a used one
cuts out round pieces from granite the
second one drills holes in the middle
later this will be the basis for the
handle then another machine with the
help of diamond blades grinds the stone
to make it round after the processing of
one side is finished the stone is turned
over to do the same on the other side it
looks almost finished but the stone must
go through several other stages of
processing so that it eventually turns
out perfect
finally a plastic handle is attached to
the stone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
