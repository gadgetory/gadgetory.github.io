effective and affordable ways to make
your home more comfortable is installing
underfloor heating this is a special
system with heating elements underneath
the flooring thanks to the adjustable
temperature the surface of the floor is
pleasant to the touch and doesn't burn
as it sometimes happens with traditional
heating elements there are several types
of underfloor heating the first is a
water system it uses hot water which
passes through special pipes to heat the
floor the pipes are laid in a spiral or
zigzag shape on a heat repellant
material as a result heat only flows
upwards directly heating the floor the
second option is electric heating in
this case cables attached in mats or
special sheets serve as heating elements
they're connected to a thermostat or
some control system the video shows the
installation of a heating system with
water pipes the interesting thing about
the procedure is that mats with special
protrusions are used to fix the pipes
this significantly speeds up the
fastening process and you don't need to
use a stapler to fix them once in place
the self-leveling floor is poured over
the mass
interior door installing a door may
appear to be a simple procedure that
even an inexperienced person can perform
however although the process of
installing the doors isn't very
complicated there are many details to
consider first of all numerous
measurements need to be carried out
correctly after all even a small
calculation error can result in a
twisted door affecting its functionality
and appearance the next challenge is the
correct assembly of the doorframe in
this case glue is used to join the
elements together this means you need to
work quickly and carefully
to ensure that the structure is strong
and remains intact steel fixtures are
used to connect the door until the glue
dries
the Finnish doorframe is secured with
special clamps and supports workers also
fill all gaps with foam inserting the
locks into the door is often a difficult
task which also involves many precise
measures but not in this case because a
special template is use that facilitates
the work
self-adhesive mosaic tiles any worker
who's ever laid a large number of small
mosaic tiles on a wall knows that this
is a long and extremely strenuous
procedure that's why modern building
material manufacturers created this
mosaic that could be glued all over the
room in a matter of hours construction
workers who value their time and strive
to increase productivity choose this
material self-adhesive mosaic tiles
consist of tiles as well as an adhesive
film to which they are glued it should
be noted that the material from which
the tiles are made can't vary the most
common material is glazed ceramics and
this option is only suitable for
interior decoration because of its high
water absorption properties another
fairly common material used to make
tiles is glass this is the best choice
for bars or swimming pools as glass
doesn't absorb moisture however there is
also a drawback glass is a fragile
material the scratches easily therefore
workers don't install it on the floor
tiles can also be coated with thin metal
plates and of course you can buy
self-adhesive mosaic that imitates
natural stone it's usually made of
marble quartz travertine or feathers
dropped ceiling dropped ceilings are one
of the most common ways to finish a room
that's what these workers are doing
right now this technique is very popular
for its great number of advantages for
example it's easier to mount a lighting
system on a drop ceiling it can also
absorb sound and insulate the room
provide ventilation and even protect the
ceiling from the fire and don't forget
the decorative function dropped ceilings
are often chosen to hide ventilation
ducts pipes and cables among other
things its eliminates the need for
leveling a dropped ceiling is usually
made of drywall panels which are
attached to a wooden frame or in our
case metal profiles it should be noted
that gypsum board has a treatable
material which offers additional
advantages for example you can arrange
special hatches on the ceiling to access
communications the material is not water
resistant so it's not recommended to
install it in the bathroom by the way
this room already had low ceilings but
choosing a dropped ceiling does not
significantly reduce the size of the
room
the hike loss is minimal and doesn't
exceed seven or eight centimeters
natural stone mosaic here we have a
master who's always ready for challenges
and doesn't look for easy ways to get
the job done
this increases the value of its work as
it makes the final result unique and
exclusive the mosaics seen on the screen
can be used to decorate the floor of any
front yard as a rule it's located in the
center of the front yard on the terraces
or in the entrance areas of the house
natural stones such as granite and
porphyry
is used to create the mosaic porphyry is
a rock with an irregular granular
structure stone mosaics can also be
assembled with marble pieces but in this
case this material is not used
if you think that the master probably
spent a lot of time laying the stones
properly you are not wrong the video
shows the final stage of the process
since natural stone has a variety of
shapes the pattern is first assembled as
a draft without glue each stone is
carefully selected so that the final
result is pleasing to the eye
only after creating a perfect draft the
elements are placed with global
floor renovation finally we'd like to
show you a building material that you
probably didn't even know existed at
first glance it may seem like you're
looking at a concrete slab floor however
that's not entirely true this tile is
95% recycled and is an eco-friendly
alternative to traditional paving
methods it's resistant to temperature
changes decomposition mold marks stains
scratches and cracks in shorts the
performance properties of the material
are not inferior to those of
conventional tiles
however the blocks are thinner lighter
and are easier to install the blocks are
mounted on a special substrate each
element has protruding parts that are
inserted into the substrate providing
optimum fastening elements at the edge
are subjected to a higher load so
workers place them on top of an
additional layer of adhesive we want to
highlight another unique feature of this
material this tile can be installed on
any floor which makes it an ideal choice
if you want to quickly and effortlessly
renovate the appearance of your front
yard
