transported on a platform with a hundred
and ninety two wheels leading the
structure as a Peterbilt 3 5 9 truck
this tractor is equipped with a six
cylinder Caterpillar 3406 engine whose
power reaches 425 horsepower carrying
this cargo the vehicle speed does not
exceed 10 km/h and even at small turns
the hull construction reduces the speed
to almost zero this hose away to the
cargo hold by the pizza belt 3 v 9 in
the platform can be more than 400 tons
the whole transportation process is
controlled by workers on site and also
remotely by dispatchers
the vessel Baltic 175 pink gin sex is
one of the largest ships of carbon fibre
in the world
it's almost 54 meters long therefore the
transportation that this large vehicle
was carried out with the help of
powerful trucks that were connected to
each other and also equipped with a low
level platform from the manufacturer
gnostic owner pal Valu projects it was a
21 kilometer road trip the total weight
of the transported cargo was about a
hundred and sixty tons so the average
speed was ten kilometers per hour the
itinerary was created beforehand and the
road signs interfering with the
transportation process were removed
pipe piles are one of the most common
types of building structures use for a
variety of tasks from building unloaded
foundations and fences to capital
construction bridge construction and
other large-scale works the length of
these piles can vary from 3 to 40 metres
so it's very important to correctly and
carefully transport them for this
companies usually use mercedes-benz
Actros 3353 trucks with additional
platforms the cars equipped with an 8
cylinder diesel engine with a capacity
of 530 horsepower transportation is
carried out by securely fasting the
piles to the surface of the platform and
the average safe speed of the truck does
not exceed 15 km/h transportation of the
wagons of the class 800 electric train
is carried out using trucks produced by
the Japanese company its hacci these
cars are equipped with special platforms
from the AL Ellis group each wagon is
reliably fastened to the platforms using
iron cables and chains and it's worth
noting that the trucks engines can
develop a relatively high speed on the
highway thanks to its power engine which
significantly reduces the time of
transportation this unique
transportation system has an increased
flexibility and load capacity of up to
600 tonnes the platform can be used to
transport generators turbines engines
transformers and much more it's 95
metres long and the unique flexible
design allows not only so ideally
overcome sharp turns but also to travel
on rough terrain the advantageous ratio
of deadweight and payload allows you to
reduce the pressure on the axle to 12
tonnes even if you need to carry the
maximum why
these self-propelled modular conveyors
are rather complex machines that deal
with the transportation of super heavy
loads in short distances
thanks to their design these conveyors
can be arranged lengthwise or across
depending on the customer needs and the
cargo dimensions each line of this
module has eight wheels and a carrying
capacity of about 40 tons for example to
transport a heavy transformer weighing
about 416 tons you need 400 wheels for
even distribution in this case the axes
are controlled by a computer and the
entire machine if necessary can be
controlled by one Operator
depending on the task and model the
system can rotate each wheel
individually up to 90 degrees
thus you can achieve maximum and neutr
ability of the entire structure
the Volvo fh16 is a series of heavy GT
large capacity trucks that can perform a
wide range of tasks depending on the
version one of the models is a truck
that can travel on roads with a hard
surface and work on difficult terrain
performing several industrial and
construction tasks the overall length of
the car varies from five point six to
twelve point one meters or being 2.4
meters wide without external mirrors and
from three point four to three point
five meters tall working in conjunction
with strong platforms this truck with a
capacity of 750 horsepower is capable of
both transforming into a road train and
transporting really massive objects for
example drum details whose weight
reaches a hundred tonnes with a diameter
of seven meters
the heavy-duty tractor the Trojan 88 7c
has outstanding performance economy and
reliability it's equipped with the
Allison's 6620 transmission providing
optimum traction continuous power flow
from the engine to the drive wheels
which used fuel consumption and
efficient braking the peculiarities of
the tractor design is the possibility of
compiling a road train from several
units of equipment for the
implementation of super tonnage
transport each Trojan 88 7c has a
payload capacity of 300 tonnes which
means that a column of three tractors
will provide a carrying capacity of 900
tons the road train connected by
pneumatic lines and by means of an
electronic can bus is controlled by the
operator of the main tractor the
centrepiece of this unique truck is the
fully automatic 6-speed Allison 6620
transmission in combination with the 700
horsepower volvo penta engine the
reliable trojan tractor transmission
provides emission reduction and fuel
savings of up to 40 percent compared to
previous models
this massive vehicle has a modular base
and is equipped with hydraulic control
the eight wheels along each axis can
withstand even the most extreme load of
up to several thousand tonnes in this
case the load on each axle can be up to
thirty six point six tonnes these
platforms are used to transport
components of power plants petrochemical
plants tanks and other massive elements
as a traction device the vehicle uses
standard trucks such as man
the Latour Noel 2350 loader created by
the American company Letourneau Inc
which specializes in the production of
earthmoving machinery is by far the
largest wheel loader in the world the
lot saw Noel 2350 is used in the mining
industry particularly in the extraction
of iron and copper ore the bucket is 7.2
meters wide and as a volume of 40 cubic
meters it uses a powerful hydraulic
system to lift up to 72 tons of payload
the loader is equipped with a 16
cylinder diesel engine with a capacity
of 65 litres and 2300 horse power it
consumes almost 170 litres of diesel
fuel during one hour of work the loaders
overall height is 6 and a half meters a
vehicle of this size as a rule is not
transported to the place of work
entirely but instead assembled from the
imported parts right in the quarry
the special heavy trucks CNC you for 80
are used in order to deliver the huge
blades of wind turbines to a 3,000 meter
high mountain after a 5.5 kilometer
route 30 units of this model were
specially created by the Chinese car
building companies see IMC the wind
turbines blades weigh 12 tons each and
have a length of 52 meters it takes an
hour to move one kilometer is such a
heavy load the highly specialized truck
that you 480 with an equipped mass of AC
800 kilograms has the 12 litre 480
horsepower Chinese diesel engine why c6k
for 60/40 the cnc you 480 has a
two-speed planetary swing and a 16 speed
synchronized gearbox given that to carry
an oversized cargo on a mountain you
often have to brake for protecting the
braking system au for 8 is equipped with
a retarder</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
