difficult and lengthy process is behind
us today most countries will provide
quick wash services where the car is
driven through a specially equipped
tunnel it may be quite different but the
idea in the process is similar
the video shows have fully automated an
autonomous car wash which is performed
in China by Shui Fuu here we also see
the German cut wash line Christ washed
systems the first step is to rinse the
car this is done to remove dirt and sand
from the vehicle the next step is
soaking in this case special chemical
reagents are used that can remove road
grime interestingly the composition of
these reagents is such that their
destructive only to dirt and don't
damage the paint in a third stage the
washing of the car begins large brushes
installed at different angles are used
to clean dirt on absolutely all surfaces
horizontal vertical and inclined
even the wheels of the cars are cleaned
for special round brushes after drying
by traditional methods some stains often
remain on the surface of the car for
this reason a growing number of
companies today prefer to try with
compressed air the moisture droplets
when the cars are simply blown away the
final stage includes cleaning the cars
mirrors and frames
some companies for example Walther
tunnel carwash in Australia which is
washing a Lamborghini also provide in
Syria cleaning surfaces but they are
usually done manually by specially
trained personnel this Washington all
has many advantages for example it
provides a high washing speed an
excellent end result and a minimum
number of workers in one hour hundreds
of cars can pass through it since human
contact is minimized the possibility of
damage to the car is practically nil
bus's the washing of large vehicles such
as buses can also be done using a tunnel
equipped the large number of brushes it
is true that the brushes and the bases
to which they were attached must be
larger the video shows a washing system
consisting of five brushes the water is
sprayed onto the surface of the bus
after which the brushes scrape off any
excess dirt interestingly even though
the average bus height is three meters
the brushes even clean the roof
with the help of a similar cleaning
facility it's also possible to clean
trucks special vehicles tractors and
semi trailers the systems shown in the
video belongs to the company man-machine
group and is equipped with a control
panel and a chemical reagents accounting
system which makes its use autonomous
and simple it provides a single
continuous cycle of brush rotation and
has a program to protect the front
mirror
other carwash models offered by this
company also have an adjustable height
and width for claiming buses of various
sizes
truck absolutely all cars need to be
washed regularly even those with unusual
dimensions the washing system you see on
screen was designed by hydro chem
systems in such a way that it cleans any
vehicle in less than three minutes it
uses soft water for work which allows
detergents to be used more economically
in addition it provides the possibility
to use warm and hot water this is also
an advantage as with cold water
detergents act less efficiently soap
foam is applied to the surface
thoroughly and uniformly allowing a
perfectly clean surface to be obtained
without a single speck of dirt
the washing is done with water jets
which clean the truck at different
angles under high pressure
thanks to their soles surfaces including
the wheels and chassis are cleaned
train trains have a special design
they're very long move along the rails
and therefore washing equipment must
also be special the German company
Christ wash systems is involved in the
production of rail vehicle washing
systems in other words they can be used
for both trains and trams
the video shows the C 7000 s o a rail
car wash it's rotating horizontal
rollers clean even hard-to-reach areas
such as the rounded front and rear parts
the side rollers whose power is
controlled by the control panel
guarantee a uniform and complete
cleaning result by the way they have
different lengths this design allows
even curved side surfaces to be cleaned
optimally it should be noted that the
washing of cars has done in motion the
Train moves along the rails forward
while the rollers clean dirt and dust
from their surface planes the larger the
vehicle the more difficult it is to wash
the height of the aircraft can reach 24
meters the length of the world's largest
serial passenger aircraft is almost 73
meters and its wingspan is almost 80
meters the weight of standard aircraft
as a rule exceeds 200 tonnes as you can
guess cleaning an aircraft from dirt is
a very difficult task
here we have a Nordic diner the most
powerful and technological machine for
aircraft washing the production of this
equipment is carried out by the Swedish
company aviator Nordic Dino is a
computerized an autonomous system
consisting of a mobile energy unit spray
nozzles and huge rotating rollers the
entire system equipped with a remote
control is designed to ensure safe and
easy operation with the participation of
a single person
according to the manufacturer this is
the most reliable economical and safe
way to keep the aircraft clean the
engineers did not forget to equip the
washing device with special functions
designed to prevent accidental damage to
the surface of the aircraft the video
shows the washing of the aircraft using
the model Nordic Dino 4380
it's designed to wash the world's
largest aircraft this washing system can
even clean the world's largest cereal
passenger aircraft the Airbus a380
