tank of the excavator holds 1585 litres
of fuel with an average fuel consumption
of 35 liters per hour a Rex these
excavators equipped with special parts
for demolition of houses of different
height operates under the constant water
pressure of active parts which greatly
facilitates the deformation of walls
regardless of their material as a result
of squeezing the edge of the surface it
starts breaking which leads to a partial
or complete collapse for example in the
case of working with beams
the massive movable claw can also hold
fragments of the building and safely
lower them to the ground without
creating unnecessary noise during the
dismantling process the maximum working
height of this excavator is about 230
feet which allows using it even during
the demolition of multi-story modern
buildings the machines operating weight
