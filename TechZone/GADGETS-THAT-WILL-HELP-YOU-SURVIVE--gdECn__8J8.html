different looks and designs however
these sneakers that you see on the
screen stand out among other models in
the world for their uniqueness they're
made of steel
the material is a chainmail of very
small rings paleo Barefoot's are
chainmail socks which are adjusted to
the leg and then fixed with an elastic
lacing the surface though rigid doesn't
cause any discomfort the feet almost
don't feel the fuse according to the
manufacturer these are the best shoes
for running and just walking on rough
terrain in the forest on dirt or on sand
besides paleo Barefoot's can give a
person something that no other shoes can
the possibility to be close to nature
the manufacturers argue these statements
by the fact that 70% of human receptors
are located our feet a nature created us
in this way for a reason
despite the fact that the shoes are made
of steel they've still very light the
waist of each sneaker is approximately
200 grams it's noteworthy that paleo
Barefoot's can be cleaned in the
dishwasher as well their price is 250
dollars
tenth fist drop requirements imposed on
camping equipment and moreover survival
are usually quite demanding they have to
be light compact reliable and at the
same time provide the owner with maximum
comfort the tent fist roll from the
German company Heil planet has all these
characteristics when folded it takes up
no more space than a standard sleeping
bag the weight of the whole construction
doesn't exceed two and a half kilograms
separately you'll have to carry a
compact pump as the tent unlike many
others is inflatable the tent is
supported at the expense of the
inflatable frame isn't it worthy that
the process of installing the tent takes
no more than a minute after which it's
ready to use
you might think that it doesn't look
very reliable however the manufacturer
claims that fist roll is able to
withstand even extreme weather
conditions interestingly the design is
meant to support the tent under all
circumstances if one part of the frame
has been damaged the other will keep
holding it in the correct position the
manufacturer offers several tents of
similar design of various sizes at a
price ranging from five hundred to five
thousand dollars
Gerber tools you never know when a sharp
tool might come in handy a standard
knife even a folding one can take up
precious space in the bag this is the
GDC zip played by Gerber it's a part of
the series of many gadgets created by
this company and equipped with a tiny
but very sharp blade the GBC zip blade
has an optimal design for camping
because their size allows you to always
keep it at hand its price is $15 in case
you have to deal with a hard material
you can use another knife by Gerber
known as the hunting vitals there this
knife is focused on tourist and hunting
needs it can safely cuts even the most
solid materials it's ideal for cutting
dense fabrics one of its advantages is
the possibility of easily replacing the
blades the price is $12
the key feature of the next tool is the
absence of a knife
however the compact dime travel can
perform many different functions the
multi-tool is equipped with pliers wire
cutters screwdrivers tweezers and a file
there's also a tool for removing
insulation spring-loaded scissors and a
universal hook you can buy the dime
travel for $13 the font S bottle far
from civilization
finding drinking water can be a serious
problem and a real headache this is a
bottle that allows you to stop worrying
about that font s is the world's first
bottle that can be filled independently
the secret lies in a unique design that
allows you to get water literally from
the air in order to do this you need to
connect the bottles to a special station
that comes in the kit
it's equipped with a fan which drives
the air through a special filter and
then through the condensation chambers
inside them the coolers force the liquid
to condense on the surface and then it
flows into the bottle the Fonz's bottle
is powered by solar cells so you don't
even have to carry any batteries the
speed of filling the bottle depends on
the temperature and humidity of the air
and ACS and 90% humidity and 30 to 40
degrees Celsius are ideal conditions for
the device to produce half a liter of
water from the air in an hour there are
two models of this bottle as well the
usual Fonda's arrow cost two hundred and
fifty dollars and if you want the model
to cyclists the Fonz's ride you'd have
to pay two hundred and twenty-five
dollars
pure to go
here's another device that allows you to
produce water in the wild effortlessly
actually even if you're in this city for
example traveling you can never be
really sure the water you're about to
drink is pure pure segoe solves this
problem most standard water filters
don't destroy the bacteria in the water
they detain them but they keep
reproducing inside the filter piers ago
has a completely different design
according to the manufacturer it's able
to kill germs and bacteria
thus the device is not actually a water
filter but a purifier it's noteworthy
that the process of water purification
does not take any time the dirty water
is poured into one end of the purifier
after which the same water but just
clean immediately flows from the other
hand cleaning cartridges are replaceable
so for $95 pure segoe will serve many
many years

surviving in the wild away from
civilization you need to be ready for
everything bad weather can easily catch

tighten blankets and sleeping bags are

originally developed by NASA the fabric

hundred and 26 grams there literally
fits in the palm of your hand at the
same time the material is able to detain
up to 90% of the human heat thanks to
which you can sleep under the blanket or
in the sleeping bag and feel warm in
