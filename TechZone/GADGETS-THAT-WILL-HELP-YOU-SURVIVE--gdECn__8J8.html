connect the bottles to a special station
that comes in the kit

the air through a special filter and
then through the condensation chambers

to condense on the surface and then it
flows into the bottle the Fonz's bottle
is powered by solar cells so you don't
even have to carry any batteries the
speed of filling the bottle depends on
the temperature and humidity of the air
