doorbell for your smartphone
the device is installed in a place where
a usual doorbell should be and is
connected to your phone or tablet via
Wi-Fi
skybell has an integrated camera and a
motion sensor so it allows you to see
any visitor it also notifies you when
someone approaches your house or your
apartment for the night time as an
infrared sensor
after someone rings the doorbell the
call is transferred to the mobile app so
you can talk to your guests or turn off
the sound if you don't want to be
disturbed
practically skybell can serve as a
peephole and a surveillance system
the device is connected to the
electrical system of your house so you
don't have to worry about batteries the
casing is made out of plastic to prevent
interference with Wi-Fi signals and the
plastic itself is immune to UV light and
corrosion
skybell cost $199 flip-phone this
extraordinary concept from designer
Christian Larsen has three touchscreens
in the form of a triangle flexible Super
AMOLED displays are protected with
Gorilla Glass the sides of the aluminium
frame are highlighted by coloured LED
lines the three screens give you a lot
more possibilities than a usual phone
it'll come in handy especially when
working with files images graphic and
text editors books and so on the
keyboard is on the backside of one of
the three parts of the flip phone
besides the construction makes this
phone a doc itself for example when
you're watching videos or photos or
using it as an alarm clock sprayprinter
in recent years graffiti stopped being
considered vandalism and became a form
of art but it's very difficult to create
something really beautiful with spray
paint and it takes a huge amount of time
and a great talent
so a start-up in Estonia started
producing sprayprinter a device that
will help you create an impressive
graffiti
you
using an app the gadget turns any photo
into a bunch of pixels easy to print
with a balloon
sprayprinter consists of two key parts
the printer module connected to a paint
balloon and a camera module for your
phone
the device is fastened to the spray can
and using the app releases the exact
amount of paint at a certain point at
the canvas that way you get yourself a
pixel painting even if you haven't used
a spray paint before
you can upload your own drawings and use
two balloons at the same time
you
the idea is quite interesting but the
price of $200 doesn't make everyone so
happy apart from that it turns out you
can only use a special paint made by the
developer Carl Audi the future is here
you know that when you see the Carl Audi
navigator this device is very special it
can be put on any vehicle in seconds and
all the information is displayed
directly in front of you on your
windshield Carl Audi exchanges data with
any Bluetooth enabled device and the
information on the windshield is seen
clearly anytime a day or at night the
system is completely voice controlled to
keep your hands-free
unlike other navigators Carl Audi
doesn't boss you around with a weird
artificial voice
instead it lets you give the orders
the compact device fits any dashboard
without blocking the view skin track a
group of developers from Carnegie Mellon
University created a technology to
control smartwatches without using a
touchscreen or buttons
skin track detects touches on the skin
by using electrodes integrated into the
watches strap and a special ring this
way your wrist expands interactions
beyond the confines of the small watch
face
the researchers found that they could
determine when the finger is touching
the skin with 99% accuracy the control
will cause no problems even when dialing
texting or playing
the skin track technology is a
two-component solution in the wristband
there are four pairs of electrodes that
touch the skin to triangulate the
position of your finger in 2d space
the second component is the ring which
propagates a low-energy high-frequency
signal through the skin the frequency is
fixed so it won't interfere with the
tracking system according to the
developers the price won't be that high
and skin track shouldn't discharge the
battery of your watch too quickly
