has released several amazing sports cars
known for their convenient handling and
insane speed this car can reach 60 miles
per hour in just 3.7 seconds and the
maximum speed of the car is 200 miles
per hour the capacity of the engine is
noteworthy under his hood the car
generates 440 horsepower however most of
these machines creates between 1996 and
2006 were banned in the u.s. due to
non-compliance with safety regulations
also the design of the 2003 TVR Tuscan
chosen by the manufacturer caused it
many problems with Supervisory
authorities the fact is that Peter
wheeler who owned the company at that
time decided that the airbags and the
automatic braking system give drivers a
false sense of security and can cause a
large number of accidents therefore
during this ten-year period he didn't
equip them in any of the models and as a
consequence these cars are not allowed
to ride American rose
Marcedes fo 15 luxury in motion the new
luxury sedan Mercedes fo 15 luxury in
motion presented in Las Vegas at the
International Exhibition of consumer
electronics 2015 is equipped with an
autonomous control system and as an
example of the future of automobiles the
fully working prototype of the
mercedes-benz fo 15 can move both with
the help of the driver and autonomously
thanks to the complex system of radars
and sensors this car recognizes markings
traffic signs and traffic lights this
model is able to autonomously take the
right decision in the most difficult
traffic situation the car is equipped
with two electric motors that generate
270 horsepower which allows the Mercedes
to reach 60 miles per hour in 6.7
seconds but there's a little problem in
several cases the law requires unmanned
vehicles to have a steering wheel
installed on the driver's seat and a
person inside the car who in an
unforeseen situation could take control
of the vehicle
for this reason India banned the use of
both this car and other unmanned
vehicles
lotus elise s1 focus more on speed and
maneuverability than safety all elise
models released from 1996 2001 were
blacklisted by the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration in earlier
models of this car there were no roof or
windows to reduce the total weight of
the car allowing it to go from nought to
60 in just five point eight seconds but
an engine power of a hundred and
eighteen horsepower and a weight of
1,600 pounds this car could easily reach
a top speed of 150 miles per hour is
made it fast and furious
however Lotus took things farther and
created a model without a hydraulic
steering wheel and without a brake
booster and this in turn did not satisfy
American security services Toyota Hilux
this pickup truck is famous all over the
world for being practically
indestructible the power of the Hilux
engine is 177 horsepower and the maximum
speed of the car is a hundred and ten
miles per hour apart from being
extremely quiet while working the
capacities of the vehicle are
outstanding they can pull a tug weighing
three point two tons
that's one ton heavier than the car
itself the Toyota Hilux is one of the
most reliable cars on the market but US
residents can't drive this car in their
homeland at least in the near future the
Hilux has a turbo diesel engine and due
to non-compliance with US environmental
regulations for air quality it's not
available for import
HSV Maloo r8 the company Holden special
vehicles has modified a number of models
including those made by other
manufacturers one of them the Maloo r8
is a general-purpose car which has been
produced since 1990 in 2001 the r8 set a
world record as the fastest pickup truck
reaching a speed of 165 miles per hour
the version of this car with a manual
transmission could reach a maximum
engine power of 591 horsepower
however this car never reached the u.s.
borders the car was marked as being too
dangerous and since the small amounts of
Maloo r8 models were released no one has
ever tried to prove otherwise
Alfa Romeo 8c spider 2010 only 500
spider models and 500 comput it's the
only models that this car were produced
in 2010 the vehicles equipped with a
soft top roof which must be manually
disconnected from the windscreen and a
450 horsepower engine the technical
characteristics of the car allow it to
reach 60 miles per hour in just four and
a half seconds so it's not surprising
that this car was recognized as one of
the best creations of the company but
because of this engine power this model
automatically didn't get permission to
enter the US market and you won't see it
on the roads of this country
nissan skyline r34 GTR 1999 despite the
fact that nowadays Nissan cars can be
seen on the roads of any American city
it was not always like that
the main problem of course was that
nissan produced right-hand drive cars
which was uncomfortable or even
unacceptable for the united states and
such cars were heavily taxed meaning
that the cost was a hundred and fifty
percent higher than in other countries
in addition in the early stages of the
importation of these cars into the
country there were many problems with
all the technical novelties of the
vehicle according to one version the
skyline was one of the first cars to
display various statistics about the car
during its operation and the amounts of
computer innovations seriously troubled
customers
volkswagen amarok like many other cars
on this list
Volkswagens offspring was also banned in
the u.s. despite the fact that most
countries happily allow these cars on
public roads according to some captures
American experts the Amarok does not
have some vital safety functions
necessary to be approved and apparently
in the near future this car will not be
able to ride the streets of the United
States however the states are not the
only country with a Volkswagen Amarok
faced serious difficulties in some areas
of Moscow photo and video cameras
decided that the car was a Loeb truck
and prohibited it from entering certain
areas at the same time serious financial
penalties are levied for violation of
the ban and to date there is no way to
cope with this technical malfunction
Jaguar xj220 s 1993 this car released an
own limited edition in 1993 was an
everyday version of the famous racing
car the xj220 safe produced by the
famous company Jaguar in fact it was one
of the company's very first supercars
and according to some sources the most
expensive Jaguar car ever
unfortunately in attempts to adapt the
classic racing characteristics for
everyday needs
the designers reduce the weight of the
car by 440 pounds which made it very
uncomfortable and even unsafe in
addition that typed pedals the lack of a
hydraulic steering wheel and the extreme
simplicity of the cabin made steering
the supercar physically difficult in an
urban environment the calling to
unofficial data the maximum speed of the
Jaguar was 220 miles per hour which also
banned the car from public roads
TVR Sagaris another TVR car on our list
the Sagaris is also famous for its
complete non-compliance with safety
regulations in the car there are no
airbags nor an anti-lock brake system
and all because of the strange ideas of
the owner of the company on drivers

security reasons you probably won't see
any TVR cars in the US guys it's time to
