see on the screen was discovered quite
recently in 1999 it is the result of the
work of two British engineers dr. Phil
Greene and Richard Palmer from the
University of Hartford sure throughout
its 20 years of existence d3o has
revolutionized the markers of protective
equipment today manufacturers around the
world increasingly use it for their
inventions in its normal stays it is an
elastic and flexible material but once
subjected to physical force the
properties of d3o change it becomes
incredibly hard and absorbs the impact
energy the experiments with d3o are
really impressive
for example they person's arm is wrapped
in this material and then hit with a
heavy hammer incredibly the arm remains
intact also the impact doesn't deform
the material in addition the shock wave
is distributed over the entire surface
eliminating the chance of feeling pain
therefore this material is ideal for
creating protection for athletes
military and other security professions
d3o does not suppress movements while
providing optimal protection even when
applied in a thin layer today sports
equipments and bulletproof vests are
made of this material
growing robots this invention was
created by specialists from Stanford
University in 2017 a group of engineer's
showed a special robots that can grow in
any direction the development can be
used in a variety of fields from
construction to rescue operations
basically this robot is a soft
transparent tube that can be inflated
and turned in any direction creating
soft robots is very difficult but they
can interact safely with a person and
reach otherwise inaccessible places it
is noteworthy that the robot can move
autonomously it is equipped with a
camera at one of its ends a special
algorithm controls the position of the
target and ensures that it is always
within sight in this way the robot
always knows in which direction it
should move the robot can turn by
changing the pressure in certain
cavities and interestingly the air
pressure inside the robot is enough to
lift up to 70 kilograms it will be an
indispensable assistance in
search-and-rescue operations the robots
ability to carry things like water or
mini sensors to their destination is
also very useful the miniature version
of the robot can be used in medicine as
a catheter two cables for the
installation of communication networks
can also be placed inside the robot
traffic stop robot the police have a
duty to stop cars all the time
typically police officers approach the
drivers doors who check his or her
documents putting their own lives in
danger statistics showed that at least
4,000 police officers are attacked each
year in such situations SRA
international specialists have found a
way to solve this their idea is to
expose robots to risk instead of
people's lives the robot you see on the
screen is specifically designed for
situations where a police officer needs
to stop a suspicious car when the car
has stopped instead of approaching
himself the police officer consent the
robots
the device is equipped with a camera so
that the police and the driver can see
each other the driver can show the
documents that the camera and there's
even a special panel for signing
documents the robot is equipped with a
printer that can print out the phone if
necessary the device is a metal frame
mounted on a police car to date it's
just a prototype it was shown just a few
weeks ago however it is clear that it
will be possible to install this device
on any car of any brand or model to help
as many police officers as possible
Kittyhawk flyer the dream of people
being able to fly whenever they want is
gradually coming true partly because
today there is already an existing
prototype of a giant multicopter capable
of transporting people flyer is the
creation of the American company Kitty
Hawk created and financed by Google
co-founder Larry Page the single seater
flying device is equipped with 10
electric propeller motors powered by
lithium polymer batteries fly air is
capable of speeding up to 32 kilometers
per hour in this case with the passenger
onboard it rises three metres above the
ground the device is made of a
high-strength material it is lightweight
aerodynamic and waterproof the
developers say that its handling is
simple and intuitive as the system
consists of only two elements
the Frog when a person tries to lose
weight or build muscle they are faced
with the unpleasant facts that they have
to repeat the same annoying exercises
over and over again
that's why experts around the world are
trying to find solutions that offer more
variety during training this is how the
Frog was invented it has a very unusual
design so even experienced athletes will
learn something new the device makes you
choose between training each muscle
group individually or working all the
muscles at the same time the
manufacturer points out the large number
of modifications which allows it to be
easily adapted to the needs of any user
for example the kit includes four and a
half nine 18 and 27 kilogram elastic
resistance bands in this case up to
three bands are placed on each side of
the device
the cost of the equipment's is $1,500 a
single person can assemble it easily and
quickly without using special tools once
disassembled the device takes up
virtually no space and fits easily into
the back that comes with it Aria Matic
240 an automatic straight cleaner can
save time and money spent when cleaning
the streets manually the Italian company
technological systems by mauro
manufactures these devices the model
shown on the screen is the area Matic
240 the equipment is designed to be used
by one person
however the operators efforts are
minimal essentially the device is an
electric vacuum cleaner fitted with a
recognition system it allows the machine
to see where the operator is and
automatically follow him or her the
device is compact and maneuverable which
makes it ideal for working in crowded
and narrow spaces the Aria Matic 240 is
capable of collecting both urban and
industrial wastes
the manufacturing shells that are thanks
to the built-in filters the emission
level is minimal it should be noted that
a recognition system not only sees the
operator but also the people around it
which improves the safety of the device
if there's risk of collision the machine
just stops the speed of the device is 6
km/h the continuous operation turn
doesn't exceed 10 hours and the waste
container has a capacity of 240 litres
hey stop being lazy it's time to use
that brain of yours welcome to brain
time incredible facts from the past the
present and even the future the power of
