behind the house aren't that
aesthetically pleasing and can ruin even
the most beautiful lawn the creators of
this amazing innovative system thought
long and hard about how to make the
trash bins be there and not be there at
the same time the solution is simple a
lifting platform that most of the time
hides the bins underground
the first glance Beauvais girl looks
like a beautiful round flowerbed with
plants decorative stones and even a
small fountain everything changes though
when the person presses the button on
the remote control the flowerbed begins
to rise showing a big round elevator
underneath big enough to hold up to four
garbage cans inside they can all be 120
liter bins or two of them can be
replaced for two hundred and forty liter
containers the depth of Bo Vega is a
hundred and sixty-five centimeters the
width of the flowerbed is a hundred and
sixty-seven centimeters the system works
on electricity and costs about eight
thousand dollars
underground waste bin by aka bins on the
streets help to keep the city clean but
they have one major drawback their small
capacity the boxes get filled in about a
day and in places with high traffic it
happens even faster every day people
have to specially empty the bins
otherwise it wouldn't make sense
this system is imperfect for two reasons
it takes people too much time to empty
the bins throughout the city and it
requires a huge staff of employees and
money some countries like Turkey have
already begun installing specially
designed bins on the streets they
require little maintenance as they have
a significant capacity at the same time
they harmoniously fit into the
surrounding landscape don't occupy
unnecessary space and look like a common
litter box actually it consists of two
elements the first one is above the
ground that everyone sees while the
second one is hidden underground a large
roomy tank for waste is located
underground so as to not take up
precious space thus it's not necessary
to empty it that often and it's done
using special vehicles
ah cracks underground garbage turkish
company Paulo Tech has been producing
and selling equipment to make people's
lives better and more comfortable in the
first year as they add quite a narrow
focus their manufactured acrylic
bathtubs
however by 2012 they started thinking
bigger and they engaged in the creation
of fundamentally new ways of getting rid
of waste they don't simply create unique
bins they make them eco-friendly
the air cracks underground garbage
system is designed to teach people to
recycle this is an environmentally
important process as the separation of
waste allows to process certain
categories of waste like plastic and
glass and reuse it it's noteworthy that
the system is specially designed for
tight spaces in crowded places each out
correct bin is designed for a particular
type of waste and they're located next
to each other so that all the trash can
be thrown away at once by the way the
special design is meant to protect the
health and well-being of people
unpleasant odors and bacteria that
inevitably multiply in the garbage are
stored deep underground and the metal
cover seals them in and prevents them
from spreading
the SI bin project the creator of the
bins we're gonna tell you about has
always led an active lifestyle and
spends a lot of time in the water
according to him there's nothing worse
than swimming or surfing while being
surrounded by garbage this conclusion
led him to believe that it's necessary
to develop new unique waste bins placed
not on the ground like we used to but
directly in the water the problem of
garbage in the world ocean is extremely
acute a huge amount of garbage floats in
the seas lakes rivers and other natural
bodies of water of our planet it not
only spoils the appearance of water but
also is a threat for most wildlife
species this is probably why the sea bin
project was supported on crowdfunding
platforms and collected the necessary
sum of money to become a reality
the specially designed bin is placed in
the water near the pier after that it
sucks up water 24/7 and along with it
all the garbage that floats around
absolutely any trash gets in the bin
from paper and bottles to oil stains the
garbage remains trapped thanks to a
replaceable filter so the water returns
to the reservoir already clean and as
with any bin this also requires
maintenance once in a while the filter
should be pulled out and emptied it's
noteworthy that the bin doesn't harm the
fish and other water inhabitants as they
tend to keep away from strange and
unnatural water flows
garbage collection system
here's another intelligence system
designed to solve the problem of
pollution of streets and public places
since the containers have a unique
design and are emptied with the help of
Motor Vehicles they have to be located
close to the roads the system can be
seen working in a park in Istanbul
Turkey the platform on which the bins
stands is covered with grass on the top
making the design fit harmoniously into
the landscape you can't see the complex
construction from the outside
when the truck drives up the waste bin
rises from the underground so that it's
easy to lift and flip over the whole
process takes only a couple of minutes
which greatly simplifies the maintenance
making it quick and economical it's also
noteworthy that the garbage collection
is carried out by the same trucks that
pick up traditional trash cans so it's
not necessary to buy any special
equipment
Quadra Matt place is designed for
garbage disposal and residential areas
are often dirty have an unpleasant smell
and you can often find rats and stray
animals they're specialists of the
German company villager AG designed a
system to improve such places making
them appealing to the eye and getting
rid of the floors we're all used to
at first glance Quattro mat is basically
no different than any other bins that we
showed you today however there's still
one difference above-ground you only see
a compact aesthetic bin underground
there's a huge container hidden similar
to those used for residential areas one
container can be used by several houses
for a couple of days the volume of the
underground container varies from 12 to
20 cubic meters the Quadro mat not only
has an aesthetic appearance but the
system also prevents bad smells from
spreading and of course rats birds and
any other animals that spread the
garbage around can't get in the
container is equipped with a press
whereby the waste takes up less space
and maintenance costs are reduced
