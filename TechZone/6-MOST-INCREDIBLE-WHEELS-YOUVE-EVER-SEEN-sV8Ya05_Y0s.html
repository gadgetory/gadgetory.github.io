terrain armored military technology has
more strict requirements than any other
that is why the Polaris terrain armored
tires designed specifically for military
vehicles will amaze any off-road
enthusiasts they can be mounted on a
quad or a car representatives of the
company Polaris claim that non pneumatic
tires were successfully used by the
military and rescue teams and therefore
decided to bring this technology to the
market
it is easy to guess that the main
feature of these tires is its cellular
structure which makes them less
vulnerable to bullets the tires were
shot from a 50 gauge weapon during a
test and the results showed their
effectiveness and serviceability
in addition these airless wheels can
withstand even a huge load at high
mileage the outer rim of the tire is
made of standard tyre rubber and it's
equipped with protectors and in some
cases it can also be equipped with
spikes the cellular structure is made of
a patented composite which combines high
strength flexibility and shaped memory
reconfigurable wheel track this is the
latest developments of the National
Engineering Center for robotics at
Carnegie Mellon University USA its
specialists improve the design of
standard wheels so that they could
transform into tracks the process takes
two seconds this feature allows the car
to instantly adjust to different types
of soil and pavement
Eagle 360 last year at the International
Geneva Motor Show
Goodyear presented its conceptual smarts
tires for their cars of the future these
are spherical tires with artificial
intelligence
the unique shape allows them to rotate
in any direction just as unmanned
vehicles require it turns out that the
Eagle 360 gives the vehicle amazing
maneuverability in fact the car can move
in any direction without turning around
it is worth noting that the
manufacturers took into account the
necessities of the driver and the
passengers so the tires provide a high
level of comfort and safety
Eagle 360 is covered in a plastic bionic
shell with built-in sensors they collect
the dates around the condition of the
tires the roadway the surrounding
conditions and even the location of the
car the idea is that all this
information in real time will be shown
on the display in the car in addition
the tires can use this information to
learn this will allow them to more
effectively adapt to the changes around
and respond quickly to them
shape-memory allow about a year ago NASA
Research Center developers showed their
new tires to the public their unique
feature is their amazing wear resistance
and durability the tires are not afraid
of punctures deformations or bulges the
secrets of their unique performance
characteristics is in the special design
the tires are made of a huge number of
metal Springs which are interwoven into
a grit of course the springs are
resistant to damage but in addition they
absorb vibration using internal friction
just as standard wheels do
the idea of creating such tires came to
the experts when the tire of the Mars
rover Curiosity got damaged in the fall
of 2013 the rover got it when driving on
a Stoney part of the path repairing the
damage is impossible and henceforth the
rover only rides on safe routes now thus
NASA experts decided to develop these
tires which in the future will be used
to create vehicles and send them to
other planets the springs are made of a
special alloy of titanium and nickel and
it has shape memory this means that
within a small deformation up to 10
percent the wheels will be able to go
back to their original shape it is
noteworthy that the wheel will withstand
even more serious defamation although in
order for it to return to its previous
form it's necessary to heats the
material
vision the design of the traditional
tires which everyone uses is not perfect
and not only because they're quite
easily damaged they are a threat to the
environment because we produce them and
then throw too many old tires out to
landfills the average life of a tire is
five years which is a small period and
that's why dumps are simply filled with
used tires in recent years Michelin has
been working to create tires that would
not have these problems this is an
innovative conceptual tire that's been
printed using a 3d printer it has an
airless design and is also made of
biodegradable materials it's noteworthy
that vision is both a wheel and a tire
despite his biodegradability the
material used to create the tread
provides the same characteristics as a
regular wheel
that is the driver and the passengers
will not feel the difference in the
future sensors embedded in the device
will transmit information about his
conditions the driver the data obtained
will allow a person to refine the tire
change the tread pattern or make their
own again using a 3d printer
interestingly the American magazine time
included vision tires and the top 25
best inventions of 2017
McCollum wheels the Turkish company
Cirque isley is engaged in the
production of forklifts with a unique
wheel structure roller bearing tires
were designed by the Swedish engineer
bank to deal on the idea came to the
scientist in 1973 these wheels allow
vehicles to move in any direction
guaranteeing amazing maneuverability
thanks to their wheels circ is Lee
loaders can work even in the most
constrained conditions in addition the
speed and efficiency of work increases
since you no longer need to spend extra
time on maneuvering
the working principle of the wheel is
quite simple as well a great number of
rollers are mounted onto the surface of
the whole wheel they are positioned so
that the angle of rotation is 45 degrees
the driver changes the direction and
speed of rotation of each wheel so the
vehicle moves forward backward on a
diagonal and even rotate around its own
access amazingly with all this there's
almost no slip between the rollers and
the support surface this technology is
used in tracked vehicles with skid
steering however the tracks can
seriously damage the roadway the wheels
created by L on don't damage the surface
because they rotate with a minimum
friction force and low torque
hey stop being lazy it's time to use
that brain eels welcome to brain time
incredible facts from the past the
present and even the future the power of
nature and wild animals amazing facts
and unsolved mysteries you'll find all
this and much more hair subscribe now
