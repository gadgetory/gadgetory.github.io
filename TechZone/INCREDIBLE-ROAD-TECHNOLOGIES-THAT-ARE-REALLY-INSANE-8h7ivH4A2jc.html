surfaces suffer from all sorts of
devastating external effects unfavorable
weather conditions soil affected by
destructive processes as well as
friction of car tires are the causes of
potholes companies that build roads are
forced to fix the road covering the
potholes but they do not always deal
with the task in time citizens often
come to the rescue and sometimes choose
very original and creative ways to fix
Road deficiencies human imagination is
limitless so there are countless
creative ways to repair a pothole
for example artist Jim Becker from
Chicago is decided to help rate service
by filling particularly large and deep
gaps with mosaics
first he firs each hole with mortar and
then places a pattern of glass and
marble on top he assembles them at home
beforehand the idea of repairing the
roads in this way came to the artist
when he visited Pompeii the man decided
that if the glass and marble roads built
in ancient Rome have survived to this
day and this technology is suitable for
modern roads too now it's impossible to
confuse his neighborhood with any other
parts of the city this is because the
roads are flat and the patches on the
surface are a true work of art and
although the artists work is technically
illegal the police and road services
don't mind at all so no one's going to
stop and find the man trying to restrict
his creative impulses
infra-red pavement repair
statistics show that every year between
2 and 3 percent of the surface area of
each city's roads wears out in some
places where the climate is particularly
harsh or where low-quality materials
have been used the figure can be as high
as 12 to 15 percent cracks and potholes
are the most common problem before
starting the repair it's necessary to
remove the damaged layer traditionally
mini excavators with hydraulic hammers
and hammers and special cutters are used
for destroying the asphalt layer today
there is a more efficient simple and
economical way to remove the old coating
thanks to the use of special equipment
infrared asphalt heaters infrared heat
softens the road but doesn't degrade its
properties bitumen does not burn in the
process not only asphalt but also
concrete metal and even thermoplastic
can be heated with the help of this
equipment
during the repair the fourth step is to
place the heater over the damaged area
the asphalt doesn't take more than 10
minutes to soften after that the heater
Rises and moves to the next damaged area
workers loosen the surface add fresh
asphalt salute reminiscing agent and
then level the layer the only thing left
to do is roll the results is a flawless
surface that doesn't look like a patch
it should be noted that this form of
road repair unlike traditional methods
allows the amounts of materials used to
be reduced by half
chip Phil saveco markings as a company
specialized in the production and sale
of thermoplastic for road markings
however a few years ago the company's
experts developed a new thermoplastic
that unique properties its main feature
is that it's suitable for road repair in
crude form chip fill looks like flakes
that are transported in large bags
first workers eat the damaged surface
and then fill it with these flakes next
the chip fill thermoplastic is heated
using a gas torch the material optimally
fills the crack or hole and melts with
the bitumen this repair method is ideal
if the damage has a diameter or width of
15 to 20 centimeters maximum
thermoplastic adea's much better to the
surface the materials traditionally used
for cold repair the repair process takes
only 20 minutes which is enough to
prevent further damage to the right
surface it should be noted that roads
can be repaired in this way all year
round as well the use of bulky and
complex Road equipments is not required
humm Klinger hydraulic clamps while
automobile tracks are paved with asphalt
slabs are increasingly used as materials
for sidewalks and walkways here we have
an advanced hydraulic paver laying
clamps produced by the German company
hum clinker each machine is equipped
with a patented automatic hydraulic
control unit this means that the device
can be connected to any construction
machine
by contrast the installation of
competing models which usually have an
electro-hydraulic unit is much more
complicated and can only work with a
certain number of machines the robot
operates in cycles holding a layer of
slabs while the clamps perform lateral
and horizontal leveling the clamps then
fix the layer lifts the slabs and place
them on the surface cycles are repeated
over and over again until the walkway is
ready
concrete rollers the last step in
creating a concrete floor whether
indoors or outdoors is to level the
surface it's especially important to
perform this step when it comes to
building a room only if the floor is
flat laying linoleum laminates or other
similar materials can be done correctly
however leveling is also important when
building parts creating a perfectly flat
surface without joints is a complex and
time-consuming job traditional leveling
methods are not perfect and require a
lot of effort from workers curb roll or
manufacturing offers a solution that
will significantly simplify and
accelerate this work the company
produces concrete rollers of different
sizes and designs the equipment is
powered by an electric generator the
solid roller rolls and compresses the
surface to create a perfect surface
without any effort the working width of
the roller can be varied so that workers
can perform a wide variety of tasks
poly level the most common reason the
surface of the concrete slab becomes
unusable is because the soil beneath it
shrinks on the outside it may appear
that poly level is an ordinary spray
foam that shouldn't be used under these
slabs
however poly level is made of
polyurethane and as a higher density
normally in order to return the concrete
slabs to their original and correct
position special concrete is used
however for the cavity to fill evenly
it's necessary to make a large number of
holes around the entire perimeter
damaging the appearance of the slight
the advantage of poly level foam is that
it can be filled through very small
holes which are virtually visible after
filling and other advantages that poly
level is lights were in white than
traditional mix but as a higher
load-bearing capacity the lifting
capacity of the foam is regulated by the
components of the composition
ie poly levels meet the needs of any
construction project the polyurethane in
the composition penetrates the floor
reinforcing it which prevents further
shrinkage allowing the co seem to be
repaired less frequently and the last
advantage is the curing speed to allow
the traditional mix to spread and dry
it's necessary to wait from a few hours
to a couple of days poly lava dries
almost instantly so the surface can be
used again immediately after repair hey
stop being lazy it's time to use that
brain of yours welcome to brain time
incredible facts from the past the
present and even the future the power of
nature and wild animals amazing facts
and unsolved mysteries you'll find all
