vehicle project is a hybrid of a
helicopter and an electric suburban
train designed for a large number of
people and equipped to provide maximum
comfort
the engineers placed not only chairs but
also tables a dining area and a bar in a
spacious lounge the vehicle is lifted in
the air using a combination of six
powerful propellers and moves along a
predetermined path through special Lane
is located at the bottom it also travels
at low altitude on the ground helping to
avoid traffic jams in the typical risks
of road and air travel next future
transportation another project for a
means of transport of the future has
been developed by a team of engineers
under the direction of the genius behind
the idea Tommaso Getz Helen according to
one of the developers this passenger
vehicle will become the main means of
transport in the city it's based on
modular systems each cabin module can be
a personal transport system for the
passengers or interact with each other
getting together directly on the track
in the form of a train or a traveling
device therefore the module becomes a
convenient inefficient means of
transport depending on the density and
number of passengers but even if the
number of people is high this doesn't
mean that they will be deprived of
comfort as this vehicle has room even
for a bar and a shop in addition
purchases are made directly from a
device without any cash the same applies
to tickets smart phones smart flocks
PDAs and other electronic devices
interact with next future transportation
and the modules take people to their
stops and know exactly where to go this
is possible thanks to the route
previously chosen in a special
application the length of each module is
eight point eight feet and each module
can accommodate up to ten people six
standing and four seated the modules
themselves are electrical and therefore
environmentally friendly in addition
they can travel on normal roads and
railways and the attachment unit uses a
magnetic device a third cruise
experience this luxury cruise project is
based on a platter
for airships developers say that you can
travel not only quickly but also with
maximum comfort the futuristic airship
operates on the basis of a technology
called eros craft this means that it
uses engines as the main source of
ascent while helium only compensates the
weight of the load the aircraft is also
equipped with a special system that
allows the crew to adjust the total
weight of the aircraft using air
compression inside the aircraft there is
a spacious lounge a dining area a bar a
kitchen and passenger rooms with all the
necessary amenities Tahir inserts wrote
technology the world's first automated
road complex is designed to reduce costs
and improve the quality of road patches
upon arrival at the site the complex is
installed on hydraulic supports so as to
not tip over during operation with the
help of a light indicator the operator
determines the processing area selects
the size of the repair and then the
machine enters into automatic mode the
complex uses a variety of tools changing
them in the correct order depending on
the ongoing operations the machine can
cut and remove the surface of the old
road as well as place pre-prepared
patches in place at the time the entire
technological repair cycle doesn't
exceed five minutes and its quality
increases significantly due to the
structure of the particularly strong
patches Mercedes concept IA
this project presented by mercedes is a
true vehicle of the future it's
dimensions are 16 and a half feet long
six and a half feet wide and 4.2 feet
tall a hybrid transmission puts the
vehicle into operation and its total
power is 279 horsepower which allows it
to reach a speed of up to 155 miles per
hour and an electric journey of up to 40
miles in order to achieve better
aerodynamics that create a saying no to
the side mirrors replacing them with
cameras and to the door handles to
installing a special sensor system
instead even more futuristic of the
window
on the sides of the vehicle which with
the help of screen printing technology
take on the same color as the bodywork
however the main feature of this concept
is the activation of additional
components at the back which make it
possible to extend the vehicle and
further increase its aerodynamics at
high speeds tf-x on the outside the tf-x
flying vehicle looks like a high tank
four seater sedan in addition to an
aerodynamic bodywork the vehicle is
equipped with folding wings with two
electric motors on each side these
engines are powered by the energy
produced by the generator along with a
300 horsepower internal combustion
engine the vehicles wings can be folded
horizontally during preparation for
flight and can take a vertical position
while flying across the surface the
additional propellers provide the tf-x
with the ability to take off and land on
any short stretch of road and in other
words no runway is required the air
vehicle can reach speeds of 200 miles
per hour and fuel and energy are
sufficient to overcome distances of up
to 500 miles it's also worth mentioning
that the concept is semi-automatic ie
the pilot can control it manually or
using preset destination coordinates
transit elevated bus the creators of
this unusual bus set out to defeat the
city's traffic jams completely this is
made possible by the unusual design of
the vehicle which allows cars to
literally pass underneath it at the same
time passengers are on an elevated
comfortable and totally safe platform
the width of this prototype bus and
giant tunnel is about 26 feet around two
lanes of traffic at the same time the
length is 72 feet and one of these buses
has a capacity for 300 people
the creators also say that a series of
several innovative vehicles will be
suitable for transporting more than a
thousand people despite its impressive
size the transit elevated bus should not
occupy a place on the road because all
traffic passes through it to move the
bus tunnel through the city roads must
be equipped with special rail
with an emergency braking system
unfortunately despite the great
potential this concept has not been
realized trifles 600 this project for a
universal hybrid between an airplane and
a helicopter is called tri fan 600 this
aircraft which combines the vertical
lifting capacity of a helicopter with
the speed of an aircraft can be built
from composite materials according to
the idea of the creators the flying
vehicle will be designed for five
passengers and one pilot the plane is
designed primarily for businessman and
to help solve the problem of traffic
congestion in the metropolis as it moves
at four hundred miles an hour in
addition it can be used to travel
between cities the maximum height limits
of the hybrid aircraft is approximately
twenty nine hundred and fifty feet two
turbine engines allow flying between 800
and 1,200 miles without refueling
depending on the take-off and the cargo
vertical take-off is possible thanks to
an adjustable three channel fan built
into the fuselage which uses sliding
hatches it is noteworthy that trifon 600
uhz not require special areas for
takeoff and landing and can land on any
smooth surface including the roof of a
building or the area in front of a
country house Navia armored independent
buses are definitely the most modern
technology in this area this type of
vehicle is absolutely ecological which
is extremely important in the modern
world the boss moves using electrical
energy besides being a robot ie the
control is carried out by means of a
special computer program and therefore
without the human factor Navya armor is
also functional and very comfortable for
passengers the cabin has an air
conditioning system and a special ramp
for the comforts of boarding and
disembarking disabled passengers the bus
is designed for the transport of 10 to
15 passengers with only four people
standing the average speed of this
futuristic vehicle is about 12 to 15
miles per hour and the maximum speed is
27 miles per hour passengers have a
special program for smartphones and
tablets to
schedules or reserve a seat Willie the
author of this project is a designer
named Ted Orlovsky who proposed turning
buses into a giant screen on wheels on
the outside of the vehicle as a large
LCD panel on which the advertisement is
broadcast it is worth highlighting that
even advertising in this means a
transport is a real innovation as
dynamic videos move along the route and
attract the attention of passers-by when
the bus isn't moving it shows you a
familiar design you can see the doors as
well as detailed information about the
route the following stops schedules and
other useful information the when
Willie's on the move it becomes an
advertising screen unfortunately the
designers project doesn't include a
demonstration of the vehicle's interior
but it is likely that inside this bus is
no less unusual than the outside
fire truck of the future to make it
easier for firefighters to work in a big
city and avoid traffic jams tahir
inserts designers have developed a
concept for a fire truck
this vehicle equipped with signal lamps
can be raised above the vehicle flow and
moved balancing on two supports eg
between the rails if necessary but this
is not it's only function the fire truck
doesn't have laddus as it has a large
unmanned aircraft that can lift
firefighters and water tanks to the
required height in just a few seconds
flexible transport the basis of this
urban vehicle as well as that of the
fire engine shown above is the concept
of a self balanced vehicle thanks to a
stabilization system this vehicle for a
large number of people as balanced on 2
thin poles that move on specially
installed rails in addition the
invention can dodge various obstacles
such as bridges and elevated crossings
traveling at a higher altitude than
other means of urban transportation thus
greatly easing traffic and avoiding
congestion another advantage of this
futuristic development is its transport
capacity and respect for the environment
