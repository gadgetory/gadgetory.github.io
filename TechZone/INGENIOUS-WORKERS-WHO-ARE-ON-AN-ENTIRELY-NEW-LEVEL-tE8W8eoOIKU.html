other walkway is made of concrete or
stone slabs sooner or later at the
surface loses its uniformity due to the
natural contraction of the soil the
slabs sink pedestrians walking on this
path may fall due to unevenness and
injure themselves to prevent this it is
necessary to carry out surface leveling
work on time in this case and has been
shown how to lift a sunken concrete slab
with special poly level foam even though
this foam resembles a normal one its
performance properties are very
different the foam is pumped underneath
the slab through a specially drilled
hole and consists of two components
which are connected when the foam is
under the slab by interacting the
components contribute to the expansion
of the phone and the uniform filling of
all the cavities the road repair
contractor controls the composition of
the foam and consequently the final
elevation of the slab the entire
procedure takes no more than 15 minutes
after which the poly level hardens
completely and keeps the slab of the
proper level this product is completely
ecological and doesn't affect the
composition of the soil
egg trays from recycled paper molded
pulp packaging is one of the most
popular ways to store eggs in the
village of dwarapudi located in the
Indian district of East Godavari in the
state of Andhra Pradesh they came up
with a way to make production of these
trays more environmentally friendly it
was decided to use waste paper to create
this type of packaging recycling is an
effective way to reduce the amount of
waste produced by human activity egg
trays can be produced from a wide range
of waste paper from newspapers and
magazines to notebooks and recycled
cardboard waste paper molding technology
simpler to papier-mache production is
used for manufacturing recycled paper is
mixed with a lot of water wet paper
passes through a metal mesh in order to
obtain dehydrated paper fibers the mass
is then molded together product the way
it needs to be after that the paper
fibers acquire a smooth surface and are
compacted
that's how egg trays with rigid and
stable sides are obtained
stamped concrete modern construction is
constantly being improved and every year
new materials and technologies appear on
the market to improve the quality of
buildings today an unusual design using
concrete the most common building
material is rapidly gaining popularity
workers use polyurethane and metal
stamps to give an unusual relief to the
smooth surface of the concrete stamped
concrete can mimic almost any surface
whether it's bricks paving slabs wood
pallets slate tiles or even animal skin
there are molds that will allow you to
create a pattern of leaves animal tracks
or various other decorative figures to
be placed on a concrete surface it may
seem that the stamping procedure is not
too complicated but it is necessary to
apply the stamps in the right places
in fact precision and extreme accuracy
are required to make the image complete
not blurry and without visible joints or
defects
wooden lamp the video shows the work of
an expert carpenter capable of making a
modern and stylish table lamp from a
couple of unremarkable pieces of wood
the initial materials are three wooden
bars which are polished from different
sites until the profile becomes a
rectangle then with the help of a sawing
machine the bars are transformed into 27
cubes of identical signs the carpenter
makes a hole inside each cube to connect
them with glass plugs this is a really
laborious job because the numerous holes
must be placed strictly in the center of
the cubes otherwise the lamp will not
have the right shape for safe use of the
products once the cubes are assembled
the edges and corners are carefully
polished finally the inner cubes are
replaced by a wooden parallelepiped
wrapped in an LED strip the result is an
original and unique handmade lamp
sidewalk construction paving tiles are
the most common material for path
construction it can be found all over
the world but some people can't afford
to buy ready-made tiles sometimes it's
much cheaper that do the work yourself
right where you plan to place the
pathway the video shows how quick reach
plastic formwork can be used to quickly
and efficiently build a pedestrian
walkway that'll have the same attractive
appearance as if it were made of
finished tiles the manufacturer of quick
read offers a wide range of ways for
anyone to build a path to their liking
before work begins the Builder levels
the surface and prepares the place where
the tiles will be laid
he then dilutes the concrete and apply
special dyes to increase the
attractiveness of the finished Road
finally all that remains to be done is
to apply the formwork to the spot and
fill it with concrete in the cells
the material is so compressed that when
the formwork is removed the concrete
maintains the shape of the stones or
tiles after one hour the material will
get to harden and after a few days the
path can be used without problems
active house the construction you see on
the screen has two very interesting
features first it is a house with a
positive energy balance this means that
the building itself produces the amounts
of energy needed for normal life inside
the combination of several original
architectural solutions makes it
possible not only to save energy but
also to manage it more efficiently
secondly the Canadian patented initial
wall technology was used for the
construction previously these
installation panels were only used in
commercial construction today they've
been improved to make it possible to
build a residential structure special
solar span thermal insulation panels
were used for roof construction the
results was an energy plus house which
was also built in a much shorter time
than standard buildings
the materials selected for the
construction create a favorable
microclimate
thanks to adequate ventilation and
temperature control
epoxy resin furniture in recent years
furniture made of combined materials
such as wood and epoxy resin have become
increasingly popular the reason for this
phenomenon lies in the unusual and very
beautiful appearance of the finished
product the wood contrasts spectacularly
with the elements of the finished epoxy
resin epoxy resin is a synthetic
compound of oligomers which is hardly
used anywhere in its pure form
however the expert workers mixing the
substance with hardener create true
works of art to create a piece of
furniture for example a table you first
have to prepare a wooden base then the
synthetic material is mixed with the
hardener it is important to correctly
calculate the proportion of components
any arrow would affect the durability of
the product and the resistance to water
and chemicals if the master does
everything in the right way as shown in
our video the resulting furniture has a
unique appearance and optimum resistance
to adverse effects
