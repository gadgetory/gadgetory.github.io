inventions are developed by specialists
from large companies for example these
omnidirectional wheels were developed by
Canadian driver named William Lydiard
he's been working on large vehicles for
a long time more than anyone else he
understands how difficult it can be to
maneuver cars in confined spaces when he
created the Lydiard wheels he wanted to
make his own life easier
his invention is a pair of wheels that
make parking much easier regardless of
the size of the vehicle it took him
about $60,000 and eight years to develop
the wheels the results is amazing a car
equipped with these wheels can move
sideways and can even turn around on the
spot
these unusual wheels are powered by an
electric motor which takes energy from
the car's battery the max speed is 2
kilometers per hour in any direction
even though the Lydiard wheels are
electric they're not afraid of water and
they can be used in any weather
Stan a is another invention designed to
solve the problems that people face when
parking a vehicle stan is a robotic
parker developed by the French company
Stanley robotics in 2018 it was tested
at the Charles de Gaulle Airport the
robot is able to find a suitable free
space for a particular car on its own
the owner just needs to drive the car
into a special box and go through a
simple check-in procedure the
registration process helps the robot
remember when it's time to prepare the
car for checkout as soon as the driver
leaves the vehicle Stan starts working
according to the developers the robot is
much smarter of managing free parking
space than people it instantly performs
precise mathematical calculations and
parks any car using as little space as
possible the airport management is going
to provide 6000 parking spaces for the
robots the creators of Stan claim will
be able to park up to 8,500 cars on this
area
lmv 496
this is the test of the prototype of the
world's first flying motorcycle by
Lazzara so far it can only hang in the
air at a height of 1 meter however in
the future is developers plan to
significantly expands the flying
capabilities the LM V 496 has two modes
one for road travel and one for flying
the video of the demonstration appeared
on March the 17th so there's not much
technical information about the bike yet
it is known that the vehicle weighs a
hundred and forty kilograms it would be
equipped with four turbines which are
responsible for lifting the vehicle into
the air creating a two hundred and forty
kilogram thrust
however for this test the motorcycle is
using six turbines to additional
turbines have been installed near the
pedals for safety during the test phase
when the lnb for nine sexes on the road
is powered by two electric motors
Makani crosswind flight in February of
this year it was reported that Norway
will have the world's first power plants
equipped with flying wind turbines the
idea to create such a project belongs to
the company shell and Maconie at the
moment is under development but the CEO
says that the work will be completed
within two years compared to a
traditional power plant it has many
advantages finding a place to build a
conventional wind turbine is a long and
difficult task and the location should
have high wind speeds but these wind
turbines can be installed anywhere
flying wind turbines rise to a huge
height where it's always windy
thus McCarney power plants are not only
easy to build they also produce much
more energy according to the plan the
advanced wind turbines are connected to
the power plant by special electricity
wire each generator has a wingspan of
almost 26 meters it can rise up to a
height of 305 metres as well when the
plant starts to operate the flying
turbine will rise to the working height
and then circle around the power plant
the plant capacity is six hundred to a
thousand two kilowatts
boogity 3d brakes modern cars especially
if they're sports cars or luxury cars
become more and more powerful every year
this means that they are at the same
time subject to ever-increasing safety
requirements brakes that were good 20 to
10 years ago are no longer perfect in
early 2018 the company bugatti announced
the release of brake shoes printed on a
3d printer but that's not their main
feature the new brakes will be able to
stop even cars driving at extremely high
speeds finally in December 2018 the
first video showing the performance of
the brakes in action was released
amazingly tests have shown that the
brakes can slow down a vehicle moving at
a speed of 400 km/h the load is
incredibly enormous at the peak of
operation the disc and brake calipers
reach a temperature of 1025 degrees
Celsius the hypercar the bugatti chiron
will be equipped with these brakes such
a car can reach a speed of 400
kilometers per hour
prime air delivery a few years ago
Amazon introduced a unique delivery
system for the first time the customer
receives the products 13 minutes after
placing the order human intervention
during the process is minimized the
secrets of the amazing speed is of
course the drones used by the company in
2017 Amazon filed a patent application
for a drone tower from there the drones
will fly with the products to the
destination according to the plan the
drones will have different sizes and
carrying capacities to deliver a wide
range of goods although the system is
still under development there is already
some information available the drones
will be able to rise to a height of 120
meters and reach speeds of up to 80 km/h
there will also be full types of
delivery home work boat and current
location
elder e-signature oled TV arm earlier
this year at the CES 2019 exhibition LG
presented a unique TV set it's 65 inch
screen can be rolled up when folded the
device takes up almost no space it looks
like an elongated decorative nightstand
the screen with an OLED display unfolds
in just a few seconds after pressing a
button the claimed durability of the
mechanism is 50,000 cycles in other
words it'll be possible to watch TV for
more than 10 years if used frequently
it's noteworthy that the invention will
be able to adjust to the image
resolution which is shown on the screen
thus the owner manually chooses how to
open the screen for example it can be
extended by half or up to the size of a
small strip thanks to this the device
can be used to check the weather or
supply the sales will start in 2019
there's no price information yet but it
will surely be a high-end product
hey stop being lazy it's time to use
