convenient access not only to vehicles
but also to people
that's why constructions like the one
you see on the screen are being
developed all over the world the screen
is placed on the garage doorway covering
it at the same time it has a door so
that the owner can enter and exit
without problems
a remarkable feature of these doors is
that they can be installed together with
traditional garage doors for cars the
construction is fixed under the ceiling
just below the garage door the screen
may be transparent or not in the second
case it practically replaces the wall
these doors are ideal for people who
spend a lot of time working in the
garage
thanks to these doors passers-by cannot
see you but at the same time you can go
out at any time
the main feature of this door is that it
blends in with the wall when closed such
secret constructions are used for not
only for spies in movies this door is
the ideal solution if you don't want to
take people's attention off a
beautifully decorated wall
it is recommended to install this type
of sliding door in small apartments and
houses the fact is that this door
doesn't take up any space when opening
thanks to this you can put even bulky
furniture next to it without blocking
the exit in this case the sliding door
also looks very nice it's made from wood
which performs a decorative function
hair tech manufactures and installs
these structures the door can have any
width to fit any kind of doorway
although technically these doors are no
different from any others they are still
very special you can change the
transparency of the glass just by
clicking a button or you can do this via
the app the secrets of this
multi-layered glass lies in the special
liquid crystal film inside under the
microscope they look like oblong sticks
reacting to the switch command they
change their position in space when they
line up along the surface they
overshadow it and the glass becomes
opaque when the crystals are placed
across as you can see through the glass
moreover there can be more than two
levels of transparency
thanks to this unique feature the design
has an extremely wide range of
applications for example it's perfect
for large offices or it can be used to
assemble a shower cubicle
we are accustomed to garage doors that
rise to the ceiling when you open them
and then stay there however this is not
the only possible design experts from
strand automation for example offer this
sliding gate it's noteworthy that they
don't take up too much space just like a
traditional design the partition wall
pulls away on specially installed rails
pay attention to the material of the
gates these are long oak boards
connected to each other in several
points with special fastenings
improvement they can rotate making the
gate change the direction of movement
here's another gate designed and
installed by the specialists of the same
company it works in a similar manner
however we decided to show it to you
because of one significant difference
only one part of the structure is
equipped with a rotary mechanism the
second part instead of pulling aside is
folded up against the opposite wall this
design was chosen because the room was
not deep enough to accommodate the
entire gate even so experts have come up
with the best solution by the way this
door is also made of rotating sections
but they are much wider
this may look like a normal door with a
few large windows next to it
however this whole construction is one
big white door it is the ideal choice
for people who like to spend time
outside because it virtually erases the
border between the indoors and the
outdoors the manufacturing company
Marvin offers more than 90 different
configurations it can pull away
completely or partially fold on one side
or two there are a lots of options so
that everyone can choose one the suits
their tastes the most the maximum width
of this door is almost 17 meters the
maximum height is 3 meters it is
noteworthy that even the largest doors
will not take up extra space in any
modification they are very compact
this gate is perfect for garages storing
tall vehicles it's divided into four
sections when opening it rises up and
then moves into the garage on horizontal
rails freeing up the entrance the
manufacturer points out that the gate
does not take up any space outside the
garage there are gates of different
thicknesses to provide various degrees
of protection as well
at first glance this gate is no
different from other folding designs who
have already shown you today however
there is a slight difference notice that
they are not attached to the rails on
which the doors usually move since the
construction has to withstand its own
weight its frame has increased strength
at the same time the installation
procedure is simpler and faster than
with rails
the gate works almost the same way as
the last one however since they are
larger and therefore heavier they have
to be provided with an additional
bearing point in this case it's the
wheel the installation is still simple
but the frame didn't have to be
reinforced this double gate provides
increased security
it doesn't need a track to unfold and
both parts do it synchronously
despite their heavy metal construction
they are safe for people and cars
movement stops as soon as the door
encounters our obstacle
this gate doesn't look like anything
else you've seen before each door
consists of four triangles that bend and
rotate in relation to each other
and finally the last design we'll show
you today is a combination of a window
and a slightly balcony it can also be
called a door to the roof or the balcony
it's designed for the Attic and is
usually located on a sloped roof when
folded the structure is inclined at the
same angle as the roof and the railing
is placed horizontally when unfolded
hey stop being lazy it's time to use
that brain Eeyore's welcome to brain
time incredible facts from the past the
present and even the future the power of
nature and wild animals amazing facts
and unsolved mysteries you'll find all
this and much more hair subscribe now
