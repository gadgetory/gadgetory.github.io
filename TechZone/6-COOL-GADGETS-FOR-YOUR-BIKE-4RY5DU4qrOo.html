are designed for driving and difficult
and even extreme terrain their owners
often face different problems this
product designed to facilitate the life
of cyclists is called vitória airliner
despite its simple design this device
for your tires provides additional wind
protection enhances grip and prevents
punctures the vitória air liner is a
foam made of a new generation of polymer
it's suitable for bicycles of different
sizes it can be used with wheels with
inner tubes or tubeless wheels other
notable features are vibration
absorption enhanced ride comfort reduced
tire pressure and the prevention of
chain breaks it's noteworthy that
despite its density and stability
the device has a small weight so that
its presence doesn't affect the weight
and speed its weight varies depending on
the size and ranges from 160 to 220
grams the manufacturer claims that the
products durability is 2,000 hours in
standard conditions given a cyclists
weight of 80 kilograms installing the
vitória air liner is simple and takes no
time at all you can buy the product for
$70
ride air the life of a modern man is
inextricably linked with the use of
mobile applications and various gadgets
pressing a couple of buttons is enough
to make your life easier more
comfortable and convenient the creators
of ride air thought about the fact that
a huge number of tasks are performed
daily only by pressing the buttons but
pumping bicycle wheels is not one of
those tasks so they created ride air a
device to automatically pump your wheels
pumping a wheel of a hand pump will
remain in the past if you have $50 for
this device now all you need to pump is
pressing one button the device is
compact simple and efficient and it can
be easily attached to the frame of the
bicycle it consists of a 120 centimeter
cord an aluminium canister for air and a
button of course recharging the device
with the air compressor takes only a few
seconds the special design of ride air
prevents leakage of air from the tank so
the wheel would be pumped in any
situation wherever the bicyclist is by
the way it can also be used as an
anti-theft device the cable is stretched
and passed through the wheels securely
fixing it the advantages that ride air
can be used for air pumping other
objects for example balls scooters and
balloons or children's inflatable toys
Klug despite the fact that this device
has a modest price only nine dollars and
an even more modest size it will be
useful to every cyclist since is able to
solve a very important problem the lack
of free space riding a bike is
interesting and exciting
however bikes are very cumbersome and
aren't easy to store klog can be screwed
to any more or less smooth surface
becoming a strong reliable attachment
for your bicycle using plug you can
store your bike in an upright position
taking up less space it's noteworthy
that these devices are created using a
3d printer the manufacturer offers a
digital model that is you don't have to
wait for delivery and instead you can
print the device immediately after
purchase the first clogged model offered
on Kickstarter is designed for standard
bicycles however the manufacturer is
going to develop other models in the
future so that every bicycle owner
regardless of the size and model of
their vehicle could use the plug holder
due to its compact size and simple
fixing procedure the device doesn't
damage the surface of the wall
tailfin the device that you see on the
screen is designed for people who like
to travel with a bicycle over long
distances the tail fin is a rack with
baskets for storing things it's easily
installed on a bicycle of any size and
is designed in such a way that the
cyclists when riding doesn't even notice
its presence it's noteworthy that the
installation of the rack takes only 10
seconds and you don't need any tools
the capacity of storage is 24 liters and
the structure weighs only 875 grams
275 of them account for the rack itself
and 600 for the backpack this is almost
a kilogram less than the standard
familiar design traditionally the
bicycle rack is made of metal pipes a
unique feature of the tailfin is that
the material for its production was
carbon fiber the rack has an aerodynamic
shape so as to not increase the
resistance of the air when riding and it
doesn't affect the speed and difficulty
of the ride it's worth paying attention
to the interesting design of fastening
the backpack to the rack during the ride
the backpack is attached to the bike
very reliably so that it doesn't
accidentally fall on the road at the
same time a person can unplug it from
the bike in just a second and take it
with it like a normal backpack this rack
can be bought for a hundred and ninety
dollars assetid - backpacks will cost an
additional 140 dollars
for me the developer of this device
always dreamed of finding durable and
aesthetic grips which could also provide
a high ride comfort when he failed to
find a grip that would satisfy all his
high demands he decided to develop one
himself so for me was created and today
anyone can buy them for $69 first of all
numerous studies have made it possible
to find out that the use of 3d scanning
will make it possible to produce grips
that provide maximum convenience and
control over the vehicle ultimately it's
thanks to 3d printing that these grips
have a unique incredibly convenient and
practical design and don't worry about
aesthetics the manufacturer offers more
than 40 colors so that everyone can
choose the right grips for their bike
before making the handles the parm is
measured so that the finished contour is
optimal for the hands of each particular
form user the manufacturer states that
usually the higher the flexibility of
the material the lower its strength
however thanks to a unique designer for
me perfectly combines flexibility
elasticity and strength
bike pack the device that you see on the
screen was developed by the aro team
which has extensive experience in
introducing innovative products to the
bicycle market the patented bike pack
system includes seven separate products
to increase the comfort of using the
bike it will suit absolutely any
cyclists from professionals to people
who simply ride their bike to work the
system includes a handlebar and seat
fastening a fork a back panel and bags
of nine 11 or 14 liters capacity the
bike pack system allows you to transport
various loads in your bicycle including
the steering wheel the fork and the seat
fastening for this purpose the weight of
the fastener for the steering wheel is
only 250 grams
the forklift mount will increase the
weight load on the bicycle by only five
hundred and twenty-five grams and the
rear panel mount has a weight of 750
grams backpacks for carrying things of a
small weight are resistant to water and
have an aerodynamic shape the cost of
the fasteners varies from 69 to 160
dollars and the cost of the bags is also
different depending on the chosen size
the smallest will cost a hundred and ten
dollars and the biggest 132</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
