wheels of any vehicle be it a scooter
bicycle or car get out of order even if
the surface looks intact the tire
pressure might be too low too right
what you can do is pump up the tires
regularly all by a vehicle similar to
the one you see on the screen or build
one yourself because this scooter is an
experimental model created by a team of
skilled inventors
the standard wheel of this Honda vehicle
was removed and replaced with a new one
a wide metal strip was welded to the rim
then sixteen clips were inserted into
the rim and springs were installed into
them each about 76 millimeters high it
sounds incredible but the scooter hasn't
lost its functionality
despite its unconventional appearance
however we're guessing not everyone
would enjoy driving this vehicle
Kawano ko1 modern scooter manufacturers
always put the riders comfort first for
example the electric scooter the kawano
ko1 was equipped with a shock absorber
between the wheel and the steering
column to smooth the ride and minimize
shaking with only 16 kilograms of weight
it has an impressive payload 120
kilograms the maximum speed of the
kawano ko1 is 20 kilometers per hour
like any other electric vehicle this
scooter has a power reserve ie the
distance it can travel without being
recharged for this scooter it is 20
kilometers
the manufacturer offers to tsiyon
muddles urban tires for driving on flat
city roads and sports tires for off-road
adventures that's why the Kawano kia one
has been equipped with a wide steady
wheel the scooter is also water and dust
resistant which makes it perfect for
extreme riding its price is $1300
c31 micro the disadvantage of all modern
scooters is that they don't have a roof
on sunny days you might be okay with
that
but if it's raining the rider is
probably not too happy experts from zeph
have developed a vehicle that doesn't
have this problem the c31 micro looks
like a minivan but three or four times
smaller despite being so tiny the
scooter can accommodate as many as three
people however their total weights
including the luggage should not exceed
a hundred and ninety-four kilograms
the electric motor accelerates the
vehicle to a maximum speed of 50
kilometers per hour the battery capacity
is large enough to travel up to 80
kilometers - the scooters price starts
at $5,500
my life
traditionally three-wheeled vehicles are
aimed at young children who are learning
to keep their balance
Milo is a scooter equipped with three
wheels as well however it doesn't really
look like a child's scooter this
original and unusual vehicle is
eye-catching but also really practical
when folded Milo takes up almost no
space thanks to this you can take it
with you to the subway or transport it
in the trunk of your car it only takes a
second to unfold it even when the
scooter is folded down the wheels remain
functional so that you can roll it next
to you the two front wheels are designed
to mirror each other's movements
thanks to this design even when making
external threads touch the ground this
means that the vehicle is stable and
safe the maximum speed is 24 km/h the
manufacturer offers two batteries to
choose from with a range of 24 or 48
kilometers you can buy this vehicle for
$1,500 if requested it can be supplied
with a second seat to share the ride
with someone else it'll cost an
additional 75 dollars
step scooter the wheels of this vehicle
are spinning powered by its rider moving
the riding step scooter feels like
walking up a staircase or working out on
an exercise stepper and even though it
looks like a kick scooter you don't need
to actually kick to make it move all the
scooters we've shown you today are
powered by a motor or a battery that
needs to be recharged but in this case
the source of energy is the person on
the scooter thanks to this the step
scooter is an eco-friendly transport
with an economical price the model for
children cost a hundred and eighty
dollars while the adult version costs
two hundred and ten dollars perhaps the
main advantage of the scooter is that it
keeps his owner healthy riding the step
scooter is basically working out by
pushing the pedals so you can train the
muscles of your hips calves glutes and
arms the vehicle comes with a special
stand so that you can use it as an
exercise machine at home another
interesting feature is the possibility
to buy a set of wheels for the
children's model to adjust the step
scooter to the height of the child
by car you're looking at a hybrid
between a scooter an electric car and a
bicycle created by the students of
Zurich University according to them in
the face of ever growing cities and
increasing population we need to switch
to miniature transport by car is
essentially a three-wheeled skater the
first prototype was shown in 2015 over
the past few years the engineers have
been working on their brainchild and is
the third version of the bike car it was
shown in January 2019 the best assets of
the vehicle is its clothes design the
compact cab will protect the drive of
rain and even cold weather also the bike
car makes parking much easier in a large
city the built in electric motor
accelerates the scooter to a speed of 45
kilometers per hour
the by car will end some mass-production
soon yes its price remains unknown those
who want to purchase it have to fill in
an application and wait for an answer
from the manufacturer
stator electric scooter the last vehicle
we're going to show you today is beyond
any other it has an original and
minimalist appearance but first sight it
might seem that someone just bent a few
metal tubes and shove them into some
wheels
despite its confusing appearance this
vehicle by stator is not a kick scooter
but a motor scooter
hence the large wheels the vehicle is
powered by an electric motor there are
two models with different ranges 16 and
32 kilometers on a single charge
the developers focus mostly on the
original design which is why the status
scooter is not a breakthrough in terms
of technology its speed is approximately
the same as that of any other electric
transport about 43 kilometers per hour
the weight of the device is 41 kilograms
and it can carry a person weighing up to
113 kilograms
