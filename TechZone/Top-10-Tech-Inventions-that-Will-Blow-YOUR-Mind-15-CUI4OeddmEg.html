bike powered by an electric accumulator
and has a unique smart balancing system
it's light and simple to drive anyone
would easily master the technique after
driving a few feet the invention by
designer Chris Hoffman has been released
quite recently before that for a long
time the construction was being upgraded
and improved Rhino is a unique example
of moto technique that doesn't pollute
has quite an impressive predicted range
and safety margin and it's a really
premium acquisition for everyone who
loves all that's new and unusual Rhino
speeds up to 19 miles per hour it's easy
to drive accelerate slightly goes into
bends very smoothly is steady even when
driving for a long time at a low pace as
a comfortable seat weighs less than 130
pounds it's compact and it's safe
mercedes-benz future bus mercedes-benz
introduced the self-driving future bus a
picture of what public transport can be
like in the future the cars made on the
base of the 40-foot mercedes-benz
Sottero bus equipped with a v6 300
horsepower engine the interior of the
future bus is completely
reconceptualized for example the
compartment is divided into a few zones
with different economics in accordance
with the time the passengers are going
to spend inside the main feature of the
bus is the autopilot system city pilot
that allows it to move on its own
identifying obstacles traffic lights
road signs all by itself city pilot
counts with a high-precision GPS
receiver and radars of short and long
range which are used to scan the road
while moving goodyear eagle 360 goodyear
presented its idea of how tires will be
in the long term future and is
fundamentally different from the modern
models thanks to its spherical shape
according to the manufacturer the 3d
printed tire will gain popularity as the
self-driving cars become more common the
distinctive shape of goodyear eagle 360
provides safety and maneuverability
required for self-driving cars the
spherical shape is the main condition
for perfect manoeuvring the tires can
move in every direction guaranteeing the
safety of the passengers thanks to the
active technology the tires move in a
way that makes the car steadier during
unforeseen situations on the road the
unique form of the tire provides a
smooth ride by creating a fluid lateral
movement this helps the cars will
overtake an obstacle without changing
its driving direction the tires are
connected to the car thanks to a
technology which is also used in
magnetic levitation trains which
increases passenger comfort
reduces noise
kawasaki GA on an exhibition in Tokyo
Kawasaki introduced a new concept
the Kawasaki J the three-wheeled
motorcycle is equipped with electric
transmission but its coolest feature is
the flexibility of the vehicle you can
adjust the seat from vertical when the
wheels are wide apart and the handles
are up to sports mode when the wheels
are close to each other the handles are
down on you're almost lying on the seat
instead of a rudder there are two levers
attached directly to the front wheels
the kawasaki company didn't reveal the
specifications of the concept they only
emphasize the fact that is equipped with
a high-density giga cell nickel metal
hydride or ni MH battery pack Kawasaki J
may never go into mass production plus
it's successfully fulfilled the role by
showing the futuristic opportunities of
the modern bike production
hoverboard while everyone's waiting for
real hoverboards there is one company
that claims you can get the same feeling
like floating in the air if you skate on
one wheel that's why they made their own
hoverboard aboard with a 10-inch wheel
controlled by inclining your body
forwards and backwards the guys from the
company hoverboard technologies claim
that their one wheeled skateboard is
much faster more practical and mobile
the 24 pound hoverboard is equipped with
a 5000 volt motor placed in the center
of the wheel it guarantees the top speed
of 16 miles per hour at a range of 12
miles complete charging takes only 15
minutes a sonar detector informs the
board's self-balancing system to keep
the board parallel with the ground while
regenerative braking is employed to
recover energy and charge the board when
going downhill or decelerating in
addition to all the technology that's
packed into the hoverboard itself is
also a mobile app for Android and iOS
the app running on a Bluetooth connected
smart device allows users to activate
and lock their one wheeler check its
charge level and battery health and set
speed limits it's also possible to
customize the lighting play and
customize audio and view ride data such
as the maximum speed the average speed
and the distance traveled eath the
cruise british student mac Byers
developed a project of a luxury mega
airship called eight the cruise which
can be realized by 2030 atha Cruise is

restaurant next to it all the tables are
near the windows so you can have dinner
while watching the landscape beneath the
dirigible a huge kitchen big staterooms
with double beds fitted with the latest

Jets they can give you a very nice and
comfortable trip
Sunnie quest a Crete based company
started to produce the sunny quest a
vehicle powered by solar batteries the
developing of this autonomous and
economical vehicle took four years the
car cost half the price of a common
European solar-powered vehicle the
three-wheeled car capable of
transporting three people was created
with the latest engineering programs
equipped with a photovoltaic generator
and a four kilovolt motor Sun Eclipse
can cover up to 155 miles using a three
kilowatts Sun battery while other
similar electric cars use a Sun battery
four times bigger than that
sunny khlyst is fitted with individual
compact pedals so every passenger can
