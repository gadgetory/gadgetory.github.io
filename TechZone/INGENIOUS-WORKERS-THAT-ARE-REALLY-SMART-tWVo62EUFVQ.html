up with a huge number of different
interior decorations to meet all tastes
the problem is that they're often too
expensive to be affordable for the
average person fortunately with the
right set of tools you can assemble your
own wall decoration by yourself just
like the craftsman you see on the screen
right now
as a basic material he uses wooden bars
which he cuts into many flat blocks with
the help of a special machine in total
it needs about 275 wooden blocks for his
work the next step is polishing the wood
with several types of sandpaper the
finished blocks are attached to the
sheet of wood with a special glue which
is spread on the whole surface except
for the four blocks in the corners
because there will be fixtures to the
wall under them after that the
decoration is ready they can be left as
it is or you can put up pictures
stickers and other things on it thanks
to the skillful work of the master the
wooden board turned out to be of the
same quality as the expensive model from
the store
laying tires if the floor to be child
has an uneven surface it's not necessary
to make an underlayment some craftsmen
like this one
choose a tactic that saves a lot of time
laying tiles on self-leveling concrete
moreover the worker does not try to
apply the mortar to the entire surface
at once he paves the concrete gradually
before laying each new slab the result
of this productive work is a perfectly
even surface it's no worse than if you
had previously made an underlayment
plasticine figure modern sculptors can
choose from a wide variety of raw
materials in this case the workers
perform with professional sulphide free
chavant NSP plasticine according to the
master this sculpture was made only for
entertainment at some point the sculptor
came up with the idea of recreating a
character from fallout for the death
cloth first he developed the sketch and
then he started working on the artwork
itself soft aluminium wire is used to
make the frame with pliers and the
crumpled foil is placed inside it's also
applied on top of the frame and after
that the master starts working with the
plasticine first the figure resembles
the character of the game only a little
by its outlines the sculptor then
applies layers of material to give the
workpiece the correct shape and size
note how the master only works with his
hands almost to the end without having
to resort to tools
however you can't do really small work
without them the arsenal of tools as a
rule is diverse he uses wired modeling
tools to cut off pieces of plasticine
giving the mass the desired shape there
are different types of tools depending
on the task usual modeling tools remove
or push through the material to create
animal horns the craftsman again creates
a frame covered with foil on the screen
you can see the results of this long
complicated and accurate work the head
of the creature would be
indistinguishable from the real one if
the deathclaw existed in reality
planters and basses This American
pottery craftsman uses quite unusual
techniques to create his dishes for
example he makes traditional Japanese
ceramics called raku the baking of clay
products is done in the shortest
possible time about an hour the kiln
pots are heated to a temperature of 900
degrees then they're placed in
containers filled with strong sawdust in
newspapers the high temperature of the
product makes these materials burn there
is then smoke which makes the surface of
the dish is dark it's noteworthy that
each pot made with this technique is
unique as the smoke leaves its own
unique pattern on every single one of
them the master also uses feathers to
decorate the clay dishes the simplest
technique implies their use as a stencil
the feathers applied to the surface
after which the sculptor sprays a thin
layer of paints after baking the dish
Ruiz acquired an unusual and again
unique appearance
a more sophisticated technique involves
using feathers directly for decoration
unusual patterns on the surface are also
created with horsehair the Potts is
taken out to the kill and before the
temperature drops this decoration
material is applied to it when burned it
leaves an interesting mark on the
surface the difficulty of this technique
is that the products outside the kiln
cooled down very quickly so the master
has literally 30 seconds to create a
beautiful pattern
Pizza Oven this may seem surprising but
pizza ovens despite their small size in
a complex shape are made by some
craftsmen by hand the design you see on
the screen is classic is known as a
pompeii oven first the master constructs
the base since it's another it is
imperative to take care of the thermal
insulation the tiles are laid then these
side elements are carefully grounds to
fit the rounded shape of the future
furnace then layer by layer the bricks
are laid the black shape in the middle
determines the size of the hole at the
oven
note that the master doesn't use
ordinary bricks but halves and even
smaller parts to lay the last few rows
of bricks a special frame is placed
inside the oven it will maintain its
shape until the mortar that holds the
bricks together tries out you might
think that this at the end of the
process but it's not next the bricks are
covered with heat insulating material
and a layer of cement is applied on top
the creation of such ovens is a long and
complicated process so the master has to
be very careful even a small mistake can
lead to frailty collapse or
unsuitability for cooking
Miller Fiore class even though this
unusual technology of glass
manufacturing was invented in ancient
Egypt fortunately today especially
skilled masters continue to use it to
create the most beautiful artworks made
of glass as raw materials special glass
paintings are used their section as are
necessary drawing for the master it can
be a flower a geometric figure an animal
in general almost anything to create
such canes molten glass masses of
different colors are layered on top of
each other when the resulting lump is
stretched out its cross-section forms a
whimsical pattern when the cane hardens
it's crushed into small pieces to be
used in the manufacture of the final
product despite the fact that the glass
looks soft and malleable it's not easy
to shape it don't forget that the
temperature is extremely high so you
need an incredible level of precision
and craftsmanship
patterns tabletop kitchen worktops can
be made of a variety of materials
however it's only in epoxy resin
worktops that craftsmen really put all
their skills and soul into each such
tabletop is unique the process is
actually quite messy though to get a
really beautiful surface you have to
work really hard
the master alternately pours resin evens
itself creates gradients and passes
using a variety of tools at first glance
it may seem that the work isn't too
complicated but in fact you need to have
a great imagination to create a really
beautiful picture</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
