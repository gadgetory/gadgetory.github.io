I'm gonna be the voice in today's video
thanks for your understanding
laying paving stones the creation of the
paved roads were used to usually starts
in specialized workshops first cement
crushed stone dies and plasticizers are
mixed the mixture is then processed on a
vibrating table cast into molds and lets
it harden when the paving towels acquire
their trademark appearance they are sent
to the construction sites their workers
have to lay them properly on a specially
prepared surface this is a traditional
paving method but the one you see on the
screen is a more original way the
workers use a template and mortar to
shape the slabs directly where they are
going to be laid the mixture has a thick
consistency it is malleable and can take
almost any shape if it is properly
identified it won't lose its shape after
removing the template thanks to this the
workers can speed up the process and
reduce the cost of laying the path
it is noteworthy that the templates can
be very different in this case for
example paving stones are made in the
form of eight bricks this paving method
forces the craftsmen to work very
carefully the template is removed slowly
so as to not damage the shape of the
slabs they shouldn't be touched during
the rest of the process and not even by
accident
roof covering a rather large number of
materials is used to cover roofs one of
the most common is metal sheets they are
usually made of lead it is a flexible
material that can take almost any shape
this is one of its main advantages
because roofs often have complex shapes
which makes it difficult to cover them
it's worth noting these sheets are
almost entirely produced by hand it all
begins in the production facility this
is where the metal takes on the shape it
needs recycled metal is used as the raw
material it is cleaned and then melted
in a huge boiler traditionally the metal
is cast in sand molds first a pile of
sand is placed on a special steel table
then it is manually flattened to create
a perfectly flat surface amazingly this
technology was invented in ancient Rome
but is still used to this day liquid
lead is poured onto the finished sand
platform workers remove the excess so
that the metal hardens in a thin layer
then these sheets are cut or bent
afterwards they are used to create the
roof
wall finishes creative workers as well
as companies engaged in the production
of building materials always come up
with new and interesting ways of
decorating walls in this case for
example we can see the products of the
Mexican company added tech in action
this is a special powder designed
specifically to create original textures
on the walls it consists of cement
chemicals mineral fillers and special
fibers when the powder is mixed with
water it forms a thick dense paste which
is used to finish the wall first the
worker lays the paste in a dense layer
the finished result will imitate natural
stone cladding so the worker draws the
outlines of the future stones using a
sharp tool in order to make them
realistic and texturized
the material is layered the poorest
texture is created by patting the
material with a hard brush additional
relief is created with the help of other
tools once the stones have a
satisfactory appearance the only thing
left to do is cutting off the extra
paste
another way to decorate a wall is to
make fake tiles in this case the worker
layers the paceman thicker layers again
he then uses the sharp end of a trowel
to draw patterns at this stage the
resulting texture is too sharp the
craftsman uses a regular sponge to
subtly soften it before the material
heart is completely it must be treated
one more time
the worker cuts off strips of material
to create the Tao joints this step
requires precision which is why the
expert uses a construction level to
avoid mistakes
Tyl production the technique you see on
the screen was invented in the middle of
the 19th century when builders learned
to make cement tiles decorated with
multicolor patterns the workers who have
mastered this technique used handmade
stencils firsts a pattern is drawn on
paper then pieces of sheet metal are
assembled into a template it can take
from 1 to 3 days to create one the
finished template is placed in the press
form each cell is filled with a three to
five millimeter layer of pigment paste
of different colors
after that the template is carefully
removed from the form the master pours
the mixture over the layer of pigment
paste which will become the basis of the
future tile then a hydraulic press takes
over pressing the two layers together
interestingly the concrete tiles are not
fired after pressing the tiles are kept
in special temperature conditions for
about a month the results is a unique
and very durable decoration material its
main features that each tile is made by
hand which is a laborious task
concrete patterns almost every city has
buildings with their facades decorated
with quaint patterns and sculptures some
people will probably assume they were
made in workshops and then brought to
the site and glued to the surface of the
building
however it's not like that the workers
cut out concrete patterns directly on
the surface of the building first the
pattern is drawn on the wall with chalk
then a thick layer of cement is laid on
top defining the outlines of the future
decoration
finally the sculpting stage begins when
the master cuts out the pattern on the
surface giving it an aesthetically
pleasing shape it is painstaking work
and if you started it
you can't just leave it and go on
vacation the entire pattern must be
finished before the cement hardens
barrel vault the first barrel vaults
were built a long time ago by ancient
civilizations they're still popular
today but only the most diligent and
responsible workers can build a barrel
vault metal profiles can be used as
beams it is actually much more difficult
to make beams from wood as in this case
before starting construction you need to
prepare the wooden beams forward if you
look closely you'll see when the wooden
parts are attached to the ceiling
they are already curved there are two
ways to bend the wood hot and cold
the wood is generously lubricated with
glue until it becomes wet then it is
bent with the help of presses to give it
a required shape during the cold bending
the wooden bar is simply left until it
dries
when using the heat bending the wood is
covered with a film and warmed up this
way the glue dries faster once the wood
dries out the press is no longer needed
the wooden beam keeps its new shape now
you just have to attach the wood to the
ceiling beams and the wall in this case
a pneumatic brad nailer is used to
fasten it
hey stop being lazy it's time to use
that brain of yours welcome to brain
time incredible facts from the past the
present and even the future the power of
nature and wild animals amazing facts
and unsolved mysteries you'll find all
this and much more hair subscribe now
