speedbumps work efficiently and do their
job but have several drawbacks first
they contribute to the formation of
traffic congestion on the roads as cars
reduce speed to 20 kilometers per hour
second the car slows down and then
increases speed which increases the
amount of harmful emissions into the
atmosphere experts from the Mexican city
of Morelia have invented speed bumps
that don't have this problem
the principle of operation of the topi
intelligente is quite simple on the road
special sensors that can measure the
speed of the vehicle are placed in front
of the speed bump if the car approaches
at a low speed the speed bump hides in
other words it's not necessary to reduce
the speed to 20 kilometers per hour to
continue moving if the car moves too
fast the speed breaker remains unfolded
forcing the driver to slow down
Kiwi baht the culture of ordering food
at home appeared relatively recently
however in the short term of its
existence it has steadily improved and
seems to have reached its peak there are
already places in the world where food
delivery is done by compact and
intelligent robots however for now
they're only being tested in the spring
of this year it was revealed that Kiwi
delivery robots are being tested on the
campus of the University of California
Berkeley it should be noted that they
successfully completed more than 10,000
orders the innovative robots have two
key features first they're compact size
the Kiwi robot takes up virtually no
space on the sidewalks and therefore
doesn't interfere with pedestrian
movement the second feature is that the
robot doesn't perform the entire
delivery cycle from the restaurant to
the customers door the engineers
realized that using a robot for a single
order would be inefficient and therefore
several robots are being developed now
in the future some robots will work
inside the restaurant others will take
the orders to the necessary place on the
street and the last robot will have to
deliver them to the door of the users
currently they are testing this third
robot the developments in testing of the
other two robots will be carried out in
the future
capsule hotels travellers struggled
daily with the need to find a place to
sleep there are many options but not all
are convenient hotels are expensive or
not very comfortable in hostels you have
to share a room with strangers and not
everyone is willing to rent a room or an
apartment from a local resident
that's why capsule hotels and hostels
are gaining popularity in the world the
first institutions of this type appeared
in Japan but now they can be found all
over the world for example the first
capsule hospital in the UK appeared in
the winter of 2018 it's interesting that
initially the appearance of such hotels
was dictated by the lack of free space
today capsule hotels are reasonably
spacious and some don't even look like
low or narrow capsules but like small
rooms the capsule may cost less than a
place in a hostel all have the same
price however the person gets privacy by
closing the shutter you can hide from
prying eyes in addition the capsules are
made of soundproof material so guests do
not interfere with each other a night in
a small capture will cost you about $50
inside you'll find air conditioning a
lamp a plug and a USB connector this
type of hostel is not suitable for
people with claustrophobia though larger
capsules will obviously cost more but
are more convenient for example some
even have faults and drawers for storage
Enlil modern engineers are devising more
and more interesting and unusual ways to
produce electricity in an
environmentally friendly way
Turkish specialist kerim Davichi who
lives in Istanbul came up with a new way
to get electricity from the air on the
way to work the man noticed that when
buses go towards each other they create
a fairly powerful airflow when they meet
so we came up with the idea of creating
turbines that would spin at the expense
of this airflow and generate electricity
the man managed to obtain permission to
test the turbines after which they were
installed in the Topkapi region as out
sort of 300 turbines were installed over
a 1 kilometer stretch if all the tests
are successfully completed in the future
with the help of them it will be
possible to provide electricity to more
than 20,000 houses the energy created by
the turbines is enough to distribute
free Wi-Fi power the devices to
determine air temperature and carbon
dioxide emissions they can also be used
in seismic monitoring stations
mata toc twin an airplane tug is a
massive structure that takes up a lot of
space due to the fact that there must
always be a place in the hangar for tug
maneuvers space can't quite be used
efficiently
however a new equipment has arrived to
solve this problem the Mater toc twin is
a compact tug that hardly takes up any
space it's not only does it help to park
aircraft safely and quickly but it can
also increase the hangar volume by 40%
the Moffatt op twin is remotely
controlled its small efficient and
therefore in addition to all the other
advantages can significantly reduce the
cost of maintenance in personnel the
manufacturer offers a wide variety of
models that differ in their load
capacity
thus the Mata top twin can transport
aircraft weighing up to 95 tonnes
de fin MC sterility in medical
facilities as well as in other
institutions must be off the highest
quality to prevent visitors from
spreading dirt through the hallways boot
protectors are offered at the entrance
however they are not the optimal
solution
there are fabric shoe covers but many
companies use polyethylene to make them
which is harmful to the environment
South Korean company de Chien MC has
invented a cleaning system that
eliminates the need for shoe covers the
first device developed as an automatic
shoe cleaning machine
the brushes rotate in different
directions effectively removing all dirt
from the sole after that the person can
move to the second part of the platform
and dry the water of the met
the second device is a vacuum mat which
absorbs dirt particles and dust from the
shoes when the person walks over it it
should be noted that the mat turns on
only in the area where the shoe is
located giving the equipment greater
durability and using electricity more
efficiently
curiously the mat can also be modified
to clean dirt from cars and other
vehicles
