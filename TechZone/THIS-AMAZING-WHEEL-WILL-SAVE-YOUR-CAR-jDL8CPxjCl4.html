size start to get damaged even when the
car drives through an 80 millimeter deep
pothole at a speed of 28 km/h it appears
that on roads with poor road surfaces
there's a high risk of damaging the rim
of the wheel jeopardizing the safety of
the driver and the passengers michelin
together with maxi on wheels has set
itself the goal of creating rims that
are less likely to be damaged when
driving through a pothole flexible wheel
was the result it consists of two rubber
flanges mounted on a special rim the

the ride quality while also absorbing
impacts when hitting small obstacles

helicopters attached to a unique mobile
ground platform
is designed to give the trainee the
illusion of flying during training
during the first phase of training the
platform is programmed in such a way as
to securely fix the helicopter
this way the novice learns how to get up
in the air turn around and rotate in
doing so the platform with the help of
the side supports keeps the helicopter
in the right position on its own during
further training the supports stop
holding the aircraft and the pilot
learns how to operate the helicopter
