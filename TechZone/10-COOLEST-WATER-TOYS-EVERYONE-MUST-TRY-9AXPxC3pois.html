system
the device has a board which has
attached to the user's body with a pair

mechanism is pulled by a motor boat and
the user simply has to maneuver change
the angle of inclination and hold
himself using a pair of handlebars in
the wings to sink further simply incline
the wings down and to go up incline them
in that direction interestingly enough
you don't need a high speed to perform
all kinds of tricks underwater this
device will cost you $300
the Triton 3303 this submarine weighs 8
tons and can reach a depth underwater of
3,300 feet the submarine can sink down
in record time thanks to a special

passengers the developers also added
handmade leather seats and a built-in
sound system to make the stay on
boardwalk comfortable it is worth noting
that the device itself is made of high
quality materials for example the cabin
is made of highly resistant glass that
allows it to support great pressure
under water
the electric motor of the submarine is
enough for 16 hours of work and the
oxygen reservoir - but also in case of
emergency you can find oxygen tanks in
the cabin that'll last for 96 hours on
top of that each submarine has lifting
points on the top and the sides which
stabilise the device when it's going up

the price of this device jetovator this
unique device for water sports is
compatible with all kinds of jet skis
and it has a power of a hundred and
thirty horsepower this device uses a 50
foot hose to connect to the hydro Jets
and lift the vehicle up in the air using
a powerful water jet the jetovator can
reach a speed of 25 miles per hour and
can travel large distances depending on
the needs of the user the driver can
lift the vehicle 26 feet up in the air
or 10 metres underwater but he needs a
companion with him despite the power of
this device the developers assure that
it's very easy to use even if you've
never driven a water vehicle in your

miles per hour it's highly maneuverable
it can lift itself on top of the water
perform all kinds of sharp turns up to
90 degrees even at high speeds according
to the developers in four years of
experimentation before the beginning of
mass production the ship didn't flip
over once this is possible thanks to a
special suspended engine place on the
middle of the ship and a special
construction the standard version has a
70 horsepower motor but if the user
wants it he can ask for a more powerful
engine basically this water vehicle is a
semi light asymmetric catamaran which

Seabreacher
this bodes is a hybrid between a
personal submarine and a boat and by its
looks it resembles a shark it is worth
noting that the design is not only a
funny decision but it actually increases
the streamlining of the ship making it
even faster the shape along with a
powerful air engine allows this
submarine to reach 25 miles per hour
underwater and 50 miles per hour on the
surface on top of that the Seabreacher
at top speed can sink at a depth of 5
feet and after that jump in a very
stylish way to the surface and reach a
height of 11.5 feet a special control
system allows the captain to rotate 360
degrees on the water and perform other
tricks like a dolphin this is possible
thanks to a series of mechanical fins
and a tail which control the process of
sinking and turning inside this shark
can travel to people so in the cabin you
can find to sporting scoop seats for the
pilot and that can
the price of this underwater boat
