like to show you has no practical use
however it is pleasing to the eye as it
turns the faucet of your sink into a
decorative element this type of LED
lighting can have a variety of designs
there are several types of nozzles too
they can be of different sizes to fit a
faucet in this case lighting is an
integral part of the design it should be
noted that the lights are powered by
water pressure this means that they
don't need to be connected to upper
power sources if you want the device to
have a useful function you can use a
sensor that responds to temperature
changes in this case if the water is
cold it will glow blue if the water is
hot it will shine orange if the water
reaches a dangerous temperature the
light will flash red
this warning system minimizes the risk
of birds
--home biogas 2.0 natural gas is a
mineral extracted from within the earth
according to research its reserves will
last between 50 and 60 years after which
humanity will have to look for
alternatives it's worth noting that
these alternatives are already being
invented like this product called home
biogas 2.0 it is a mobile and portable
biological gas generator that on the one
hand reduces the amounts of waste
produced by people and on the other hand
saves gas the fact is that an average
family produces about two liters of
organic waste per day this invention
which looks like a whimsical tent turns
garbage into gas in the comfort of your
home when inflated the tent takes up
about two cubic meters of space there's
a funnel on the top to load the garbage
during the heating season home biogas
2.0 produces about 12 liters of biogas
per day this is enough for the gas stove
to work for three hours the gas produced
by the device can also be used on
lighting in addition the station also
produces ecological liquid fertilizer
which is discharged through a special
tap the construction doesn't let
unpleasant odors escape and doesn't
attract insects either
the price of the invention is 720
dollars
egg collection system automation on
poultry farms is an important process
that reduces the need for manual labor
while increase in productivity and
profit the egg collection system you see
on the screen is an auxilary facility
for the battery cages where egg-laying
hens live this invention solves a whole
series of problems firstly it reduces
the time-consuming process of collecting
the eggs the fact is that these poultry
farms produce more than a million eggs a
day it's hard to imagine how much time
and effort it would take to collect the
eggs manually second and most
importantly stress levels in birds are
reduced by minimizing contact with
humans the system is designed to
transport the eggs as carefully as
possible
this means that almost all the eggs
reach the tray in one piece the device
consists of an egg collector usually one
for each henhouse the eggs are sent to a
long conveyor belt then another conveyor
belt where the lifting mechanism sends
them to the packing table
tighten the next invention we want to
show you will be useful for all people
regardless of their lifestyle
professional or personal preferences
Titan is a device developed by Joseph
Joseph
it's a trashcan that compresses the
trash inside we're sure that you've seen
a trash can completely fill even though
there's only a couple of things inside
like boxes of bottles titan solves this
problem it also allows you to take out
the trash with minimal effort and
without getting your hands dirty the
price is two hundred and thirty-six
dollars
planting machine here we have a system
consisting of two separate machines it's
designed for fast automated planting of
seedlings in pots the first equipment is
the TT a MIDI curve 8 gr transplant er
it's equipped with a manipulator that
lifts the plants by moving them up and
then lowers them to the prepared soil
this automatic plant transplant ER is
designed to work with an automatic
flower pot filling machine this is the
mayor 2400 dr the rotating round table
on which the pots are placed is the
working area surprisingly this system is
capable of handling between four and
eight thousand pots per hour pay
attention to the synchronized work of
all the elements of the equipment the
advantage of the system is that the
plants are placed in the holes
immediately after they've been excavated
this prevents the soil from collapsing
at losing its shape MIDI curved plants
eight plants simultaneously each arm is
equipped with its own motor - this
allows them to move separately from each
other and plant seedlings differently
transforming rooms the Canadian company
garlis systems is developing several
projects that significantly expands the
functionality of different indoor spaces
the fact is that Flass rooms concert
halls and other similar places can't be
transformed to meet different needs
due to their design characteristics gala
systems engineers say that they can
create a room that changes its
appearance and design characteristics in
a matter of minutes it only takes 10 to
30 minutes for the room to change the
number of seats their configuration
their size and the direction of the
seats the rows of seats are magically
hidden under the floor or leave the
floor changing their height while the
multi-level floor becomes a single level
one you don't have to worry about
building safety seats are stable and
strong and the floor is extremely
durable what you see on the screen is a
project that was completed in 2014 in
the Swiss city of Lausanne experts have
rheic whipped the conference center so
that 2,300 out of 3000 seats can be
changed
waste recycling machine the last
invention we're going to show you today
will improve the environmental situation
in the world at least a little the fact
is that every year mankind produces uses
and dumps a large amount of plastic in
landfills this material is not
biodegradable this means that it's not
destroyed by natural microbiological and
chemical processes the decomposition of
plastic takes at least 500 years that's
why it's so important to recycle the
people you see on the screen have come
up with the idea of turning used and
unnecessary plastic into raw material
for paving slabs the trash has turned
into cronies and then melted and added
to a traditional concrete mix it should
be noted that this type of plastic
filler does not negatively affect the
quality of the finished slaps on the
contrary molten plastic is viscous and
improves the adhesion of the components
of the mixture to each other
hey stop being lazy it's time to use
that brain of yours welcome to brain
time incredible facts from the past the
present and even the future the power of
nature and wild animals amazing facts
and unsolved mysteries you'll find all
this and much more hair subscribe now
you won't regret it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
