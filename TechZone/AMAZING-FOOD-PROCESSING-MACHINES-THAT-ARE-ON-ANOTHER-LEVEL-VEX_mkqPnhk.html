easy to peel even when you're cooking at
home so of course if you need to peel
them for industrial needs specialized
equipment is used the machine you see on
the screen is produced by the dutch
company finis this is a processing line
for vegetables covering the whole
process all the way to the final
packaging each onion is processed in
many times at first the forklift puts
the onion box on a special platform
which flips Edom's sends the vegetables
over a conveyor belt in order for each
onion to be peeled the machine must cut
off its route that's why the vegetables
are separated from each other and sent
for peeling in separate cells
knows how the equipment then also turns
each vegetable over so it faces the
blade with its backside only after that
the onion is peeled the equipment
removes the skin and then finally cuts
the vegetables the last task performed
by the processing line is packing the
onions it's noteworthy that the size of
the sliced pieces is adjustable the
displayed equipment is also capable of
processing carrots potatoes beet roots
peppers and some other vegetables IMS
forming machine before you start baking
you need to make the dough the machine
you're seeing right now is designed for
this purpose especially for cooking
dumplings and other similar dishes this
unit manufactures a ready-made product
and the quality doesn't differ from that
of homemade dishes
the video shows the work of the
production equipment paired with a
special rotating table its allows to
make production more autonomous and
space operators from the need for
careful control surprisingly this
machine produces up to 90 kilograms of
dumplings per hour making from 80 to 120
pieces every minute
frig easy line if you've ever wondered
how pastry products such as strudels and
stuffed buns are made on a production
scale you're about to get your answer
this is a processing line from the
German company fridge it can cut fold
twists fill and punch dough that's why
it can be used to create more than 10
different pastry products from pretzels
to rolls the machine is designed for the
needs of small and medium-sized bakeries
there's minimal involvement of the
operators in the process they only carry
out the maintenance such as cleaning as
well as the supply of raw materials and
the assembly of the finished product
saw Mack line this line of equipment is
designed for processing large quantities
of lettuce the video shows how the cuts
washed product which can be found at
almost any store is made first the
lettuce is personally conveyor belt
workers manually separate the leaves
from the stem with a knife but leaf
reading which is a more demanding task
is done by the machines the next step is
to rinse the lettuce thoroughly in water
at this stage leaves that are unsuitable
for further processes are also removed
it's very important that every leaf is
thoroughly cleaned and that's why
they're washed twice wet leaves cannot
be packaged as they're more likely to
rot for this reason the leaves are then
placed on a vibrating conveyor belt
which shakes off excess water from the
products but that's not the end of it in
addition moisture is removed by this
centrifuge only after that can the
leaves be sent to the shops the
production line consists of a total of
seven separate types of equipment
together they're able to process 500 to
800 kilograms of lettuce per hour
texts or machinery sliced ham and cheese
aren't made by hand but by a very
advanced piece of equipment like these
machines from the German company text or
the manufacturer offers about 10
different models what you see now on the
screen is the working process of one of
them for example the models the TS 500
and TS 700 work in a similar way but
have different powers and blade sizes
both machines are designed for slicing a
wide range of products but the most
important thing is that they can stack
the cutting in 12 different ways
depending on the needs of the
manufacturer for example with a small
gap piled on top of each other
folded and so on
the disk cursor combines high capacity
and short recharging time the open blade
design facilitates the cleaning process
here's another equipment for slicing
products the blade cuts several types of
meats simultaneously afterwards they're
stacked on top of each other with these
smart overlap from here stacks of
products arrive at the smart loader this
is another conveyor belt designed for
folding the product in a suitable way
for packaging this way all the work is
done by the machines the only thing left
to do is loading the raw materials into
the machine on time
Pizza processing line the last equipment
we want to show you today is used by
Mickey's whole pizza to produce frozen
pizzas surprisingly in this case to the
machines perform an almost complete
cycle from cooking to packing in boxes a
person is only needed at the very
beginning in order to fill the round
forms with dough from here they're sent
to a conveyor belts where toppings are
applied to the dough in several steps
first the tomato sauce then the cheese
is poured on top it's ground right here
you can see in the background how the
workers put entire cheese blocks in
special containers the machine can't
independently track how even the cheese
layer is that's why this job is done by
people now it's time for heat treatment
Pizza comes out of the oven with a
golden-brown crust and almost ready for
packing in order for the pizzas are
cooled down it's sent on a particularly
long conveyor belt only after that does
the package stage begin first each pizza
is placed on a cardboard pad then a
layer of film is stretched over the
product as this pizza is salt frozen its
then subjected to flash freezing this
technology makes it possible to preserve
all the prophecies that the products as
much as possible in their original form
finally the pits were sent to the boxes
interestingly this work is also done by
people while special equipment assembles
and glues the boxes the boxes are
delivered to the factory in stacks of
cardboard sheets
hey stop being lazy it's time to use
that brain of yours welcome to brain
time incredible facts from the past the
present and even the future the power of
