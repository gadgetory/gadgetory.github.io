are used to manufacture Springs in this
case the work is done by cold forging
which means the metal is not heated
before being shaped the procedure
requires a high level of dedication and
precision from factory workers the video
shows the well coordinated work of four
workers that's so many people it takes
to create a really big spring it's being
bent very slowly the workers have to
maintain the correct position of the
workpiece at all times otherwise the
metal may break down if for some reason
there's no resistance on the part of the
workers the operation of the machine can
lead to dangerous consequences
Inc making the process of producing ink
at factories is mostly an automated work
even though people no longer play a key
role here the operation of numerous
machines is impossible without them this
is a demonstration of the amazingly well
coordinated work of machines and people
every machine and every person in the
factory is an important link in the
production change what you see on the
screen right now are the machines used
by the printing ink company whose owner
has shared his knowledge about the
process when he first made some ink it
was incredibly exhausting however when
the work was completed he felt a sense
of anguish instead of relief so he
decided to continue making ink is always
a challenge no matter how
technologically advanced the machines
are
only four colors have been come produced
at factories yellow magenta cyan and
black all other colors are developed on
their basis in facts the production of
ink is mixing colored pigment with
solvent at the first stage a person adds
pigments of the industrial mix that
filled with this thick viscous substance
the next stage in which a person is
involved is dispersion the mixture made
in a mixer consists of large amounts of
dry pigment lumps the person and the
Machine break of these lumps and
distribute the pigment evenly over the
whole mixture the procedure is performed
in two stages first the mixture is
placed in a crusher where small metal
balls break the pigment lumps then the
future ink passes through three rollers
rotating in different directions which
finally mix the components together
the quality control is also performed by
people making sure all ink patches have
identical prophesies
tire restoration for a long time
restoring the tread pattern on a tire
was an impossible task as the years went
by the technological process allowed the
procedures to be carried out manually
finally today tire restoration is a
fairly quick and easy process because
manual labor is skilfully integrated
with automated processes the machine you
see on the screen is known as the ring
builder 3000 the Italian company
Marangoni produces such equipment at the
first stage the worker puts a completely
faded tire on the working area and
starts the mechanisms the tire is
stretched the equipment itself covers
the surface with a thin layer of
compound all the machine performs this
task the person puts a tread on another
working area at this stage it looks like
a ribbon the equipment stretches the
treads and then puts it on top of the
tire so the most demanding parts of the
job is done by a powerful machine the
system then processes the surface of the
tire to ensure that the layers are
securely fixed amazingly this teamwork
made it possible to restore the tire in
just three minutes it means that in one
working shift the ring builder 3000
restores up to 200 tyres
Cley car model the for designers finish
a new car and send it into production
they need to make sure it looks perfect
for this purpose a clay prototype is
made which is an exact full-size copy of
the future car this modeling technique
was invented about eight years ago
despite the fact that car manufacturing
technologies have advanced a lot in the
last year's this stage has not changed
that's because clay models allow to
critically examine and evaluate the
appearance of the future car for the
last time play is a soft flexible
material so designers can easily and
quite quickly fix any defects they might
find the work is carried out both
outside and inside of the car even the
slightest drawbacks are fixed today the
creation of clay modelling is mostly an
automated process however people still
play a key role giving the model its
final look
interestingly there are practically no
schools where you could learn such
skills
that's why real experts are so valued
they all have their own techniques and
favorite tools when people create things
that previously existed only is a sketch
on a piece of paper or in a computer
file everything is used from sawmills to
kitchen knives and surgical scalpels
more precise work is done by machines
phony products it's hard to imagine how
much time it would take a person to
manually make all these curves on a
mattress especially taking into account
that each product should be identical to
another and all the cuts should have the
same width depth and shape that's why
modern production halls use special
numerically controlled machines they
guarantee high precision and excellent
results of course the equipment is
controlled by a qualified person
otherwise it would be impossible to get
the work done it is noteworthy that not
only mattresses but also pillows are
made in this way when the work is done
the worker only needs to remove the
extra material in this case cutting is
done with a thin metal thread truly
technological equipment works equally
fast and efficiently with materials of
different density and texture the
equipment you've just seen is not the
only one used for manufacturing foam
products this one for example cuts the
foam into two identical halves and at
the same time squeezes it giving the
production their desired shape
silicon rubber production
making products from silicone rubber is
always a long and time-consuming process
if only because it takes a lot of time
and effort to create the rubber itself
this is another example of well
coordinated work between a machine and a
person silicon rubber as you can see is
a very elastic material it's made by
mixing high molecular compounds of
silicon and organic substances before
the material acquires the correct
properties it is processed several times
with special rollers it's impossible to
say exactly how long this procedure will
take each time the workers decide
whether the material is ready based on
its texture and their experience the
expert runs the rubber through the
rollers over and over again if necessary
colouring pigments are added we'd like
to draw your attention to the fact that
this work can actually be quite
dangerous the rollers exert great
pressure on the rubber you can't put
your hands inside so you have to be
careful and focused throughout the
process
hey stop being lazy it's time to use
that brain of yours welcome to brain
time incredible facts from the past the
present and even the future the power of
nature and wild animals amazing facts
and unsolved mysteries you'll find all
this and much more hair subscribe now
you won't regret it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
