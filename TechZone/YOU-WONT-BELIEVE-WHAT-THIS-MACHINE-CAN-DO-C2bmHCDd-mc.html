production of metal is widely used to
make building materials such as bricks
and tiles and as an additive to cement
special containers of harder materials
resistant to high temperatures are used
to extract the slag while still hot this
is necessary since the incandescent slag
can reach 1300 degrees Celsius vehicles
with high-strength bodies deliver the
containers with the hot material to
their destination and automatically
overturn them at the point of discharge
it's noteworthy that for this the
operator does not need to leave the
cabin
thus safety is ensured when working at
extremely high temperatures
blg 60 this armored bridge was a joint
development of East Germany and Poland
when deployed the bridge has a total
length of 20 1.6 metres a width of 3.2
meters and a height of 9.8 meters it can
cover a maximum clearance of 20 meters
in length thereby significantly
increasing the potency in any terrain
the blg 60 has a maximum load capacity
of 50,000 kilograms the main external
differences between the blg 60 and his
predecessor the MC 55 a are the surface
of the bridge as well as the wheels of
the pulleys in addition the blg 60 as a
collective security system and equipment
for underwater driving it should be
noted that there is an updated version
of the blg 60 bridge builder under the
destination blg 67 which is currently
used in Bulgaria and Poland

at the front boom in a separate hatch
the tank is equipped with a small
bulldozer blade installed in the front
of the hull it's used to prepare a
section under the bridge clear obstacles
and stabilise the machine during the
bridge building process the additional
equipment of the tank bridge layer also
includes containers and baskets for
storage around the tower and at the rear
of the hull on request the same auxilary
power unit can be installed instead of a
bridge
this version is able to deploy two
separate bridges each bridge is 14
metres long and they're carried on top
of each other on the roof of the hull in
order to build bridges separately the
tank is equipped with two guidance
devices
cameto MTH 30 this unusual vehicle
similar to a towing platform is in fact
a portal conveyor it's used for
transportation of long cargos and as a
total carrying capacity of 30 tons the
electronic steering system provides
unique maneuverability for this type of
vehicle thanks to it the Camaro MTH 30
can be used in metallurgy shipbuilding
the timber industry and many other
industries the overall length of the
conveyor is six point eight meters the
overall width is three point four meters
and the weight of the car is twenty
three and a half tonnes
despite this the cameto MTH 30 can reach
15 kilometers per hour without Congo and
up to ten at maximum load the conveyor
is powered by a diesel engine and has

Komatsu D 155 w this unique Japanese
bulldozer capable of working underwater
can engage in various works at the
bottom of the water
for example clearing the bay and raking
mud and debris ashore for cleaning it
should be noted that the bulldozer was
developed back in 1971 and is completely
remote-controlled
these machines can work at a depth for
up to seven minutes without losing speed
or productivity and also overcome
obstacles even underwater
unfortunately the production of the
Komatsu D 155 W was stopped in 1993 the
reason for this was the lack of demand
however several bulldozers still operate
today successfully coping with their
work
l60 lock stacker the rated lifting
capacity of this loader exceeds 27 tons
making it better than similar vehicles
of market at the same time a car can
reach speeds of up to 35 point 4 km/h
thanks to its 430 horsepower engine
with a half fuel consumption and two
times the service life the l60 provides
maximum efficiency and reliability in
all phases of operation the increased
height of the cap guarantees maximum
visibility and its internal arrangement
ensures comfort even in bad weather
conditions service compartments
accessible at ground levels simplify
everyday maintenance tasks and make it
possible for one operator to use the
vehicle
cats 973 the cat 973 is the only crawler
loader in its class the loader provides
operator comfort high productivity and
versatility the vehicle was designed to
ensure high performance in this regard
the loader can be used for several tasks
in difficult conditions without reducing
productivity and efficiency the loader
has a strong and reliable design
excellent handling and ease of use
and in addition thanks to his
characteristics the cat 973 can even be
used at extreme temperatures for example
at metallurgical production during slag
discharge and other works
Sena bogan 8 7c this vehicle can be
equipped with both caterpillar tracks
and standard wheels depending on the
field of application it's also mounted
on a stable fixed platform in case the
work involves a lot of weight or is

centre bogan 870s use for transshipment
of scrap bulk and piece materials in
paws as well as in steel making plants
the caterpillar chassis is suitable for
particularly complex bases for example
in a scrapyard or for grinding slack
from steelmaking plants</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
