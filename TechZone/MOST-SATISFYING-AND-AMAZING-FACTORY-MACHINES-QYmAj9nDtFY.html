screen was made in Germany it's a very
original welding tool for metal parts
the circular arrangement of the torches
allows you to heat the surface evenly
from all those sites this type of
welding provides a better holding of
solid parts when the metal under the
influence of high temperature is
softened the parts are squeezed
contributing to the diffusion of the
materials among themselves the results
of this work is an excellent seizure ie
a tight joint the advantage of this
machine is that it has a well adjusted
flame flow
laser engraving there are several ways
to apply a pattern or drawing to a piece
of metal or any other surface however
none of these methods can be compared in
accuracy and speed with laser engraving
the use of this kind of equipment is
relevant to businesses that are involved
in mechanical engineering instrument
making nuclear power jewelry and
advertising the image or text is applied
to the aluminium stuff is using a focus
laser beam the main difference between
laser engraving and laser marking is
that the image has a relief and depth
the work process of this kind of
equipment is quite simple light from the
emitter is transmitted through a system
of mirrors or optical fiber to the lens
wearer acquires its final focus and gets
on the material notably the accuracy and
precision of the focused beam and
therefore the engraving lines depend on
the distance between the lens our
material typically the closer they are
to each other the more accurate the work
is the video shows how the fiber cube
laser marking and engraving machine
works the American company laser star
manufactures such machines the high
level of precision is guaranteed by the
patented star FX software it makes it
possible to carry out complex engraving
and texturing which was not available on
the market before
cosmetic production the production of
any cosmetic product begins with the
preparation of ingredients face masks
are no exception the video shows the
production processes of the company lush
in this case the making of a refreshing
facial mask the very first step is the
preparation of a rose petal tincture
when it's ready sea water is added a
powerful industrial mixer while the
liquids being prepared another
industrial mixer produces the base of
glycerin and a substance called
carrageenan the next stage of the base
creation is the addition of propylene
glycol a substance that promotes the
uniform mixing of all the ingredients
previously added the mask as a cleansing
effect provided by other components like
it's helping : high-quality white clay
when all the ingredients are evenly
mixed the base is ready and added to the
tank with a rose seawater finally the
last stage of production is the addition
of color and essential oils in this case
lavender and chamomile oils the mask is
ready when it cools down and is manually
poured into pots all production
processes are performed on professionals
specialized machines
it's noteworthy that the company pays
great attention to ecology so the
equipment's is energy-saving and doesn't
harm environment
vacuum packaging quite often the final
stage of production of various products
is vacuum packaging with a special film
this process greatly simplifies the
transport of parts as the film as a
protective function preventing scratches
tearing and other defects on the surface
its height fits of the film to the
surface as well as the absence of
unevenness in the packaging can usually
be achieved only when using high quality
equipment semi-automatic and fully
automatic packaging machines are
suitable in this case you can see the
operation of the sp7 machine for the
british companies CPAC limited the
equipment you see on the screen as a 3d
design system and uses new technologies
as a result the quality of the seal is
improved while the role of the operator
is minimized and the need for
maintenance is almost completely
eliminated notable features include
automatic magnetic locks and a vacuum
pump the sp7 packaging machine optimizes
production processes by vacuuming large
quantities of details per minute the
working area is 765 by 511 millimetres
but it can be adjusted to the needs of
the workshop candy production just as
there are many different types of sweets
on the market there are also many
different types of machines that can be
used in their production what kind of
equipment is used is determined by the
composition of the product ie what they
are made of for example the production
of candy and some workshops is only
partially automated the caramel is
heated and then the workers manually add
sugar of dye and then they bring the
mixture to a homogenous state then it's
necessary to wait until the composition
cools down that becomes more viscous
then it's cut into pieces to make
several caramel plots of the same size
only after that the stamping machines
come into play in this case several
types are used the caramel which has now
become thick is driven through the
forging machine to produce a place of
sweets the professional equipment allows
to quickly get a large number of
products identical in appearance when
the caramel finally hardens we simply
have to break the plates to get the
sweets for all you Ste
but the production of jelly beans is a
more automated process in the video you
can see the work of Bosch machines first
and the industrial mixer the main
ingredients are mixed these are water
sugar and a gelling agent the process
doesn't take long because of the high
power of the mixer the liquids that
transfer to the extruder which molds it
the gummy candy dries first then it's
left for 24 hours to cool down it's
noteworthy that the equipment you see on
the screen produces about 14,000 pieces
per minute the next machine is a special
drum where the gummy candy is lubricated
and gets its usual glossy surface then
other machines sort the candy into
identical portions and packet
the last bottle production the
production of glassware on an industrial
scale is almost always carried out with
the help of a large number of equipment
and machines the fact is that the work
is done with materials heat it's with
great temperature it's simply not safe
for a person to work under such
conditions and even if you wants it you
can't provide the same work speed the
first step is to prepare the raw
materials cleaning them from unwanted
impurities the dry blends that's fed
into the furnace to produce the glass is
known as in feed it should be
homogeneous it consists of quartz and
dolomite flour glass short aluminum and
some other components after the mixture
is turned into glass it's cooled down to
make it viscous a special machine
creates droplets of glass at the same
size which are fed to the next equipment
which gives its form to the future
bottle the treated items are transports
it's were conveyor belt which sends them
for additional heat treatment ie to the
furnace this procedure relieves the
internal residual stress in the glass
containers so the bottles won't burst
during further processing and operation
furthermore another machine sprays the
bottles with a solution that prevents
scratches and abrasions on the surface
only quality control and packaging
remains the use of advanced technology
and quality machines makes it possible
to create more than a million vessels
per day
hey stop being lazy it's time to use
that brain of yours welcome to brain

present and even the future the power of
