developed by the famous British blogger
Colin Furze who constantly adapts and
creates all kinds of devices
in 2016 he introduced the hover bike a
flying bicycle without pedals instead
simply turn on the machine and right but
first and foremost it's necessary to
learn and stand Stavely on the face and
to hold your hands to a special steering
wheel and use it like an ordinary
bicycle handle in the front and in the
back of the main seat you can find
rotating blades which lift the device up
using the force of the engine in order
to make the invention more convenient
for buttons in the central panel can be
used to turn the device on and off and
to move in the desired direction
nevertheless it takes a lot of practice
to learn how to accurately manage this
technique it's also worth noting that in
the dark the backlight turns
automatically are
drifting car Irishmen James Carroll
created this buggy over the span of
three years on the tubular frame of this
machine
the inventor installed a modified GSXR
1000 motor from a suzuki sports bike the
engine power of this car is a hundred
and fifty horsepower
in addition James's buggy car is a
programmable ECU control unit with
interchangeable settings a limited slip
differential and an independent
suspension the four-wheel vehicles
equipped with small front lights in an
open metal construction for one person
the machine created by this Irish
inventor can make perfect turns so it's
ideal for drifting at the same time it's
possible to perform maneuvers of
absolutely any level of complexity also
worth noting is that all the
functionality of the buggy car allows
you to get excellent dynamics and
manageability in addition for this
project he spent more than 15,000 euros
humanoid robots this humanoid robot was
named Arduino mega
it's controlled using a specially
designed exoskeleton which allows it to
accurately repeat all the movements of a
person
the robots equipped with high
sensitivity sensors which instantly
receive a signal after the action is
performed using electrical pulses the
commands are recognized and the robot
immediately reproduces the movement in
addition Arduino mega is able to
maintain balance with a slight
inclination they can stand thanks to a
series of wasting mechanisms installed
on the limbs and also to the sensors
which can recognize literally in one
second the sequence in which they need
to work
in addition the exoskeleton was
specially designed for humans being very
easy to control the arms and legs of the
robot
electric airplane Peters rear pole
developed this invention in in the
basement of his house
like an ordinary aircraft Peters
electrical design has a control lever
that allows you to monitor the altitude
and speed of flight in addition the
electric aircraft is equipped with the
dashboards and more carefully control
the plane and prevents any failures in
the system
the aircraft is operated by an electric
motor powered by powerful batteries the
rear parts of the structure is equipped
with two symmetrically arranged blades
which together with the engines
operation allow the aircraft to
accelerate to the required speed
moreover two wheels are used during
acceleration they were carefully chosen
for the electrical device it's
interesting that Peter independently
modeled all parts of the aircraft
tank all major parts of this tank are
made from materials such as metal and
wood while the support plates are
securely fixed with conventional tools
the unit is equipped with a conventional
control lever a clutch pedal and a break
this homemade tank is approximately two
and a half meters long
which in turn contributes to good
maneuverability of the device when
driving like a real tank this one has a
caterpillar train that works along with
the steering wheel and the support
roller
the device can pass through various
surfaces and overcome the small
obstacles the main parts of the tank has
a moveable mechanism which allows you to
direct the gun in different directions
while the turning angle is 180 degrees
hydrofoil boat this homemade boat was
designed by a craftsman named Hank
Anton EADS
the invention was tested for the first
time in the summer of 2012 the body of
the vehicle is made mainly of plywood
the boat moves along the water using
supports made of the same material only
of a smaller thickness
the boats together with the installed
engine weighs about 660 pounds and can
support a weight of up to 220 pounds the
engine has a small power of five
horsepower making the average working
speed of the boat equal to six miles per
hour
and the maximum 12 miles per hour
inventions by Michael Finney the
inventor named Michael Finney is famous
on the internet for his various
self-made works mostly made of metal
thus his collection includes an iron
helmet sculptures in the form of roses
hearts and fish as well as Street stoves
that have absolutely incredible shapes
here for example this furnace looks like
a spare part of a spacecraft
unfortunately at the moment we managed
to see only a photo of this invention
but soon we hope to see this unit in
action or on video
guys it's time to recharge your brain
visit the channel brain time there
you'll find a lot of interesting and
useful facts lots of positive energy and
tons of useful information subscribe
right now we promise it's going to be
