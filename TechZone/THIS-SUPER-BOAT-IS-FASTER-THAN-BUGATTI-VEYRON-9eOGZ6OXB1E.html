type of catamaran stands out for its
unusual appearance the yacht was built
at the German shipyard kinnear imp and
the person behind the idea was Raphael
Damiano from Switzerland as a source of
energy the turin or planet so leaves his
sunlight transforming it with solar
cells installed on the surface of the
boat which produce up to 93 kilowatts of
energy in order to provide the engines
with the needed 120 kilowatts the turin
or uses 537 square meters of solar cells
which charged the lithium-ion batteries
with the total weight of 8.5 tons the
vessel is 31 meters long 51 meters wide
and 7.5 meters tall it can easily carry
50 passengers and the maximum speed that
can develop is 25 pounds per hour
look her 350 one of the main features of
this boat is that it's equipped with the
transparent glass bottom the vessel has
enough space for 30 passengers the
looker 350 is equipped with a 370
horsepower diesel engine the yas is ten
and a half meters long and it weighs
four tons typically ships that have a
glass-bottom operate at low speeds since
most of the time during travel is spent
on inspection of the underwater world
but the looker 350 combines the latest
advanced technologies an exclusive
design and special underwater wings that
allow the yacht to reach a top speed of
75 kilometers per hour in addition this
model has a very large spheroidal window
of 2 by 3 meters
jet capsule it's a lien designers
pierpaolo Lazzarini and lucas solar
created a mini yacht for short sea walks
the jet capsule at seven point three
meters long but thanks to a
disproportionate width of three and a
half meters the panoramic cabin has
enough space for seven people
the ship has a futuristic appearance and
it resembles a spaceship which makes it
even more unique the jet capsule has a
spacious interior and it's worth noting
that the yacht is equipped with climate
control comfortable seats and large
glass windows for comfortable viewing
that night the jet capsule stands out
from other vessels thanks to it bright
neon lights in addition the vessel is
equipped with a Yanmar engine with a
capacity of 325 horsepower which allows
it to reach speeds of up to 56 km/h ymv
Proteus this experimental yacht
developed by the company marine Advanced
Research is known as spider and it looks
like one as well
the ymv Proteus as a catamaran but
unlike other similar ships its deck
superstructure is connected with the
floats through a damping system instead
of being rigid this significantly
reduces the movements of the cabin when
driving on large waves as well as fuel
consumption during the voyage it's
noteworthy that the decks superstructure
has its own engines it can descend
disconnect from the floats and even
become a regular closed boat
the ship is 29 metres long 15 metres
wide and the cabin can reach a height of
six point one meters the maximum speed
that one v Proteus can develop is 56
km/h and the yachts lifting capacity is
two tonnes
w foil 18 albatross this vessel
developed by Tomasz or is a hydroplane
on hydrofoils
the w foil 18 albatross can develop a
speed of 92 km/h the developers plan to
release a new modified version of the
vessel which will develop a speed of up
to 200 km/h the hydroplane is equipped
with a Rotax 912 engine with a capacity
of 75 kilowatts which rotates the
propeller the W foil 80 in albatross has
two power sources a removable aircraft
engine and a must with a sail the hole
was created on the basis of an airframe
which was covered with boards made of
ship pine the boat is equipped with
underwater wings made of carbon fiber
capable of withstanding long heavy loads
Thunder child safe-haven Marine has
launched the xsv 17 boat also known as
the Thunder child developed specially
for naval forces police border guards
and other special services whose
employees must navigate and work on the
water in all weathers this model cannot
be overturned which is basically its
main feature the Thunder child is
equipped with two caterpillars sea 12.9
power units each with a 1,000 horsepower
engine this allows the boat to reach a
top speed of a hundred kilometers per
hour and to keep the cruising speed at
83 kilometers per hour it's worth noting
the v-shaped bottom which allows you to
reduce the resistance of water when
driving at high speeds another design
feature is the hydraulically controlled
fins in the nose that allows you to
reduce the depth of the nose plunging
when leaving the wave
iguana commuter the French company
iguana yachts presented a 9.2 Me's along
in 3 point 1 meter wide boat the feature
that makes the iguana commuter unique is
the fact that it can independently get
out of the water and use a caterpillar
track and move on land at the speed of 7
km/h on the water the ship uses twin
overhead engines to move around the
basic capacity of the motor is 350
horsepower and the maximum power is 400
horsepower the maximum speed of the
iguana commuter on water is 78
kilometers per hour the boat can travel
less than 185 kilometers using standard
fuel one interesting detail which
distinguishes the ship from its
analogues is its sliding roof equipped
with an electric drive when closed it
reliably protects passengers from the
bad weather another key feature of the
iguana commuter is an electronically
controlled anchor that automatically
measures the depth and can be controlled
using a touchscreen
nor tech 5200 this motor yacht developed
by Nortec stands out not only for his
bright appearance but also for its
excellent technical characteristics the
vessel can easily accommodate 10
passengers and is worth noting that the
company produces these yachts on a by
order basis adapting the Nortec 5200 to
the desired set of characteristics and
additions of the future owner so for
example depending on the engine the
speed of the boat can vary the fastest
speed this model can develop is about
240 km/h spirit of Australia - the
creator of this vessel is Ken Warby he
modified the first model of the spirit
of Australia which in 1978 was the
world's fastest boat on water the
developer equipped the with
powerful rolls-royce Orpheus 803 X
engines taken from the Fiat Gina g91 jet
fighter which allowed the spirit of
Australia to to reach a speed of 500
kilometers per hour
surprisingly thanks to its features the
boat can outrun even one of the fastest
supercars in the world the bugatti
veyron in just seven seconds Kanwar beef
it can travel one kilometer Glastron
Carlson's CT 15 this is a modified boat
created specifically to race the
Glastron carlson is equipped with a
powerful mercury 1250 engine
to make it work several exhaust pipes
right it to the boat the modified
version of the CC 15 is better than all
of its analogues first of all it can

105 km/h also the Glastron carlson CT 15
is really comfortable thanks to an
advanced shock-absorbing system</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
