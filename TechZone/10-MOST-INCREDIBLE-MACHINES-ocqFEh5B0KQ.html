the soil is moved forward and mounted on
a long boom the rests on two wheels it
is noteworthy that they are also mobile
elements and are controlled by their own
mechanisms blades located in the shape
of the letter V can be folded and moved
apart if necessary depending on the
width of the roadway the maximum depth
to which the teeth can drop capturing
the unevenness of the soil as 10
centimeters after the place is freed
from excess land and holes five special
rollers located behind the driver are
able to align and tie to the road for
later operation Fendt 930 3 s for the
maximum speed that this small
all-wheel-drive tractor can develop is
37 miles an hour at the same time the
power of its engine is 333 horsepower

it with products such as sawdust or
small wood dust also the tractor is
equipped with a special system that
determines the load thanks to which the
device will not fail Jews who
accidentally exceeding the norms the
creators did not ignore the role of the
operator as well in a comfortable cabin
designed for one person and equipped
with large windows made of durable glass
they installed not only a soft chair and
an on-board computer but also an air
conditioner from
comfortable work and long periods Crona
big ex 580 this compact agricultural
machine designed for mowing grass and
high stemmed crops such as corn and
sunflowers is equipped with six rolls
which ensure the reliability and quality
of grinding the universal grinding
barrels depending on the model can
contain 28 36 or 40 strong knives
capable of processing stems of any
thickness and density the working
distance can be regulated and exceed the
length of the machine itself by several
times this function is indispensable
during large-scale agricultural work in
vast areas the power of the combine is
engine is 430 kilowatts the total weight
exceeds 14 tons and the maximum speed is
25 miles per hour it is noteworthy that
it is self-propelled that is it leaves
without the help of a tractor thanks to
the independent suspension of the wheels
on the rear axle the vehicle has a high
maneuverability the cabin of this
machine can accommodate several people
in addition to the operator that is
equipped with air conditioning as well
as large windows that provide good
visibility throughout the working
process Erickson s 64 air crane
originally this heavy transport
helicopter was used by the US Army to
evacuate other damaged helicopters
during the Vietnam War
after that private companies purchased
several decommissioned vehicles and
today they used to transport heavy loads
and extinguish forest fires for example
in the firefighting version the
helicopter is equipped with a water tank
of 10,000 liters while in other cases it
can be used as an autonomous flying
crane the crew of this car on average
consists of three people and its maximum
payload can be more than nine tons the
cargo helicopter can reach speeds of up
to 150 miles an hour and gain maximum
altitude in more than five seconds

vehicle designed for lumber logging
operations this new kind of forwarders
can handle loads of up to 25 tons in the
most difficult conditions the model
perfectly copes with work even on steep
slopes and can deliver the product in
long distances a unique transmission
allows the vehicle to reach a speed of
4.5 miles per hour while it can safely
carry a cargo weighing several tons an
innovative system with a low wide cone
combination with a hook shaped crane
increases reliability and shortens the
loading and unloading types of the
product by tilting forward and
decreasing the height of the grate the
low wide Connick reduces the chance of
contact with the crane and provides
maximum lifting capacity without the

well off-road and can carry up to four
rolls of pipes or cables at the same
time in front of the machine there is a
v-shaped tool that cuts the ground and
simultaneously stacks the pipe between
the cut layers and then again puts the
soil in place this technology is called
trenchless since it does not leave the
soil damaged and doesn't require digging
for a long time it is noteworthy that
the whole process of work doesn't stop
during the movements of the device
through the field this system of
operation greatly facilitates the
process of drainage works and reduces
the number of people involved to use the
VanDam drainage only two will be needed
