building loses its aesthetic appearance
a layer of moss starts to cover the
surface mold fungus and bird waste spots
appear traditionally roof cleaning is a
dirty and quite dangerous task
fortunately today there are washing
machines on the market such as the
Aquajet
this compact device efficiently removes
even the most persistent dirt at the
same time manual work as well as the
risk of falling off the roof are
minimized this model was produced by a
German company it is recommended to use
aqua jet to clean concrete ceramic
asbestos cement and steel roofs
interestingly the effect is visible as
soon as the device passes over the
surface the secret to efficiency is that
the device is capable of producing a
very high pressure it creates a powerful
jet of water that's delivered through
the nozzles depending on the model and
the power setting the water hits the
surface with a pressure of 270 to 500
bar the roof looks perfectly clean after
the work is completed not only as the
moss and dirt removed but also other
microorganisms during the process itself
the operator is on the roof however he
doesn't move much which is certainly
safer compared to conventional cleaning
leisure wash 360 today's smart devices
and all kinds of robots are replacing
humans at work such equipment is used in
all spheres of life for example the less
you wash 360 is an automatic washing
machine that can completely replace
manual car washers this equipment is
designed and assembled in such a way as
to completely eliminate the need for
personnel you can use the terminal to
pay for the wash first the owner chooses
the preferred washing mode after that
the equipment is ready for operation the
manipulator equipped with the nozzles
rotates 360 degrees so the car is
cleaned from all sides pay attention to
the superiority of the robot machine
over a person the movements of the arm
are programmed they are always the same
and optimal thus after washing there are
no dirty places left on the surface the
latter wash 360 will clean the sides and
the bottom they can apply foam emulsion
a layer of wax and then drive the
vehicle there's even a special rinse
function that leaves no trace below she
wash 360 is great not only for car
owners but also for carwash owners the
procedure is carried out five times
faster compared to manual washing at the
same time it consumes 60% less water and
electricity
the steam washer Duprey perhaps the
easiest and most effective way to get
rid of dirt in the house is by spraying
water and steam under high pressure this
professional cleaning equipment from the
Canadian company Duprey once again
confirms it the manufacturer offers six
different models their price varies from
fifteen hundred and fifty to five
thousand dollars compact portable models
like one are designed for home use the
device is powerful enough to process the
surface with steam which a temperature
of a hundred and fifty degrees Celsius
the 1.15 liter water tank lasts for 50
minutes of continuous operation the
Tosca model generates steam at a
temperature of 160 degrees and can be
operated for up to 90 minutes finally
the most powerful and large equipment is
designed for commercial use the steams
temperature reaches 175 degrees Celsius
the video shows how different car and
motorcycle surfaces are cleaned with
this steam cleaner it's also possible to
use this equipment to clean tiles floors
sanitary ware and furniture
Eco cleaning this is a new revolutionary
air conditioning cleaning system it was
developed by the Australian company
plumb heating and cooling using a
polluted air conditioner leads the
aggravation of allergies and asthma
that's why it's very important to clean
the AC on time the user washes the
filters and removable parts of the
structure in the open it uses a special
system that sprays water and an
antibacterial cleaning solution on the
surface removable parts are washed
indoors for this purpose the air
conditioner is wrapped in a drainage
case first these surface is treated with
chemicals that corrode dirt fungi and
even oil then all internal air
conditioning systems are rinsed the
professional equipment allows to achieve
excellent results after cleaning the air
conditioner works more economically
because an unclean device uses more
energy to let the air through
high pressure washer Northstar the
equipment you see on the screen works in
the same way as the roof washer that we
already showed you today the difference
is that the device from the American
company Northstar is more versatile this
means that it can be used on virtually
any surface dirt is removed from the
surface thanks to the high-pressure hot
water jet the minimum pressure of this
device is a hundred and seventy one bath
the maximum 275 bath
this means that between 11 and 30 litres
of water are consumed per minute for
greater efficiency special detergents
are added to the water the pressure
generated by the washer is so strong
that it can remove organic and chemical
stains dirt breaks and dissolves
instantly at the same time the user
doesn't have to come into contact with
water dirt or chemicals the design
guarantees that the person will be less
tired after work too the manufacturer
recommends cleaning access roads patios
swimming pools and parking lots
using this washer the device can also
clean floors in production facilities
the Contra sc2 the cost of this device
is $200
it can kill up to 99.9% of bacteria it
is a compact steam cleaner designed
primarily for home use the surface is
treated with a hot but delicate steam
Jets the jet pressure is only 3.2 bar so
even fragile surfaces won't be damaged
remarkably the Karcher s seats do clean
surfaces in an environmentally friendly
way water consumption is extremely
economical a full tank is enough to
clean 75 square meters detergents and
chemicals are not used for surface
decontamination
Dyson 360 I today we've already talked
about the fact that robots are gradually
replacing humans freeing them from many
tedious tasks this robot vacuum cleaner
from the British company Dyson frees you
from the need to think about the
cleanliness of the floor its main
advantages are its powerful suction
power compactness and noiselessness the
robot moves around the room using
infrared sensors and a 360-degree camera
it's able to capture the features of the
apartments this means that the device
does not drive randomly through the
rooms it remembers them and uses this
knowledge to work the camera also allows
the robot to understand where it has
already been which places are cleaned
and which still need to be vacuumed
vacuum cleaners are usually equipped
with additional side brushes the wheels
are for travel Dyson experts decided to
change this design the 360 eye is
equipped with a basic nylon hydrocarbon
brush it moves at the expense of mini
casa pillars they make it easier for the
robot to overcome obstacles it's price
is about a thousand dollars
