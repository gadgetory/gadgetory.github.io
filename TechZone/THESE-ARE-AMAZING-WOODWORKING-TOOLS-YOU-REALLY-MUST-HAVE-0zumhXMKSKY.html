high-quality wood is growing every year
according to recent studies about 70% of
the wood used to make veneer furniture
is produced on special plantations
traditionally caring for trees on such
science involves huge financial costs
people after harvest the branches by
hand spending a lot of time and effort
the Advil leg no device of German
manufacture can be called revolutionary
because it saves time effort and money
the outer leg now is an equipment for
the mechanical tree pruning which allows
to obtain wood of high quality the use
of traditional pruning methods means
that for a maximum of six trees per hour
will be processed adver leg now allows
you to get rid of the branches of 40 or
50 trees per hour with the help of the
equipment the trees can be cut even at
great height the limits of the working
range is 12 to 15 metres a definite
advantage is the fact that Advil oak no
not only fulfils its tasks quickly it is
also easy and quick to attach to a tree
trunk and to take off
the Porter mill p.m. 14 wood production
is a simple but slow process the bark is
cut from the four sides of the storm
tree trunk to obtain a perfectly flat
wood with a square or rectangular cut at
home the procedure can be performed with
an electric saw however in such a case
you have to be very precise the porter
mill PM 14 is a device that greatly
simplifies and accelerates the
processing of the trunks
in fact the port MLP m14 is a device
that moves the saw along the track
allowing for a perfectly flat cutting
edge with minimal effort preparation for
work takes less than seven minutes it
should be noted that the sawmill can be
equipped with an oil tank so that's even
under intense work the saw remains cold
and oil the cutting height is adjustable
ie with the help of this equipment is
possible to produce wood and boards of
different thicknesses another advantage
is its low weight and compact dimensions
portal LP m14 fits easily even in the
trunk of a car
Ravel WRC 12:50 AC the equipment you see
on the screen is used for industrial
wood processing this is a versatile
high-performance horizontal bandsaw it
provides fast and accurate cutting
allowing word to be handled quickly
a notable feature is the ability to
monitor cutting processes using the
built-in video camera it's definitely
worth paying attention to the solid and
robust construction of the chassis
equipped with rolls and Turner's that
allow it to turn even large heavy logs
quickly and easily moving them sideways
backwards and forwards
the rollers had a retractable design so
that the word can be placed in the
optimum position it can be lifted from
either end as well therefore is possible
to process a tree quickly within the
accuracy of one millimeter the place
where the operator sits is in the
immediate vicinity of the soil so the
work has always carried out under the
control of the person
8000 series firewood processor the
Canadian company bells machining
produces a variety of equipment designed
to work with tree trunks the most
powerful machine in the model range is
the 8000 series
it's a machine created specifically to
work with large trees it's equipped with
a 152 centimeters circular saw and an 18
centimeter splitter cylinder the engine
power is 127 horsepower
the outstanding operating
characteristics allow working with trees
with a maximum diameter of 67
centimeters the length of the trunk at
the same time can reach 90 meters the
work is carried out in several stages
first using a circular saw or the
longitudinal cut for the log the
resulting piece is then divided into
several small pieces that are sent along
the conveyor belt to the storage sites
removing sawdust shavings and other
debris on the way posh smart cuts 700
here we have a fully automated equipment
for the production of firewood the
Austrian company posh is dedicated to
the production of these machines it has
three main advantages the first is their
efficiency thanks to a maximum cutting
diameter of 20 centimeters
the second is the compactness as the
weight of the equipment doesn't exceed
920 kilograms and the third advantage is
its speed the smart cut 700 allows you
to process four to eight cubic meters of
wood per hour the intelligent device
makes the work of a single person
efficient convenient and most
importantly safe the persons contact
with a working sore is minimized the
position of the saw blade is adjustable
so the size of the wood obtained after
processing varies you can also set the
saw angle to obtain firewood of
different shapes
Rex log saw the usefulness of equipment
today is measured by the ease and speed
of work the Rex log saw soaring device
is very useful in that sense after all
it allows a single person to perform
operations for which using a
conventional chainsaw three so five
people would be needed surprisingly the
maximum diameter of the trunk can be one
point one meters the Rex log saw is
designed to cut logs along the length to
create firewood with the resulting
blocks
a 122 centimeter train still powered by
50 horsepower Deutz diesel engine is
used for the work with the help of a
loader the wood is loaded onto a special
platform from there it's sent to the
ramp that moves them towards the saw it
should be noted that the blocks are the
same size with a perfectly flat cut the
finished blocks that were drawn on a
conveyor belt removing residual sawdust
during transportation
hey stop being lazy it's time to use
that brain eels welcome to brain time
incredible facts from the past the
present and even the future the power of
nature and wild animals amazing facts
and unsolved mysteries you'll find all
