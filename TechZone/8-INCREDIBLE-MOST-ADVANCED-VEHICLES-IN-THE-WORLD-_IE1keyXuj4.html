on the screen was developed in the NASA
Space Center and it took about five
months to make it the Mars rover has a
futuristic look it's eight and a half
meters long three point four meters tall
and four meters wide
this unusual vehicle was designed to
move people around the surface of Mars
but it won't be able to ever fulfill
this mission the materials used work
composites in aluminium which makes the
SUV relatively lightweight 2.7 tonnes
overall the maximum speed of movement is
110 kilometers per hour
however the creator state that on Mars
the working speed would be 25 kilometers
per hour NASA's Mars rover has
incredible maneuverability thanks to its
six wheels with a diameter of a hundred
and twenty-seven centimeters in addition
the wheels have a unique shape to more
effectively overcome obstacles instead
of tires the aluminium discs are covered
by rubber strips allowing them to be
quickly cleaned of sand
Yamaha motor ride in the fall of 2017
experts from the Japanese company Yamaha
showed a conceptual smart electric
motorbike called the motor roid the
designers used original stylistic
solutions during the design giving the
model a very futuristic appearance by
using electricity as fuel the motor is
friendly to the environment the chromed
cylinders located on the sides the form
not only an aesthetic function they're
also stylized storage batteries that
store the power reserve it's no accident
that we call this electric bike smart
the fact is that the vehicle can
interact with the driver thanks to the
built-in artificial intelligence the
bike can recognize faces and body
movements and move autonomously the main
advantage is the automatic balance
control system thanks to it for example
if the motorcycle is pushed it
automatically returns to its original
position
Renault float in 2017 another futuristic
car this time designed by Renault was
introduced on the outside this model
doesn't look much like a vehicle it's
more like a flying or a floating bubble
it's noteworthy that this car was
designed by the most ordinary student
the company Renault held a competition
for the best design of the car of the
future and the Renault float was the
winner instead of liquid fuel the car
uses electricity to travel around it
floats in the air using the same
technology that Elon Musk uses for his
ultra high-speed trains thanks to this
technology the float will be able to
smoothly move in any direction without
turning or bending the vehicles equipped
with a bucket seats and sliding doors
there are several versions of this car
in the first model inside the bubble
there is space for only one person other
versions are equipped with passenger
seats as well as additional seats
Terrafugia tf-x modern vehicle
manufacturers surprises every day with
their new technological innovations the
Terrafugia x' t FX is a real flying car

hopefully the tariff ugh CFX will be out
on the market in the next 8 to 12 years
the estimated price will be about three
hundred thousand dollars
sure fly here we have one of the most
ambitious projects of the company
workhorse engaged in the development of
electric vehicles sure fly is a flying
taxi which moves using a hybrid power
plant
it's equipped with a gasoline generator
with a capacity of 200 horsepower
according to the creators this passenger
drone can travel 112 kilometers and
raise a load of 180 kilograms at the
moment the vehicle is still under
development
the first test flight was conducted in
the spring of 2018 and at the end the
drone reached a height of only half a
meter nevertheless this is an important
step to continue the working process it
is noteworthy that the passenger drone
is equipped with a lithium battery if
the engine fails the battery will last
for five minutes usually this time is
enough to safely learn the vehicle and
avoid falling nevertheless the main
feature of the drone is the control
system once the pilot sets the direction
the vehicle decides the quickest and
safest way to reach the destination
sure a TV here we have a car with a
capacity of 40 4.3 horsepower

designed to overcome 35 degrees steps
the sealed housing doesn't let water
into the cabin each wheel has a volume
of 800 liters and is connected to the
pumping system it has a relatively small
weight and small dimensions to move even
in confined spaces
it shows incredible stamina and it's
able to move even when two wheels out of
four fail it is noteworthy that a car is

amphibian on caterpillar tracks is 26
meters it's 10 metres tall and the speed
of movement on water is 37 km/h
supposedly the Machine withstands a
standard load of a hundred and fifty
tons but in a state of overload is able
to move with a load of up to 190 tonnes
the power reserve is 370 kilometers
thus the UHA sea is able to completely
replace a landing craft since it has
higher technical characteristics the
undoubted advantage is the ability of
the vehicle to enter the beach as well
as overcoming obstacles on land for
example
aunty Canon dams up to 3 metres tall in
addition this machine has a low
maintenance cost which also is an
advantage
