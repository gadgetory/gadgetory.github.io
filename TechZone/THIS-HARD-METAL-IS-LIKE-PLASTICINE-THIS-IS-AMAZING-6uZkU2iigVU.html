titanium is used in a wide variety of
industries its strength is roughly the
same as that of conventional steel
however it weighs 45% less if you
compare titanium with aluminium the
former is 60% heavier and about 50%
stronger in the chemical industry it's
used to manufacture chemical reactors
pipelines pumps and reinforcements in
the military industry it's used to
manufacture flak jackets fire partitions
and submarine hulls titanium is also in
demand in the automotive agricultural
and food industries it's used to make
sports goods jewelry and mobile phone
parts like any other metal before
titanium it's ready for production it is
processed to forge titanium first it is
kept at a temperature of 650 to 700
degrees Celsius it's heated up to a
temperature of 900 to 1600 degrees just
before the forging process the pure of
the titanium the lower the temperature
of its forging the heated piece is
pressed to destroy the coarse grain
structure and get rid of voids
interestingly the hammer is also heated
before forging to about 200 to 220
degrees Celsius this is necessary to
keep the metal warm and reduce the
changes in temperature
the temperature range of iron forging
varies from 800 to 1200 and 50 degrees
Celsius factories and production
facilities use incredibly powerful
equipment to process this metal usually
because the pieces weigh dozens of tons
the video shows the forging of a 35-ton
metal block to forge this giant piece of
metal workers use a piece of equipment
with a force of 14 mega Newtons to move
the metal through the production floor a
special manipulator is used the maximum
capacity of this particular piece of
equipment is 50 tons
special steam hammers are used to
process smaller and lighter work pieces
interestingly it's one of the oldest
pieces of forging equipment it's been
used since the early nineteen forties a
steam hammer is a hybrid between a
piston and a steam machine previously
when a blacksmith turn the handle the
steam that came out of the boiler forced
the firing pin upwards when the
blacksmith turned the handle in the
other direction the steam supply stopped
the falling piece under the influence of
its own weight
hits the workpiece for the force
impossible to achieve with the hammer of
course the appearance that the equipment
has changed a lot since then but the
principle of operation has remained the
same you have to use nine steam hammers
to process a workpiece weighing up to
twenty-five hundred kilograms their
weight varies from three hundred to six
thousand kilograms in spite of the fire
that modern technologies have gone far
ahead
manual forging is used for especially
small pieces
engineers around the world continued to
develop equipment that will enable them
to produce high-quality metal parts in a
shorter time the video shows a forging
press produced by the Japanese company
Mitsubishi it's a system of machines
that perform forging and auxilary
operations such as transporting the
workpiece from the warehouse to the
presses and rolls educating and so on
first the workpiece is placed in the
soaking pit where it's heated evenly a
special conveyor belt then delivers the
hot metal to the press the mentioned
equipment creates a pressure of 3,000
tons per square metre
note how the metal decreases in size
under the influence of such a huge force
this is how the metal is pressed filling
the core blows and voids that were
inside during the cobbling process
scaled forms on the metal surface you
can see how it crumbles it's noteworthy
that the cross-sectional ratio of the
finished product in relation to the
ratio of the original piece is 6 to 10
the ratio changes to a three to four
ratio if a particularly dense casting is
performed
forging is a method of metal pressing
that can be done in two different ways
you can see one of them on the screen
right now it's called stamping the
workpiece heated to the forging
temperature is shaped with a special
metalworking machine tool known as a
stamping press the flow of metal is
limited to the surface of the cavities
and protrusions produced by the die this
method is used when it's necessary to
obtain a large number of pieces of
complex shapes
what you see on the screen is the method
of open forging which is essentially the
opposite of stamping here metal is not
placed in a special form nor enclosed
from the sides
while the workpiece is shaped it's not
enclosed in space at all it can be but
only from one side
open forging in turn can be performed
manually or automatically the first one
as the name suggests is done by hand by
specially trained specialists this
method is used when it's necessary to
perform a single production of small
forgings or repair work the foreman uses
hand hammers sledge hammers chisels and
other tools the automatic method is
perfect to make large forgings all the
videos that we've shown you today
including the one that's been shown
right now are examples of automatic
forging as you already know it's carried
out with the help of hydraulic presses
of more than 15 tons of power
here we show the creation of complex
forgings without the use of manual tools
first the blank is squeezed until it
becomes thin and white then an iron
hollow rod is lowered into the middle
forming a hole then the final cobbling
is done during which the workpiece is
shaped as needed for production it's
noteworthy that during this process cold
water is continuously circulating inside
the rod this measure is necessary to
ensure that the rod is not heated and
compressed along with the workpiece in
order to expand the size of the
resulting piece the metal is subjected
to a special semi cylindrical roller
when the piece is ready the special
pliers move it first to the conveyor
belt and then to the storage room along
with the rest of the finished products
working at plants involved in metal
processing is extremely dangerous work
pieces are heated to extremely high
temperatures so the more machines that
are involved the better fortunately
today most of the modern factories
minimize the work of people only
occasionally people have to be near the
hot metal all the main work is done by
the operators from afar surprisingly a
few decades ago metal processing on such
a scale was simply impossible the metal
piece you see on the screen weighs at
least a hundred and twenty tons and of
course only the most technologically
advanced and powerful equipment can move
and processes
