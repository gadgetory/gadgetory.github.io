screen is the largest dump truck in the
world the ballast 75710 is capable of
lifting loads up to four hundred and
fifty tons and its own weight is three
hundred and fifty tons compared to a
height of eight point one seven meters
and a length of twenty point six meters
these giants are produced by the
belarusian automobile factory
surprisingly this truck is capable of
lifting extra weight exceeding its own
limits
in 2014 the Bellas 75710 was placed in
the Guinness Book of Records as it was
able to carry a load of five hundred and
3.5 tonnes in the tests the truck is
equipped with two diesel engines with a
capacity of 2300 in 30 horsepower it
also has a hydropneumatic suspension and
the diameter of the shock absorbers is
naught point one seven meters for this
incredible dimensions the Bell are 75
710 develops an acceptable speed for the
road
67 km/h fuel consumption is 1,300 liters
per 100 kilometers to ensure the ability
to travel the manufacturer had to equip
the vehicle with two fuel tanks with a
capacity of 2,800 liters
piling reg here we have a special
purpose vehicle that's used during heavy
pile at long range as a base usually
workers use crawler cranes or cable
hydraulic excavators piling works are
performed using attachments such as a
hydraulic hammer the developing of these
models is carried out by the leading
companies in the production of special
equipment Leap air and power for example
the mass of the assembled pile driving
installation LRH 600 from Leap air can
reach 330 tons but only 22 tons other
way to the hydraulic hammer the
approximate frequency of strokes is 30
to 80 per minute the weight of the
impactor element varies and depends on
the hydraulic hammer model the optimum
number for performing complex works is
15 tonnes hammers are manufactured in
compact sizes to simplify transportation
installation and maintenance procedures
some models have soundproofing of the
impactor element
Eppie Rockhead loader HR here is heavy
equipment designed for underground
excavation work one of such machines is
The Hague loader in total the
manufacturer Swedish company epi rock
produced three models of this extreme
loader the vehicle was designed to work
in narrow confined spaces and the
emphasis is on performance and economy
given that under the ground a large
amount of energy is spent on ventilation
the hair gloater HR has a hybrid power
supply that reduces the need for
ventilation the largest of the three
models the hair glowed a 10 HR and it's
more advanced version the 10 HR they are
capable of loading up to five cubic
meters of material per minute it's
relatively compact dimensions allow it
to move in tunnels measuring 14 cubic
meters and more the smallest model of
the series The Hague loader 7 HR loads
up to 3.5 cubic meters of material per
minute and can operate freely in tunnels
measuring 8 cubic meters also there's
loader is equipped with a sprinkler
system to improve working conditions
SP 1200 vert Caen here we have an inset
slip form paver used in road
construction for laying concrete blocks
the SP 1200 version allows you to
significantly accelerate and simplify
the work it's range varies from 4 to 12
meters the main advantage of the model
is its wide working cycle
it's equipped with a finishing beam and
a road iron which allows you to achieve
a perfectly smooth coating without using
additional equipment the manufacturer
offers a really large number of
attachments which significantly expand
the functionality of the SP 1200 version
the thickness of the pavement varies
with the maximum of 450 millimeters the
operational weight of the machine goes
from 66 to 78
tons its performance depends on the
fullness of the water tank and the
airborne tool it's noteworthy that the
paver has a very powerful engine that
produces 305 horsepower and the fall
caterpillar tracks also guarantee
efficient work
li pair LH Li pair one of the largest
manufacturers of special-purpose
machinery in the world offers a series
of LH full turn crawlers for a wide
range of tasks the series consists of 19
machines all of them have different
dimensions and a design for various
tasks for example the LH 60 C industry
latronnik is used for handling round
wood and heavy scrap is also often used
to load ships the manufacturer offers
different versions of the model and the
machined fully meets the working needs
high performance is achieved mainly
thanks to the boom which rotates 360
degrees the power LH 60 C develops 258
horsepower and the working weight varies
from 52 to 62 tons
Cole Mart's he 10,000 FSCJ
the conventional caterpillar and wheeled
special equipment is not used for
railway construction in this case
special equipment is produced for
example the railway crane the coal Marty
10000 FSC G its distinctive feature is
the presence of a platform which allows
you to move along the railway track
leaning on the wheel axles the auto
coupling system allows workers to attach
the vehicle to a train and even use it
as a locomotive in this case the
caterpillar tracks make this crane
suitable for work on the ordinary roads
the maximum weight that this car can
carry on a railway is 12.1 tonnes
standing on the tracks the coal Marty
10,000 FSC GU lifts up to ten point nine
tons the crane is equipped with a 245
horsepower engine and the speed of
movements along the road is 3.2 to km/h
on the railway 19.3 1 kilometers per
hour
cats three six five CL one of the main
features of this excavator is the
ability to fill the cargo compartments
of the dump truck in three steps the 365
CL is developed by the famous American
company caterpillar this is a hydraulic
model weighing 72 tons which operates on
an industrial diesel engine Katzie 15
with a capacity of 440 horsepower
another notable feature is the
integrated air cooling system and an
improved technology for reducing harmful
emissions into the atmosphere the
manufacturer offers changeable buckets
of various sizes to perform the widest
range of tasks the working weight of the
machine depends on the serial number of
the specific excavator and varies within
the range of 67 to 70 3 tons
li pair lb forty four five ten the
rotary drilling rig that you see on the
screen is considered the most powerful
model in its series German Li per lb
forty four five ten can work in several
modes the most common and demanded is
the drilling Kelly bar in addition to
this drilling is also carried out by an
infinite screw and auger with complete
displacement of the soil
this model has a really great talk 510
and kilonewton meters but it has a
compact design a small dimensions
simplified transportation and reduce its
cost the model is equipped with a
hydraulic system and an easy to maintain
drilling drive thanks to this the plant
can operate in continuous mode showing a
high drilling speed the weight of the
elbe 44 510 in running order is a
hundred and fifty-five tons as an
advantage the manufacturer highlights
the innovative control system that
allows drilling operations using
different technologies the leaper lb 44
510 is designed specifically for heavy
construction work and its engine power
is 687 horsepower</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
