large number of hydropower plants around
the world has been of great benefit to
humanity today they produce about 85% of
the world's renewable energy however the
problem is that traditional ways of
turning water energy into electricity
are quite expensive and require the
construction of a large dam in addition
transporting energy from the dam to
urban areas is also quite expensive
specialists from the Belgian company
turbulent hydro have devised a simpler
more efficient and cost effective way of
obtaining electricity it is an
innovative vortex turbine that can be
installed close to any River in a place
where there is a slight natural change
in height it can also be installed in a
channel with running water the turbine
is installed in an opening on the side
of the water body once installed the
turbine will generate electricity 24
hours a day seven days a week by the way
this is another feature of the unique
system the operation doesn't depend on
the climate or the time of day as it
happens with solar or wind energy
the technology is based on the use of
the whirlpool which occurs naturally in
the turbine one of these facilities is
enough to supply electricity to 60
houses it should be noted that this
equipment is harmless to fish and other
inhabitants of the rivers the low
pressure inside the mechanism allows
them to swim through the system the
installation of the unit takes only one
week while the useful life of this
concrete pool is up to a hundred years
today there are a few such turbines in
the world zoo in Chile one in Belgium
and one in Indonesia the turbine you see
on the screen is located in a Chilean
city of dong Yi way swag BOTS robots
gradually penetrate all spheres of human
life
we're already used to the fact that they
help in factories of plants it's quite
possible that in the near future we'll
have to get used to their help in
agriculture too because there is already
a robot capable of coping with the work
of a farmer so far however it's just a
prototype called the swag BOTS the idea
belongs to the engineers of the
Australian Centre for field robotics at
the University of Sydney
it was first shown in 2016 when swag
BOTS became the world's first automatic
Shepherd the fact is that pastures for
cattle and sheep and Australia are often
in remotes in inaccessible areas swag
bot was used instead of a sheepdog and
the person in charge could control it
with a remote control to allow the robot
to move through difficult and rough
terrain each wheel had a separate Drive
the result was a maneuverable machine
capable of moving the herd from one
pasture to another helping livestock
overcome gullies and other obstacles in
2018 swag bot was upgraded and engineers
added computer vision to the robots
always so that it can cope with a large
number of tasks
for example the machine can now find
weeds in the field and spray them with
herbicides
surprisingly unlike other automated
systems designed to eliminate weeds swag
bot is not attached to any particular
location so it can work anywhere you
need
vortex bladeless turbines today we've
already talked about renewable energies
and we mentioned that hydroelectric
power stations are the most common
source of energy the second place in
this industry goes to wind energy ie the
conversion of kinetic energy from air
into electricity modern people are not
surprised anymore by wind turbines
installed almost everywhere in the world
but this doesn't mean that the wind
energy industry has nothing more to show
off here we have a very original wind
turbine with a unique and innovative
design its difference from all the
others is that it has no blades this
design was developed by specialists from
the Spanish company vortex bladeless the
blades are the most fragile parts of the
generator and they're breakage causes
the loss of functionality of the entire
installation in addition they can freeze
over which reduces the efficiency of the
operation
the vortex bladeless turbine looks like
a long inverted cone electricity is
generated by oscillation and the cone
generates swirls of air as it moves
thus the vibratory energy is converted
into electricity
however the vortex bladeless turbines
differ from traditional wind turbines
not only in their appearance the absence
of parts that are difficult and costly
to maintain makes them an economical
alternative in addition this generator
has a quick and simple installation
procedure compared to a conventional
wind turbine the procedure is 50%
cheaper too they can even be installed
in urban areas as they don't
inconvenience people
at Kolkata people started using water
jets as a cutting or demolition tool in
the 1930s since then
the equipment has been constantly
improved in every few years new machines
appear on the markets that take material
processing to a new level in this case
we want to show you the series of hydro
demolition robots at Kolkata
manufactured by the Swedish company aqua
jet systems a B these are three machines
that differ in size and therefore in
power the equipment is fitted with a
rubber casing in the working area which
provides better acoustic insulation and
protects the surrounding area from
splashes
the sides of the casing are detachable
so you can work in the corners between
the horizontal and vertical surfaces the
smallest robot model has a working
height of three meters the most powerful
model is suitable for all types of hydro
demolition both on horizontal and
vertical surfaces up to 10 metres tall
this equipment is designed for the
treatment of concrete in order to repair
bridges overpasses dams tunnels and
other similar structures
aircraft washing system in 2018 the
Norwegian company MSG production
introduced the world's first automatic
washing and antifreeze treatment system
for aircraft previously these tasks were
performed by people and it took four to
eight hours to clean an airplane despite
the fact that between 8 and 10 people
did the job since it's recommended to
watch the airplanes once or twice a
month it's not difficult to imagine that
all these numerous procedures were very
expensive systems like the one you see
on the screen should make the job easier
and reduce the cost all the elements of
the washing system can be carefully
adjusted so that with the help of the
system it's possible to clean any model
of aircraft water jets moving in
different directions gently but
effectively clean the surface of the
aircraft of dirt and bituminous mastic
the procedures takes much less time than
the traditional one carried out by
people in addition the system can be
used to clean the engine
the antifreeze treatment by the washing
system is also carried out in a much
shorter time than the manual treatment
hey stop being lazy it's time to use
that brain of yours
welcome to brain time incredible facts
from the past the present and even the
future the power of nature and wild
animals amazing facts and unsolved
