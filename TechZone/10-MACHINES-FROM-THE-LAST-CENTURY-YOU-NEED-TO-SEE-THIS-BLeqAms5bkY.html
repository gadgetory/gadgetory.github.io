unusual vehicle came to William Albee
when he was watching the Eskimos
transporting the boat over land laying
sealskin
filled with air under the bottom having
adapted the idea for modern materials
Albee produced special low-pressure
tires made of cloth and rubber which
allowed to overcome any obstacles the
truck equipped with such wheels was
quite maneuverable and fast its speed
reached 75 km/h in addition it could
easily move on unstable surfaces such as
sand snow or swamp and thanks to wide
low-pressure wheels the vehicle didn't
sink Antarctic snow cruiser this
all-terrain vehicle was created by the
Illinois Institute of Technology in 1939
for Richard Birds expedition to
Antarctica it was designed by Thomas
Poulter to improve the maneuverability
in the Antarctic landscapes the
designers used two solutions they put
for a hundred and twenty inch wheels and
equipped the body in a car with a ski
like bottom the snowmobile was able to
pass cracks of up to four and a half
meters wide like skis pushing with the
wheels
in the same way it was supposed to
overcome granular ice the total length
of the cruise it was 17 meters and it
weighed 34 tons however once in
Antarctica the all-terrain vehicle
wasn't able to move as its wheels sank
into the snow despite all attempts by
members of the expedition to correct the
situation the car was decided to be
abandoned and today the location of the
cruiser is unknown
err roll another vehicle created by the
principle of bill alby's rola gong was
created in 1956 by an inventor named
Richard Marsh the main advantage of this
vehicle was good cross-country ability
on Xtreme off road including swamps dirt
sand arable land thanks to the original
design of the chassis the specific
pressure on the ground was low hence the
effect at the same time the Chrysler v8
engine located behind the cab provided
the 9 ton amphibia with a stable speed
of about 50 km/h the air roll proto site
was purchased by the US Navy improved
and subsequently used successfully mil
v-12 the heaviest load lifting
helicopter ever built in the world was
created in the USSR and first flew in
1968 the helicopter was supposed to
transport various types of military
equipment with a mass of up to 25 tons
including the latest ballistic missiles
of strategic purpose at the time the
project of the air giant was a full
motor vehicle where the two row two
transverse scheme at the ends of each
wing panel there was a nacelle with two
d25 VF gas turbines with a capacity of
six and a half thousand horsepower each
the fuselage of the v12 was made in the
form of a giant semi-monocoque its front
part was occupied by a two-story crew
cabin in the tail part of the fuselage
there was a power ladder with side flaps
despite the fact that the helicopter
managed to lift a forty four thousand
two hundred and five kilogram cargo to a
heights of 2255 meters setting a world
record for the load capacity for
helicopters the program was found
ineffective and the development of the
male v12 stopped
big Brutus this special vehicle known as
big Brutus is a huge electric shovel and
one of the largest machines of its kind
big Brutus was developed for the
extraction of coal from thin seams and
it's depth varies from 6 to 21 meters
when working at maximum speed the
excavator is able to open a surface area
of 260 hectares in a year the height of
big Brutus is 49 meters and the bucket
has a capacity of 69 cubic meters or 150
tons the machine was commissioned in May
1963 during its operation the excavators
have produced about 9 million tons of
coal and despite the fact that its
design was calculated for 25 years of
operation big Brutus was used for only
11 years in April 1974 the excavates was
found economically inefficient and the
work was stopped paralyzed as the main
exhibit of the mining Museum in West
Mineral Kansas lz-129 Hindenburg the
German passenger airship the Hindenburg
was built in 1936 and became the largest
airship ever created
he was 245 metres long and his volume
reached 200,000 cubic meters of gas the
Zeppelin was equipped with four diesel
engines with an operating capacity of
about 800 or 900 horsepower and a
maximum capacity of 1,200 horsepower
each the Hindenburg was able to lift up
to a hundred tons of payload and 50
passengers while speeding up to 135 km/h
the airship was one of the popular ways
of crossing the Atlantic the Hindenburg
did its last flight in May 1937 a fire
began during the landing as a result of
which the airship was completely burned
at 34 seconds
snow freighter this car developed by
Letourneau technologies was actually an
84 meter train with a locomotive cab and
5 trailer cars each trailer could carry
25 tons of supplies with a total load
capacity of 150 tons the 24 wheeled car
was set up by a crew of 4 people it
didn't need roads or railways across the
Alaska Tundra and also easily crossed
rivers up to one and a half metres deep
the snow freighter was an operation in
1955 until there was a fire in the
engine compartment after which the use
of this off-road vehicle was
discontinued RMS Lusitania the British
ocean liner la Lusitania known primarily
for its luxurious rooms and high speed
capabilities cruised across the Atlantic
between the US and Great Britain its
displacement was about 31 thousand tons
length about 240 meters for comparison
the length of the famous Titanic was 268
meters at that time the Lusitania was
one of the largest ships in the world is
worth noting that in August 1909 the
liner was able to cross the North
Atlantic at a speed of 40 7.87 km/h the
Lusitania was in operation for almost
eight years until its sank in 1915 as a
result of a torpedo hit the Rhino
this machine that looks like a piece of
a sci-fi movie decoration was created in
1953 by an American inventor named Eli
ignites having a curved weight of five
tons and hemispherical iron wheels each
weighing 700 kilograms this all-terrain
vehicle could accelerate up to 70
kilometers per hour the low center of
gravity of the car and the unusual
chassis provided it with excellent
cross-country ability allowed it to
float and practically walk on the walls
this may seem surprising but as an angle
of 75 degrees the Rhino didn't tip over
sure our Gustave this super heavy
artillery railway gun was developed in
the late 30s in the last century by the
German company Krupp in total two of
these guns were produced bearing the
names heavy Gustav and Dora the calibre
of each was 800 millimeters while the
weight of the projectile reached 7 tons
the maximum range of fire was 50
kilometers the speed of the projectiles
flight exceeded a thousand meters per
second during the Second World War these
giant guns were used twice their
transportation was carried out by means
of the railway on April 22nd 1945 the
front units of the Alliance army
discovered the remains of Dora and heavy
Gustav blown up by the retreating German
troops in the aftermath all that was
left of the guns was sent for remounting
Mille mi 10 this military transport
helicopter or a flying crane was
developed in the USSR in 1961 and
adopted for service in 1963 the mi 10 is
a helicopter of a classic single rotor
scheme with a steering rotor a four
legged chassis and two gas turbine
engines the fuselage at the helicopter
is made completely from metal with a
flat bottom past the front part of the
fuselage Fritz the cockpit with an
improved view in the central part
there's an entrance vestibule and a
cargo cabin with a cargo door on the
starboard side as well as an electric
winch with a carrying capacity of 200
kilograms the cockpit of the helicopter
can fit up to 3 tons of cargo or 28
passengers to ensure that all the wheels
get off the ground at the same time when
taking off the right landing gear racks
are 300 millimeters shorter than the
left with a minimum clearance of 3.75
meters</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
