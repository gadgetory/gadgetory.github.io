neutralize vibration while driving all
thanks to a technology developed by the
boston-based company clear motion this
technology involves using a special
chassis supplied with four electron
hydraulic devices one for each wheel
shock absorber the equipment gathers
road condition data storing us in the
cloud the vehicle in turn uses this
information to smooth the ride on
certain road sections clear motion was
successfully tested in 2018 engineers
said it took almost four decades and
several billion dollars to develop in
the future this amazing invention will
not only improve conventional cars but
also unmanned vehicles
Katzie knee lifting bags special
machines are used to lift heavy vehicles

Lumiere law paint makes any vehicle
visible even if there is not light
around the secret lies in these special
electroluminescent properties of the
paint the coating consists of several
layers forming a system capable of
emitting light it comes in five colors
green blue white orange and aqua these
are the colors that the human eye can
see when the paint is glowing when it's
not working the surface has a standard
gray color it's no worthy that the light
emission doesn't heat the surface the
paints also uses alternating currents
rather than direct current to emit light
it changes thanks to a special inverter
mounted in the car
so luma law runs on the vehicle's
battery power the coating you see on the
