complex and time-consuming process but
as technology advances this has changed
the construction of new buildings using
3d printing is one of the most popular
processes on the market today the
novelty of this industry is mobile
printing the APIs core 3d mobile printer
prints while inside the building under
construction it is a rotating arm with a
single point coverage area of a hundred
and thirty-two square meters the device
is small in size easy to transport and
requires no preparation time before
construction the installation and
configuration of the APIs core requires
no more than thirty minutes
the dimensions of the prints are quite
compact and reach four by one point six
by 1.5 meters the innovative machine
weighs two tons making it possible to
use standard special equipment for
transport another distinctive feature is
the number of people needed to work with
APIs core to trained workers can fully
control the entire process including the
material flow for the printing of the
construction fiber concrete a kind of
cement concrete is used in this way the
material is dispensed and applied layer
by layer reducing the possibility of
construction waste to zero
helicopter tree-trimming the unique
technology of helicopter tree-trimming
seems almost fantastic but it is used in
reality to carry out this process a
special circular saw blade is used
consisting of steel blades fixed one
below the other the device is powered by
a common diesel engine when the sore is
lifted out of the air the helicopter is
floating in the air above the trees and
moving in a straight line cutting off
the branches this work requires the
precision of every movement as is
necessary to control not only the
helicopter but also the cutting
mechanism this method of trimming is
mainly used near power lines to avoid
contact of branches with cables and
subsequent accidents
Amazon Prime air Amazon began using
small drones to send small purchases to
customers in the UK in 2016 and this can
be considered a major breakthrough in
the use of drones at the moment the
drones deliver purchases weighing up to
two point three kilograms and they do so
in half an hour
Amazon's standard flying messenger
service is a helicopter with a
propellers and a computerized control
system that's installed in the center
and top of the frame the maximum flies
altitude for the drones developed by the
company is a hundred and twenty meters
the speed of the device in the air
reaches 80 km/h but the design and
features continue to improve the so
called drone tower is also being
actively developed from where the drones
will fly with the orders and then return
taz life the American companies hasla
world famous for its electric vehicles
was founded in 2003 and was named after
the father of electrical engineering the
physicist
Nikola Tesla today's tesla has
successfully produced four models of
electric passenger cars the t roadster
the Model S the Model X and the model 3
in addition on November 16
2017 Tesla introduced the Tesla semi
electric tractor which will be launched
in 2019 according to the creators idea
electric cars must completely replace
the internal combustion engine and
impart to humanity the desire to advance
green transportation despite significant
deficiencies in some cars criticism and
loss of production the company is still
existing and announcing new models of
electric cars
wham-o waynebow part of alphabet holding
specializes in the development of
autonomous driving technologies way most
systems use information collected by the
Google Street View service a video
camera a lidar sensor mounted on the
roof a radar in the front of the car and
a sensor connected to one of the rear
wheels that helps determine the position
of the car on the map is also worth
noting the devices for detecting
flashing lights in emergency vehicles at
the end of May 2014
a completely autonomous car without a
steering wheel or pedals was presented
to date
wham-o cars have exceeded more than
eight million kilometers during testing
and on public roads among the
disadvantages of these vehicles are the
difficulties with parking the
recognition of urban waste as well as
the impossibility of moving under heavy
rainfall and in snowy terrain the
company plans to complete the cars by
2020
cuca robotics as a specialist in the
field of robotics and automation
technology cuoco robotics is one of the
leading manufacturers of industrial
robots cucas wide range of robots
includes devices of almost all load
capacity types
cuca industrial robots help to improve
product quality reduce material costs
and save energy
one of the unique capabilities of this
company's robots is their interaction
with the person as a partner and
assistant this allows these intelligent
devices to be used economically in small
and medium-sized businesses it's also
worth noting the novelty of the software
and the exceptional precision in the
movements of each robot thanks to which
they can carry out work even with
smaller details
I'll impulse the Scottish company touch
bionics is a leader in the development
of high-tech prosthetics and was the
first company to commercially produce
Bionic prosthetics for the upper limbs
currently more than 1,200 patients
worldwide use a limb products in
addition to the existing model another
product has been developed the island
pulse according to the developers it's a
modification of the first model it
allows for more movements some of them
very subtle such as tying the shoelaces
and fastening the strap the island pulse
uses a unique patented pulsating
technology when moving the toes of the
prosthesis which increases the ability
to manage the prosthesis and increases
the strength of adhesion to the object
when the fingers of the island grasp an
object the user is able to use the
pulsation function that assures control
of the object these high-frequency
electronic pulses are very important in
everyday life as they enable precise and
decisive movements in this case the
aluminium casing and design features
make the island pulse a fairly robust
prosthesis is worth noting that the
device is capable of carrying a load of
up to 90 kilograms in addition the ilm
pulses is a Bluetooth interface which
allows the prosthesis technicians to
select individual settings for each user
danyoung cun chang grand bridge this
incredible structure is part of the
Beijing Shanghai high-speed railway in
addition the danyoung Kunsch and grand
bridge is considered the longest bridge
in the world and is registered in the
guinness book of records the length of
the construction is a hundred and sixty
four point eight kilometers but only
nine kilometers of the road is above
water at the same time the largest pond
across the viaduct is lake yang Cheng
the genuine Kashan grand bridge is
located in eastern China between the
cities of Nanjing and Shanghai the
construction started in 2008 and despite
the amount of work the bridge was put
into operation in 2011 more than 10,000
people participated in the construction
the most advanced technology was used
and the work was carried out
simultaneously on both sites to build
the bridge
two and a half million cubic meters of
concrete and 500,000 tons of steel were
spent the final cost of the danyoung
Kanchan grand bridge according to
various estimates ranges from 8 to 10
and a half a billion dollars guys it's
time to recharge your brain visit the
channel brain time there you'll find a
lot of interesting and useful facts lots
of positive energy and tons of useful
information subscribe right now we
promise it's going to be really exciting</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
