automatic transmissions undoubtedly I
have a huge number of advantages which
is why they are gradually replacing
manual gearboxes on the market however
in the world of drag racing enthusiasts
automatics cannot compete with manual
transmissions because only a manual
gearbox guarantees an optimal gear
shifting when constantly gaining speed
on the screen you can see a transmission
created especially for fans of drag
racing it is a variation of the Kilduff
shifter which allows you to take
advantage of both automatic and
mechanical transmissions at the same
time in the drive position the gearbox
works as an automatic transmission
however if the driver needs a manual
gearbox he can pull the leftmost lever
down to the first gear all levers on the
right or then push the car into the next
gear
trophy truck cars assembled specifically
for desert racing have a number of
interesting features that make them
incredibly spectacular and impressive a
few years ago
Monster Energy showed its new and
amazing trophy truck it's a huge three
ton car capable of landing on the ground
from a height of 2 meters and moving on
without any damage the size of the
wheels on the 20-inch rims give the car
an amazing off-road capability
and it may seem that there is no
insufferable obstacle for the trophy
truck it has 800 horsepower and an
impressive torque of 930 for Newton
meters combined with a phenomenal
running gear and transmission we'd like
to draw special attention to the
suspension to the front suspension is
independent but the real one is
dependent with the possibility of
adjustments in the Front's there are
double wishbone suspension and the car
also a shock absorbers with Springs and
a transverse stabilizer the front
suspension stroke is six hundred and
sixty millimeters the rear suspension is
a continuous drive axle with three
longitudinal guide rods and shock
absorbers for Springs the suspension
stroke is 864 millimeters it's these
features that allow the trophy truck to
withstand loads that conventional
vehicles cannot withstand
Koenigsegg Agera in the spring of 2015
Koenigsegg showed their amazing
capabilities by developing a
modification of its rig error the result
was a car that could easily star in the
movie Transformers to make the
Koenigsegg Agera more unusual it was
decided to equip each of its opening
parts with a separate drive the modified
doors attract the most attention because
of the interesting updated design
also the trunklid and the rear parts of
the body were modified then we have
taught to open on their own an
interesting feature is the remote
control which handles the mechanisms it
makes the koenigsegg agera similar to a
transformer because the car begins to
transform on its own despite the fact
that the interior is empty
killaby Kamara here is another
modification of a world-famous car model
this time it's the Chevrolet Camaro 2010
usually these cars were equipped with a
304 or 426 horsepower engine
but the killaby Camaro has five or six
times more power specifically seventeen
hundred and fifty horsepower Eraser
known in certain circles Steve no gas
did the modifications the basis of the
resulting monster was a 2010 v6 Camaro
with more than 30,000 kilometers on the
road from the very beginning Steve knew
that he wanted to build a car which
could perform a burnout this is a
special technique of keeping the vehicle
almost motionless while the wheels are
still rotating
during the burnouts tires are subjected
to a great deal of friction which causes
them to heat up and smoke
thus the killaby Camaro is literally
destroying its own tires
in addition Steve wanted to surprise
everyone at the time of the creation at
the killaby cars but 1471 blowers were
not uncommon so we decided to opt for a
giant 1671 all these features allow the
car to rotate its wheels at a speed of
up to 300 km/h while still remaining in
place
in limo chats the vehicle you see on the
screen is probably the most unusual
limousine on the planet in August twenty
eighteen specialists from the American
company jetsetter finally finished the
project which was launched twelve years
ago
however the engineers claimed that the
resulting device is worth every day
spent on us the limo jet is a hybrid
between a Lear jet aircraft and a
limousine
of course the jet engines had to be
removed and instead the vehicle was
equipped with a v8 Vortech gasoline
engine despite the fact that the limo
jet is not able to fly the engineers
left all the parts of the hull like
penis cells and the empennage to show
its true origin
note what an interesting decision has
been made regarding the jet engines they
were replaced by decorative lighting
inside the 13 meets a vehicle you can
find absolutely everything you expect to
find in the most common limousine eight
passengers can enjoy an excellent audio
system the cabin was equipped with a
large number of speakers and TV sets the
diode lighting ribbons are decorative
and of course the car has fridges with
alcoholic beverages and leather seats
it's noteworthy that the limo jet was
authorized to drive on public roads too
however the driver will have to spend
time on mastering the controls because
the cabin is equipped with numerous
displays
driving houseboat all your boats have
one little problem
they can only travel on water they have
no wheels to drive on the roads for this
reason transporting a boat is often
difficult as special trucks have to be
used mechanics from Vietnam ik Sark
rated about without this disadvantage in
2017 the driving houseboat was launched
for the first time what you see is very
real it's really a vessel equipped with
working wheels like a real vessel it has
a name to the beast of burden what you
see on the screen is a 10 meter floating
house a hybrid between a 1967 jeff boat
sun liner and a wrinkled big a sprayer
three-wheeled tractor when asked why he
needed to create something like this the
developer answers there's no logical
reason I just thought it was something
cool to do and the result is great isn't
it
hey stop being lazy it's time to use
that brain eels welcome to brain time
incredible facts from the past the
present and even the future the power of
nature and wild animals amazing facts
and unsolved mysteries you'll find all
this and much more hair subscribe now
