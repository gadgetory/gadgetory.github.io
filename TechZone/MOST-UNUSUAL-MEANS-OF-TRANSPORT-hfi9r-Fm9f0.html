the ability to adjust its
characteristics to the owner the car has
a flexible robotic platform which
changes the size as well as the power
depending on the need the process of
transformation takes only a few seconds
which saves time the size of the car for
one passenger is a hundred and sixty
centimeters long 78 centimeters wide and
135 centimeters tall in the two
passenger mode the length of the car

future such vehicles will move on
special magnetic roads despite its
weight the repulsive force of the
magnetic field is powerful enough to
lift the vehicle into the air
in size the hover car has a joystick

hour it easily overcomes slopes of up to
40 degrees since it has a powerful 200
cc gasoline engine
the drive range of the vehicle is only
an hour however it can be used even for
carrying heavy loads its carrying
capacity is 550 kilograms according to
the idea of the engineer the DTV
shredder is a modular vehicle that can
be equipped with various accessories
thus the vehicle can perform a wide

the Canadian company opener is engaged
in the creation of this miraculous
vehicle they've been working on it for
the last 10 years at the moment black
fly is not in free sale and the
developers are planning to begin mass
production of the multi-rotor in 2019
the price is also yet unknown but the
manufacturer promises that it will not
exceed the cost of an average SUV the
most notable feature is that the device
Rises into the air and descends
vertically this is very important since

of rain equipped to the backlit display
it displays all the necessary
information from the speed and battery
reserve to the distance traveled the
cost of this device is $2,900
