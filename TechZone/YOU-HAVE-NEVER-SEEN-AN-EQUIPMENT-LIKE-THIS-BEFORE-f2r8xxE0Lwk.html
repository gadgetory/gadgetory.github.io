or any other lawn small particles of
grass remain on the surface after a
while they rot forming a thin loose
layer on the surface of the lawn it
doesn't have the most favorable effect
on the soil their fall to improve the
soil structure level the surface and
prevent the appearance of moss once in a
couple of years the turf is treated with
sand in this case a thin layer of sand
is applied to the lawn of course you can
do it manually with the help of a shovel
but the use of a special sand machine
significantly accelerates the work
process top dresser the device you see
on the screen places the sand on the
surface smoothly and most importantly
evenly it optimally fills all the holes
in the lawn and prepares the top layer
of soil for the next season the video
shows the sanding with the Jacobsen
Cushman TD 1500 characterized by its
high productivity it can be used to sand
the turf of sports stadiums and golf
courses
a bi gravel grader owners of dirt and
gravel roads know that maintaining them
is hard work that involves delicate and
regular care to keep a road free of
potholes bumps and other defects it must
be leveled periodically traditionally a
special nozzle is used which is hung on
a gasoline lawnmower however it is an
imperfect method and for the teeth of
the nozzle to penetrate the ground from
above a concrete block is used to
increase the weight the American company
a bi created its own innovative nozzle
which makes loading unnecessary and
greatly simplifies the care of gravel
and dirt roads
it's equipped with spiral Springs which
make it possible to handle even complex
and extra hard sections the position of
the grader box equipped with long
ripping teeth is regulated by the remote
control panel the owner independently
chooses the effort to be applied to the
road surface based on his real needs the
API gravel grader together with the
gasoline lawnmower will make any road
even the most uneven smooth soft and
suitable for driving again
ventrac edger 4500 p grass tends to
spread which is especially noticeable in
parks where a large amount of grass
extends over pedestrian pathways to keep
them neat and aesthetic the edges must
be cut every few months
unfortunately the grass invades the
sidewalk ruining the appearance of the
road and moreover the surface clearing
the pavements of grass with hand tools
is possible but it's a long and heavy
process often the government can't hire
a brigade of workers to do this job the
equipment you see on the screen can
replace an entire work group as it deals
with the grass along the edges of the
sidewalk very quickly while the person
makes minimal effort the ventrac edger
4500 P is equipped with a sharp disc
that cuts the grounds together with the
grass along the curb and then removes it
from the pedestrian walkway optionally
the ventrac edger can be equipped with a
blower for more efficient cleaning it's
used ensures that the sidewalk surface
will remain perfectly clean after
processing it should be noted that the
special technology makes it possible to
care for a variety of sidewalks
including those with a curb
Ransome's
hm 600 here we have a universal
extremely effective lawnmower that
allows you to process a wide variety of
lawn covers in a short time the
Ransome's HM 600 can be used to care for
golf courses sports stadiums gardens
parks roadside areas and many other
places the processed area can be
regulated so it fits a variety of needs
when you need to process a large open
area use a nozzle with a width of 3.2
meters if you need to process turf along
the road replace the side nozzle with a
narrower one the vehicle is on the road
while the lawnmower moves on the grass
and does its job it should be noted that
the side mower can be easily raised and
lowered this greatly simplifies the work
when mowing a lawn with many low
obstacles such as benches and bushes
another advantage is the special
flexible design of the wide nozzle which
makes it possible to work even on rough
terrain the manufacturer was also
concerned about operator comfort the
position of the steering wheel seats and
instrument panel is all adjustable the
Ransome's HM 600 can also be equipped
with a covered cab for greater comfort
and safety
ventrac era vaiting 4500 why regular
cleaning and sanding are not enough to
take care of lawns to ensure that the
grass is always fresh and has a healthy
saturated color it should be aired
approximately once a year this is a
uniform perforation over the entire lawn
area this contributes to better ingress
of water air and minerals into the soil
and roots a variety of equipment can be
used for the aeration process both
manual and mechanical but the fastest
way to treat the entire surface is to
use a specialized device such as this
ventrac air of 1840 500 why it's more
efficient thanks to its special design
the teeth not only bite the soil
destroying the integrity of the layer
they also vibrate and move on the site
which provides additional loosening this
increases the amount of air that the
grass root system can saturate a nozzle
with a large number of dowels makes up
to 86 holes in each square meter the
size of the holes is regulated by the
speed of the movement the faster the
machine goes the less the ground loosens
beach tech 2,800 the procedure of
cleaning sand in public places and other
beaches always raises many questions how
is it done
do people clean the sand manually or do
they use any special equipment well of
course it all depends on the particular
Beach in some cases they do use special
equipment like the beach tech 2800 it's
a trailer that can be used in
conjunction with any standard tractor
the tractor moves the trailer forward
and is working area is 2.5 metres
special equipment captures a strip of
sand and passes it through the filter in
such a way that it removes all the trash
as a result the perfectly pure sand
returns to the beach and the garbage
remains in a special tank the working
depth is adjustable up to 30 centimeters
this technology is extremely productive
and it can handle up to 30,000 square
meters per hour
rabid multi gnat 2,400 modern
manufacturers are dedicated to the
development of a variety of technologies
designed to facilitate and accelerate
the care of municipal territories the
rapid multi net 2400 is a tractor nozzle
designed for fast and effective cleaning
of sidewalks it's working width is 2.4
meters
powerful brushes effectively clean clay
sand stones oil stains and other
impurities from the sidewalk surface the
device can operate in two modes in the
first mode dirt and debris are collected
from the road and immediately threaten
to one sight towards the sidewalk the
second mode is designed to clean wide
roads when there is no sidewalk a
floating brush cleans the trash and
sends it to a special collection tank
its volume is 400 litres in other words
you can work without emptying the tank
for a long time
