Prius cars aroused mixed feelings among
car enthusiasts some of them are
delighted and others don't like them
very much however in the near future the
car will receive an improved engine the
company has developed a 2-liter
four-cylinder engine which has much more
outstanding power than the existing 1.8
liter model the biggest disappointments
about the Toyota Prius was that the car
didn't have enough power and the
manufacturer decided to fix this the new
gasoline engine dynamic force is more
powerful than its predecessor by 34
horsepower reaching a hundred and 69
horsepower overall with the torque of
205 Newton meters amazingly thermal
efficiency is 40 percent on normal Drive
and 41 percent if you use the hybrid
installation the manufacturer doesn't
call this figure a record but it can
still be considered phenomenal some time
ago it was believed that such thermal
efficiency was simply impossible to
achieve engineers redesigned the
interior to paying special attention to
the characteristics of the airflow of
the engine with direct injection into
the cylinders and intake ducts the
descending flow of the intake mixture
was optimized which made it possible to
achieve combustion efficiency the
compression ratio is 13 to 1 which adds
power with each rotation of the shaft
the engine will be featured in the 2019
Corolla as well as the Toyota Auris and
then the Toyota Prius
Kwasi turbine the engine that you see on
the screen has a rotor design pay
attention to the number of parts
rotating in the oval cavity they provide
variable capacity necessary to implement
suction compression expansion stroke and
exhaust the inventor speaks of the
engine as a multi-link mechanism which
rolls around the central path
interestingly the motor can consist of a
different number of links so the number
of working strokes made by the car in
one full turn varies
however with any configuration the
number of working strokes of the quasi
turbine is greater than that of a
conventional piston engine a few years
ago a prototype chainsaw was created
called the zero vibration quasi turbine
chainsaw the main feature of the engine
is that the percentage of harmful gases
in its exhaust is very low
Vesey turbo here is the world's first
serial variable compression car engine
it can transform depending on the
situation in order to optimize power and
efficiency specialists from the company
infinity called the new VC turbo one of
the most technologically advanced
internal combustion engines in history
the motor was equipped with a multi-link
system that adapts the stroke height of
the pistons thanks to this feature the
engine can smoothly switch between eight
to one and 14 to one compression ratios
working as a load coefficient provides
high power and torque working at a high
coefficient increases efficiency
significantly reducing fuel consumption
the innovative control system is able to
autonomously decide which mode is more
suitable in any given situation thus
infinity specialists managed to assemble
an engine that shows the output power of
a four-cylinder turbo engine but at the
same time consumes fuel like a diesel
engine engine capacity is 249 horsepower
so the manufacturer claims that the vc
turbo is 27 percent more economical than
other engines in addition it's vibration
noise is 20 decibels less than that of
competitors
SKYACTIV X some time ago it became known
that Mazda specialists are going to
equip the Mazda 3 model 2019 with a new
gasoline engine of these SKYACTIV X
family it's noteworthy that it has
unique structural features before Mazda
no one had tried to put such a motor
into mass production being limited
exclusively to prototypes and
experiments the peculiarity of the
engine is that it uses homogenous charge
compression ignition technology or HCC I
it turns out that the SKYACTIV X
provides something like a diesel cycle
on gasoline the manufacturer claims that
this feature will allow gasoline engines
to become 30% more economical
however the experts had to develop a
variation of H CCI for this engine known
as SC CI or spark controlled compression
ignition the compression ratio in the
2-liter SKYACTIV X is outstanding
reaching 15 to 1 it's possible thanks to
the fact that the engine is equipped
with a driven supercharger
8,000 see tech to engines with a dual
injection system are being produced by
the company arctic cat this is a rare
combination of increased power ultra-low
oil consumption and new standards for
performance and exploitation the
manufacturer claims that the new 8000 C
tech 2 is 30% more economical in oil
consumption at low revs the specialists
also managed to increase the torque at
low and medium speeds by 36% the 8,000 C
tech 2 runs on gasoline is capacity is
794 cubic centimeters a notable feature
is the upgraded system known as Arctic
power valve it provides three stage
control of auxiliary outlets through
side valves as well as a three stage
control of the main exhaust window
a 1250 cc boxer engine the new
motorcycles the r12 50 GS and the R 1250
RT from BMW which will be released in
2019 received an improved boxer engine
with shift cam technology this allows
you to adjust the lift and the opening
time of the intake valves the specialist
managed to squeeze even more power out
of the improved engine and increase the
torque it shows smoothness and balance
especially at low revs it also provides
lower fuel consumption as the motorcycle
will emit much less harmful gases into
the atmosphere it's noteworthy that the
camshafts open in sake valves
asynchronously which leads to increased
turbulence of the intake air this in
turn guarantees better mixing and
combustion
other interesting features of the engine
include a camshaft gear chain drive
instead of a roller chain also the oil
flow has been optimized as the cylinder
now has two nozzles
Polaris 850 Patriot for the past five
years Polaris has been working on an
improved engine the results was the 850
Patriot engine with almost none of the
traditional components used in other
engines of the company the only elements
taken from other motors include the
spark plugs two sensors and some
fasteners the 850 Patriot has been
completely redesigned and it's received
new highly efficient and durable Pistons
that have an increased compression
height and thickness the low inertia
crankshaft is durable tough but also
light all this allowed a 13% reduction
in inertia and a faster response time to
a change in the position of the throttle
plate the cylinders and cylinder heads
have also been designed in such a way
that they can be optimally cooled the
design of the combustion chambers and
exhaust ports is also new and has been
patented the updated technical
components include the three-stage power
valve system EVs 2 and the exhaust pipe
and resonator have increased throughput
creating significantly less noise
hey stop being lazy it's time to use
that brain of yours welcome to brain
