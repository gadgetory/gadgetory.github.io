I'm going to be the voice in today's
video thanks for your understanding
NCC spuma here's an innovative way to
deal with weeds NCC spuma is a
functional solution developed by the
Swedish company NCC the manufacturer
claims that it is the ideal tool to
maintain sidewalks roadsides parking
spaces and other overgrown surfaces this
method of controlling unwanted
vegetation consists of spraying hot
water about 95 to 98 degrees celcius on
the weeds the high temperature is
maintained by an insulating foam
containing vegetable oil and cornstarch
it's noteworthy that these are
eco-friendly components
high temperatures damage the cellular
structure of weeds the layer of foam on
top intensifies this effect hot water
also prevents the seeds from germinating
thus the NCC spuma not only removes
already germinated weeds but also
reduces the need for maintenance in the
first year of use he needs to perform
the procedure three or four times in the
following years the number of treatments
required is reduced to two or three this
is significantly less than with other
weed removal methods
plastic road nowadays the Netherlands is
showing us what roads will look like in
the future at the moment plastic Road is
a trial project working in two cities zu
Ola and geet worn in the latter half of
2018 30 meter long bicycle tracks were
put into operation here they have two
very important and interesting features
first of all they are made of modular
elements secondly these elements are
made of recycled plastics such as
bottles bags caps and other man-made
ways the Netherlands is an amazing
country that recycles 51 percent of all
waste produced no wonder these roads
appeared here of course in the future
the project will develop further each
lane in the city is a swollen D torn
required an amount of plastic equivalent
to two hundred and eighteen thousand
plastic cups or five hundred thousand
bottle caps
another advantage of the design is the
ease of installation experts say that
modular road construction technology
reduces construction time by 70%
unfortunately there are also
disadvantages during the rain the road
is quite slippery also if you ride the
bike at high speed the road grip is
rather low specialists are looking for a
way to improve the surface when they do
they will also start developing
motorways just imagine it will be
possible to lake communications in the
cavity under the modules for example to
create heated roads protected against
ice and instead of fixing the whole road
you can simply take out the damaged
module and replace it with a new one
de vici electric cars are slowly but
steadily conquering the automotive
market today all the leading car
companies have already started
developing and producing them needless
to say it is necessary to provide
drivers with the most comfortable
driving conditions the American company
qualcomm has made an important
contribution to this field
it's specialists created the de vici
technology which stands for dynamic
electric vehicle charging it allows you
to recharge an electric car wirelessly
on the go the project has been in
progress since 2014 for the first time
it was decided to test it in France near
Paris a 100 meter long test track was
laid there
the main advantage of the technology is
that the electricity's obtained not from
one particular section of the road but
as you move along the track to make this
possible special panels are installed on
the road surface remarkably at the trial
stage the road can recharge two cars
simultaneously the project cost about
nine million euros in the future these
automatic charging systems will not only
take the use of electric cars to a new
level but will also expand the range of
use of unmanned vehicles
Euna lift you are looking at equipment
designed to simplify the work of people
building concrete slabs pavement for
decades the main problem was that heavy
slabs had to be moved manually from
place to place over time such physically
exhausting work results in bad back pain
Yuna lift is an equipment developed by
unit lock the machine uses a powerful
suction pad to lift the paving stones
move them and then place them in the
right place the road is paved by a
single operator
the machine is so fast that in a minute
you know lift allows you to lay up to
one square meter of fading stones all
the operator has to do is place the
suction pads over the slab and then
press the lever
after that the device bears the entire
weight of the products the person can
easily handle the lifting mechanism most
of the work is done from a comfortable
standing position so you do not have to
lean over bearing a load in your hands
the maximum weight of the slab is a
hundred and forty kilograms the moving
speed of the equipment is three point
five kilometres per hour
paver laying machine and here's another
even simpler way to build roads which
implies minimal human involvement the
Chinese company Quan Fang
produces this amazing equipment this
paper laying machine does most of the
work on its own operators are only
required to place the building material
on the conveyor belt in time in this
case it is Road break the equipment is
ideal for the construction of bridges
sidewalks garden paths garden squares
parks and the like
it is noteworthy that the machine is
able to lay paving stones in different
ways for example it could be a classic
or a herringbone pattern which is chosen
by the operator before starting the work
surprisingly in one shift such equipment
lays up to 400 to 500 square meters of
paving stones this is much more than
with traditional construction methods
the machine is operated by three people
the working width varies from 2 to 4
point 2 meters
Ultra creat instant road repair if
you've ever seen a road repair process
you know that workers have to use bulky
complex machines but this is an asphalt
pavement repair equipment that does not
have this disadvantage ultra create
instant road repair is a material
especially developed for filling holes
and crevices in the road surface
it is sold in bags and containers the
materials spread over a pre cleaned road
defect and then compacted if the damage
is minor a hand tool is used for this
purpose if you need to process the
larger surface then you should use
special equipment immediately after that
the road can be used no other operations
are required
by the way work can be carried out
immediately after rain on a wet road
this means that the weather conditions
do not affect the quality of the
resulting patch</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
