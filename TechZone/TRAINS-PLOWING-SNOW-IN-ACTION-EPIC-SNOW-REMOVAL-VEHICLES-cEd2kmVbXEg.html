already in the forties of the last
century but still don't go out of
operation due to their functionality and
reliability they're used if the depth of
the snow cover doesn't exceed naught
point six meters when cleaning snow is
thrown away on both sides of the Train
creating massive snow drifts along the
sides of the railway track
snowplows are used in all countries of
the world where the climate implies the
sufficient amounts of cold precipitation
the elimination of snow embankments
guarantees the subsequent safety of
travel to passenger and suburban trains
irrespective of weather conditions
this small car equipped with a rotary
snow throwing device was seen in the
Swiss Alps near Pont racino
despite the fact that most modern trains
are highly technological and use more
new ways of consuming energy
this device is still moving with the
help of a steam engine as well as trains
of the last century according to the
operator this is due to the fact the car
first worked without a bunch with an
electric train and moved independently
perhaps the reason was an abnormally
large amount of precipitation or
employment of all the rest of the
equipment transferred to other parts of
the road
unlike the previous trend this one gets
rid of snow with the help of a large
metal wedge located under the driver's
cab due to the special structure of the
massive element it not only raises the
snow from the railway track but also
throws it to the sides thereby
completely cleaning the rails
the location of the windows in the cabin
allows you to monitor all stages of the
process fully controlling it and
providing maximum safety this is an
important factor because in Japan where
this video is shot it isn't unusual for
wild animals to step onto snow-covered
railway tracks
the uniqueness of this snowplow is that
it doesn't use speed as an assistant
when working on the contrary the train
moves very slowly and cleans the snow
gradually collecting it from the tracks
with the help of special brushes
after that the snow gets inside the
machining where it goes off on a special
conveyor belt it's ground and only after
that it's removed through the holes on
the side of the train this technology
makes it possible to improve the quality
of path cleaning in several times but
differs from others in large time costs
in Japan due to the cold and snowy
winter of 2014 to 15 part of the Niigata
Prefecture alrea way line was completely
covered with snow to prevent possible
accidents and damage the trains were
stopped and on the line came a massive
cleaning machine with a high performance
or good device in the video you can see
how the snow cover is raked up inside
the machine with two plows on the sides
and then Rises with an auger all the
snow collected by the cleaner is sprayed
to the sides by means of a special
dispenser with a movable upper part
thanks to this technology it's possible
to avoid large blockages on the edges of
the railway track
when there's a lot of snow which causes
problems in the operation of trains many
people prefer to use personal cars
which leads to even greater problems
including traffic jams and emergencies
in order not to reduce the volume of the
passenger traffic and also to avoid any
possible changes in the train schedule
they often use cleaners like this in
Japan
its main distinguishing feature is its
unique design with two cabins because of
this the machine can move along paths in
both directions while equally
successfully performing its work the
technology of snow removal from this
cleaner is similar to that previous
device from our list uses plows and
orchid device however to manage this
cleaner a person doesn't need a special
driver's license
the maximum speed of this track snow
plow doesn't exceed 16 km/h but this
doesn't reduce its productivity in
addition to the usual metal wedge
located in front of the driver's cap the
device is also equipped with two massive
wings which can either be folded or
straightened depending on the width of
the road
in the unfolded state these details
increase the area cleaned of snow
approximately in three times capturing
not only the paths themselves but also
the space on each side of them the
absence of snowdrifts is necessary when
the Train needs to make an emergency
stop for example in case of an
unexpected break down for repair work
despite the fact that this device is not
a railway device and it's able to move
independently without the help of rails
it should still be mentioned in our list
the Auguste snowplow is capable of
throwing snow to a height of about 10
meters spraying it to the required
consistency to avoid the appearance of
large snowdrifts at the same time is
working speed is 60 kilometers per hour
in other words the machine can process
snow directly in the course of travel
the weight of the device is equal to 37
tonnes and in order to achieve this
speed a 650 horsepower engine is
installed
but today the car is made only in Norway
but it's freely delivered to other
countries</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
