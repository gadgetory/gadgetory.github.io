block system has developed an innovative
system that takes low-rise construction
to a new level the company's specialists
create concrete blocks which after
drying can be placed on top of each
other like Lego blocks
note that the wall is built by two
people using an ordinary loader the main
feature of the design is the special
grooves and recesses at the top and
bottom of the blocks thanks to them the
concrete elements can be securely linked
together it's not necessary to use
mortars and adhesives which greatly
speed up the work another benefit is
that the blocks by bet block system
don't need a foundation the wall as well
as the entire structure can be built on
any paved area the manufacturer suggests
using the blocks to create covered
parking lots garages and any other
similar premises these concrete elements
will become an ideal material for the
construction of supporting walls fences
and sheds the blocks are water and frost
resistant the performance of the
resulting construction is not inferior
to traditional concrete construction
grip writes drill bits you may need to
make a hole in a concrete or brick wall
for various reasons for example to
install air conditioning systems
communication systems or heating and
sewerage pipes in other words this
procedure is carried out at every
construction site in the world
these diamond core bits are designed to
work with a grip rights drill the
manufacturer offers a wide range of
drill bits to suit a wide variety of
applications some of them are suitable
for wet use and some for dry use the
bits have a modified design which allows
you to drill the wall with greater speed
and power thanks to this grip white bits
do the job 30% faster than its analogues
wine cellar if your house doesn't have
enough space for a wine or food cellar
don't worry you can place it directly
under the house as follows first the
builders mark the place where the cellar
will be located they make a hole in the
concrete floor the next is probably the
most difficult stage digging a pit deep
enough
since the work is performed inside
Builders have to work by hand devices
that could speed up the work simply
don't fit in the room as the depth of
the pit increases its edges are covered
with metal panels as the construction
will be located below ground level there
is a small risk of flooding too
to protect the future seller a special
film is placed inside the pit the bottom
of the pit is filled with concrete's
which then becomes the foundation the
preliminary operation at this stage is
almost finished
the workers start installing the shelves
for the bottles inside the cellars they
also serve as a framework at the same
time the workers build a spiral
staircase of course this also a
ventilation system so they fill the
cavity between the cellar and the ground
with concrete the last stages are
installing the door and finishing the
surface
iq m/s 362 tile cutter from the moment
that tile cutting machines were first
invented their design hasn't changed
much they are still massive dangerous
machines with limited mobility experts
from IQ power tools decided to put an
end to this this is a powerful but at
the same time mobile tile cutter
it's equipped with a 42 centimeter blade
and a built-in dust collector the IQ m/s
362 tile cutter can cut bricks paving
stones stones and veneers with extreme
precision when folded it's compact
enough to fit in the trunk of any car
larger than a passenger car pay
attention to the wheels - they allow the
device to be moved around the
construction site without much effort
building 3d printer the layer-by-layer
technology to create a solid object was
developed relatively recently
nevertheless 3d printers are becoming
increasingly popular in the modern world
in the recent years companies all around
the world events at the competition to
create the most perfect 3d printer tool
a construction mix here's a device used
by consolidated contractors company it
is the largest construction company in
the Middle East last November they
showed how 3d printing technology can be
used in mass construction the 3d
printing equipment uses an extruder to
apply the construction mix thanks to the
fact that it's integrated into the
moving arm the machine is capable of
constructing walls corners and window
openings basically only one 3d printer
can be used to create a whole house the
project was carried out on the behalf of
the Saudi national housing company and
in the future the authorities are going
to print about one and a half million
buildings using this method
projectile system installing a
multi-level floor may be used for a
variety of reasons for example you can
separate two rooms who visually
highlight a certain area also a
multi-level floor is able to hide wires
or hide the imperfections of the room
traditionally a multi-level construction
is made of ordinary wooden beams they
used to build a frame on which slabs
parquet boards or other finishing
material are attached what you see on
the screen is an innovative system that
can be erected instead of a standard
wooden frame it consists of adjustable
elements on which the floor is attached
the height of the elements can vary
between 35 and 500 millimetres the
system is made of high quality
polypropylene it can be used both
indoors and outdoors and is not affected
by water or temperature changes the
manufacturer the company tile warehouse
recommends using Pro Jack to built
terraces poolside areas walkways and
patios installation is fast and easy
which is also an advantage
roofing roofing is always a complex
multistage process a correct
installation will ultimately determine
the reliability and durability of the
entire construction what you see on the
screen is one of the stages of the roof
installation workers perform mechanical
fixation of polymer bitumen membranes
they are made of a multi-layer composite
material about three to five millimeters
thick as you can guess from the name of
the material the membrane consists of
bitumen and modified polymer this layer
makes the roof waterproof polymer
bitumen membranes are used because they
are more elastic when compared to other
insulation materials as a results the
surface is not damaged and the water
does not seep in even if the roof itself
has been deformed or the surface is
cracked the membranes are laid in a
thick layer using equipment that
resembles a tubing stapler however in
this case special rivets are used for
fixing instead of staples additional
bitumen allows to create a continuous
insulating layer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
