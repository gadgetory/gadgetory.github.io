how to make a bed better however in
recent decades modern engineers and
developers have persistently proved
otherwise
today you can find beds that will
provide a fundamentally new sleep
experience and increased comfort one of
them is this smart duvet perhaps the
most important feature of this bed is
that it has two independent zones
if a person likes to sleep cool they can
adjust the climate control to have their
side cooled down throughout the night
for example - 18 to 20 degrees Celsius
at the same time if the other person
likes to sleep in the warmth they can
adjust their half to heat up for example
up to 24 degrees Celsius no more
fighting or sleeping with discomfort for
the benefit of your partner in addition
you can save electricity haters and air
conditioners could be turned off during
the night the comfortable temperature is
maintained locally right where you sleep
another advantage of these smart duvet
bed is its ability to tuck in on its own
the developers have also taken care of
the air circulation system that keeps
the bed linen dry and reduces the risk
of bedbug infection the price ranges
from two hundred and seventy nine to
three hundred and sixty nine dollars
depending on the size
hi cam according to the developers this
bed performs three important functions
the first is that it makes you feel good
the keys who are healthy full sleep is
relaxation high can makes you feel safe
thanks to the blinds on all sides you
can also turn on a dimmed light
relaxing music and even add a pleasant
soothing scent secondly it keeps him
healthy the smart bed monitors the
quality of your sleep
taking biometric data measuring ambient
temperature and noise levels then it
records all the information received in
the app it has a smart alarm and snoring
prevention functions finally the third
feature of high con is that it can
entertain you in front of the bed
there's a screen for you to watch movies
and shows high quality sound its
director the viewer from all the sides
of the bed so it feels like you're in
the world's most comfortable theater the
price of high can starts at forty
thousand dollars the ultimate bed only a
few pieces of furniture can offer the
same functionality as the ultimate bed

curve it takes up just a little more
space than a standard sized bed however
it provides the owner with a storage
space a bookcase additional seating
space and the safe the nightstand can be
raised there is a built-in lamp and a
panel for charging gadgets to this bed
even has speakers that can be used to
play music all surfaces are finished
with soft and smooth velvet and you can

pods time you are looking at a bed
designed specifically for public spaces
the manufacturer suggests three ways of
using the bed for example in the office
scientists have proven that a power nap
in the daytime can be of great benefit
firstly it allows you to compensate for
the lack of night's sleep and improve
your health secondly a power nap
improves your mood reaction rate memory
attention and other cognitive functions
that's why many companies see power naps
as a way to increase productivity pods
time is perfect for people to rest for
15 or 20 minutes if you don't want to
sleep you can just lie back and relax
read or listen to music
the second suggestion is airports and
terminals inside the pod time capsule
the traveler can have some privacy and
relax between flights a screen to watch
movies also brightens up the waiting
time and allows you to have some fun for
the third option it's recommended to
replace the standard mattress with a
soft one and also add a set of bed line
into the capsule because it's designed
to be used in hotels and hostels a large
number of pod time beds will allow you
to set up a fully fledged capsule hotel
your guests will find everything they
need to rest and sleep inside the price
of one capsule starts at forty four
hundred dollars
bumblebees spaces bed people are
increasingly choosing compact apartments
with extremely modest living space
organizing space in them requires
resourceful Nastasia manufacturers all
over the world come up with new ways to
save space
for example experts from the American
company bumblebee spaces suggest to
suspense the bed from the ceiling the
ability of hiding the bed opens new
opportunities for you for example
there's no need for a separate bedroom
as it can be shared with the living room
alternatively the bedroom space is then
freed up to allow use of play exercise
or to other things at the moment the
project is at the stage of development
cereal production will start at the end
of this year the price will then vary
from six to ten thousand dollars
the rest smart bet most regular beds
have one huge drawback the mattress does
not adapt to the individual
characteristics of the body of its owner
the rest smart bet is different though
this is because its mattress is divided
into five separate zones head shoulders
back hips and legs each of these areas
can be separately loaded or raised for
each user the stiffness of the mattress
is adjusted manually using the mobile
app you can also customize the bed to
fit your body automatically in this case
the mattress will change the stiffness
level throughout the night to adjust to
your sleeping postures
the secrets of the bed's construction is
it's multi-layered structure the
mattress consists of memory foam a
material that takes on the anatomical
shape of the body under the effect of
human weight and warmth underneath it
has smart sensors and 5ne chambers there
is support for the edges of the bed
ensuring that you always sleep closer to
the center the rest smart bed is
recommended for athletes especially
during intensive workouts however anyone
can buy one the price ranges from 2,800
to $5,200
Magne smart tech the last boat we'll
show you today also guarantees a higher
level of comfort that's because it's
harmoo independently from each other
this is perhaps the most important
advantage as partners don't disturb each
other during the night one can be half
sitting at the other can sleep on a flat
mattress you can control the
construction with the help of a mobile
phone for example to enable the reading
mode lifting the top of the head in this
case you take up the optimal position
for reading after a long day's work it
feels great to rest your tired legs
above body level in this case there's a
special mode where only the lower part
of the bed is raised
there is also a timer in the application
which can be used to set the time when
the mattress should turn straight which
can come in handy if you often fall
asleep on reading you can buy the mag
nice mat Sakata price starting at
$20,000</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
