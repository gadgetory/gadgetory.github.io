I'm gonna be the voice in today's video
thanks for your understanding
more bdellium 100 modern technologies
allow us to solve even the most
complicated tasks when processing wood
and other materials in just a couple of
clicks here is a CNC machine for
drilling and milling according to the
manufacturer this is the only machine of
its kind on the market with an
incomparable quality/price ratio its
software is called sweet maistro' and
has specialized modules for each
production cycle
a great deal of attention was paid to
space optimization during its design
there are no perimeter fences so you can
access the work area from any side
interestingly with a more bdellium 100
it is possible to process not only wood
but also plastic for example the machine
expands the production possibilities and
can be adjusted to the needs of
different companies for example it can
be used to process a panel or in
elements of furniture a kitchen and even
a window the machine can work with parts
from 180 to 250 millimeters wide
frontier OS 27 sawmills like the one you
see on screen are capable of processing
really large round Timbers thanks to
their stationary design frontier OS 27
is designed for cutting hard and soft
wood the equipment can handle Logs with
a diameter of up to 69 centimeters at
the same time the maximum width of the
board after processing is 56 centimeters
frontier OS 27 is designed by
specialists from the American company
Norway one of the leaders in the field
of innovative mobile sawmills the
advantages of this machine include
time-saving with the frontier OS 27 the
specialists will need much less time to
cut into logs than with other similar
equipment
blue elephant machines on an industrial
scale CNC software machines like this
are used to process wood and apply
various patterns and designs to the
surface this equipment developed by the
Chinese company blue elephants is
powerful enough to work with different
types of materials
thus the machine can be used to process
wood panels acrylic organic glass MDF
plastic copper and even aluminum the use
of such equipment is relevant for
companies engaged in production of doors
windows various furnitures such as
tables and chairs as well as musical
instruments the 2148 ici model is a
drilling machine with a large working
area which increases the efficiency of
work
the manufacturer emphasizes the wide
range of Engraving possibilities which
are achieved thanks to replaceable
knives the ele cnc 6090 is a cnc
engraving machine designed for small
businesses where space is limited it is
ideal for making classic and antique
furniture wood carving and souvenirs
such as boxes and decorative sculptures
also with its hell but is possible to
make branded plates badges logos and
billboards
CNC machines machines that have been
equipped with numerical control are
increasingly in demand in factories
around the world they allow you to
process wood plastic and metals quickly
efficiently and most importantly with
minimal human intervention which ensures
a higher level of safety the video shows
how a sculpture is made with the CNC
machine
a few decades ago such work could only
be done by a sculptor he would have to
spend a few hours performing precise
meticulous processing
today modern technologies have developed
to such a level that they can produce
sculptures of any size and complexity
first the appearance of the product is
designed in the program the virtual
model sets the trajectory of the milling
cutter and then the machine starts to
work and the manufacturer decides from
what material the finished sculpture
will be the only thing to keep in mind
is that the cutting tool itself must
correspond to the hardness of the
material to be processed
VST 101 this is a CNC turning and
milling machine its main feature is the
automatic change of cutting modes this
design allows you to minimize the time
you need to change the tool settings
thus a company can produce complex parts
with high productivity and repeatability
the VST 101 is designed for the
manufacturer of both large and small
parts guides by taiwanese company
highway and provide high precision high
load capacity low friction smooth
running and low noise
the rugged design ensures a long service
life with high precision movements as
well as high speed movement with low
traction
note the 30 millimeter thick MDF sheet
worktable when processing nonmetallic
materials it offers many advantages for
example a workpiece can be attached
directly to the table material using
screws if the surface is damaged or has
accidental cuts the table surface can be
leveled and when there's nothing to
level the table can be easily and
quickly replaced
when 39:20 when designing this two
direction scroll saw when specialists
were apparently inspired by a sewing
machine
indeed anyone who is familiar with the
way it words will be able to handle this
saw it has a unique design and the blade
can move in two directions thus
achieving the best throughput the work
can be done from any angle the cutting
speed is adjustable and the blade can
make between four hundred and sixteen
hundred cuts per minute it is noteworthy
that the when 39:20 can be used to make
an angle cuts and the work table can be
tilted at an angle of up to 45 degrees
the machine is compact in size so do not
expect enormous power from it
nevertheless it easily copes with up to
five centimeter thick wood the
advantages include a solid durable iron
base a lamp an air pump and several
blades thus with the help of the Len
3920 it is possible to create products
of various even complex and intricate
shapes quickly and safely
hey stop being lazy it's time to use
that brain eels welcome to brain time
incredible facts from the past the
present and even the future the power of
nature and wild animals amazing facts
and unsolved mysteries you'll find all
this and much more hair subscribe now
you won't regret it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
