vehicle that without exaggerating is the
dream of any video game fan and even
professional gamers in November 2009
Toyota presented its incredible and
crazy project at the SEMA Auto Show in
Las Vegas the Toyota Tacoma car was
turned into a mobile gaming station for
people who don't want to stop playing
even on the road absolutely all of the
design decisions incorporated into the
car are aimed at improving gaming
comfort for example gullwing doors in
these doors the hinges are not fixed on
the side but on the roof so the doors
lift if you open them thanks to this the
front seats fold out and back lining up
next to the rear seats when the car is
ready for a gaming session in front of
each of the four seats you have a screen
with built-in joysticks
surprisingly the manufacturer even
placed a special energy drink
compartment in the cabin
jadeite oh right in May of this year
specialists from the company brave
robotics made the dream of millions of
fans at the Transformers movies and
comics from all over the world a reality
they're experts set out to create a real
robots car the result of the work was
the manned transforming robots jato ride
which can become a fully functional
automobile apparently this vehicle seems
to have just left the pages of the
catalog of a toy store the weight of the
vehicle is sixteen hundred and ninety
five kilograms the height of the robot
is 3.7 meters and the length is two and
a half meters
the developers incorporated electric
motors and lithium-ion batteries thanks
to which the transformer can move on
foot and on wheels curiously while
walking the robot lifts the foot to a
height of 80 centimeters the speed
developed by the J dieter riders a
hundred meters per hour operating like a
car the transformer can move at a speed
of up to 30 km/h it is worth noting that
in the cabin of the incredible car
there's room for two people at the same
time in addition the transformer can
change its shape while people are inside
the robots set in motion by remote
control or like an ordinary car from
inside the cabin
err fish ate some time ago boats capable
of rising in the air were just a fantasy
but today the first prototypes of flying
boats have begun to appear and air fish
8 is one of them the vehicle you see on
the screen was developed by Singapore
which it works and can reach speeds of
up to 190 km/h is a floating boat with a
length of 17 meters and a width of 5
meters air fish 8 is designed to carry
two crew members and accommodate six to
eight passengers
company representatives say the
developments of larger flying boats that
can carry up to 50 people is already
underway these vehicles have a very
important purpose
despite their ability to rise just one
meter above the water's surface the air
fish age will be of great benefit to
people living in island countries these
ships are expected to help people travel
between the islands three times faster
for a start in the Philippines and the
Maldives it should be noted that in
order to rise in the air the air fish
ate only needs 500 meters of space this
means that it can be used in places
where larger boats such as ferries
cannot access
concepto millenia the vehicle you see on
the screen was created by a single
person the Filipino enthusiast kicks
Mendiola he calls it an ultralight
aircraft although it resembles a flying
car the process art was first shown in
the summer of 2018 and the inventor
hopes to begin mass production of this
vehicle in the near future this compact
electric multicopter is ideal for
personal or professional use so with the
help of concepto millennia you can
inspect solar panels agricultural fields
or farms with its help you can move over
a wide area quickly reaching your
destination or just enjoy the relaxing
flight at this point the development has
the ability to stay in the air for 15
minutes is designed for a pilot of up to
100 kilograms
all electronic components have a backup
including flight controller at the
battery the chassis the vehicles made of
aluminium and carbon fiber so the design
combines lightness with reliability and
durability according to the inventor the
vehicle needs minimal maintenance this
means it will soon be easier than ever
to buy your own flying vehicle
bio-hybrid the German company schaeffler
is known worldwide for its high quality
transmission elements and power plants
used in the automotive and aerospace
industries their representatives believe
that compact and personal cars are the
future of the transportation industry to
demonstrate how shapeless sees the cars
of the future bio hybrid was created the
car gives its owner the opportunity to
travel comfortably and absolutely safely
while taking care of the environment and
not forgetting about his health
bio-hybrid resembles above all a bicycle
but it's actually a pedal operated
machine
the aerodynamic body protects the
cyclist from bad weather and also allows
them to carry bulky loads if you wish
bio-hybrid can be equipped with an
additional seat so that two people can
travel inside the car is powered by an
electric motor and the batteries have a
removable design thanks to this feature
the bio-hybrid can travel from fifty to
a hundred kilometres while moving at a
speed of up to 25 kilometers per hour to
operate this vehicle the user doesn't
need a driver's license and it's also
compact enough to move for example along
bicycle lanes
GTX Raptor here we have another car
which has also been created for real
gamers however it has a slightly
different design trust gaming's GTX
Raptor was presented in August this year
at Gamescom the representatives of the
company assure that they managed to
create a true champion inside we can
find five personal computers four games
in seven screens providing a 4k image in
addition to ps4 pros 24 subwoofers and a
9000 watt audio system were installed in
the cabin the special stand for the DJ
is not the only item on the GTX Raptors
list of incredible technical add-ons as
conceived by the developers the car has
a very important mission to make video
games available anywhere anytime
