up in your glass on the other side of
the filter unlike regular filters
however the RO keeper warns you when
your filter capacity is almost or
completely exhausted but easy to read
and intuitively comprehensible green and
red LED light signals this information
is based on water tests the gadget
performs regularly so it actually knows
when the water is not clean as it should
be instead of just telling you to
replace after a certain amount of time

varies greatly depending on how much
water you use and how dirty it is the

data not pictures sound bounce since the
invention of earmuffs in the late 19th
century not much has changed and foam
with minor alterations and upgrades has
continued to be the most common
protective material sound bounce aims to
change this
unlike foam which provides passive
protection equally muffling all sounds
this material actively reacts to the
level of noise absorbing only the sounds
that exceed the safe level of volume
when the volume is safe the material
stays passive and liquid inside the
earmuff allowing you to perfectly hear
low volume sounds like conversation
without having to take off the
protective gear sound bounced by far
outperformed foam as a hearing
protective material in comparative tests
especially for low frequencies the ear
muff cushions can be removed for keeping
them clean and hygienic stealth this

any water you can find after you pour
the water into the cube it starts an
electrochemical reaction turning
magnesium originated from sea water
inside the replaceable cartridge to
magnesium oxide with a resulting
electric energy directed to a USB
outlets on the cubes top surface after
the cartridges used doorless resources
which takes about 60 full charges if you
use it for a mobile phone it can be
replaced and the magnesium oxide refined
back to magnesium without using so much
energy which can be easily provided by
solar panels for example the cube itself
is made primarily from recycled plastic
ball from charity companies that create
jobs for underprivileged locals
contributing to the welfare of these
people as well as a cleaner environment
this makes the cube a sustainable non
polluting recycled and recyclable
