Israeli company miffed from security has
been developing systems and gadgets for
civil protection since 1962 last year
the company showed its latest most
innovative product the MV b3x
which stands for modular vehicle barrier
according to the company the patented
technology shown in the video is based
on 20 years of experience the MV b3 axe
has a relatively low weight about 24
kilograms while being quite compact when
folded it can fit into a small Locker
thanks to its simple lightweight design
the MV b3x can be assembled by just one
person the barrier is then placed on the
road when the vehicle bumps into the
barrier it automatically opens pushing
the vehicle upwards this way the MV b3x
ends up under the car preventing it from
moving amazingly this small device is
capable of stopping even really large
vehicles for instance a seven and a half
ton tractor as was demonstrated during
testing
the barrier can be equipped with wheels
for faster and easier transportation
whole metro door blaster nearly every
task Special Forces has to face involves
entering the premises since there's no
universal key to open all doors they
have to use special tools like crowbars
cutters and rams
that's all you see on the screen is a
more advanced and technological
alternative to the ones these security
services have been using for many years
this gadget is manufactured by home
Metro a Dutch company the door blaster
does the job as quickly as if you are
using explosives but without using a
dangerous explosive component there
aren't any dangerous debris after the
opening process either the device is
installed in the doorway and then pushes
the door so hard that it instantly
breaks the width of the doorway doesn't
matter either as the width of the door
blaster is adjustable other advantages
include the ease of installation it can
be done by just one person also the
installation is silent which means that
the device can be used even in secret
operations there is a remote control
function too so the operator may not be
standing right in front of the door when
it is opened the door blaster is powered
by a special pump which fits into a
backpack along with the door blaster
sky wall different countries have
different laws on drone use for example
there are almost no restrictions or
clear rules in the EU but in Thailand
drones equipped with cameras are
prohibited and of course in every
country there are places where flying
unmanned aerial vehicles is illegal as a
rule these include secret objects and
airports a few years ago the British
company open works engineering showed an
effective tool to stop people who
launched in drones its main advantage is
that the operator works from the ground
at first sight the device on the screen
resembles a hand grenade launcher and
indeed sky wall fires but it uses
special projectiles instead of grenades
they can be equipped with a simple net
or a net with the parachute the latter
helps to gently land the aircraft
without damaging it another type of
projectile creates an electromagnetic
pulse the features of sky wall include
fast reloading about eight seconds and a
smart aim it determines the speed the
trajectory of the drone and the distance
to it thanks to the received data the
projectile will hit the target even if
the operator is not great at shooting
the device weighs 12 kilograms and its
firing range is a hundred meters
nighthawk here is another gadget
designed to stop vehicles on the spot
the problem of most of these systems is
that they lie on the road and you can
see them from afar so the driver can do
something to avoid them Nighthawk who
looks like a black suitcase left on the
side of the road the operator waiting
nearby presses a button on the remote
control a few seconds before the vehicle
drives through the chosen area Nighthawk
throws a spike strip onto the roadway
and no more than two seconds
immediately after the car is driven over
the device it falls back this is
necessary to avoid damaging the security
car following the intruders car the
suitcase weighs only thirteen point six
kilograms ShotSpotter when there is a
gunshot in a city there is a small
chance that someone will call the police
and report the incident even when
someone does call it is usually too late
the precious first minutes have passed
which means that police can't react on
time short spotter is a system that
solves this problem and can bring police
work to a new level
acoustic sensors are installed on poles
lanterns and buildings all over the city
when a gunshot is fired the devices
respond instantly by determining the
exact location and time of the incident
to get this information the senses
around the identified location counts
the time it took for the sound wave to
spread the data is calculated instantly
and then immediately sent to the
security services the point where the
gunshot occurred is highlighted on the
city map this makes it possible to
immediately send a police unit to the
scene increasing the probability of
catching a criminal and rescuing
possible victims such systems already
operate on the streets of some cities in
the United States for example Miami
Chicago and Cincinnati
third arm this exoskeleton was designed
specifically for the US Army however the
technology it uses can be invaluable to
other special services as well the fact
is that the weapons used by the Army are
pretty heavy
for example the weight of an m249
machine gun is from six to eight
kilograms the m240 machine gun weighs
more than 12 kilograms the third arm was
tested with this weapon the simulation
showed that the exoskeleton provides
stabilization which significantly
improves the shooting it also increases
the efficiency by distributing the load
evenly across the body and reducing hand
fatigue third arm is attached to the
firearms and weighs just under two
kilograms by itself
the first prototype did not allow the
soldiers a shoot from a lying position
however in the latest version this
problem was fixed
Hoverbike s3 this flying motorcycle was
introduced about two years ago it was
designed by Alexander atamanov CEO and
inventor of hover surf at the end of
2018 he was reported that the hover bike
s3 was to be used by the United Arab
Emirates police the forces received one
of the experimental vehicles worth about
a hundred and fifty thousand dollars for
staff training in total according to the
plan about 40 of these vehicles will be
purchased the head of the artificial
intelligence department of the Dubai
Police said that in case the tests and
training go well the motorcycles will be
put into operation in 2020 the hover
bike s3 can safely fly at an altitude of
five metres above the ground in the near
future the developers plan to improve
this feature the motorcycle can move in
any direction - which increases the
mobility of a flying police squad
considerably compared to that of an
ordinary police squad in addition this
vehicle will come in handy
getting to hard-to-reach places
