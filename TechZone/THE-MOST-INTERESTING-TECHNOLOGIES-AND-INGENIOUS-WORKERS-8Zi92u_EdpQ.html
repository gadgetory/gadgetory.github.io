I'm gonna be the voice in today's video
thanks for your understanding
laying tiles perhaps the most popular
method to decorate kitchens and
bathrooms is ceramic tiles builders use
this material regularly but it is still
easy to make mistakes we could talk
about the problems with tiled surfaces
for a very long time but instead today
we are going to show you an expert who
knows how to avoid one of the most
common mistakes when working with tiles
uneven distribution of the mortar first
of all see how evenly he applies the
solution many builders instead of doing
that only apply it in the corners after
the mortar has been spread the master
uses transparent tiles to demonstrate
the advantages of his method after a
couple of movements the mortar is evenly
distributed under the tiles leaving no
gaps the result is very different when
the tiles are laid in the traditional
way using a hammer
wall decoration a really good
professional knows what building
materials to use to achieve excellent
results when decorating a room in the
shortest possible time in this case the
weakened walls natural wood finish is
used this material is easy to use and
allows you to complete even a large
project in just a few days the secret of
these wooden panels lies in their
special fastening system during the
production phase a special adhesive tape
is placed on the inside thus weakened
walls can be installed on any wall
painted or treated in any other way the
set of tools is basic a knife a spatula
or roller a builders level a set Square
and tape measure
Stone imitation here is a relatively
simple and most importantly cheap method
to decorate a wall not everyone can
afford natural stone to finish a row
however this does not mean that you
should give up this idea the video shows
the work of an expert who can create a
surface
imitating natural stone it all begins
with the preparations applying duct tape
to the wall at first glance the work
might look easy but it requires a great
deal of precision from the worker the
appearance of the finished surface will
depend on how evenly the tape is applied
to the wall as you might have guessed
the place is covered by the adhesive
tape will become the joints between the
stones then a special solution is
applied to the wall and an even layer in
this case it is a mixture from the
Turkish company al Seco this material
has been especially developed for this
job it includes elements that after
drying give the surface to stone like
texture then the mortar layer is leveled
now the most interesting stage begins
decorating the wall the worker uses a
flat trowel to give the surface that
desire to look at this stage the pattern
looks too unnatural to resemble natural
stone that's why the wall is being
leveled again before the mortar hardens
the worker removes the adhesive tape a
little later when the wall dries it is
lightly sanded and excess material is
removed with a trowel
now all that remains is to cover the
wall with paint first a base color is
applied the worker carefully paints the
entire surface without missing a single
spot
the second coat of paints of a brighter
shade is applied much less carefully the
result is a surface that looks just like
natural stone
concrete foundation traditionally
concrete mortar is poured into a wooden
mold to make the foundation of the
construction but the problem is that
wood is a heavy and rigid material this
means that people have to put a lot of
effort to cut it the brilliant builders
you see on the screen are using a
fundamentally new material that doesn't
have any of the flaws that wood has they
are using the easy click system to build
the foundation it is a set of extruded
polystyrene foam slabs this material is
lightweight which means it is easier to
bring to the construction site and move
around
in addition it is softer than wood so it
is much easier to cut it and to get it
to the right size however these are not
the only advantages of this material
despite its lightness polystyrene foam
is durable it remains intact even under
the influence of compression loads in
this case the mold for the foundation is
not removed because the slabs guarantee
heat and moisture insulation no matter
how easy it is to fasten the slabs
together with conventional construction
foam
while insulation here is another
building material which is used
exclusively by experienced builders who
know a lot about their arts wall tights
is an innovative wall insulation
solution developed by BASF Canada this
purple polyurethane foam has optimal
thermal insulation properties
significantly increasing the energy
efficiency of the construction according
to the manufacturer the foam is made of
two main liquid components or resin and
a hardener an interesting property of
the material is that it has catalysts
and stabilizers
this means that wall type foam can have
different thermal conductivity density
and cell structure they are adjusted to
each individual project so that the
right insulation quality can always be
achieved the material can be used for
both brick and concrete walls thanks to
its special properties the foam fills
all the space but the width of the
cavities should not exceed 200
milliliters along the entire wall the
master drills holes and pours the liquid
solution inside the wall through a thin
tube within minutes it grows and becomes
a foam capable of filling any even the
smallest gaps
the work begins at the bottom of the
wall the craftsman let the foam dry and
then check whether it is hardened after
that they begin to pour the solution
through the rest of the holes when the
work is finished the holes are sealed
floor installation finally we are going
to show you the specialist from the
Colombian company art goes as well as
the materials that it offers the video
shows various flooring options in the
first case it is a concrete floor
surface imitating beautiful stonework
today we have already talked about the
fact that natural stone is not the most
affordable material on the construction
markets unlike concrete which is used in
this case a die was added to the mixture
to make the surface look more natural
after the layer is leveled it is stamped
to create a stone like surface it is
noteworthy that the appearance of the
final coating depends on which stamp the
craftsman chooses here is another
example of slab paving pattern on a
concrete floor thus we can see that
concrete is a universal material that
can take any shape and have a variety of
colors
hey stop being lazy it's time to use
that brain of yours welcome to brain
time incredible facts from the past the
present and even the future the power of
nature and wild animals amazing facts
and unsolved mysteries you'll find all
this and much more hair subscribe now
