inland Oki County Arkansas it belongs to
Remington
the ammunition manufactured here is sold
in many countries around the world per
year the company produces 2.6 billion
cartridges and about a hundred million
reloading supplies such as shell casings
and bullets material consumption here is
enormous up to 20,000 tons of leads and
five and a half thousand tons of copper
a year letters delivered to the plants
in the form of blocks they're rolled
into cylinders and then sent to the
fabrication line here it takes the form
of a wire from which the bullets are
later made copper is used for the
production of lead bullet shells it's
supplied to the plants in the form of
one and a half meter high rolls it
undergoes a fortune process for the
manufacture of shell casings the metal
passes through special presses that make
the head in various steps then the
lathes make the hole for the primer and
form the circular groove at the bottom
now the workpiece is heated and passes
through a machine that will give the
shell its final shape all these
processes are automated and it's this
equipment that makes it possible to
achieve enormous production scales
before the shell casing is ready it
needs to be cleaned and ground special
tanks with chemical solutions are used
for this purpose
after cleaning the metal is heated up
again to get rid of the metal fatigue
that invariably occurs when the material
is pulled and pressed for a long time
when the casing is ready the cap is
placed in it the gun powder is filled in
and then the bullet is inserted the
ammunition is ready and the conveyor
belts send it to the packaging shop
where people are responsible for filling
each
tanks now you'll see how the main battle
tank of the United States the m1 Abrams
is assembled this vehicle has been
produced since 1980 and the cost of one
tank varies from five and a half to six
point 1 million dollars even though
today people are increasingly using
automated equipment for production the
construction of Tanks is mostly a manual
process more than 12,000 different parts
are installed in the finished tank frame
of course the factory can't afford to
assemble only one tank at a time
therefore the construction area is
amazingly large in this case it has the
length of two football fields before the
tank is assembled it passes through 16
stations h1 responsible for one aspect
of the vehicle
for example there's an electric wiring
station a hydraulic station and a
weaponry station interestingly the tank
spends about a day and a half at each of
these stations and all this time the
workers adjust the parts without putting
down their tools for example at this
station the foreman supplies the tank
with 14 wheels which ensure optimal
stability at this point the tank already
weighs 25 tons by the end of the
assembly it will weigh 36 tons the most
important parts of the tank are
installed almost at the very end of
production these are the engine and the
tracks the workers carefully lower the
three thousand eight hundred and sixty
kilogram engine into these special
opening each track weighs approximately
two tons and 270 kilograms the weight of
the two caterpillars that are mounted on
the tank is four times the weight of a
minivan and as you can guess the process
is complex and painstaking at this stage
the tank is almost ready
finally the onboard equipment on the
computer providing one of the most
modern fire control systems are
installed
artillery shells only truly powerful and
destructive weapons can strike enemy
buildings and fortifications artillery
shells are a weapon of destruction
created specifically for these purposes
they can be used to destroy armored
vehicles trenches falsifications
Garrison's fences and even buildings
an artillery shell consists of two parts
the casing and the explosive itself the
video shows a shell casing manufacturing
plants in value ava's serbia the factory
is basically a forging plant but we'll
talk a little bit more about the process
high quality steel is supplied in blocks
which are then cut and carefully
measured to ensure that each workpiece
has the exact same size then the forging
process begins and it consists of
several steps the metal is heated and
then shaped into a shell then the
workpiece it's pressed to achieve the
optimum steel strength when the shell
cools down
they are sandblasted to achieve a smooth
ground surface
helicopters here is the
mcdonnell-douglas
eh 64 Apache the main attack helicopter
of the US Army which has been produced
since the mid 80s in spite of the fact
that the vehicles been in operation for
a long time today the Apache is the most
widespread attack helicopter in the
world as with tanks helicopters are
built entirely by hand by trained highly
skilled craftsmen this giant helicopter
Factory is located in Mesa Arizona it's
size is comparable to the size of seven
residential blocks on an area of a
hundred and eighty-five thousand square
meters there's a research center a
production hall as well as a test area
every year 32 helicopters are created
here besides modifying and updating the
old ones in order to turn an empty
fuselage into a fully fledged helicopter
a hundred and sixty employees work
tirelessly for three months the
production hole consists of 15 stations
when one station finishes working the
helicopter is manually moved to the next
one it's noteworthy that it spends about
five days at each station first the hull
is processed a fuel tank is installed
when the cockpit is equipped with the
necessary equipment then the engines the
rotors the electronics and the sensors
are installed leaving the weapons for
the end
here we can see how the mi 8 mi 17 and
mi 38 helicopters are produced at a plot
in Kazan Russia these are Russian
multi-purpose and civilian transport
helicopters the main unique feature of
this plant is that all three models of
helicopters are manufactured almost
simultaneously just like with the ah-64
Apache all the work here is done
manually people can install a large
number of components in a limited space
better than a machine
Swiss Army knives Victorinox is a swiss
company there's been manufacturing now
since 1884 today it is the only company
that supplies knives for the Swiss Army
soldiers keep one to eight different
tools with them a blade a can opener and
a cap opener are mandatory there can
also be a small or large knife a metal
saw a wood saw a Phillips screwdriver
scissors a wavy blade a Milan spike
pliers and even a booth cleaner the
knife is at least thirty percent
chromium which gives it the ability to
withstand corrosion around 2,500 tons of
chromium are imported from France to
Germany every year the blades of the
knives are pressed from a three
millimeter thick steel strip the
hydraulic mechanism presses down on the
material with the pressure of 40 tons
different metals of them used four
different tools for example the knives
are made of particularly hard steel
screwdrivers are made of softer steel so
they won't break under pressure the
hardness of the material changes
depending on the amounts of carbon in
the composition after forging the knives
are then polished they spend about eight
hours in a tank with ceramic chips and
water
the final hardness of the blades is
achieved by heat treatments in an oven
at a temperature of 1050 degrees Celsius
at the same time as the knives other
tools and plastic handles are also
produced interestingly the knives are
assembled by hand craftsmen lighted
screws in layers one by one and then the
equipment forces them together the
knives are almost ready and the only
step left is connecting them to the
handles</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
