metal parts are incredibly diverse as
are these size shape and functions of
the various details factories around the
world process a wide variety of metals
on a daily basis for example iron copper
titanium and aluminium since the metal
has a high hardness it must have reached
the forging temperature before it can be
processed each metal has its own
temperature depending on its physical
and chemical properties to work with
iron it's necessary to heat it to a
temperature of 800 to 1200 and 50
degrees Celsius copper processing takes
place at a temperature of 650 to a
thousand degrees the forging temperature
of titanium is 900 to 1600 degrees and
aluminium and it's alloys need only four
hundred to four hundred and eighty
degrees
there are several different types of
forging and can be made with hammers
pneumatic steam or hydraulic another
method is stamping there is also a
manual forging but it's not suitable for
industrial processes generally speaking
the process of forging metal and making
parts consists of four steps the first
is to heat the metal to the desired
temperature the second is to compress
the metal to achieve a homogenous object
immediately after the oven the metal is
pressed with a hammer so there's no
hollows inside the third step is to give
the detail the right shape the softer
that metal the more flexible it is
during this stage the metal is poured
into molds cuts stretched or bent
depending on the shape it should have
the fourth step is the final treatment
and as the resulting surface is uneven
it must be smoothed out
Inc the video shows how ink is produced
for use in a wide variety of industries
any drawing design text on paper or
cardboard which we see around is painted
with this product here we see the
production process of the Canadian
company the printing ink company the
numerous color variations used by
designers and typography are based on
four basic colors these are yellow
magenta cyan and black it should be
noticed that black is the most important
color as it's responsible for the
brightness of the remaining colors to
create the colors the two ingredients
are used the first is a pigment that
contains a color similar to a color
powder the second is a thick sticky
lacquer the first step is to place the
pigment and the lacquer into a special
large tank where they're mixed with an
industrial mixer the tank also has a
heating system because when the mixture
is hot it's more liquid and mixes better
the next stage is polishing the fact is
that pigment particles which a short
time ago were particles of color dust
generate lumps within the mixture the
paints will have a uniform color only
when these lumps are destroyed there are
two types of equipment for this process
the first uses small metal balls to
break up the lumps however after this
the paint still has a novel II surface
to finally make it smooth and shiny
the second equipment is used a machine
with rollers after this the paint is
ready
however in companies that manufacture
high quality paint the final step is
quality control
ATM absolutely all ATMs have a similar
design and are produced based on the
same technique the device consists of
two sections the lower part is a steel
safe in which the money is located the
top section is equipped with everything
needed to perform the operation on the
user's side the card reader the panel
with buttons and the monitor most of the
non electrical parts used to assemble
ATMs are made of steel sheets workers
place the steel plate on the cutter
which is controlled by a computer
program with the help of a laser the
parts are cut in the desired shape the
finished metal parts are immersed in a
liquid which in the future will protect
them from corrosion the parts are dried
in a special oven and then painted all
components will be used for the frame of
the top section at the ATM when it's
assembled people start working they
manually connect all the modules and the
electrical parts connecting them
together and fixing them then in the
next step the top section is attached to
the prefabricated safe by the way the
thickness of its walls reaches 5
centimeters the external panel equipped
with a keyboard speaker cameras and
other things is also assembled manually
when all the components are ready they
are then connected to each other so that
the ATM can start working
leggo the first Lego plastic brick was
built in 1949 for more than 50 years the
parts have been created to fit together
a Lego brick made 50 years ago can
easily fit a newly made brick this is
the result of careful monitoring and
verified production stages in factories
all over the world designers use these
same technology the material used to
create the parts are plastic granules
bought from other factories by trucks
and stored in a warehouse
interestingly the granules themselves
are either colorless or have a white or
black color from the warehouse the
granules are sent to the heart of
production the molding section here the
machines produce the Lego figures 24
hours a day seven days a week the
factory also has more than 50 different
colors for the bricks the raw material
is heated to a temperature of 230 to 310
degrees Celsius becoming a homogeneous
mixture similar to a toothpaste then
this paste falls into the stamping
apparatus where under great pressure
the famous bricks are created the waste
after manufacturer is immediately
recycled and reused at production the
shape of the manufactured parts is
determined by the templates thanks to
them the parts are the exact size each
plant pay special attention to taking
care of these templates the boxes with
the finished parts are placed on the
conveyor and then sent to the warehouse
the number of details and boxes is
unimaginable but the system is automated
when certain items are needed for a
particular set the computer finds the
right box and grabs it in this way the
parts are packed correctly
ldq five the cars by large and
well-known companies such as Aldi are
produced in factories where manual work
is combined with automatic work this
video shows how the Audi q5 cars are
created the chassis material is
aluminium to see all the parts a press
for the load of 81 tonnes is used
specially trained workers look for flaws
in all the parts specifically in this
plant 670 units of robotic equipment
work to produce up to a hundred and
fifty thousand automobiles per year
thanks to them the components are
assembled and gradually acquire the
shape of the vehicle as we all know each
robotic arm has its own purpose for
example some move details and others
join them together the finished frame is
bathed with an anti corrosive liquid
after drying the frame is painted and
the other robots and people work hand in
hand step by step and finally assemble
each car the final stage of production
is the quality control of the car
