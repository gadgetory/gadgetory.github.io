created a scrap-metal copy of the 1.3
million dollar Lamborghini Reventon
super sports car in one year Wang
created the chassis for his Lamborghini
using a second-hand Volkswagen he also
had to move the machines engine from the
front to the back it's worth noting that
there were only 21 copies of the
reference on model in the world
so this copy is unique in every way
the original Lamborghini reaches a speed
of a hundred kilometers per hour in 3.4
seconds while the maximum speed is 340
kilometers per hour
despite the resemblance on the outside
the speed of this homemade version of
the Lamborghini is very different from
that of the original now this farmer
uses his sports car to transport mineral
fertilizers but he plans to improve this
Lamborghini Reventon
and make it more like the original
flying boats this new zealand inventor
Rudy Hyman spent 11 years building this
device his invention known as the wig is
a motorboat on a hovercraft that can fly
the operating principle of this device
is quite simple the motorboat
accelerates to 97 kilometers per hour
after which the wig can fly over the
surface of the water and for a while
float in the air it's impossible to lift
the vehicle to the sky of course but
nevertheless the weight can float over
the water at a distance of up to 3
meters the flying boat is equipped with
removable wings a 1.8 litre Subaru
engine and a scooter steering
we're a full tank the wit can fly over
225 kilometers the load capacity of the
wig is approximately 160 kilograms
three-wheeled car this 3 wheeler has a
rather unusual design the vehicle has a
metal base that supports the structure
which in turn moves on small wheels this
small car is designed for one person and
the vehicle is equipped with they're not
very powerful engine the speed of the
three-wheeled homemade car does not
exceed 30 km/h and also since the car
has no roof you can use this vehicle
only good weather conditions it's also
worth noting that the inventor used all
his creativity for the external design
decorating his invention with several
bright stickers
Daihatsu jet car this homemade car is a
rather unusual modification at the urban
Daihatsu mirror car the original model
comes with many options and variants of
the chassis and has an engine with a
capacity of 850 cubic centimetres whose
power does not exceed 70 horsepower
these features probably didn't please
the creator of the new version of the
car who decided to improve the Daihatsu
mirror for this the inventor installed a
huge an incredibly powerful jet engine
which allows the car to reach a high
speed in a matter of seconds with this
engine the vehicle can even participate
in amateur races in addition the sound
of the modified Daihatsu mirror is
similar to that of an airplane
in the jet a1 terminates a channel you
can find a lot of different videos where
you can see this car and its engine in
action fire force 5 another vehicle with
an incredibly powerful engine is this
dragster this car was specifically
created to compete in 402 meters
straight races from scratch fire force 5
is equipped with the jet engine which
allows it to reach an incredible speed
of 496 km/h in just 5 seconds the pratt
&amp;amp; whitney j 60 engine has been donated
by the Sikorsky s-64 skycrane helicopter
which gives you an idea of how powerful
this vehicle is the fire force 5 racing
car weighs 544 kilograms and is 7 meters
long it's also worth noting the length
of the fire escape which at maximum
speed is just over 3 meters
interestingly for one race this dragster
spends a hundred and twenty seven litres
of fuel
buggy this small lightweight vehicle
stands out for its high throughput in
all areas the inventor had the idea to
create a buggy quite some time ago and
together with his friend they've created
a car similar to the Ariel Atom his
original maximum speed is 225 kilometers
per hour in order to reach this speed
the man installed an engine that allows
the buggy to accelerate remarkably
however the engine has a capacity of
less than a hundred horsepower so the
cars top speed and acceleration are not
the best by the way in the Zen TV
channel you can find many of these
inventions and other interesting devices
boat bike to conventional surfboards an
extended home bike and various
mechanisms and elements were used to
create this vehicle giving the design
its final look the bike has special
elements that attach the metal base to
the surfboards this vehicle can be used
for land transportation and to travel on
the surface of the water in both cases
the boat bike is powered by the pedals
which both passengers must turn a small
additional motor allows the device to
reach speeds of up to 15 kilometers per
hour
hoverboard several years ago Canadian
inventor Castle and Alexandra Dori
created a homemade hover board at that
time the flying vehicle could cover a
distance of two hundred and seventy five
point eight meters as a noun stood at
about five meters above lake oro back
the man worked on the creation of the
device for over two years and according
to the author this vehicle can be used
for any purpose and will be able to
reach any height with various
modifications in the future the
hoverboard is powered by an electric
motor with a total power approximately
40 horsepower and eight propellers by
the way the charge of the lithium-ion
batteries is only enough for minutes and
a half of flight time castle and
alexandria Durer created the company on
the hoverboards which will soon launch a
new generation of hoverboards
kayak this transparent kayak made of
spruce branches and plastic is an
unusual and ingenious homemade invention
the main idea of this device is to show
how in an emergency situation any toys
can pick up the branches of a tree and
wrap it in stretch film the weight of
this kayak does not exceed four
kilograms the homemade vehicle has
absolutely water proof and in no way
inferior to a professional kayak to
create this boat you don't need more
than a day's work in addition if the
conditions allow it through the kayak
you can observe the underwater life of
the reservoir this invention comes in
two versions in addition you can control
the transparent kayak alone or with a
partner to do this you only need to make
the necessary number of cuts in the
middle of the kayak exhaust pipes this
Ford Mustang is equipped with two
exhaust pipes made of cardboard these
devices reduce the sound of the six
cylinder engine installed in the Mustang
dampening noise and allowing the exhaust
gases to escape more productively in
this video you can hear the result of
this home modification
