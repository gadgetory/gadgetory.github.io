technique where the driver over steers
while driving the car through the
entirety of a corner at maximum speed
most people associate drifting with cars
but it is also possible to do it on a
bicycle the main thing is to equip the
bicycle properly for example with the X
20 wheel from the company BMX streamer
it can be used to replace the rear wheel
and tire of any BMX bicycle with 20-inch

is the moving elements around it they
allow the wheel to slide and move at the

Mavic UST tubeless road tires are
nothing new
however they are becoming more and more
popular everyday and manufacturers are
striving to modernize their designs the
UST is a wheel and tire system developed
by specialists from the French company
Mavic they managed to create their own
shoe bus construction tubeless tires are
usually too tight or too loose on the
rim and it's almost impossible to pump
them this is due to the fact that wheel
manufacturers and tyre manufacturers do
not usually work together to create a
good product but Mavic designed the tire
at the same time as the wheel to achieve
an optimal fit the difference in size
between them is only a few millimeters
that's why the process of mounting the
tire on the wheel is so simple and fast
the risk of the tire popping off the rim
at high pressure is minimal no special
tools such as a tire iron are needed for
installation the pumping is just done
