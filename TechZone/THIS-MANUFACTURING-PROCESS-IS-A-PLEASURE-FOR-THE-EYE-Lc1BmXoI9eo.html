I'm gonna be the voice in today's video
thanks for your understanding
wooden balls this modern equipment makes
it possible to manufacture wood products
of different shapes and sizes wooden
balls such as those seen on the screen
are normally created with special
milling machines the design allows the
cutting blade to remain fixed while the
additional unit rotates the wooden
workpiece which must be cylindrical
notice that the ball has the correct
shape thanks to the choice of a
workpiece with the same height and width
it should be noted that wood such as
linden pine and ochre walnuts are the
most suitable for this type of work the
balls can be used in many ways for
example they can be a standalone
decoration or used to decorate furniture
the equipment you see on the screen is
much more efficient and modern than
standard lathes they allow wood to be
shaped in minutes minimizing human
efforts and leaving no room for error
- blazer cutting on the screen we see
equipment produced by the German company
Trump specifically this model of -
blazer cutting machine is called true
laser tube 7000 it can be used to
process a wide variety of parts the
processing of structural steel tubes and
section is fast and precise pay
attention to the complex operation of
the laser and the roller that moves the
metal workpiece to achieve the goal they
move synchronously allowing the device
to cut the metal at an angle and create
a variety of holes and cuts
it should be noted that the stepped
rollers which support the tube and act
as side rails can be adjusted in width
this means that the metal part can be
almost any size the automatic centering
of the clamping heads ensures maximum
precision
they place and hold the tubes without
damaging their surface and special
sensors ensure that the workpiece does
not move sideways as this can affect the
quality of the finished product
metal heat-treatment to increase the
strength of metal parts in industry a
heat treatment known as hardening is
used during this treatment the metal or
it's alloys are heated above the
critical point it is the temperature at
which the materials crystalline network
changes immediately after the metal has
been heated it is quickly cooled using
oil or as in this case water
interestingly there are other ways to
quickly cool the metal for example with
a jet of compressed air water mist or by
immersion and liquid polymer hardening
compound
it should be noted that although the
metal hardens during the hardening
process it also acquires other
characteristics the heat treatment makes
the material more fragile less ductile
and less viscous these characteristics
increase with each new hardening to
reduce brittleness and increase
ductility after hardening a process
known as tempering is used it is also a
heat treatment the part is heated to a
hundred and fifty to two hundred and
sixty degrees to three hundred and
seventy to six hundred and fifty degrees
Celsius and then slowly cooled
the video shows the hardening and
tempering of car parts
wallpaper production interestingly
wallpaper production technology has not
changed much in recent decades the only
changes are in the machines that do the
work a hundred and fifty years ago a
workshop could only produce three rolls
a day but today's production facilities
allow the production of hundreds of
rolls the material from which the
wallpaper is made depend some of the
manufacturer wants to achieve in the end
the product can be very different made
of paper vinyl and fabric surfaces in
addition there are metal and even cork
wallpapers for the traditional wallpaper
paper with small fibers is chosen this
structure increases the density of the
material and prevents it from wrinkling
and stretching during glue application
if the wallpaper is stamped on the
surface it is clear that first you have
to come up with the pattern that's what
designers and artists do once the
pattern is designed and approved it is
sent to the workshop where the special
printing equipment is used it is a
roller with an engraved pattern it
should be noted that the paper for
printing the wallpaper must be very
strong since the ink of different colors
is applied in several layers each time a
new color is applied the entire surface
passes through the roller once the
drawing is applied other equipment
performs the stamping this means that
the image on a fabric is squeezed to
create a textured surface another way to
get relief is to coat the surface with a
special acrylic foam paint this
substance makes it possible to create a
three-dimensional image for the creation
of washable wallpaper another step is
added to the production coating the
surface with a protective layer of latex
croissant production a wide variety of
industrial machines such as
interchangeable belts rollers and spin
blocks make it possible to produce
confectionery products such as
croissants quickly and in large
quantities first in the industrial mixer
the dough made of sifted flour melted
margarine yeast mixture salt and water
is mixed the mixers have two modes fast
and slow the automatic weighing
equipment then divides the dough into
pieces of 5 to 7 kilograms then the most
technologically complicated process is
carried out the creation of the layers
of the dough
the thickness of the dough must not
exceed three millimeters as a result of
the operation of the dough flattening
the folding of the dough has also
carried out with these machines the
layered dough is cooled from plus five
to negative five degrees Celsius the
layer is then cut into triangular layers
which are rolled into almost finished
croissants by means of a molding machine
using a special conveyor the products
are transferred to a special chamber
where the humidity is maintained at 75%
and the temperature at around 30 degrees
Celsius only after one hour of
maturation in such conditions are they
baked usually the products are brought
to the oven at a temperature of a
hundred and eighty degrees for about 20
minutes in this case we see the
production of filled croissants so after
cooling the equipment perforates each
product in several places and fills it
with chocolate all that remains is to
package croissants
shaped chocolate production chocolate
products regardless of their final shape
are made in approximately the same way
first the prepared and melted chocolate
is poured into the molds then special
machines rotate the molds this process
is necessary to ensure that the
chocolate is distributed evenly over the
walls of the mold and during the same
process the chocolate is cooled in fact
this is where the manufacturing ends on
the screen you can see how the chocolate
bunnies are prepared the Lindt Factory
before sending the product to the
packaging a specialist carries out a
random check on a single product he or
she checks whether the chocolate is
evenly distributed and even listens to
the sound of the products when cracking
when the test is passed the bunnies are
wrapped in aluminum foil all that's left
is to put collars with bells around
their necks it should be noted that all
these processes can also be done
manually but more time is needed at the
kernel factory to make striped chocolate
eggs the molds are first covered with a
jet of milk chocolate then the white
chocolate is poured into the mold and
all the processes described above are
carried out
hey stop being lazy it's time to use
that brain eels welcome to brain time
incredible facts from the past the
present and even the future the power of
nature and wild animals amazing facts
and unsolved mysteries you'll find all
this and much more hair subscribe now
you won't regret it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
