are more eco-friendly and
technologically advanced alternatives to
conventional building materials today
for example we'd like to start our video
showing you an unusual roof covering
which was chosen for this project
composite tiles are actually just an
imitation of ordinary tiles but they are
better in terms of technology and
quality first of all it weighs less a
square meter of natural roof tiles
weighs from 40 to 60 kilograms while a
square meter of composite tiles weighs
between 6 and 7 kilograms
we'd also like to highlight the high
strength of the material thanks to a
special fixing method it can withstand
even significant wind loads another
advantage is the increased resistance to
temperature fluctuations and lack of
electrical conductivity all these
amazing qualities have been achieved
thanks to the unique multi layers the
base of such tiles is a thin sheet of
Steel the top layer of al use ink alloy
guarantees corrosion resistance next
comes a layer of acrylic primer and
acrylic resin the rough texture which
you probably have noticed is a layer of
stone granular covered with colorless
acrylic varnish composite tiles are
produced in profiled panels they're easy
to install thanks to their size all
panels have special fastenings for
reliable inter connection with each
other the sheets are overlapped to
prevent water leakage they are fastened
to the grid with special nails that
allows several sheets to be attached
simultaneously
sack wheat flow coat the material you
see on the screen now is used to renew
concrete surfaces making them look more
attractive it is a polymer modified
substance it comes in bags and it's
ready to be used all you have to do to
get started is add some clean water flow
coats can be used to repair walkways
patios and driveways it's noteworthy
that the entire process is simple and
consists of just a few steps first dust
dirt paint and oils are removed from the
surface
next the solution is mix using an a21
powder to water ratio
the result is a thick viscous mixture
that's placed in pits cracks potholes
and other defects with a standard trowel
the master uses a spatula for leveling
then the solution is diluted again but
now it has to be more liquid the
substance is poured onto the surface and
then evenly distributed the result is a
perfectly smooth surface with no defects
thus a Creek flow Coates has self
leveling prophesies so it levels itself
with minimal human intervention
clean decks Hercules 650 the tool we'd
like to show you now is an efficient
grinding machine the fact is that today
floors are made of complex materials
such as marble slabs stone porcelain
stoneware and even concrete's are
becoming increasingly popular in order
for the coating to have high quality and
look aesthetically pleasing it must be
properly prepared and it is here that
the Hercules 650 from the Italian
company clean decks comes in handy the
video shows how this grinder handles
concrete floors however it can also be
used for grinding leveling and polishing
granite marble stone and other similar
materials another useful function is to
remove paint blue and old coatings from
any surface with its help the concrete
is level and irregularities and bumps
are removed the machine copes for these
tasks thanks to three heads rotating in
opposite directions each of them is
equipped with the diamond grinding disc
the working width as the name suggests
is 650 millimetres
be honest Stormbreaker here we have a
system that's according to its
developers is the world leader among
products created to absorb water from
precipitation it's designed to be used
in areas with frequent rains the system
accumulates rainwater and allows it to
slowly dissipate along natural drainage
routes Stormbreaker can be used in
undeveloped areas with high or low
traffic using a special design there are
many configuration options - the system
can be laid out in layers up to 12
metres in the ground
Stormbreaker is installed on the ground
in several layers for demonstration
purposes it's usually installed in
special pre dug and prepared trenches
the Stormbreaker consists of lightweight
compact elements that are connected to
each other to form a grid of the desired
size it's noteworthy that the elements
are designed in such a way that the
workers don't need special tools to
install or connect them as you can see
Stormbreaker panels can be stacked on
top of each other this is definitely an
advantage as the system takes up less
space during transport
also the system withstands enormous
loads in the video you can see the tests
made with an 18-ton fire truck
hydro demolition equipment the water
directed at the surface under really
high pressure has the same cutting power
as all the best and most powerful soars
this property was noticed quite a long
time ago which is why today hydro
demolition equipment is often used on
construction sites
this term means selectively removing
damaged concrete with high-pressure
water machines like the one you see on
the screen are in demand when repairing
bridges overpasses dams tunnels and
other concrete structures this equipment
was developed by aqua jet systems the
company offers a huge number of
different models we've chosen the most
interesting one for you this machine is
the ergo go it's a compact cutter
designed for small and medium sized
companies it is mobile and the whole
system fits in two boxes
concrete floors Prosecco consolidate the
last thing we'll show you today is an
amazing combination of well coordinated
work and well chosen building materials
the results of many hours of work is
strikingly beautiful and unusual
concrete floors the materials used in
the process you see on the screen are
part of the consolidate theories from
Prosecco first the craftsman prepared
the floor by the way this equipment is
similar to the grinding machine we
showed you before the builders treat the
surface with abrasives in order to
achieve smoothness a layer of color hard
solution is applied to the finished
surface and it performs two functions at
the same time colouring and compacting
this stage can be fast enough but the
workers on the video consciously
complicate the tasks to achieve a more
appealing result the concrete floor will
be painted in several colors in order to
ensure the pattern is nice and tidy
each color zone is covered with a film
the composition is first sprayed on the
spreading brush and then on the surface
itself the color is distributed using
the same brush a total of 10 different
colors were used after the painters
dried the surface is polished again
after that a protective coating is
applied on top in this case
guard axed it's a sealant that makes the
surface shiny and protects it from
damage</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
