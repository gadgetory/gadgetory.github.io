combines the best features of sport
motorcycles with those of a flying
quadricycle according to the creators
this makes the process of flying as easy
and approachable as the process of
riding a bicycle instead of wheels this
flying motorcycle has a special traction
that generates the effect of an air
pillow the features of this high-tech
device allowed it to be used by
professional pilots or beginners as
scorpion three can be controlled in
manual or automatic mode the vehicle has
been developed based on motorcycle
frames which have been transformed to
ensure greater mobility and
maneuverability the creators of this
flying device also took care of the
safety system which has modern height
and speed controls scorpion 3 is the
company's second and latest prototype
according to the calculations the
maximum speed of this means of air
transport is 60 miles per hour battery
charging allows you to fly for 30
minutes straight it is unknown at the
moments in which areas this vehicle will
be used but its creators see it as the
basis for the development of future
transport systems it also started
talking about the creation of flying
taxis another area in which they can be
used is sports the flying device is
currently under development
Kittyhawk flyer this prototype of a
flying vehicle was presented in April
2017 and aims to make the dream of
individual flights come true on the
outside the vehicle resembles a giant
drone capable of carrying one person
according to its creators the flying
device is easy to use and you can learn
to drive it in a few minutes
in addition this electrical device is
large enough to fit into a garage and
because Kittyhawk flyer is an ultra
lightweight means it transports you
don't need a special license to drive it
the vertical takeoff and landing system
also ensures that the vehicle can take
off in small areas making it even more
comfortable to use the aim of the
creators is to develop a simple and
practical vehicle which anyone can enjoy
this vehicle will go on sale this year
method 1 this robotic exoskeleton was
created by the Korean company Korea
future technology the 13 foot high giant
weighs one and a half tonnes supports
large weights has to mobile manipulators
in the shape of human fingers and a wide
range of motor functions the device can
be controlled by the operator seated and
protected by a shielded capsule or
remotely in the first case the
exoskeletons hands imitate the movements
of the user significantly increasing the
robots precision the most interesting
thing is that Bulgarian 3d artist vitaly
bobrov
participated in the project he's worked
on models for movies such as
transformers for terminator genisys and
game trailers such as Starcraft 2 and
World of Warcraft for now the robot is
taking its first steps and must be
significantly improved say the creators
however they are optimistic and consider
method 1 to be a project with a great
future in terms of mechanics and
computer science the possible areas in
which this robot can be used are
underwater and space research and
construction and rescue work among
others for now it's not known whether
the robot will ever be sold to the
general public
EPOC plus on the outside
this device resembles a futuristic
headset but its features make it much
more so than that this gadget is a
scanner that can record the user's brain
activity the collected data is sent to
the users computer and can be used to
control games some devices and
applications epoch Plus is a compact
wireless device with a battery that
guarantees 12 hours of continuous
operation the gadget works by recording
the electrical activity of the outer
layers of the brain with a series of
special sensors the device is simple to
use although the technology behind epoch
plus is quite complicated
it this is because the human brain
signals are unique to each person and
cannot be interpreted categorically the
creators have done a great job in
interpreting the signals of the brain
and increasing man's knowledge in this
field and they will continue to work on
this AI optic in 2014 after two years of
experimentation the American company in
ER Vega showed its peculiar invention
these are contact lenses equipped with
augmented reality technology unlike
virtual glasses such as Google glass
this device ideally combines real-life
and virtual images in reality these are
micro screens that display the necessary
information to the user in addition to
the contact lenses eye optic users
projector glasses the lenses are the
display in which two miniature
projection devices located on the
glasses reflect the digital image the
information first passes through the
central filter and then focuses on the
retina information about the real world
is analyzed through external or
peripheral lens filters the entire image
therefore is generated in the retina of
the eye it's worth noting that these
lenses allow the user to focus on
distant and near objects at the same
time something impossible to do on other
devices in addition eye optics special
technology improves vision giving the
user the ability to clearly see close
and distant objects the creators of the
device have developed a powerful
everyday mechanism that can be used in
all kinds of situations driving a
vehicle exercising playing games or
watching movies the device is currently
under development and is being adapted
to work with Android devices and has not
started to be mass-produced
the Kingsmen umbrella gun this
incredible device was created developed
and shown for the first time on the
channel the hack Smith famous to making
realistic copies of different devices
used by superheroes the Canadian
inventor and author of that channel has
developed a dozen different devices
including Wolverines claws Captain
America shield and other Batman owned
gadgets in addition to the Marvel and DC
films hack Smith has drawn inspiration
from other films in this case Kingsman
according to the inventor the 20th
Century Fox Company proposed him to
create a functional analog of the secret
agents umbrella that dazzled everyone in
Kingsman to make the idea of the film a
reality the Creator used an ultra
resistant umbrella capable of breaking
different objects such as visors or
small household appliances without
losing its shape
the device has a trigger that allows the
users to shoot darts and bullets at
short distances it is unfortunately not
bulletproof but it is possible to see
your enemies through the cloth to
achieve this the inner part was painted
white while the tip of the umbrella
which is also the canyon has a small
analog camera the camera then sends the
recorded image to a small projector on
the grip of the device which in turn
projects the image onto the inner
surface of the umbrella
the camera and projector use lithium-ion
batteries which can be recharged if
necessary parts of the elements of this
unusual weapon have been created with 3d
printers while the rest of the materials
are everyday objects sai locks psionic
sword the hack Smith team is also
responsible for the creation of Sai
lakhs katana the weapon of this x-man
character a common katana was used as
the base for this magical weapon and the
handle was equipped with a compact
incendiary element but the main
characteristic of this sword is the
composition of the flammable liquid
specially developed this project thanks
to the combination of different chemical
elements the katana can burn with a
strong purple flame that Rises evenly
throughout the blade the interesting
thing is that the fire doesn't die out
even when you shake the weapon intensely
in order for the fire to burn through
the entire sort the special fuel was
poured into special sheaths in which the
blades were also placed in addition the
burning katana can perform all the
functions of a common sort with this
help you can cut wood brake metal nets
or destroy any obstacles in your path
the creators also gave the sword energy
to repeat the scene of the destruction
of a car in the film x-men Iron Man
rocket launcher unlike other Iron Man
gloves on the market this one does not
have a laser but instead has a powerful
mechanism capable of launching small
missiles like Tony Stark's original suit
it features moving elements that reveal
and raise the projectile
these can be activated by pressing a
button on the middle finger
this same button is used to launch the
missile
in addition the moving elements are
illuminated by LED lights for a better
effect when using it
this invention belongs to the youtuber
gyrus although the glove tests were
carried out together with hack Smith's
team currently its creator is improving
the device according to gyrus he is
working on improving the flight of the
projectiles and the firing mechanism so
that there'll be no problems
