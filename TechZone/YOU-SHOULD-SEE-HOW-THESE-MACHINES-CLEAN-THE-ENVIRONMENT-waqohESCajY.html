harvesters are specially designed for
cutting underwater weeds
reeds and other plants that can clog
water bodies this is necessary because
water is an important resource that's
the abundance of aquatic plants can
complicate the access to it in many
countries in addition plants make it
difficult to use small boats or fish and
pumps or other equipment covered with
grass can cause an accident this problem
can be solved using aquatic combines
which work just like those used on land
during harvesting the weeds collected
can then be used as biofuels
ocean cleanup every year more than 320
million tons of plastic is produced in
the world and about 10 million tons of
plastic waste gets into canals rivers
seas and oceans their density is usually
less than the density of water so the
trash keeps floating on the surface or
slightly below it for a long time
more than 95 percent of this waste is
washed back to shore
and can be collected from land however a
significant part of the plastic waste is
taken into the Centers of the oceans by
currents where these so-called garbage
patches are formed to solve the problem
the Dutch company the ocean cleanup has
launched a cleaning system for the
Pacific Ocean it's a floating barrier
about 600 metres long which naturally
becomes u-shaped and goes 2.7 meters
deep underwater
the system will capture plastic waste
from the surface of the ocean using
currents and waves the garbage
accumulated in the barrier will be
transported by special ships to land at
the disposal one barrier will be able to
extract five thousand tons of garbage
per month from the ocean in the future
the developers expect to launch another
sixty traps thus in five years the
company plans to remove 50 percent of
waste and by 2040 ninety percent the
cost of one barrier is twenty five
million dollars this price includes both
the cost of its direct production and
subsequent monitoring maintenance the
first test of the waste trap took place
on September the 8th 2018 and its
results were satisfactory
Sandman TT Sandman TT is the smallest
sound cleaner by barba it uses a special
vibrating screen to lift sand and sift
it the trash raised where the sand moves
through the sieve and then gets into the
bucket and the sand falls back to the
beach the performance of the sand fancy
sea can reach six thousand square meters
per hour
note that the bucket can be empty by
hydraulics this is a great solution for
small and medium beaches to remove
garbage such as shells stones cigarette
butts twigs and bottle caps in addition
the efficient and compact sand sifters
Sandman tte can be used for sifting soil
and maintaining the arena for horses
tracks ball fields and removing litter
and debris using various sifters with
five or twenty millimeter holes it
equally successfully removes stones
grass broken glass and other garbage the
total cleaning width of the Sandman TT
is a hundred and fourteen centimeters
and the depth of the lifted sand is
eleven and a half centimeters the total
weight of the device is a hundred and
forty kilograms
Sandman CDC works in conjunction with
the tractor
Bobcats and cleaner this sand cleaner is
suitable for Bobcat tracked mini loaders
the attachments are designs for use on
both dry and wet sand the device allows
the operator of the mini loader to
quickly and efficiently sift sand and
clean it from various small debris like
bottle caps glass fragments wood as well
as cans stones plastic bags and algae
the working width of the equipment is
nineteen hundred millimeters and the
depth reaches two hundred millimeters
and the bucket capacity is 350 liters
the cleaning area can reach 15,000
square meters per hour
my productivity is complemented by the
possibility of unloading from a height
own means of lifting levers on the
loader which makes it easy to dump the
collected garbage into the dump truck
x1 50 skimmer the main purpose of this
device is to eliminate oil emissions in
the world ocean collecting it on open
water or near the coast with 10 built-in
desks the X 150 has high throughput and
can collect up to a hundred and fifty
cubic meters of oil per hour the X 150
works both in stationary mode and while
moving the machine can be towed through
the water at a speed exceeding the speed
of the X 150 analogues without impairing
the results
see bimproject a Spanish startup has
developed the automated garbage cans see
bin which is able to collect floating
waste oil fuel and chemicals in a
special bag made of an eco-friendly
fiber the device can be used in port
docks private reservoirs lakes and
waterways as well as attached to
equipped yachts and motor ships wind
severe storms and ocean currents
constantly move floating garbage
thus in each port dock or Yacht Club
there are particularly contaminated
areas these are the most appropriate
places to start the water purification
process according to the authors of the
project Sieben is a revolution in ocean
purification technologies it will help
to create more clean moments with
thriving marine life the principle of
operation of the device is quite simple
see been consists of two main parts the
first is a floating container directly
in the water with a permeable bag made
of natural material for waste collection
the second part is the docking station
the water pump which is located on the
dock or Shore the water pump connected
to a floating container by means of the
pipe creates a certain pressure by
pumping water into the container
different waste gets into it with the
water and stays there
then after passing through the water
pump with a filter inside to separate
oil and various oil pollution the
purified water is ejected back into the
harbor once filled the container must be
released by removing the bag and
cleaning it but even if the bag is full
the seabed continues to run and pump
water keeping the trash near the
container it should be noted that one of
the advantages of the project is the
possibility of using the device 24 hours
a day seven days a week 365 days a year
the manufacturers claim that only one
person is needed to maintain its
operation
waste shark to combat pollution in the
ocean the company ran marinas developed
and manufactured a floating robots known
as the waste shark this robot can work
near harbours and other places
collecting and absorbing trash before it
gets into the ocean waste shark is a
small catamaran with an electric drive
between the pontoons at the catamaran is
a scoop which is used to collect
floating garbage after being collected
the waste falls into the inner
compartments of the waste chart
in addition to collecting garbage the
way shark robot uses sensors to monitor
water quality measure temperature
meteorological conditions and transmits
all this data in real time
the robot can use some of the collected
data for its own purposes correcting the
roots of movement depending on weather
conditions currents and the like</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
