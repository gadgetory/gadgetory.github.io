Navy RP flip despite its
resemblance to a ship this vehicle is
not an autonomous craft and therefore
cannot move by itself its main purpose
is to carry out Oceania graphic research
flip does not have its own energy base
which could become an interference
source for the vessels measuring in
transport equipment so it moves with the
help of a tugboats externally the device
is a kind of hybrid between a boat and a
submarine on the bow there is a classic
carcass with an ad on a long ladder and
rows of cranes the length of the
compliments is 50 to 55 feet and the
length of the boat up to the stern is 90
feet the hull of the flipped spacecraft
is cylindrical similar to a submarine
casing inside this sectioned housing
other compartments for research
equipment as well as 10 water tanks it's
worth noting that the name of the flip
boat itself is an acronym for floating
instrument platform at the same time in
addition to being an abbreviation
flipped means jump as the ship is
partially capable of sinking turning 90
degrees and leaving only 55 feet above
the surface since flip investigations
last several weeks in order to
facilitate the cruise work the ship has
been planned in such a way that it's
possible to enjoy the stay in any
position at different times on the ship
studies have been carried out on the
propagation of seismic waves in the
ocean the interaction of different water
layers the exchange of heat between the
thickness of the water and the surface
and many others
tanco a 200 according to the creators
there's individual packet of hay bales
is fully automatic and autonomous the
machine can be connected to a tractor or
be operated with a power supply the main
function of this device is to prepare
the bales of hay for long-term storage
or transport the most important thing is
that the use with the help of an energy
source which can be installed on the
machine avoids the need for a second
tractor during the process the operator
can organize the packages or prepare
more the remote control system allows
the operator to be located 165 feet or
50 meters away from the device without
losing the signal
screw propelled vehicle this unusual car
created by a Russian SUV Factory is an
all-terrain vehicle that moves thanks to
a rotary screw motor the motor uses two
Archimedes screws prepared with a
resistance and anti corrosive material
the SUV is the unique ability to pass
through marshy terrain snow or ice and
is perfect for moving in the water
without sinking to great depths this
all-terrain vehicle shouldn't be used
within urban areas as the huge bolts are
not meant to move over asphalt or
concrete it's worth noting that the SUV
is very harmful to the environment
destroying the soil and killing plants
so it's used only in extreme cases for
example in rescue work in places of
difficult access the average speed of
this off-road vehicle is 6 miles per
hour
TCM 60 the Swiss firm mateesah which
since 1945 has been considered the best
in the field of railroad machining
specializes in the creation of machines
for the construction maintenance and
repair of railway tracks among other
devices produced by the company is the
TCM 60 train for track installation the
main characteristic of this device for
the construction of railway tracks is
it's complete continuous work this
apparatus is self-contained and can
perform lifting and installation of
rails and sleepers without additional
machines its universality makes the work
easier and faster as it decreases human
participation in the process another
important feature is that the machine
can transport its own materials this
prevents the use of additional machinery
when building railway tracks
vityaz a road is not required to ride in
this vehicle as it has a high passing
capacity even in difficult weather
conditions and our land with a minimum
level of grip for example pity asses no
problem walking through swamps
snow-covered terrain impassable roads or
forests the temperature spectrum in
which the vehicle can work with
normality ranges from minus 52 plus 40
degrees Celsius Matias is not afraid of
the water and when swimming it can reach
a speed of 4 miles per hour besides
being able to get in and out of the
water regardless of the state of the
shore or the hardness of the bottom the
vehicle can overcome obstacles up to 5
feet or the creator's claim that it's
the world's largest crawl attract
vehicle with the world's highest
throughput capacity as it can move on a
single crawler track traction in
addition the TR stands out for its high
maneuverability despite weighing 29 tons
on the ground the vehicle can move at a
speed of 22 miles per hour even when
carrying a load greater than its own
weight BRDM 2 the main characteristic of
this armored vehicle is it's incredible
passing capacity the wheels have a
pressure regulation system that allows
them to change their position when
they're still all moving in addition to
the four-wheel drive chassis the central
part of the vehicle has a special
movable wheel that allows it to overcome
enormous gaps or trenches before the
obstacle is overcome the wheels are
lowered and once the obstacle has been
overcome they're lifted using four
hydraulics suspensions the 10 millimeter
thick shielding provides protection
against gunfire splinters and small
caliber mines in addition the armored
vehicle has a hydro Jess on the front
that allows it to reach a speed of 6
miles per hour in the water in the
control area you can find observation
instruments a radio station a navigation
device and seating for the commander and
the driver in the combat zone there's a
machine-gun military instruments and the
hydraulic suspension for the additional
wheels the BRDM 2 crew includes a driver
mechanic a commander and two
intelligence soldiers one responsible
for the use of the machine gun currently
intelligence divisions in more than 50
countries use this armored vehicle
the Toyo tires ferret according to the
developers this vehicles capable of
withstanding any conditions and is ideal
for driving in forests deserts and even
across rivers the creators of the
armored car used a 1959 British
intelligence car as a base and decided
to modify it are the rare of the car
they installed a powerful engine and
equipped the vehicle with large wheels
and special tires designed for all
terrains these tires are characterized
by increased mobility and optimum
reliability and also have an attractive
aggressive design hydraulic motors
controlled from the inside drive two of
them instead of a machine gun a device
with a hook attached to the cable of the
winch was installed in addition the
vehicle is equipped with reinforced
shock absorbers the special suspension
allows this improved armored car to
easily cross any serene and overcome any
obstacle paddleboat here we have the
prototype of a new amphibious assault
vehicle a caterpillar vehicle with an
original design all of the machines main
units are located inside the bodywork in
the front we find a crew cabin with all
the necessary equipment crawler tracks
are located on the sides of the vehicle
these have special blocks of porous
material which increases the flows
ability of this vehicle the original
caterpillars allow the amphibious
vehicles are literally walk on water
although the car is still slower than
amphibious speedboats it is
significantly ahead of them in its
ability to overcome any terrain
after all if necessary this invention
may even pass over a wall 10 feet high
in addition the vehicle can carry up to
200 tons of cargo
m3 amphibious rig this German amphibious
car is designed to transport tanks and
other vehicles across water barriers
when entering the water the amphibian
can be transformed automatically with
the help of a floating system and a
hydraulic crane therefore if necessary
it can serve as a bridge or a floating
ferry which can carry heavy armored
vehicles weighing up to 64 tonnes the
main loading parts of the m3 amphibian
are made of aluminium in its main part
that's a cab
a hydraulic crane and a control pole in
addition the design features a four
stroke eight cylinder 360 horsepower
diesel engine allowing it to travel over
land at a speed of 50 miles per hour and
by water at speeds of up to 12 miles per
hour the machine has two large folding
aluminium mechanisms to increase
buoyancy in the water in addition this
technical device is equipped with an
armored cabin and air conditioning
system and a number of other
improvements in addition to Germany
Singapore Taiwan Brazil and the British
engineering forces are successfully
using these amphibians
form trackway for ordinary off-road
vehicles wetlands can be too hard a test
for not for this automobile this unique
rescue truck can create a path for
itself and others if necessary the car
carries an aluminium Road coil which is
located in the back of the truck to
start building a temporary road the
driver must deploy the forklift activate
a special cylinder like mechanism and
engage the rear gear after these actions
the temporary path will be installed
following the principle of a carpet
track when the roadway is in the right
place other vehicles will be able to
move along roads that were previously
impossible the new road reaches a
hundred and sixty five feet in length
and supports cars weighing up to 70 tons
when all traffic has crossed the site
the truck can pick up the temporary road
and continue its journey it should be
noted that this truck could operate even
in partially flooded areas making it an
ideal vehicle to operate in areas of
natural disasters such as floods and
landslides today the car is already in
use in more than 30 different
departments around the world guys it's
