developed a very accurate copy of the
pokeball from the legendary anime
Pokemon pokeball plus is an accessory
designed for the Nintendo switch it can
be used to navigate menus explore the
Pokemon world and for Pokemon fights the
toys supports motion control it allows
you to immerse yourself more deeply in
the virtual world when a wild Pokemon
appears the player throws the pokeball
and tries to catch the Pokemon by
imitating throwing the pokeball when you

light up and vibrate in your hand and
you'll even hear the Pokemon let out its
unique cry as if it were really inside
the pokeball in addition the toy allows
you to search for Pokemon without
looking at your smartphone screen when a
creature is nearby the pokeball starts
glowing you can buy it for $50
chalk draws drawing on the pavement or a
blackboard with chalk is a simple and
interesting activity most people used to
do it when they were kids and when
you're drawing you have to use your
imagination
however kids quickly lost interest
because after all it's just chalk to
extend the hours at pleasure
Nickolas pencil has developed a new form
of chalk these are three unique toys
that greatly enhance creative
opportunities each of them is designed
to create geometrically accurate
drawings the first chalk makes dots on
the surface with the help of the second
chalk you can draw circles and the third
one is designed for drawing smooth
parallel lines interestingly chalk
drawers are not just toys music teachers
can use them for their classes you can
use it to draw notes on a board much
easier and faster one piece of chalk
costs $16
time for machine the construction set
you see on the screen is a
revolutionising toy it was created by
the ukrainian designer denis aquaman Co
all the details are made of metal each
model is assembled from a lots of small
carefully worked-out details the results
is a working mechanical device the car
can ride and its wheels respond to the
steering wheel movements the mechanical
spring makes the assembly train move on
Rails the propellers of the plane rotate
and the tank can overcome any obstacle
amazingly you can even assemble a real
watch using this construction set these
heavy shiny and very beautiful models
will please both adults and teenagers
the manufacturer offers nine different
designs with the price ranging from 18
to a hundred and twelve dollars payload
toy modern manufacturers work hard to
create increasingly complex and amazing
toys however complexity and
sophistication are not always good
payloads toy has a simple appearance and
it doesn't have an intricate design
however the toy will keep you busy and
will allow you to kill time when you
have nothing else to do halo toy is a
couple of pretty significant features
first the toy develops fine motor skills
secondly it has a relaxing effect and
reduces your stress level
in addition when you don't have time to
play payloads hoy can be a fashion
accessory so you can hang the chain
around your neck and the ring will look
like a unique pendant so if you want to
have fun you don't have to go through
your bag or pockets looking for the toy
the ring and the chain are made of
stainless steel the manufacturer offers
three models covered with silver regular
gold or pink gold they cost 50 55 and 58
dollars respectively
trick-or-treat perhaps the most
versatile games that can be enjoyed by
both children and adults and even
together are for word games that's
exactly what you can see on the screen
right now trick-or-treat is somewhat
similar to the famous game Jenga in that
game players take turns pulling blocks
out of a tower until it falls apart the
one who makes the tower falls losses in
trick or tree the blocks are not removed
but added instead until one side
outweighs the other and the structure
falls apart the player who breaks the
construction loses the toy is completely
made of wood blocks can be attached to a
pole as well as to each other using
powerful magnets
note that the blocks have different
shapes and sizes they may have skewed
edges to all this complicates the game
and makes it more interesting
before each move each player draws a car
telling them the shape of the next block
that must be added so the elements of
chance adds fun to the game to
trick-or-treat can also help small kids
remembering the names of appearances of
geometric shapes the cost of the set
which includes 24 wooden blocks is $74
Mesmer globe the modern market offers a
fairly large number of amazing and
beautiful kinetic toys and of course all
of them make you think about the physics
behind the toy the products that you can
see on the screen is one of them the
mesma globe looks like an ordinary metal
bowl with a spiral stripe on its surface
thanks to the position of this line
it creates an optical illusion when the
ball is spinning it is very very
difficult to take your eyes off it
Mesmer globe costs $30
kendama we have already mentioned that
oi doesn't need to have thousands of
complicated details to give you tens or
even hundreds of hours of entertainment
kendama is another example of that it's
a traditional Japanese toy with hundreds
of years of history it is believed it
was invented in the late 17th and early
18th centuries the design is
ridiculously simple a ball with an
opening inside is attached to a wooden
handle with a cord
it's alway works as follows one holds
the toy and plays the ball upward so
that it may land with the hole on the
spike
loaning even this basic trick can keep
you busy for hours as soon as you master
it you can begin to learn new tricks
while having fun with kendama the player
is limited only by their imagination
interestingly there are kendama
associations around the world for
example the Japanese kendama Association
has published a book that lists a
hundred and one tricks some players take
the game to a new level bow and
competing kendama tournaments they are
particularly popular in the US and Japan
a basic toy costs $18 however there are
entire collections by famous brands
their price can reach hundreds of
dollars
ben10 deluxe Omnitrix here is an almost
exact copy of the Benton cartoon watch
which will easily cheer up any child the
model is capable of emitting lights and
producing sound effects it's also
equipped with a motion sensor when the
user moves his or her hand with the
watch the toy makes sounds with the
watch just like in the cartoon you can
call a superhero from the space by
rotating the glowing dial in this case
the toy plays the phrases of the
characters of the series the price of
the watch is $24</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
