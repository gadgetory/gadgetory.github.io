exhibitions are interesting mostly
because they allow visitors to interact
with the exhibits they can be very
diverse - and most of them change their
appearance depending on what the viewer
does for example in 2014 at the
innovators of Olay show an amazing
swimming pool filled with ferromagnetic
fluid which shown in case you don't know
it's a fluid that reacts to a nearby
magnetic field the exhibit was created
by the engineer and artist Eric Nez play
in addition to the ferromagnetic fluid
320 magnets were immersed in the pool
also the exhibit was equipped with a
camera that monitors the movements of
the person standing in front of the pool
thanks to all of these components the
faroe reflection pool was created in
which the liquid follows the movements
of the person in front of it
the exhibit works like this the camera
records the viewers movements and then
transforms them into special data that's
read by the controller it in turn
switches certain magnets on and off when
the magnets activated the ferromagnetic
fluid pushes it to the surface all this
happens with minimal delay so the vos
sees a reflection of their movements at
the port
similar exhibits were created by Israeli
American artist daniel rossen for
example to make this installation
he used 928 fur pom-poms and 464 smaller
motifs the for marrow was also equipped
with a camera that reads the movements
the exhibit was named pom pom mirror and
can be found in the New York bit forms
gallery
another creation of the artist is an
interactive mirror with 450 toy penguins
it's also in the bit palms gallery in
both cases the camera captures the
movements of the person in front of the
device and then send signals to the
computer the information obtained
activates the motors that turn the pom
poms and penguins
developable mechanisms in February of
this year a group of engineers from the
Brigham Young University in the u.s.
reported the discovery of a new class of
mechanical devices it took about ten
years of research to develop this new
class of mechanical devices
the video shows in detail the technology
that allows even complex mechanisms to
be placed in the outer parts of the
structure the main feature is that the
mechanism doesn't occupy the inner space
in other words the mechanism is capable
of taking a three-dimensional form from
a flat configuration without stretching
or tearing such a unique design is the
reason why the new discovery is known as
developable mechanisms during its
development engineers managed to expand
the potential of curved surfaces now
they can transform or rather unfold
perform their unique function and then
return to their original position you
will probably think that something like
this is used in the Ironman costume and
indeed even the engineers who created
the mechanism speak about the similarity
of the technologies this discovery will
give new possibilities to the
development of tools and equipment in
medicine space and military industries
engineers are constantly working to add
more features and functions while
keeping the size of the devices as small
as possible deployable mechanisms will
also allow improving special vehicles
police vehicles for example will be able
to slide out additional wheels
bulletproof barriers and much more
kinetic sculpture this is a relatively
new trend in lighting design today there
are companies engaged in the
installation of kinetic lighting systems
the sculpture you see on the screen
consists of 1000 LED spheres in total
each of them is a plastic white ball
with a diameter of about 80 millimeters
the surveyors are attached to the
motorized blocks with flat cables each
element can change height brightness and
color regardless of what happens to
other elements the system is controlled
by a special program LED spheres can
move in a special way creating complex
architectural shapes and lighting
compositions
concave mirror what you see on the
screen is one of two kinds of spherical
mirrors like any other mirror that can
reflect objects however the main feature
is the form of the surface which looks
like a segment of a sphere
the unique design gives the mirror the
ability to reflect objects in a
different way from what we're used to if
the object is close to the reflective
surface the image has a normal look as
the object moves away the reflection
increases the size of the central points
as you can see the ball occupies the
entire surface of the mirror finally if
the ball moves further away from the
mirror its reflection turns upside down
the same happens to everything that's
beyond the central point thus a concave
mirror can show the same object both the
right way up and upside down
plasma Hourglass plasma balls were first
invented and created in the United
States in the mid-1980s the invention
became the base for the creation of
various beautiful home decorations for
example right now you can see an
hourglass that uses the principle of a
plasma ball inside the glass container
which can be almost anything a central
electrode is placed then the air is
sucked out until a vacuum is formed
inside the next step is to fill the tank
with stable inert gas this can be helium
neon xenon or Krypton the color of the
plasma and the nature of its movement
depend on which gas has been selected
after connecting a high voltage source
the container fills up with an amazingly
beautiful glow
ghost cube-like the engineers of the
developable mechanisms we've already
talked about today the sculptor Eric R
Berg was inspired by Japanese origami to
create the ghost cube it all started
with the development of simple blocks of
two or three cubes at one point when he
joined them together he realized that it
was possible to create amazingly diverse
sculptures that could move fold unfold
expand open and close then he developed
a system called the ghost cube it
consists of separate elements which you
can arrange in any way you want
all the shapes you see on the screen can
be built with this set thus it's like a
kind of bizarre Construction Set you can
buy it for 11 to 86 dollars depending on
the number of elements in the set
circuit marker a few years ago the
Japanese startup AG ICA showed a
revolutionary marker with unique ink for
the first time the main feature is that
they can conduct electricity the video
shows how electrical circuits are
connected by what at first glance looks
like just drawings the conductive marker
a guy see pen allows you to easily and
quickly create a variety of simple and
complex electrical circuits the secrets
of the ink is that its main component is
the tiniest silver particles they're the
ones that conduct the electricity it's
noteworthy that the conductive line can
have a width of at least naught point
four millimeters if the lines thinner
will be too much electrical resistance
interestingly you can recharge your
printer with this ink too in this way
the process of creating electrical
circuits becomes easier they are created
on a computer and then print it out in
seconds by the way to make the scheme's
work you need to use glossy paper it
guarantees the correct absorption of the
conductive dye providing work stability
hey stop being lazy it's time to use
that brain of yours welcome to brain
time incredible facts from the past the
present and even the future the power of
nature and wild animals amazing facts
and unsolved mysteries you'll find all
this and much more hair subscribe now
