and of course people making crystal
figures glass is a transparent hard
material that breaks or scratches easily
however under the influence of high
temperatures it becomes a dense and
flexible mass which can be given a
variety of shapes even odd ones
the art of making glass work by
processing molten glass is called
glassblowing the most common source
material for these figures are glass
granules they're made by processing
common glass in general a temperature of
glass melting varies through 300 to 2500
degrees Celsius the exact temperature
value depends on the chemical
composition of the glass in other words
the presence of various additives a
special furnace is used to convert the
glass into a viscous mass that can
change shape in this case the material
is heated to a temperature of thirteen
hundred and eighty to fourteen hundred
thirty five degrees Celsius the
individual components are then heated on
an open fire for example with a corner
immediately after the glass comes out of
the furnace the master starts processing
you need to work quickly because the
glass last cools rapidly with each
second it becomes more and more solid
to give the glass the desired shape a
variety of tools are used such as
scissors and tweezers and of course the
most famous tool is a special tube for
blowing glass it should be noted that
this work is quite dangerous you have to
work very carefully as the risk of
burning is extremely high
the final stage in the production of
these figures is the fritting the
product is cooled for about ten hours
however the figures are cooled in a
special way the glass is heated to a
temperature of 532 580 degrees Celsius
and then cooled very slowly and evenly
if calling is carried out quickly and
unevenly a residual stress will fall
with the glass over time this will cause
the figure to collapse on its own
kake's can have incredibly different
appearances as there are countless
techniques for decorating a cake for
example the surface of this cake has
been decorated with a composition of
cream flowers each flowers made by hand
and then set in place note that no
special tools are used for the exception
of pastry bags the whole secret lies in
the skill of the hands at the experience
of the pastry chef
in the case of this cake the flowers
also created separately and not directly
on the surface to create them whipped
cream is used dyed with pink blue and
lilac food coloring first a round base
is created for the flower and then one
after the other the elongated in curved
petals are placed the roses in this case
are made with a slightly different
technology the petals grow layer by
layer in circular movements the final
stage of decorating the cake is to frame
the composition with cream leaves and
draw patterns on the sides
to make the surface of the cake smoothly
the create a beautiful mirror layer its
first coated with fondant it's a dense
and flexible substance that's put on the
cake and then the excess edges are cut
sometimes to create the mirror glaze
layer the liquid glaze is poured
directly onto the surface of the cake in
this case the cake is painted with
pastry paint
it may seem that the creation of complex
metal engravings only takes a few
seconds but of course this video is a
bit spent up here we see the work of a
special engraving machine designed to
work with a variety of metals including
precious metals special software greatly
simplifies this job the user only needs
to upload the necessary drawing press a
couple of buttons and the machine starts
working by the way the laser can be used
to engrave not only metal you can also
use glass wood plastic leather and even
various types of fabrics the main
feature of these lasers is the precision
of the cut calculated to the last
millimeter but in addition the laser
while exposing the surface to an
incredibly high temperature does not
leave burns
well now we'll show you a device for
high-speed processing of aluminium and
plastics
it's a digitally controlled milling and
engraving machine with the help of this
equipment the factories perform
mechanical processing creating aluminium
profiles and complex sheet products it's
also capable of 2d and 3d engraving
art has come a long way it's constantly
changing and acquiring new forms that's
why the brush is no longer the main tool
of modern artists here you can see how a
painting is created using ropes the
technique is somewhat similar to fluid
art when acrylic paint is allowed to
flow freely through the canvas creating
whimsical patterns
the paint is mixed in equal proportions
with a special paint conditioner or
float rock this substance improves the
spreading capacity and although
water-based paint is used for these jobs
the conditioner gives similar properties
to oil in addition it increases drying
time which means that more time can be
spent on creating different passes
this technique is quite simple and
offers freedom of imagination on the
canvas covered with paint at a single
color threads are placed previously
dampened with a paint of a different
color then you can improvise for example
by moving them on the canvas in
different directions
leaving unusual traces or as in this
case you can also move the canvas this
creates an even more interesting effect
the only drawback of this painting style
are the drops that eventually cover the
entire table surface however for real
artists this should not be a problem
hey stop being lazy it's time to use
that brain of yours welcome to brain
time incredible facts from the past the
present and even the future the power of
nature and wild animals amazing facts
and unsolved mysteries you'll find all
this and much more hair subscribe now
