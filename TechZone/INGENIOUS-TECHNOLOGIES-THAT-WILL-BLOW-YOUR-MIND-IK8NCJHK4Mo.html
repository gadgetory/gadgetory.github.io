humid climates invariably creates large
deep puddles on roads in particularly
difficult situations the sewer system
can't cope with the flow of water you
have to use special machines to pump the
water this as you know means time and
money not to mention the fact that it's
detrimental for cars to drive through
places with particularly deep puddles a
few years ago British scientist invented
an asphalt cover that could save
humanity from this problem it took more
than a decade of research and
experimentation to create top mix
permeable it's an ultra porous asphalt
that is as strong and durable as any
other road surface however its unique
structure allows it to absorb water
according to the developers the surface
absorbs up to 4,000 litres of water in
just one minute another advantage is
that on hot days top makes permeable
warms up less so people don't suffer so
much from the high temperatures but
there's also a disadvantage this coating
is not recommended for use in places
where the temperature drops below zero
degrees if the water freezes inside the
porous material it will damage the
integrity of the coating
BYD skyrail china is the most densely
populated country in the world so it's
not surprising that almost all residents
suffer from traffic jams so earlier this
decade BYD engineers began developing
the sky rail monorail in 2016 it finally
began operating the projects of 5 years
and 750 million dollars to complete the
first section 4.4 kilometers long was
launched in Shenzhen
the construction has several advantages
over the traditional subway the monorail
track is located as a high altitude so
it is not worsens the problem with
traffic jams underground construction is
usually very expensive while the cost of
sky rail is twenty percent lower than
the cost of the same construction
underground in addition the construction
of these public transport lines is three
times faster and the Lotus monorail will
not reduce traffic on the city streets
its developers hope that the situation
on the roads will improve a little the
trains speed is 80 kilometers per hour
Ram Foss 582 here we have a flying boat
the Croatian company ran fast has been
producing this vehicle since 1998
the seaplane will allow you to enjoy the
beauty of the sky nature and the water
and to use this vehicle you don't need
to be an expert pilot with years of
training some models like the one you
see on the screen can rise into the air
from only the surface of the water Ram
Dass experts also offer planes that are
capable of accelerating and rising into
the air from the ground commercial
production of these boats began in 1999
and the models have been improved
several times since then more than 200
units of flying boats have been sold
worldwide it should be noted that
today's no serious accidents involving
them have been reported the maximum
speed is 115 km/h the maximum height at
which one could rise is 2,800 meters
robo-moe Bell DLR is the German
aeronautical and Space Center
despite this specific activity it was
their specialists who showed this
incredible car a few years ago it's
called the Robo mobile the 360 degree
view is provided by 18 integrated video
cameras thanks to them the car
recognizes the objects that surrounds it
and navigates through space to reach
your destination simply enter the
address in the navigation device after
that
robo-moe bill will start moving on its
own on the road if you want to control
it you can do it remotely with the help
of a special remote control or the
driver can be inside however instead of
the usual steering wheel they'll have to
use the side stick it looks like a
normal joystick but provides power
feedback this means that when moving the
hand the driver will feel resistance
this design greatly improves the
maneuverability and handling of the
vehicle you've probably already noticed
the wheels so and also the unusual way
that robo-moe bill avoids obstacles the
fact is that the engineers equipped each
wheel with its own electric motor thanks
to this the wheels rotate in any
direction with an angle of up to 90
degrees by the way that's why the
developers decided to replace the
steering wheel with the joystick
robo-moe bill unlike standard cars can
move in almost any direction even
diagonally the ability to rotate around
its axis and move sideways makes
parallel parking much easier
sistaco tornado ACS traditional ways of
removing graffiti from surfaces are not
perfect some of them in addition to
erasing graffiti remove the layer of
paints that the builders applied to the
building
others such as sandblasting damaged the
surface too they ruin its natural relief
and if used regularly erased the surface
the German company's sister Co has
introduced a new way of removing aerosol
drawings from city walls the tornado ACS
system does not use harmful chemicals
nor does it apply a high pressure to the
surface the secret of gentle and
ecological cleaning is in the use of a
vacuum a special compartment a deer's to
the dirty surface pulling the paint out
from the structure it should be noted
that the device can be used on any
surface both indoors and outdoors
workers independently adjust the power
and type of granulate adjusting the tool
to the particular surface the tornado
ACS even cleans glass according to the
developers the only material their
equipment can't work with is film it's
just too soft the work is so delicate
that the sister code tornado ACS is
recommended even to clean historic
buildings it should be noted that the
use of the device increases the safety
of the work team since incan painter
absorbed in a vacuum toxic substances
such as lead-based paints do not spread
through the air
robot he restaurant approximately in
July last year the first restaurant in
Shanghai with real robots as waiters was
opened the high tech establishment is
known as robot dot he and here you can
enjoy fresh seafood dishes it should be
noted that the restaurant is located on
the territory of the supermarket Hema
both institutions belong to the online
trading giant Alibaba robot keys
customer service system consists of
conveyor belts touchscreen kiosks mobile
applications and of course robots the
visitor finds a touchscreen kiosk right
at the entrance they need to choose a
free table and register the robot
application he mode app in the system
which is installed in advance of a
smartphone the visitor then chooses the
products they want for that plate the
employees pick them up in a special bag
and send them by conveyor belt to the
kitchen after that the visitor sits at a
table and registers again in the system
so that the computer can identify the
order after a short period of time the
robotic container will bring the freshly
prepared dish directly to the table
