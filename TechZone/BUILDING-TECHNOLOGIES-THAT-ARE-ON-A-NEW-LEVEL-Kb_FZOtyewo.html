traditionally simple tools such as
special sealant guts are used to grout
joints between bricks or to fill joints
between decorative spans the homemade
tool you see on the screen is a
convenience alternative it looks a
little bit like a hopper gun however in
this case the device applies the mortar
in a thin dense line instead of spraying
it on the surface the advantages of
using this device are obvious
first of all it has a much larger
capacity than most sealant guns this
means that you don't have to stop
working to refill the tank in addition
the worker has to apply less effort
during work the solution is squeezed out
by the air supplied by nearby equipment
and it's powerful enough to fill even
fairly deep joints
dry fix extra adhesive pora therm hollow
clay blocks are increasingly used in
construction these days they allow you
to build outer walls with additional
insulation as well as internal
load-bearing walls it's no secret that
these blocks should be sealed for the
special substance the company vina
berger offers dry fix extra polyurethane
adhesive for this purpose it guarantees
a clean construction site as well as a
high level of speed simplicity and
quality of work and of course it has
many advantages when compared to other
adhesives first of all pay attention to
the fact that there's no need to make a
solution the worker just shakes the glue
can about 20 times and then attaches it
to the pistol now the tool is ready
in this case the worker uses a double
nozzle to speed up the process
dry fix extra can be used to join blocks
with or without insulating materials
inside the operating temperature ranges
extended the lower threshold is 5
degrees Celsius below zero so you can
work even in winter according to the
manufacturer dry fix extra allows you to
work up to 50% faster than with any
other glue quick painter if you've had
to paint walls indoors at least once you
know that the hardest part is painting
the corners and joints between the walls
and the door workers have to be careful
not to stain the door jambs window
frames fours and ceilings quick painter
is a unique tool from home right that
will be an excellent alternative to the
traditional method for painting
difficult areas unlike conventional
brushes it guarantees a neat and uniform
coating quick painter is equipped with a
guide and a convex applicator to evenly
apply it the paint
there is a paint container inside the
holder with the capacity of about 130
milliliters so you don't have to put
more paint on the brush every now and
then it also increases the accuracy of
the work the product doesn't strip it
also guarantees an economical
consumption of paint
outstanding performance has been
achieved thanks to the applicator pad
unlike the brush it is evenly soaked in
paints during operation quick painter
allows you to process about 240 square
meters of surface in just one minute and
when the work is done the excess paint
can easily be poured back into the jar
Smart's level ladder almost every
construction project requires a ladder
to perform a wide variety of tasks today
manufacturers around the world are
working to make construction equipment
safer ladders of course are no exception
these products are manufactured by the
Dutch companies smart level ladder the
video shows a ladder equipped with a
unique patented system it allows you to
place the ladder on any even rough
surfaces at the same time the unusual
position does not affect the stability
of the structure the secret lies in the
wide spread legs and the adjustable
height of the support beams the
manufacturer also offers the top safe
system which can be installed on any
ladder from the company it consists of
two hooks that securely fix the ladder
and prevent it from waggling
patterned paint rollers most people
believe that the only way to get a wall
decorated with an original pattern is
putting up a wallpaper but actually
there is another way a good alternative
to even the most beautiful and expensive
wallpaper is the paint and rollers
offered by the company the painted house
the owner of the company says that she
saw similar tools for the first time
during a trip to Romania
it turned out that with the help of
patterned paint rollers you can create
amazing and even very complex patterns
today the company offers almost twenty
different rollers they can be used not
only to decorate walls and wooden
surfaces but also to decorate paper and
fabric the work process is not
complicated but requires a lot of
precision for the drawing to be seamless
you need to run the rollers strictly
from top to bottom near the border of
the already applied pattern the worker
doesn't have to dip the roller in the
paint before pliers as it usually
happens because there's an additional
roller underneath it is soaked in paint
and passes it on to the pattern roller
away turning this reduces the risk of
paint stripping at the surface
paving slab lifter this is a device that
is also designed to simplify and speed
up construction work in particular
laying of concrete and stone slabs
during the construction of a common area
one of these slabs can weigh a lot so
lifting lowering and transporting the
material manually can lead to back pain
the solution to this problem offered by
Lange fit is a special lifter designed
to handle slaps thanks to the long
handle the worker can lift and lower
construction materials from a
comfortable standing position if a slab
is too heavy for one person
Langford specialists have something else
to offer the construction can be
equipped with an additional holder then
the weight will be evenly distributed
between two people there are two models
to choose from the first model has an
adjustable working width of 20 to 50
centimeters the other one is designed to
work with larger slabs the working width
varies from 20 to 62 centimeters the
maximum load capacity of the device is
60 kilograms
praxis mega the last product we're going
to show you today is manufactured by the
Indian company Kappa it is a compact
mobile device capable of mixing plaster
solutions and then spraying them evenly
on the surface in this case the workers
are using gypsum plaster the machine can
also be used to spray cement and
decorative plaster it is noteworthy that
the special mixing system makes it
possible to work with both dry and wet
mixed materials the mixing tank has a
capacity of 75 liters thanks to this the
device can be used even at large
construction sites
