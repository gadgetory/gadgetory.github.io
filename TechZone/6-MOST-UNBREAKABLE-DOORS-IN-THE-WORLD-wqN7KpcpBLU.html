all over the worlds that produce heavy
juicy incredibly reliable doors one of
them is the Turkish company's surf the
video shows the tests which prove that
the doors of this company do not break
down they withstand loads that may be
destructive to other doors they don't
lose their integrity even after the
impact of a sledgehammer or a battering
ram you can see that at some point
cracks begin to form on the wall while
the door still resists the secrets of
such amazing durability lies in the
construction under the wooden frame
there is a thick steel layer thus this
door looks like any other normal door
however it will protect the roof from
intruders
Innotech doors and these are the
products of another company that creates
heavy-duty doors their main feature is
the presence of glass which as we all
known doesn't possess special strength
but don't let this design mislead you
initech doors are as strong as any other
you can see the tests of a normal door
as well as three classes of initech
doors these are security plus security
plus + + security + plus plus the more
pluses the higher the strength plus the
first-class structure doesn't break if
you throw a stone at it but it won't
survive the impact of a tire iron
security + + withstands more intense
stone blows when hit by its higher iron
the glass breaks however it doesn't lose
integrity
thus the intruder still cannot get
inside finally security + + + can
withstand even the blows of a massive
hammer of course if you hit the door for
a very long time it will break at some
point but thieves usually try to get
into the house quickly and unnoticed the
strength of these doors is enough to
scare an intruder away and make him stop
trying to get into the house the secrets
of the door strength is the
multi-layered glass the polymeric film
between the layers holds the pieces of
glass in place even when the integrity
of the surface is broken
skydesk doors when you watch this door
construction being tested it's hard to
imagine who and why would need such a
protection the video shows a team of
adult men armed with a variety of tools
trying to open this door for as long as
15 minutes as you can guess one burglar
or even several of them will be stopped
by the strength of this door until they
get nervous and run away or until the
police arrive
moreover sky dust doors are designed to
withstand even gunfire during the test
the structure was shot more than 30
times bullets left marks on the surface
but none of them went through according
to the European Standard en V 1627 the
doors can have 6 resistance classes
Lithuanian company sky das office Dorset
two three and four stability classes
plus two means increase protection a
random burglar won't be able to get
through using basic tools plus three
indicates a high degree of protection
such doors can't be opened even by an
experienced burglar who uses drilling
and hammering tools finally the fourth
security class is ultra high the doors
can be tested with power drilling tools
as well as all the ones listed above TSS
doors total security solutions is an
American company that offers a wide
range of bulletproof designs its
specialists can produce absolutely
everything for the protection of small
or large businesses we are interested of
course in the doors the video shows the
stability of third class bulletproof
steel doors surprisingly the door was
short more than a hundred times and not
a single bullet went through the tests
were 100% successful according to the UL
seventy-five to standard the bulletproof
door can have eight resistance classes
the first class construction must be
able to withstand up to three shots from
a 9-millimeter pistol plus eight
construction must withstand up to five
shots from an automatic rifle or shotgun
the steel doors by total security
solutions can have up to eighth class
protection it's noteworthy that not only
the door itself but also the frame and
fittings have a huge safety margin the
manufacturer offers to equip this door
with a glass insert this is hard to
believe but its presence will not affect
the bulletproof index y se doors the
first time you see this decorated door
it doesn't occur to you that it's
capable of surviving a burglary attack
however despite its aesthetic qualities
the doors of Malaysia's YS e industries
Sdn Bhd have an amazing
ability as you could say even the use of
different tools doesn't help to open
them the secret of the outstanding
performance of the construction is its
multi-layered and high quality fittings
door hinges are made of heavy-duty
stainless steel the door is equipped
with a burglar resistant double lock the
keys of a complex groove profiling code
elements notes the built-in hook inside
the door the pattern you might have
taken for glass with sandblasted
patterns is actually a decorative panel
fire resistant doors the selection and
installation of fireproof doors must be
taken very seriously as you will
understand from this video even one
small mistake can cost you a lot the
right door holds the fire from spreading
as well as smoke and heat in addition it
must be equipped with the special gasket
when exposed to a high temperature for a
long time they foam filling the entire
interiors face of the doorway
all the doors you see on the screen are
claims to be fireproof
however reinforced glass is not
installed correctly in the door on the
left the door and the rice doesn't have
a foam gasket this is a fire test run by
an authorized test center
according to how the structures
withstand these tests they are awarded a
fire resistance limit smoke starts
coming from the cracks on the second
minute the door on the right the one
without a gasket is not doing very well
four minutes after the test starts the
left doors glass bursts if it were in a
public place a glass installation error
would lead to a rapid spread of fire in
the fifth minute a built in letterbox
falls out at the right door causing an
outdoor fire
by this moments the smoke is bursting
out of its crack so strongly but it
would lead to a dangerous smoke spread
throughout the premises eventually the
left and right doors fail for tests the
winner door can whisk down to 33 minutes
before igniting all this time it lets in
a minimum amount of smoke to after the
test the doors are checked from the
inside the right and the left ones are
completely burned and the door in the
middle has been damaged but its
integrity has been preserved</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
