brick or stone imitations on the wall
with the most common building materials
our most loyal viewers are probably
already familiar with this process but
today we're going to show a completely
different way of decorating a wall the
worker uses paint to achieve a would
affect the work begins with the
preparation the surface is divided into
two zones with the chalk decorative
stick only the lower part of the wall
will be wood like while the upper part
of the wall will be covered with regular
turquoise green paint
finally the worker proceeds to the most
interesting part decorating the lower
part the first step is applying a layer
of white paint and then a layer of
fixative it is a water resistant film
that gives the craftsmen more time to
work his main tools are a flat brush and
a wood graining rubber that will create
a unique design similar to the natural
wood pattern first a layer of turquoise
green paint is applied to the surface
with the flat brush the master starts
from the top where the surface is
divided by the short stick the paint
does not immediately soak into the
surface and doesn't dry thanks to the
fixative applied before the craftsman
takes the rubber and runs it along the
wet surface from top to bottom working
with the brush and the rubber until the
entire surface is finished
interestingly although the rubber is
artificial it creates a very accurate
passive inherent in natural wood the
result is a beautiful and unusual wall
that will look nice in any room
radial braiding machines the equipment
you see on the screen is designed for
braiding it's also capable of making
round braids of flats tri-axial braided
fabrics made of several parallel layers
of high-strength composite threads it's
used in wind power engineering and in
such areas as shipbuilding auto and
train car building it's also used to
make sports equipment such as tennis
racquets skis surfboards and hockey
sticks the tri-axial fabric is made from
carbon glass and aramid roving it's an
intermediary product widely used in yarn
production and it looks like a thick
thread
this video shows how the Hertzog radial
braiding machine works the device as
well as the software is designed to work
in conjunction with a multi-axis arm in
this case the cuoco robot sir is used
notice how they are moves the mandrel
during operation onto which the fibers
are wound the process mostly complicates
it but it's definitely worth watching
milling cutter NC machines are now used
in many different areas for example they
used to make furniture to process metal
and wood as well as foam rubber as in
this case the use of such equipment
increases the production capacity since
the machines mechanisms are controlled
by a computerized system instead of
people not only does it increase the
speed but also the quality of work the
video shows a milling machine and a
special tool by de tron dynamics the
fact is that cutting phone with milling
cutters is usually very difficult foam
rubber is a soft and very flexible
material firstly it's difficult to
secure on the work table and secondly
conventional tools instead of cutting
the material simply wrap it around
themselves as you can see in this case
there are no problems or difficulties
the milling machine performs a
remarkable work thanks to the special
shape of the cutting tool it's
noteworthy that the tools change in the
course of work the interchangeable
design expands the possibilities of
processing the material and improves the
quality of the result
Industrial laser here is another
equipment for processing different
materials in an industrial environment
it uses a focused laser beam it's
usually controlled by a computer for
greater accuracy the energy
concentration in the beam can be
adjusted it can be so high that the
laser cuts almost any material even wood
and metal up to three or four
centimeters thick working with other
materials such as paper is usually
difficult at best the laser does not
burn the edges carefully at worst it
sets the paper on fire unlike many
others the device you see on the screen
can work with paper which makes it
high-quality and expensive in this case
the laser moves at a speed of 35
millimeters per second the power output
is 15 percent of the maximum the device
doesn't leave burnt spots on the edges
either to process words the power is set
higher about 30 percent of the maximum
like in this case see how easy it is for
the laser to cut veneers the work speed
is increased up to a hundred millimeters
per second here
we'd also like to show you how it works
with plastic more specifically six
millimeter thick black acrylic the laser
moves along the surface at the speed of
12 millimeters per second the power is
set at 90 percent all the equipment
shown in the video is produced by the
American company boss laser
moulding machines finally we'd like to
show the work of the metalworking
machines produced by the spanish company
prada nagisa it's fascinating how the
equipment processes the metal the MT
500a is an automatic iron twisting
machine able to produce any details for
building decoration railing elements or
simple scrolls the equipment is patented
which makes it impossible to find
similar machines on the market parts
with round square and even cylindrical
sections are subjected molding by the
way the fence near the Niagara Falls was
made using this equipment other machines
we wanted to show you are the hydraulic
shearing machines the MX 700 and the MX
340 G these are multifunctional
hydraulic punching presses they can
apply forces ranging from 40 to 70 tons
depending on the model the tool is
equipped with a wide workshop and a
hydraulic cylinder with an outstanding
length of stroke thanks to these
features it's able to punch holes bend
cuts fold and much more in addition to
the above-mentioned applications the
tools can also be useful perforating
shoes metal and pipes
finally the last equipment is the end
hot wrought machine the PC 16 is
designed to create scrolls at the end of
the workpiece regardless of its size
shape or cross-section piece is made by
this machine I used to decorate gates
windows fences and furniture
hey stop being lazy it's time to use
that brain of yours welcome to brain
time incredible facts from the past the
present and even the future the power of
nature and wild animals amazing facts
and unsolved mysteries you'll find all
this and much more hair subscribe now
you won't regret it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
