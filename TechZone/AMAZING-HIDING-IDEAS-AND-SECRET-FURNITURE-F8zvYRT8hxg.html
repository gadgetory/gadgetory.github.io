look very unaesthetic however closing
them completely is not an option because
in the event of a breakdown you'll have
to dismantle the wall completely or
carry out some other complex
construction work the way out is to
create secret sections in the wall which
guarantee and easy and quick access to
the pipes the construction for example
is made of decorative bricks
actually absolutely any room can be a
secret room you just need to hide the
door
an easy and accessible way is to make a
sliding room out of a whole piece of
wood
at first sight this board looks like a
piece of decoration the opening
mechanism is hidden and you can't see it
from the outside only the owner knows
that the entrance to the secret room
opens when he moved one part of the
board
here's another construction that looks
like a regular wooden wall but it all
changes when you press a button on the
remote control turns out that the
separate sections of the wooden
construction are a door it automatically
opens and closes the invisible effect is
achieved thanks to the unusual shape of
the door a stranger would never guess
this cabinet has a secret compartment
when you look at it there's nothing
special about it just a drawer and
nothing else
nevertheless on the inner side of the
tabletop when nobody can see there's a
keyhole you just turn the key and the
apparently decorative side part is
pulled out it's a perfect place for
storing your most valuable and important
object
inside this ottoman there's also a
secret space suitable for hiding your
most precious things at first sight you
can't tell of course because the hiding
compartment is covered with a fluffy
carpet as you can see the owner himself
can tell that a keyhole is so he uses a
magnet to find it in the construction of
this secret door hiding a root cellar
there's nothing complicated the
decorative wood was placed in such a way
that some of the boards attached to the
door and not actually connected to the
bolts on the floor apart from that the
owner equipped the door with a hydraulic
system so that it opens automatically
using a remote control
this construction is the perfect
solution for secret storing the dining
table is stored one floor lower without
taking up precious room space
you can assemble this or hide it back at
any moment thanks to the carpet covering
the floor you can't even tell there's
something hiding under the floor
here's another designer solution capable
of transforming any space and making it
more useful and ergonomic this is a Lego
like kitchen when folded it doesn't take
up any space and it looks like a wall
but if you press a couple of buttons the
decorative panels lift up opening the
kitchen if after planning the apartments
you don't have any space left for a
minibar you can use this unusual
solution engineers across the world are
making these secret cabinets
when you look at one of these pieces of
furniture you don't even suspect what's
inside a small drawer or shelf can hide
a pretty big minibar or even a bar for
serving drinks
this construction makes you think about
narnia although this wardrobe is not for
clothes but for books and it's not
hiding a magical world but just another
room it's worth mentioning that the
construction is completely safe for the
user
special motion sensors stop the door
from closing if there's something in the
doorway and thanks to this you'd never
pinch your arm or leg
this looks like a ventilation system but
it's actually a secret compartment for
storage
an intruder would never look for
documents important papers or jewels in
such a common place by the way it's more
secure because of the fact that only the
owner can open the door Hey stop being
lazy it's time to use that brain of
yours welcome to brain time incredible
facts from the past the present and even
the future the power of nature and wild
animals amazing facts and unsolved
mysteries you'll find all this and much
more here
subscribe now you won't regret it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
