inspired by ninjas but also slightly
reminiscent of a gas mask takes
snorkeling to an unimaginable level of
comfort the mask covers your entire face
allowing breathing through both the nose
and the mouth forget about the foggy
glass that's barely avoidable in regular
masks as well as mouth dryness Jusuf
hoarse breathing through your mouth for
long periods of time these advantages
allow those who have already discovered
the ninja mask to spend on average 50
percent more time snorkeling than their
less fortunate conventional mask
counterparts another Pleasant detail no
more mouthpiece and lips chapped from
saltwater the mask has inbuilt valves to
prevent water from getting inside during
short dives or when an unexpected wave
comes by the mask has been tested and
proven effective to be used with a 2-day
grown beard or even a fully grown
moustache root for children born in the
era of computers coding as an important
part of life so why not start learning
it early the roots coding robot was
created to bring code to life and make
it an exciting endeavor even for the
little ones its coding language is
intuitively comprehensible and suitable
for children of any age provided they
can read a bit from simple F and then
operators
presented its graphical blocks through
computational constructs kids can
explore progressively more complex
concepts of actual text programming and
then direct their electronic friend with
light and Colour lines making it draw
and erase lines and much more while
moving on any solid horizontal surface
are even vertically on metal backed
whiteboards a gyroscope and
accelerometer and wheel encoders ensure
safe driving 32 color sensors touch and
light sensors allow the robot to respond
to the outside world while 16 LED color
lights and the ability to play music
allows the robot to share its mood with
the human
additional hardware is available to
enhance functionality and programs
created from a tablet or mobile phone
and transmitted to the robot wirelessly
can be edited on the run with a pause
option and shared with other users
Grenn gin when you hear about solar
power systems for personal use
you probably think about something small
pockets portable and not good for
anything more than charging a starving
phone or laptop how about a battery

if the power suddenly goes down meet
Grinch in a powerful and
environmentally-friendly accumulator
that has all the functionality of a lead
acid accumulator except for being much
lighter and well just better in all
senses each battery of grenzen
equivalent by powers with 12 volt a
hundred amp power lead acid battery
normally weighing about 85 pounds weighs
only 12 pounds which is almost four
times less batteries are stackable to
fit your power needs and after about two
thousand cycles you can replace them
without the need to throw away the
entire unit you can use it while
charging a full charge without spending
energy takes about 6.5 hours from socket
or 10 hours from solar power on a sunny
day indoors or outdoors everywhere you'd
want to use your regular generator
before picking a lighter and cleaner
alternative

gear cup charge being enough to charge
your phone up three times you cup itself
charges wirelessly or connected to the
car lighter in which case your drink
gets ready twice as fast LED indicators
and an anti spill lid are nice additions
to the ingenious design

open eva polar created by young
engineers from saint-petersburg where it
rains a lot and people know about air
humidity even modern that like to Eva
polar is a personal air conditioner that
cools the air by evaporating water since
this process is very gradual it's
unlikely for you to catch cold if using
either polar which often happens when
using conventional air conditioners the
mineral nano fibers used in the
evaporating cartridges can hold up to
seven times their own weight of water
and are thermally and chemically
resistant as well as completely
eco-friendly it's noiseless vibration

a sky this simple to install and easy to
maintain
compact weather station provides you
with high quality meteorological data
from your own backyard

humidity as all other personal weather
stations which often cost two or three
times the price of air due but it also
offers something extra
it measures lightning when lightning
strikes it will tell you how strong it
was
how far and how fast the storm is
approaching while air stays in the shade
its brother sky is there out in the Sun
measuring sunlight solar radiation
including UV index and furthermore to
more important measurements it measures
rain and wind without having any moving
parts which sends a break and fill with
stuff other than rain
it senses every raindrop and warns you
the moment it starts raining about how
hard it is and sonic transducers provide
more precise measurements of wind power
and direction and traditional spinning
cups the batteries for both devices last
for years and they're both completely
wireless
eight this smart mattress cover collects
your sleep data from deep and light
sleep cycles to heart rate as well as
room temperature and noise level the
data is sent to a data hub which is

your gadgets wherever and whenever you
are when you rotate the ball mechanical
energy is turned into electrical and
either passes directly to your device
through a cable or is stored in an
inbuilt battery to charge it after you
finish the training session your phone
will charge as fast as it worked from
the socket anti-stress toys have never
been so useful
