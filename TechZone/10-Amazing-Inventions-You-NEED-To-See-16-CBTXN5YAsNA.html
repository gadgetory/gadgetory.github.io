inspired by ninjas but also slightly
reminiscent of a gas mask takes
snorkeling to an unimaginable level of
comfort the mask covers your entire face
allowing breathing through both the nose
and the mouth forget about the foggy
glass that's barely avoidable in regular
masks as well as mouth dryness Jusuf
hoarse breathing through your mouth for
long periods of time these advantages
allow those who have already discovered
the ninja mask to spend on average 50
percent more time snorkeling than their
less fortunate conventional mask
counterparts another Pleasant detail no
more mouthpiece and lips chapped from
saltwater the mask has inbuilt valves to
prevent water from getting inside during
short dives or when an unexpected wave
comes by the mask has been tested and
proven effective to be used with a 2-day
grown beard or even a fully grown
moustache root for children born in the
era of computers coding as an important
part of life so why not start learning
it early the roots coding robot was
created to bring code to life and make
it an exciting endeavor even for the
little ones its coding language is
intuitively comprehensible and suitable
for children of any age provided they
can read a bit from simple F and then
operators
presented its graphical blocks through
computational constructs kids can
explore progressively more complex
concepts of actual text programming and
then direct their electronic friend with
light and Colour lines making it draw
and erase lines and much more while
moving on any solid horizontal surface
are even vertically on metal backed
whiteboards a gyroscope and
accelerometer and wheel encoders ensure
safe driving 32 color sensors touch and
light sensors allow the robot to respond
to the outside world while 16 LED color
lights and the ability to play music
allows the robot to share its mood with
the human
additional hardware is available to
enhance functionality and programs
created from a tablet or mobile phone
and transmitted to the robot wirelessly
can be edited on the run with a pause
option and shared with other users
Grenn gin when you hear about solar
power systems for personal use
you probably think about something small
pockets portable and not good for
anything more than charging a starving
phone or laptop how about a battery
that's good enough to give a concert or
keep the lights on in your entire house
if the power suddenly goes down meet
Grinch in a powerful and
environmentally-friendly accumulator
that has all the functionality of a lead
acid accumulator except for being much
lighter and well just better in all
senses each battery of grenzen
equivalent by powers with 12 volt a
hundred amp power lead acid battery
normally weighing about 85 pounds weighs
only 12 pounds which is almost four
times less batteries are stackable to
fit your power needs and after about two
thousand cycles you can replace them
without the need to throw away the
entire unit you can use it while
charging a full charge without spending
energy takes about 6.5 hours from socket
or 10 hours from solar power on a sunny
day indoors or outdoors everywhere you'd
want to use your regular generator
before picking a lighter and cleaner
alternative
Yeek up 365 ever imagine how much better
your life would be if your thermos could
make your drink hot or cold instead of
just maintaining the temperature it's
time to try how it feels
year cup will make your drink freezing
or boiling hot just the way you like it
pick the desired temperature by Rameau
below plication and wait for the signal
that your drink is ready if you forgot
your phone at home you can program your
cup with buttons which is slightly less
fun but just it's effective and if you
took the phone but it's out of battery
your cup will generously share its
energy through a USB port with a single
gear cup charge being enough to charge
your phone up three times you cup itself
charges wirelessly or connected to the
car lighter in which case your drink
gets ready twice as fast LED indicators
and an anti spill lid are nice additions
to the ingenious design
smart cube the bluetooth-enabled locking
system allows controlled and if needed
restricted access to any drawer or
locker the store cently valuable or
dangerous a proximity detection system
automatically opens all the locks for
you when you approach with your phone
unlocks them when you go away
alternatively you can use encrypted
passwords for every lock and share those
you want to you can also control and
customize the proximity detection system
to provide access to other people or
rather their copies of the application
fitting your locks to compartments
designated by you smart cube is easy to
mount on any flat and smooth surface and
will keep your electronics and medicines
away from children sensitive documents
from curious guests left alone in your
office and much much more you'll be able
to know when and who opened every smart
cube in your home as well as get
notified about any attempt to force it
open eva polar created by young
engineers from saint-petersburg where it
rains a lot and people know about air
humidity even modern that like to Eva
polar is a personal air conditioner that
cools the air by evaporating water since
this process is very gradual it's
unlikely for you to catch cold if using
either polar which often happens when
using conventional air conditioners the
mineral nano fibers used in the
evaporating cartridges can hold up to
seven times their own weight of water
and are thermally and chemically
resistant as well as completely
eco-friendly it's noiseless vibration
free and compact
unlike the bulky air conditioner we used
to and the laconic design allows it to
fit any interior design
a sky this simple to install and easy to
maintain
compact weather station provides you
with high quality meteorological data
from your own backyard
it connects to your smartphone smart
home or any other gadget through the
internet air measures temperature
atmospheric pressure and relative
humidity as all other personal weather
stations which often cost two or three
times the price of air due but it also
offers something extra
it measures lightning when lightning
strikes it will tell you how strong it
was
how far and how fast the storm is
approaching while air stays in the shade
its brother sky is there out in the Sun
measuring sunlight solar radiation
including UV index and furthermore to
more important measurements it measures
rain and wind without having any moving
parts which sends a break and fill with
stuff other than rain
it senses every raindrop and warns you
the moment it starts raining about how
hard it is and sonic transducers provide
more precise measurements of wind power
and direction and traditional spinning
cups the batteries for both devices last
for years and they're both completely
wireless
eight this smart mattress cover collects
your sleep data from deep and light
sleep cycles to heart rate as well as
room temperature and noise level the
data is sent to a data hub which is
plugged into a socket so you don't need
to wear a sensors or remember to charge
any device it can also warm each side of
the bed individually to provide the best
sleeping experience and adjust the alarm
according to your sleep cycles and
activity levels throughout the night so

surely become a friend for kids and a
big relief for their parents since it
works as a baby monitor sleep tracker
and sleep trainer from birth to 10 years
old it can play your baby's favorite
lullaby and provide you with extensive
data on your child's sleep patterns so
you can improve them knowledge is power
older children can learn healthy
sleeping habits from the little buddy
as you can customize the desired hour to
go to bed and wake up and your
electronic helper will hint to the child
that it's tired and wants to sleep and
early in the morning it'll remain cutely
sleeping inviting your little one to
stay in bed for just another hour before
waking you up by jumping on your bed
and energy now you can charge your
mobile phone while training your wrists
after access typing sessions a
gyroscopic exercise ball plus a mobile
phone charger equals a perfectly
ecological compact and fun way to charge
your gadgets wherever and whenever you
are when you rotate the ball mechanical
energy is turned into electrical and
either passes directly to your device
through a cable or is stored in an
inbuilt battery to charge it after you
finish the training session your phone
will charge as fast as it worked from
the socket anti-stress toys have never
been so useful
