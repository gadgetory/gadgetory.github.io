that dr. Bruce Banner turns into the
Green Giant Hulk when his emotions take
over this BMW x6 is not able to grow in
size but the designers have given it the
ability to change its appearance in a
different way however it can only happen
when the surface is heated to show this
unique property of the paint hot water
is poured on the car the blue color kind
of fades away revealing an amazing
airbrush artwork however this is just
one of many examples in this case only
the designers imagination sets the
limits another example that we'd like to
show you is this cold black Mustang
under the black paint Heights are
drawing inspired by the story of Frank
Hopkins and is sturdy Mustang hidalgo in
both cases the secret lies in the unique
properties of the thermal paint it
consists of special micro capsules which
react to temperature changes when heated
the capsules change color or as shown in
the video become transparent once the
surface cools down the capsules return
to their original state and the surface
acquires its initial color
interior paints paint manufacturing
companies are inspiring their customers
to experiment they've shown various
interesting and unusual techniques that
can be applied to any room for example
now you see how to apply a one cycle
pass into a wall the company Dulux which
produces this paint assures that you'll
be able to create beautiful patterns
with it even if you're not an artist it
is recommended to draw the consul's of
the drawing with chalk on craft paper
then the lines are traced with a special
tool next the back of the paper is
treated with sandpaper now place the
paper on the wall and rub the chalk over
the surface leaving the contours on the
wall under the paper now you can use
them to mark the lines of your drawing
this way you can avoid mistakes and
apply the final version of the passes at
the wall
to create large circles on the floor
surface use a rope fixed with a piece of
duct tape that will serve as a compass
to create small circles you can use
round objects such as a can of paint you
can cut out stencils from paper to
create more complex patterns then you
can see how to decorate the wall with
circles they are cut out of paper and
attach to the wall at this stage the
expert decides how he wants to arrange
them the remaining paper is also used to
Sisseton cyl next they create a
honeycomb pattern using a really simple
technique in this case for example only
paper and adhesive tape are used you can
achieve the effect of blurred stripes on
the wall by combining a variety of
colors applied to the surface with
different brushes a rope attached
horizontally to the wall serves as a
guide you have to run the brush over the
wall in a special way constantly
changing the pressure not trying to
create a smooth pattern in this case six
colors were used to create the stripes
exterior paint this project could not be
realized without the help of
professional artists at first glance it
may seem that the building lost parts of
its wall but this is simply an ambitious
project by Valspar paint a paint
manufacturing company the artist painted
the wall of the building to create the
illusion that we're seeing the interior
of the apartment building
just look at this explosion of colors
such bright shades weren't chosen by
chance though according to the company
the project and the 3d mural will
encourage people to choose brighter
colors the fact is that people tend to
choose restrains tones to paint the
interior of their houses this colorful
design demonstrates that bright colors
can look stylish and very beautiful the
paint used to create this drawing has
different properties than the interior
paint outer surfaces of the building
face aggressive outdoor exposure every
day such as temperature changes
precipitation direct sunlight dust and
dirt unlike interior paint exterior
paint is resistant to all these effects
epoxy resin today furniture and products
decorated with epoxy resin are becoming
more and more popular this is a flexible
material that allows you to implement
interesting and original design ideas
even one object decorated with epoxy can
transform a room and become the main
decorative element of the whole room the
technique that you see on the screen is
used to finish floors and countertops in
the kitchen and bathroom epoxy resin can
be of any color to just like paint
therefore it can be used to create a
wide variety of effects for example you
can decorate the floor with a starry sky
design or draw ocean wave patterns on
the table
it is noteworthy that each surface is
created by hand so there are no two
identical epoxy products it's similar to
creating a work of art so experts have
to constantly come up with new
techniques and upgrade their methods
paint is board over a layer of paint
spread with a spatula
Wolters to create unusual textures and
sprinkles sometimes even sticks are used
to create even more complex patterns
acrylic poor painting painting doesn't
necessarily mean making perfect
brushstrokes with surgical precision to
achieve an ideal result acrylic pouring
is a popular technique today the most
important thing is not being afraid to
experiment and knowing when to stop for
this technique liquid acrylic paint is
used it has unique properties so it
flows on the canvas creating abstract
patterns the artist guides the paint in
the right direction and uses various
techniques to achieve a more original
result for example a rather popular saw
is a heat gun acrylic paint reacts to
the increase in temperature and the
surface is covered with bubbles which
stay on the canvas another important
aspect is the choice of colors they
should go well together you can apply
the paint at the canvas in a variety of
ways for example here the paint is
poured in layers into a cup then the
artist just flips it over
one of the prophesies of acrylic paint
is that the colors don't mix with each
other resulting in some very interesting
multicolored drawings and here is
another technique the artist fills a
funnel with panes of different colors
this is almost impossible to create
similar color arrangements using a brush
invisible ink this artist uses two
unique techniques to create his works
you've probably never seen anything like
this before first to use as a special
pen it's made entirely of glass from the
body to the tip and looks like a spindle
it works like a fountain pen only here
the ink is stored in numerous grooves as
you can see the artist uses glowing ink
instead of the usual ink for about
thirteen dollars you can buy 85 grams of
it in any specialized store
if you draw with this ink in daylight
nothing seems to be happening the
passing becomes visible only if the Rays
of a special backlight fluorescent lamp
are directed at it this lamp has a
relatively weak visible glow so the
artist works in the dark using only this
lamp and creating some incredible
drawings</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
