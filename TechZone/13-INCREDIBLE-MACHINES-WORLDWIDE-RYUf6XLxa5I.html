that transforms wave power into energy
this particular project is really unique
because the station itself is located on
the shore while the boys get placed in
the water each one of them is connected
to one end of a mechanical lever that
moves thanks to the wave power this up
and down movement activates a pump which
creates pressure on the freshwater
stored in the tank connected to the
hyperbaric chamber the water under
pressure activates a turbine which in
turn rotates a generator that produces
electricity Li pair MK 88 these
self-propelled building crane MK 88 was
designed like this to allow only one
person getting in operation position by
pressing just one button the rotating
part of the MK 88 has a two section
telescopic lattice boom the four axis
chassis is equipped with a special
system to regulate the manoeuvre of the
vehicle and activate the control of the
back axis and air disc brakes which
provide an optimum maneuverability m'kay
cranes can realize several rides a day
as taxi cranes

per 33 feet the transporter is about 130
feet long and can accelerate up to 2
miles per hour
eske 3500 D this excavator can work at a
height of up to two hundred and thirteen

this vehicle is designed to demolish
skyscrapers and other it's Hall
buildings it was built based on a
crawler crane with a carrying capacity
of 200 tons the SK 3500 D is equipped
with a fifteen point seven liter 315
horsepower diesel motor the three-piece
boom can hold different kinds of
attachments for different kinds of
actions like cutting or drilling on the
end of the boom there's a rear-view
camera for the operator controlling the
whole process from the inside of the
cabin also there's a fog nozzle that
scatters water in order not to raise
dust Big Bird 747
this is the world's largest farming
tractor the first model of the big bud
747 was built in 1977 in Lahav Montana
the current version of the tractor is
equipped with a 16 cylinder diesel
engine of 760 horsepower the dimensions
of the tractor are 26 feet long 20 feet
wide and 13 feet tall the Canadian
company United tire company made the
tires for this giant 8.2 feet in
diameter the weight of the fully loaded
tractor is more than a hundred thousand
pounds xcm G crawler crane this crane is
being produced in China and is just as
good as the vehicles created by Tareq's
in leaper this crawler crane weighs
4,000 tons and was presented for the
first time on November the 2nd 2012 it
has the greatest lifting capacity in the
world and was developed specially for
oil companies chemical industries and
nuclear energy companies on top of that
the crane has three different boom modes
to easily perform all kinds of work
ma'am oh it's SpMT this modern
self-propelled modular vehicle is a
platform with two four or eight pairs of
axles eight feet wide
each depending on the model it has a
unique control system and a power
station which can be quickly dismantled
if necessary the carrying capacity of
the vehicle is calculated from the
maximum load on a pair of axles 44
tonnes on each so if there are four
axles the maximum load capacity is 176
tonnes in the case of eight axles twice
as much 352 tonnes drag flow this
heavy-duty submersible pump was
specially designed for working with high
viscosity and high solids mixtures the
pumps are used when pumping out
hydraulic mixtures with a high
percentage of dissolved and suspended
materials as well as solid particles up
to 4.7 inches in size the pumping
process looks like this under the effect
of the agitator located in the suction
pipe area the solid ground particles
break away from the bottom surface form
a concentrated pulp and get sucked into
by a pump
Bela's 75710 this Quarry dump truck
weighs 810 tons and can reach speeds up
