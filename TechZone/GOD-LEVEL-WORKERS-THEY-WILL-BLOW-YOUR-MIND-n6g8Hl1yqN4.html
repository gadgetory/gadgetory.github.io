always possible to place a window in
every room of the house
however it has been proven that natural
light provides the person with a stable
emotional and psychological condition
keeping strength vigor and calm at the
right level if there's not enough
natural light in your room because the
window is small or uncomfortable this is
not a reason to suffer Velux light
tunnels were able to solve this problem
they are installed directly on the
ceiling and are like skylights even if
there are no windows in the room the
Velux light tunnel thanks to a special
reflective aluminium tube will fill the
room with natural light it should be
noted that if the day is cloudy the
tunnel generates approximately the same
amount of light as a 60 watt lamp
new Nietzsche who said it's necessary as
it goes to the gym for a full training
session of various muscle groups today
as possible so train sitting at your
desk all you need to do is install the
nunchi system it's mounted on the back
of the chair but can also be used on the
floor nunchi has six fastenings for
elastic bands on the sides to perform
the exercises they create enough
resistance to provide the rhythmic
contraction and relaxation of the
muscles needed for the workout the
nunchi training system is perfect for
everyone from beginners to people who
take sports seriously several different
elastic bands are included so resistance
can be regulated other advantages of
nunchi are its compactness and
possibility the system can be used in
combination with any chair as well when
folded it doesn't take up any space
it fits even in a small bag and weighs
on there's nothing and you can buy a
system like this for a hundred and
twenty dollars
vacuum thermo forming if you've ever
wondered how different plastic packaging
adapts to the shape of the product
you'll find the answer to your question
below the British company for Mac is
dedicated to the production of vacuum
thermo forming equipment the devices you
see on the screen use raw polymeric
material for example pre heated films or
foils in general there are a fairly
large number of types of thermoforming
in this case the piece is shaped through
a vacuum pump for this reason the
technology is called vacuum forming the
use of four Mac equipment is relevant in
the mass production of bulky plastic
products and the operating principle is
very simple the plastic film is heated
to a soft state above or below the
molding tool the gap between the plastic
and the molding tool forces the material
to then change shape interestingly even
complex shapes can be created in this
way and the number of curves in convex
ease does not affect the quality of the
resulting four
albedo 100 every year more and more cars
appear on the roads due to the
accumulation of vehicles these situation
is becoming critical at night walking
near the roads is increasingly dangerous
to solve this problem and improve road
safety the albedo 100 range of sprayers
was invented it's a spray that can be
applied on any surface making it glow
under artificial light the manufacturer
has developed three different sprays the
first is designed for clothing and
textiles is easily applied and is
removed curing washing the second is
made of safe components to be applied to
animal hair this is an ideal option to
ensure the safety of livestock near the
road you could also spray your dog or
cats so drivers can see them in the dark
too finally the third spray is
industrial and can't be washed off it
can be applied to concrete wood metal
another similar surfaces it should be
noted that its components allow it to be
invisible on the surface in daylight the
price of albedo 100 varies from 14 to 19
dollars depending on the volume of the
bottle and the properties of the spray
Mobe mart surely at least once in your
life you've thought about how great it
would be if the supermarket could
literally come to your door bad weather
or lack of motivation often prevent
people from going shopping or make the
whole process difficult long and
extremely unpleasant fortunately in the
near future this dream may come true
because today there are already stores
that are able to move through the
streets on their own and even reach the
customers home in early 2017 the
wheelies startup began testing the
world's first mobile store the mobi Mart
on the streets of Shanghai there are no
cashiers or cellars inside as the size
of Moby mark doesn't exceed that of a
standard bus
according to the developers to move and
navigate the streets the store will use
artificial intelligence and computer
vision the test prototype is controlled
by human operators but the idea is
revolutionary mobile art is the future
of these businesses here you can buy
food sneakers or magazines the purchase
is made with the help of a mobile
application the customer scans the
barcode of the selected product and pays
via bank transfer by the way with the
help of the same mobile application you
can call the shop directly to your home
in addition depending on the
manufacturer the vehicle can return to
the warehouse at its own expense to
restock supplies
skite export here we have a unique
winter sports simulator which allows you
to skate in a very real way on virtual
tracks covered with snow engineers
created a technology that accurately
reproduces the physics and biomechanics
of downhill skiing and snowboarding
so even though the user is at home he
feels the acceleration the curves and in
short the same emotions as when really
skiing
it should be noted that these simulator
includes not only abstract slopes of
varying complexity but also the most
famous real slopes in the world even the
ones of the Olympic Games the program
supports a maximum resolution of 6 K
making the snowboarding or skiing
experience even more complete and
plausible even professional athletes and
coaches recognize the effectiveness of
skies export the secrets of scart export
lies in its complex designing special
sensors read dozens of parameters every
second from ski position to body
position this allows the programs are
know at all times what the user is doing
and what they're going to do the athlete
can descend a slope practice downhill
skiing and giant slalom or try a descent
sky shake sports is recommended for a
wide variety of purposes such as
rehabilitation fitness professional
practice or beginner training
hey stop being lazy it's time to use
that brain of yours welcome to brain

present and even the future the power of
