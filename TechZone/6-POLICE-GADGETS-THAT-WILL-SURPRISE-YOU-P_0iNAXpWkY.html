police face dangers that can cause
serious and even irreparable damage to
the health that's why the priority is to
create devices that help protect police
officers on duty
bulletproof origami is a portable
compact and deployable field it can be
placed on the ground so it's not
necessary to hold it with your hands or
support it on any surface
the shield unfolds in just a few seconds
this is very important because in
critical situations every moment counts
when folded the bulletproof origami is
compact enough to fit in the trunk of a
car
the ways of a traditional shield for
police protection is about 40 kilograms
a considerable weight especially for a
single person at the same time a
standard shield is able to protect a
single policeman the peculiarity of the
bulletproof origami is that it weighs
significantly less around 25 kilograms
and is designed to be used by two or
three people be sure to pay attention to
the shape of the field it unfolds
forming corners that further protect the
agents from the sides it should be noted
that the shield is made of 12 layers of
Kevlar a special fiber that has a very
high resistance there is also an
aluminium rot and the inside
the grappler police bumper chasing a
criminals car is one of the most
dangerous aspects of a policeman's job
according to statistics only in the
United States one person dies every day
as a result of police persecution in
recent years engineers around the world
have been working on inventions that
will reduce chase time and make the
process safer for everyone on the road
the manufacturer of this device claims
that when the suspect increases speed
wanting to avoid arrest he gains control
over the situation the grapple a police
bumper helps law enforcement officials
regain control of the situation the
grappler hangs on the front bumper of
the police car after pressing a button
a loop is released which grapples the
rear wheel of the suspects car the knots
made of durable material is rolled into
the wheel after which the police car can
be stopped in turn stopping the suspects
car the braking trajectory is controlled
and predictable and the distance between
the cars is quite safe therefore the
grapple a police bumper is the best
solution to end the chase quickly and
safely
cube the number of people using drones
today continues to grow these devices
are used to take photos and videos put
out fires and rescue people the company
AeroVironment proposes to use drones in
emergency situations when police
departments need aerial help cube is a
compact device that doesn't need more
than five minutes of preparation to fly
after this is ready to fly in the air
showing and recording everything that
happens to criminals from a bird's-eye
view the drone battery serves for 40
minutes of operational work enough time
to gather all the necessary information
about the offender cube is able to float
permanently in the air providing a high
quality and stable image which is
transmitted to a special control panel
the working height of the device is in
the range of 30 to 150 meters
AeroVironment manufactures a variety of
similar drones so that they can perform
a wide range of tasks specifically cube
is intended for the public safety
sectors it allows a better assessment of
the situation without risking human
lives and without endangering their
health
Bassel skin Viper helmet the traditional
helmets used by the police and special
services protect quite well but they're
not the best option as they have certain
disadvantages revisions battle skin
viper is a system to protect the head
which at the same time protects the
person and allows them to better face
the tasks of surveillance the helmet is
capable of protecting the head against
blows fragments of explosive devices and
ballistic threats
it should be noted that this revision
helmet has a small weight so it doesn't
increase the load on the person at the
same time it provides effective
protection that meets military
requirements notable features include a
large number of adjustable straps which
allow for maximum wearing comfort as
well as the variability of the front
fasteners
the visor has three different mounting
positions and a removable panel to
protect the lower jaw it turns out that
the helmet of this type has four
different versions which can be easily
interchanged and complete one another in
a matter of seconds
interestingly it's designed in such a
way that a flashlight or camera can be
easily installed on the helmet
the Recon Scout XT this is another
device that allows to gather strategic
and important information without
pushing human lives at risk here we have
the Recon Scout XT a compact robot
designed for use in emergency areas the
advantage of this robot compared to
other similar devices is its strength
and durability the Recon Scout XT can
fall from a height of 9 meters onto a
hard surface such as concrete without
damaging itself and continuing its work
it is small quiet and able to move
without attracting too much attention
it should be noted that the developers
included in the robots and infrared
lighting system so that it can move even
in total darkness as planned by the
developers the robots is to be used for
the reconnaissance of places where
police or special services can't enter
equip to the camera the Recon Scout XT
can quickly efficiently and secretly
collect information about the building
or the criminals
Nimbo modern developers proposed to use
robots to ensure public safety
these devices can perform a variety of
functions such as intelligence and
patrol here we have Nimbo a compact and
technological robots designed to patrol
the streets it's able to distinguish
objects understand perfectly when it's
in front of a person a car or an
obstacle it should be noted that it
works autonomously following a
predetermined route object recognition
allows the robot to move easily even in
a space full of people or objects Nimbo
records and logs everything that happens
sending the image to the control panel
in real-time surprisingly the robots
when detecting a criminal can chase them
without losing sight of them until the
police services can catch him it should
be noted that Nimbo can function as a
self balancing scooter as well in other
words it's not only capable of
patrolling space independently but also
alongside a person
