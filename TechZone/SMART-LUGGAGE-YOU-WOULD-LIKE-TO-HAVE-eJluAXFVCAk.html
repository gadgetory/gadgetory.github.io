may seem the manufacturer of this
suitcase began the decoration of a
high-quality speaker when developing the
nomadic speaker the engineers took the
sound of expensive car speakers as
standard when the product was ready the

it needed a resonator box that's how the
pneumatic audio speak case appeared they
are sold together and cost six hundred
and fifty nine dollars as a kit it's an
amazing portable speaker and you can
even put things in it the manufacturer
says that pneumatic audio speed case is
unmatched by any other possible speaker
in the world that's because the
engineers are followed and unusual paths
a full ripped sound is provided by a
moveable membrane covering 70% of the
speaker and two subwoofers measuring 10
by 15 centimeters to cover the full
frequency range to twenty two millimeter
loudspeakers have been added

owner of this suitcase

capacity of 40 litres and the speaker
occupies only 4% of its interior space

reflects the individuality of its owner
