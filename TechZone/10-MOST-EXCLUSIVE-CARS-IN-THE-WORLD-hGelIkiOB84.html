have to raise a huge cap which unites a
part of the roof the hood and the
panoramic glass the technical interior
of the Renault drizzle concept is
borrowed from the electric racing cars
of the formula E Series its range in 250
HP electric motor on the rear axle two
batteries and an energy recuperation
system
rolls-royce 103 e^x
the concept car rolls-royce 103 e^x was
introduced in London in 2016 the car
received completely enclosed front
wheels separated from the hood a
teardrop roof and an open back according
to the creators of the rolls-royce 103 X
it's a fully autonomous electric car and
its design has a lot of composite
materials
there's no possibility of manually
controlling the car so there's no driver
seat no steering wheel or instruments
vision Mercedes Maybach six under the
floor of this electric car there's an 80
kilowatt per hour flat battery pack
installed feeding a 750 horsepower
electric power unit the car does 0 to 60
miles per hour in less than 4 seconds
and the maximum speed is limited by the
electronics at around 155 miles per hour
the overall dimensions of the concept
car are 19 feet in length 7 feet in
width and 4 feet in height the interior
of the vision mercedes maybach 6 is even
more futuristic than its exterior inside
as a huge display from door to door and
at the same time all the information
necessary for the driver is projected
onto the windshield mercedes vision van
this car combines innovative solutions
for the delivery of goods in and around
the city
fans will be connected to the network
the car will be equipped with telematics
equipments and digital technologies just
turning into the main elements of the
delivery process thanks to it you'll be
able to update the shipment status as
often as possible
and not just after it gets into the
warehouse goods will be loaded based on
the itinerary so the boxes will be
sorted in a certain sequence that won't
be violated all the way Nissan blade
guider this concept with a narrow front
part and a wide rear can seem
controversial in terms of stability but
it provides not only an exotic
appearance but also good aerodynamics
and for an electric car with a very low
center of gravity this scheme can even
give a gain in maneuverability
the car is driven by a pair of electric
motors one for each rear wheel with the
peak power of 177 HP each they are
controlled by the traction vectorization
system so that incompetent distribution
of abode of the right and left engines
helps the car to go to returns Faraday

this vehicle is not a direct hyper car
this invention is a futuristic
appearance unrealistically low ground
clearance an abundance of bends and many
aerodynamic elements the car will be
made of carbon fiber and other composite
materials and will be equipped with four
electric motors each of them spins one
wheel and together they have a capacity
of more than 1,000 doors power
this power will allow the car to
accelerate from 0 to 60 miles per hour
in less than three seconds and reach a
maximum speed of 200 miles per hour B&amp;amp;W
vision next 100 thanks to its artificial

developments of the situation on the
road give valuable advice to the driver
and solve some of the problems on its
own in conditions of poor visibility the
on-board computer will warn the driver
of all road users who cross the vehicles
trajectory interestingly all information
about the state of the car will be
displayed on the projection display
instead of the usual steering wheel the
driver will use a rudder
when the autopilot is activated the
front seats are turned to the back dust
the interior of the card sends into a
kind of coupe a mercedes-benz
fo.1 5 the concept of this vehicle looks
very strange the main mode of the car is
unmanned and four passengers sit facing
each other in comfortable sun loungers
to their service there are a lot of
electronic means of communication and
entertainment and the usual manned mode
is only an octave every one if required
the driver can deploy the seat in the
traditional position face forward and
pull out the steering wheel from the
dashboard the output power of the
traction battery is 80 kilowatts of the
fuel cell unit 120 kilowatts in total
this is 200 kilowatts or 272 horsepower
which exactly covers the peak output of
the engines sr seeds hama hawk gran
turismo
concept car this car will be presented
in three versions urban racing and
experimental depending on the version
this hyper car will be equipped with
motors with a thousand seven to two
thousand five hundred and ninety
horsepower at the same time the maximum
speed of the most powerful model of a
site seeds Alma Hawkes will be four
hundred miles per hour
the special feature of the car as a
whole is the v10 engine and also it's
pneumatic wheel control system
aerodynamic body elements and suspension
especially for this car the auto concern
has even developed a concept of anti
overload suit for the driver which is
often used by fighter pilots Toyota
Supra FC one this car will be equipped
with a 3.5 liter v6 engine and
turbochargers combined with a 7-speed
transmission a powerful engine will
