I'm gonna be the voice in today's video
thanks for your understanding
egg factory within a single chicken
breeding and egg producing facility
several production processes may be
carried out for example some eggs may be
packaged and sent to stores for sale and
the other part goes into production of
egg powder or melange a pasteurized
mixture of egg white and yolk which is
widely used in industrial cooking the
egg starts with the chicken the hens
live in special multi-story tilted floor
houses when the headache is laid it
rolls down the chute to the storage tank
and then via a conveyor belt enters the
storage center
all the eggs are inspected the process
can be either automatic or manual eggs
with cracks are rejected only whole eggs
are sent to the next stage the next
steps are laboratory and diagnostic
testing and cleaning the robot or person
then uses a suction cup to pick up the
eggs from the tray and place them on a
conveyor belt before the sorting process
the eggs are checked again for quality
at this time they are run through an ova
scope which inspects the integrity of
the inner side of the shell if there is
a crack the egg is rejected only
absolutely whole eggs enter the sorting
shop
the machine weighs and measures each egg
to determine which type it belongs to
such data is human program as a result
the machine depending on the weight of
the egg sends it to the corresponding
belt from where it goes into the
packaging unit the batch of eggs that
has been selected for the production of
melange is sent to the egg breaking room
after sanitization here the shells are
broken and the contents are extracted
then whites and yolks are separated from
each other the egg mass is filtered and
mixed then pasteurized and cooled after
that all that remains is to pack it
cheese there are a really large number
of cheese varieties in the world and the
production at different factories may
differ processed cheese is produced
mainly from remnants of cheese
production so there are not very high
requirements for the quality of the raw
materials but strict control of
ingredients is needed for the production
of hard cheeses production begins with a
preparation of the milk the more
delicious it is the better the cheese
will turn out milk needs to be
pasteurized an example it needs to be
brought to a very high temperature then
cooled and left to rest for a while
after that bacterial starter culture is
added to the liquid mass as time passes
the milk coagulates under the influence
of bacteria forming a homogeneous still
not too thick mass is left for some time
for maturation then the mass is salted
and the cheese heads are formed
interestingly this process is almost
always performed by people but pressing
is not always possible by hands
this process is performed by special
equipment in half the cases
when the cheese appears to be ready it
is sent for drying and final maturation
its duration depends on the type of
cheese
for example flagship cheese shown on the
screen matures in a year acquiring the
right texture in taste another cheese
harvest moon matures in six to twelve
months
instant noodles to make instant noodles
top grade wheat baking flour is used the
very first stage of its production is
sifting by automatic equipment then egg
powder thickener and sometimes starch
are added to the sieved flour all these
additives improve the structure of the
noodles increase its elasticity and
strength
the mixture of all these ingredients
enters the donating machine where it is
broken down into portions of a certain
size and mixed also at this stage salt
water is added to the mixture the mixing
process takes about 15 minutes after
which the dough should ripen for about a
minute instead of a rolling pin rough
rollers are used in production first
they roll out the dough into two thick
sheets the rollers then move processing
the dough until the thickness reaches
one millimeter the finished rolled out
dough is cut into thin threads by
special longitudinal cutters it is
noteworthy that at this stage the
noodles become wavy due to the
difference in cutting speed and
transporter movement then the threads
are placed in a zig-zag pattern but
their waviness is preserved in order for
instant noodles to be cooked at home in
boiling water in a couple of minutes
cooking is performed at the factory
however it's not water but steam that is
used for this purpose
this method of heat treatment is chosen
so that noodles do not have time to
absorb water and do not become mash the
next stage may seem surprising but the
steamed noodles are deep-fried this is
done to remove moisture and increase the
shelf life of the product the threads
are cut into bricks suitable for the
size of the frying cells and the
roasting process itself takes about
three minutes the bricks are then cooled
and sent to the packaging unit
coca-cola every coca-cola plant can
produce up to 1 million bottles per day
more than 30 million boxes of 6 2 liter
bottles can be produced per year the
production Hall is divided into two
parts in the first one the bottles are
made in special plastic preforms in the
second one then beverage is produced
directly
the main ingredients of coca-cola is
water syrup and carbon dioxide this
syrup contains a sugar a dye that gives
the beverage of dark brown color as well
as an acidity regulator caffeine and a
natural flavoring the latter consists of
various oils such as orange and
coriander when all the ingredients of
the syrup are mixed it ages for 24 hours
after that the syrup is transferred from
his blending compartment to the filling
station via pipes
here the syrup is mixed with purified
water in a five to one ratio special
equipment carbonates the drink then it
is bottled and immediately sealed
tightly with the lid the bottles are
transported through the bottle conveyors
to the packing area where they are first
labeled and then encoded
whoopie pies this confectionery product
is a sandwich made of two round cakes
which are joined by a layer of cream
filling or glazed whoopie pies are made
in pastry jobs or at a home but of
course there are also factories where
the production is automated the
manufacturing process begins with the
production of the cakes water is poured
into the industrial mixer and apple
vinegar rapeseed or sunflower oil is
added to it all these ingredients are
mixed then tapioca starch bean flour and
sour gum
gluten-free grain are added afterwards
cocoa powder and white and brown sugar
are added to the mixture the blender
mixes the ingredients at a high speed to
create a light airy texture
the dough must have the right density so
samples of different batches are tested
with special equipment if the dough is
perfectly dense circles are formed from
it which are then baked for 15 minutes
the filling is made of confectionery fat
with the addition of sugar powder
organic rice milk and other flavoring
additives such as vanilla or fruit
extract the filling is then rounded in
the workers pick up the whoopie pies and
send them to the conveyor belt leading
to the packing unit thanks to the
ingredients chosen whoopie pies shown on
the screen or lactose and gluten free</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
