all over the world are engaged in metal
forging this process makes it possible
to achieve the desired shape and size
using impacts a variety of non ferrous
and ferrous metals can be processed
aluminium and it's alloys copper
titanium and also iron are the most
common there are two types of forging
cold and hot in this case hot forging is
shown heat is used to make the workpiece
smooth and flexible in each case the
heating temperature is different
depending on the size of the metal part
the hardness and the type of metal
during the first stage of processing the
workpiece is heated and special furnaces
are used for this they can be combustion
and continuous furnaces sometimes
soaking pits and electrically heated
furnaces are used it should be noted
that the piece must be heated gradually
and uniformly only in this way can
internal tension in the metal be avoided
the next stage of processing is called
swaging the workpiece is subjected to an
impact so the metal is compacted and the
vacuum disappears the processing
equipment is called a hammer
this is a 14 machine with a strike mass
ranging from one kilogram to 5000 or
even more the record is 300 tonnes it
should be noted that during the process
there are inevitable Mills scales which
fall off on their own or are knocked
down with the help of the crowbar and
then cleaned up with a broom that's why
the metal is usually moulded larger and
heavier than necessary assuming it will
lose size in the fortun process
diamond mining here we can see the
Diavik diamond quarry located in Canada
300 kilometers northeast of the city of
Yellowknife every day thousands of tons
of stones have blown up in search of
diamonds after blasting the excavator
scatter stones that are more than two
and a half billion years old to reach
the kimberlite point this is the name of
the geological body formed as a result
of the ancient advance of magma through
the Earth's crust where the diamonds are
found the volcanic or extracted from the
pipe is loaded onto a 240 tonne dump
truck curiously although the ore at this
stage looks like a pile of common stones
each contains up to 700 carats of
diamonds in this condition these stones
are sent to production while processing
begins the first stage crushing is
carried out with the help of special
machines large stones are crushed to
obtain smaller stones but without
damaging the diamonds during this stage
the rocks become a mixture of small
stones
some of them precious but most of them
are rubbish
in the last stage the stones are divided
into small Lots and then submerged in
hot chemical baths after the bath the
rough diamonds are taken out
the creation of bells here we have the
Royal Arch Bounce foundry located in the
Netherlands and built in 1872 it should
be noted that since then the technology
of manufacturing bronze bells has not
changed much in the first stage the
master depending on the size of the Bell
he wants to create forms the external
and internal moulds then they come
together the internal mold is inserted
into the external the space formed
between the molds is filled with molten
bronze as soon as the metal cools the
molds are removed and the Bell is ready
interestingly the most difficult stage
in the creation of the Bell is the
manufacturing of the molds the material
used is clay which has applied layer by
layer until it acquires the desired
shape and size the masters admit that
the process is more complicated than it
seems if you over tighten the clay the
mold will fall apart if it's not sized
enough it also crumbles when the mold of
the dome is moulded it's covered with a
layer of graphite then the mold is
sprayed with sand forming a new layer it
has exactly the same size as the future
Bell when this layer is ready it's
covered with wax the resulting structure
is placed in the tank filled with sand
with additives and left for a couple of
days for contraction
after a few days the tank is turned over
and lifted inside the sand forms an
outline which is then used to make the
outer mold the sand layer is removed
from the inner mold as it's not needed
now you can start creating the bell the
shapes are combined so that the space
between them coincides perfectly with
the shape of the future bell the bronze
is poured so hot that it takes two weeks
to cool down that's the process doesn't
that they're the almost finished Bell
goes to the last processing department
where it's polished in different places
so that it finally has five notes
creation of lava lamps these decorative
lamps are assembled in two parts
the upper part is made of glass and the
lower part of plastic or metal the
construction of the glass part of the
lava lamp starts at the factory where
hot air is blown into a container filled
with hot glass the air fills the mold so
that the glass is distributed on the
walls and takes the desired shape keep
in mind that the glass part is something
like a bottle the machines in the
workshops stand out for their
extraordinary productivity creating up
to six thousand bottles per hour
if the glass cools too fast it will
crack so the bottles are placed on the
conveyor and then move through a tunnel
with straights temperature control which
gradually cools the material
at the same time the aluminium bases and
details for the lamps are made in
another workshop
the metal sheets are cut into circles
then cold Forge to the desired shape in
the meantime the bustles begin to fill
the liquid consisting of water dye and
chemical oil is poured into the interior
wax is also put inside the secret is
that at room temperature the wax sinks
as it's heavier than the oil and floats
to the surface at the top of a lamp the
wax then cools sinks begins to heats up
again and so on creating a cycle to heat
the wax and incandescent lamp is used
which is placed in the base before the
final assembly the bottles filled with
liquid and wax are placed in a hot bath
so that the wax melts and becomes our
liquid
production of Stressless chairs the
norwegian company a cornice a sa is
creating special chairs that adapt to
the position of the human body providing
maximum comfort the secrets of these
chairs is their design features the
production process is not easy though
but the plant produces up to 1250 chairs
per day in the first stage a round
elastic and durable base is created
trees known as European beaches are used
for their manufacture the layers of wood
had dried so that there's no moisture in
them and then glued together the rest of
the work is then done by robots as it's
quite dangerous for humans the glued
layers of wood are treated with a press
to give them a rounded shape then
they're cut and fold it to form a circle
another robot joins the likes to this
circle and the resulting element is
painted in addition to create the frame
metal and plastic event together the
wood base and metal skeleton begin to
resemble a chair the soft part consists
of a dense foam layer upholstered with a
soft foam layer a cowhide lining is
placed over the resulting detail please
note that each lining is hand laid the
air is extracted from the foam to reduce
its size and facilitate the installation
of the lining
