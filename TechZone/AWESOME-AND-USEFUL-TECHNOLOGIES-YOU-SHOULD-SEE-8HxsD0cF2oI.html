almost all modern designers use is
accent walls as the name suggests an
accent wall draws attention to itself
thanks to its bright color or
contrasting design it can be monotonic
patterns decorated with wood or stone
most importantly it stands out a simple
fast and efficient way to make an accent
wall is to put up voluminous wallpapers
here we can see a textile wallpaper by
the Belgian company Artur
the surface of the wall is soft and
pleasant at the touch it's thick warmer
provides optimal acoustics in the room
the manufacturer achieved a volume
effect using thermo forming technology
the pattern is applied on the heated
surface under pressure according to the
manufacturer the wallpaper was designed
precisely to bring life to the interior
and fit any style hidden sockets
traditional sockets are quite
comfortable but they have drawbacks and
therefore can be improved the main
disadvantage is that they aren't stylish
they protrude from the wall and they can
be dangerous if there are small children
in the house the best solution are
sockets that can be pushed inside the
wall or any other surface whether
installed today there are companies that
are working on this pop-out sockets
practically don't protrude from the wall
one assembled they can be activated by a
single click box sockets can be
installed in any furniture and also
appear only when needed
exit pool not everyone can afford to
have a swimming pool in the backyard
often the problem is not even the cost
but the fact that the pool takes up too
much space at the same time pools are
often used only in the summer while the
rest of the time they're pretty much
useless folding pools are the best
solution for people a dream of a pool
but don't want to build one the Dutch
company exit offers models in two sizes
400 by 200 centimeters and 540 by 250
centimeters
it's noteworthy that the installation is
simple and relatively quick it takes
about 45 minutes
the standard version comes with a filter
to purify the water and also a ladder
for safe immersion the walls are made of
a durable three layer combination of PVC
and polyester so you don't have to worry
about leaks the right shape of the pool
is provided by a strong metal frame the
price at the large pool is six hundred
and twenty dollars and the small one
costs five hundred and ten dollars the
manufacturer also offers a folding
canopy for the pool which protects it
from debris and allows you to swim in
bad weather the canopy costs $400
Tech take hedge trimmer here is a
lightweight compact Wireless tool
that'll keep the lawn and backyard
plants in a tidy aesthetic condition
this trimmer by the company tech take is
very small which is its main feature an
advantage with this tool you can work
very carefully in cramped conditions and
in hard-to-reach places the manufacturer
offers two nozzles one designed for
cutting branches the second for grass
the standard model includes a telescopic
handle that allows you to work in a
comfortable standing position rolling
the trimmer on the ground the instrument
runs on a lithium ion battery and it
charges in only 40 minutes you can buy
the tech tech hedge trimmer for $35
cordless multi-tool universal devices
are pretty useful in the household as
they usually combine a lot of different
tools perform a huge number of functions
and therefore save money and space in
the house on the screen you can see such
a device it's a wireless multi tool for
cutting which can be used for very
different tasks for example using its
protruding blade you can make a hole in
a plaster board walls
the semi-circular edge allows the tool
to work as a circular saw to cut wood
and any other not very rigid materials
other interchangeable nozzles that come
in the kit allow you to polish wood and
even clean the grooves left after
removing tiles the video demonstrates
how using just one nozzle skillfully and
quickly the user can cut as a person on
a pumpkin the cost of the tool is $100
techo we often clean our dirty hands in
the sink but the problem is that with
our dirty hands we often sustain the
faucet so we have to wash it all over
again specialists from the Chinese
company Tec hos smart home figured out
how to solve this problem they've
developed a sensor tip that turns any
ordinary tap into a smart and
user-friendly system after installing
tech out you don't have to touch
anything to use the water just hold your
hands under it and the sensor
registering the movement will forget to
supply water the device will not only
eliminate the need to clean the faucet
but it reduces the risk of getting sick
in the house after all the user doesn't
touch the faucet and doesn't leave any
microbes on it which then can be picked
up by another person note that with the
help techo you can adjust the angle of
the water supply to and it's also
equipped with light bulb so it's
comfortable to use even in the dark
adjustable sofa lego-like furniture
doesn't necessarily have to be an
incredibly complex structure here we
have a very simple sofa which however
can be transformed taking a variety of
forms the secret is that the furnitures
built from square modules that can be
installed on any side so you buy a unit
of furniture consisting of modules and
get a lots of choices
you can put together several chairs and
an ottoman a sofa with a footrest a
corner sofa a wide sofa and much more
the blocks can even be folded to build a
single or double bed transformation from
one form to another occurs in just a few
seconds the modules are light and
they're simply moved from place to place
magnetic wallpaper surely every person
at least once in their life dreamed of
transforming a familiar boring room in a
simple fast and inexpensive way changing
furniture isn't cheap but it can be
relatively easy but changing the color
of the walls or the person on them is a
complicated slow and long procedure
wallpapers that are mounted on the wall
using magnets can solve this problem
because you can change them as often as
you like
the procedure for putting up this
wallpaper resembles the procedure of
putting up any other standard wallpaper
first a magnetic layer is glued to the
wall and it will remain that then on top
of it you roll out the wallpaper itself
which will decorate the room the whole
process doesn't take much time and the
material is placed on the wall from the
top and then just rolled down</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
