and firefighters risk their lives every
day doing it for this reason it's very
important to develop mobile fire systems
capable of operating on remote control
the Lu f60 is a system developed by
Austrian specialists is able to
extinguish fires in open areas and an
enclosed spaces it can be used when the
rescuers can't get too close to the
danger zone it can perform three very
important functions the first is fire
fighting the system extinguishes the
fire with the Jets of water or special
foam the second is the ventilation of
the premises as well as the deposition
of smoke by spraying water
the third is decreasing the temperature
in the room using again water which has
sprayed in very small drops the range of
the water jet is 80 meters the range of
foam is 35 meters
despite the fact that the system weighs
2120 kilograms it stands out for its
mobility and agility as it can even
enter hard-to-reach places
the caterpillar design of the wheels
allows it to climb on inclined surfaces
however at an angle of maximum 30
degrees but the main advantage of course
is the remote control the operator can
be located at a distance of up to 300
meters from this system Sikorsky s-64
skycrane here we have a twin-engined
heavy helicopter designed in the US to
perform difficult tasks the Sikorsky
s-64 skycrane is a civilian version of a
heavy cargo helicopter used by the US
Army the helicopter proved to be very
effective in extinguishing wildfires
it's equipped with a patented and fixed
reservoir with a capacity of 10,000
laces it's noteworthy that loading the
Sikorsky s-64 skycrane with water takes
only 45 seconds the helicopter hovers
above the reservoir releasing a 46
centimeter thick hose this way the water
enters the tank this allows the
helicopter to act quickly extinguishing
fires and quickly throwing large
quantities of water into the fire it
holds up to five people as well and
speeds up to 203 km/h apart from the
United States these helicopters are used
in Italy and Korea in addition to
firefighting they used in emergency
response operations in civil protection
in wood production aims to lift heavy
structures it's interesting that each
helicopter has its own name so Elvis
Isabel and the Incredible Hulk
were used to fight fires in Australia
and with the help of Olga they built the
upper part of the CN Tower in Toronto
thermite's 3.0 sometimes firefighters
don't have the means to end a fire on
their own that's when a device like
thermite 3.0 comes to the rescue the
production of these fire robots is
carried out by the American company how
and how each robot is equipped with a
special water cannon capable of pumping
up to nine thousand four hundred and
sixty-three litres of water per minute
it's amazing that a single machine can
supply enough water under a huge
pressure in comparison to supply water
under the same pressure using a standard
hose it would take six to eight people
working together the robot is made of
durable fire resistant aircraft grade
aluminium and steel and it moves on a
crawler platform this design allows it
to reach difficult areas putting out
fires in dangerous and inaccessible
places control is carried out by the
operator using a remote control
thermite 3.0 is equipped with a camera
which streams the video to the operator
panel this increases the accuracy of
control over the robots helping to
respond faster in case of emergency it's
amazing but the radius of control over
the radio reaches thousands of
kilometers the manufacturer claims that
this is the safest most durable and most
reliable robot on the market suitable
for extinguishing fires of any size and
any kind
extinguishing robots don't let the
compact dimensions of this firefighting
robot deceive you this little robot
weighing only 480 kilograms
166 centimeters long 75 centimeters tall
is capable of shooting water at a
distance equal to the length of a
football field
the radius have remote control in an
open area is 3 kilometers if there's an
obstacle between the operator and the
robot the radius is reduced to 500
meters which isn't bad at all the robot
is not only effective spraying water at
a distance of up to 85 meters but also
very technological it's equipped with a
thermal imaging detector to ensure high
image quality in any condition even if
everything around is dusty and smoky
also there's an infrared thermal imager
which makes it easy to track the source
of the heat
the caterpillar platform together with
its compact dimensions gives the robot
an amazing passing ability it climbs
into narrow tunnels impenetrable and
inaccessible places you can even go up
and down the stairs despite its modest
size it has a lifting capacity of up to
1 Tomic this allows using it to save
wounded people who can't move
independently a low stretcher has
attached the robot so it can enter the
burning building and take out wounded
persons
the air owns firefighting drone a
standard fire engine is capable of
extinguishing a fire at a height of up
to 17 meters sadly every year there are
more skyscrapers so it was necessary to
come up with a fundamentally new
solution for extinguishing high altitude
fires the air owns firefighting drone is
able to fly up to a height of 300 to 400
meters extinguishing fires even at great
heights in a very short time the drone
needs six minutes to reach an altitude
of 300 meters there are two cables
connected to it one is the power supply
and the other is the water supply the
weight of the drone is 55 kilograms and
it's 3 metres wide the first drones
worked at the expense of the battery
which reduced the time of work to 30
minutes today's models can be in the air
for as long as necessary until the fire
is completely eliminated it's noteworthy
that the carrying capacity of the drone
is a hundred and forty five kilograms
this means that it can perform rescue
operations for example pull people out
of the windows of high burning buildings
the video demonstrates how a man is
pulled out from a lake by the drone
pyro lands some weapons take people's
lives but the weapons used by
firefighters are designed to save them
the pyro Lance is a unique water jet
that looks more like a rifle instead of
cartridges than ammo however it uses a
jet of water under ultra-high pressure
about eighty four kilograms per cubic
centimeter because of the high pressure
the drops emitted by the water cannon
ask sixty four times smaller than
ordinary drops so the water stream is 16
and even 20 times more efficient thanks
to this design thus the pyro Lance
absorbs heat as quickly as possible
which makes extinguishing fires really
quick while reducing the amount of water
used thanks to the fact that these micro
droplets have a minimum weight they hang
in the air
absorbing heat more efficiently in
addition they move more easily through
the air spreading beyond the area where
the firefighters are working the flow of
water also contains non metallic
particles which don't heat up and don't
create sparks at the same time pyro
Lance releases them under such high
pressure that they're able to pass
through any material it breaks through
six centimeters of composite material in
six seconds in 30 seconds the pyro Lance
punches a hole in a brick wall and after
fifty-five seconds it makes a hole in
steel thus firefighters can break a hole
in a wall and with the help of water
lower the temperature in the room before
entering hey stop being lazy it's time
to use that brain of yours welcome to
brain time incredible facts from the
past the present and even the future the
power of nature and wild animals amazing
facts and unsolved mysteries you'll find
all this and much more hair subscribe
