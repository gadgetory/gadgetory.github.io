beep car manufacturing companies are
constantly competing for the most
original way to show off their product
for example in 2017 land rover placed
the world's largest speed bump on one of
the streets of Great Britain its height
was comparable to the height of an
average passenger car of course the road
users were not able to overcome such a
serious obstacle when it seems that the
bump was insuperable the land rover
evoque was released on the road the car
easily coped with the obstacle
confirming the slogan of the company
born in the wild
adapted to the city the secret of the
trick is the unrivaled skill of the
driver and the built-in Terrain Response
system it includes electronic stability
control anti rollover stabilization and
traction control
trophy truck Chevrolet the Baja 1000 is
probably the most famous off-road
competition in North America the main
opponents of the races though is the
extreme course cussing through the most
northern states of Mexico Baja
California not any race that would be
able to overcome the numerous descents
in a sense even tuned SUVs experienced
difficulties
according to Monster Energy this was the
perfect place for a test the driver
ballistic BJ Baldwin was going to carry
out he is a recognized champion and has
won a huge number of awards and the car
he drives is a real monster the SUV is
equipped with a seven and a half liter
800 horsepower engine with 935 Newton
meters of torque in every 100 kilometers
the trophy truck Chevrolet consumes 76
litres of fuel despite a very powerful
heavy and strong frame the car is able
to accelerate up to a speed of 240 km/h
therefore it's not surprising that this
pickup can overcome even the most
terrifying obstacles it is worth noting
that in this case BJ Baldwin had an
additional incentive to drive the track
flawlessly the whole race was an attempt
to beat Dan Bilzerian his friend poker
player and actor in an argument the
commercial shows such an impressive ride
that there's no doubt about the outcome
of the but the trophy truck Chevrolet
jumps over streets stairs and even
people
Ford Focus RS rx
this video was recorded with the support
of the hoonigan motorsport team and the
video game Forza horizon 3 released in
2016 the video shows a series of amazing
very dangerous tricks the inspiration
for these tricks was the already
mentioned Forza horizon game series air
is a car with a capacity of 600
horsepower the Ford Focus RS rx Gymkhana
9 the maximum speed isn't too high
though just 232 km/h but the car
perfectly counts with sharp turns and
breaks quickly can block an American
racing driver in schoneman is behind the
wheel he has repeatedly participated in
a variety of competitions he is a master
of skateboarding snowboarding motocross
and of course rally and rallycross in
this case the racer demonstrates
Gymkhana tricks this is a kind of motor
sport popular in Japan South Africa as
well as in the United States and Britain
Gymkhana courses are incredibly
difficult the purpose of the competition
is no different from other races it is
necessary to complete the track in the
shortest amount of time usually racing
routes are designed so that the driver
uses only the first and second dakea
there are cones tires barrels and other
obstacles on the track the driver must
go through the track in a predetermined
order by doing so he demonstrates a
variety of driving techniques for
example quite often riders have to
perform 180 and 360 degree turns you can
also see backward riding or eight ken
Block is one of the best pilots in this
type of motorsport the tricks shown in
this video are so complicated that if
the professional can't cope with them on
their first attempt for example this
manoeuvre was performed after 10 tries
at some point under the rear wheels of
the car as a 6 meter cliff notice that
all the tricks were performed by a
professional racer do not try to repeat
them with your
car just in case there was an oxygen
tank in the interior of the Ford Focus
RS rx also there were divers on duty in
the water
formula off-road driving on water
it's easy to imagine a 1600 horsepower
engine inside an incredibly cool sports
car like the Hennessey Venom f5 but look
at this car it also has a 1600
horsepower engine inside amazing driving
skills as well as the outstanding
characteristics of the car have allowed
a man named good beyond Grimson to break
the world record for hydroplaning during
the formula off-road competition in
Iceland the man literally drove on water
at a speed of 87 km/h he covered a
distance of 305 metres in just seven
seconds the races here on the screen is
held annually in Iceland it is
noteworthy that most of the Motorsports
were born and developed in the US
however formula off-road is an exception
Iceland as a fairly hilly terrain and is
almost entirely off-road so you know
it's the perfect place for this event at
first glance the vehicles participating
in the competition appear to be ordinary
buggies nevertheless they have a unique
design the body is most often taken from
the chief Wrangler while the wheels have
off-road tractor tires in general there
aren't any restrictions in terms of
modifications the car should only have
two axles B four-wheel drive and weigh
at least 600 kilograms as it's not
difficult to guess riders assemble their
own vehicles in our opinion the most
spectacular part of the course is the
one that's located on the water or mud
in order for the car to be able to
overcome this section it's equipped with
huge protruding superscooper tires with
solid rubber paddles their special
design makes it easy for the driver to
drive on loose sand dirt and water with
juice Gill
formula off-road rock crawling
and here's the main part of the course
of the formula off-road this is an
incredibly spectacular sport usually
cars for rock crawling climb the hills
slowly showing the wonders of balancing
but this is completely different the
races of formula off-road are going
straight up the hill without even
slowing down racetracks are often built
for climbing hills with crumbling rocks
some of them are as steep as 90 degrees
and everyone's fine with that in about
half the cases the cars don't reach this
hot the loose sound and too steep ascent
make them slide downwards under the
deafening applause of the audience only
the coolest drivers can overcome such a
difficult obstacle drivers pay a lot
attention to the wheels they can be
modified with the help of ground hooks
and other additions all in order to
maximize the grip on the ground most
often these vehicles are equipped with
v-shaped turbocharged engines with an
output of about 800 horsepower nitrous
oxide helps them overcome particularly
steep sections of the routes too
