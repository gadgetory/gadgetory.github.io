is a move that allows you to score a
goal to your opponent's since it's
considered to be technically quite
difficult athletes spend a lot of time
practicing it here is a simulator for
practicing this volleyball shot it
allows you to repeatedly hit the ball
without needing to constantly return the
ball to its original position the basket
can hold up to 11 balls the device
automatically serves the ball each time
placing it at the right height it's
noteworthy that the construction stone
has an adjustable height as well thanks
to this beginners can practice a shot
standing up and professionals can train
while jumping on top of everything else
the simulator allows use of practice
defense techniques to
alpine skiing and snowboarding everyone
is used to the fact that training for
skiers and snowboarders takes a lot of
time and is very inconvenient as a rule
the training ground is either far from
the city or it takes up a lot of space
not to mention the fact that the
training grounds are very difficult to
maintain here is a simulator that can
solve this problem this is a downhill
simulator created by the specialists of
the Russian companies sky Tech sport
every second the sensors read dozens of
parameters from the position of the skis
or the bores to the pressure on them
thanks to this the reaction of the
simulator the athletes movements and the
slope behaviour are absolutely realistic
in terms of physics the person who
trains can reach a speed of 120 or 140
kilometers per hour at the same time the
user experiences the same load and
acceleration as if they were moving on a
real slope it's noteworthy that the
equipment recreates three-dimensional VR
copies of mountain ranges with the help
of the GLONASS navigation system the
three section panoramic screen can be
used to downhill any mountain world the
developers have even placed trees in the
places where they actually grow thus the
athletes not only trained working out
the movements but also remember the real
existing tracks on which they have to
compete
baseball the key to success in any sport
is the relentless and persistent
repetition of keen movements in baseball
when it comes to the batter the main
movement is hitting the ball here is a
simulator designed specifically to help
athletes practice it
the main inconvenience of traditional
training is that the ball can fly far
enough away on impact
searching forwards and then returning it
takes up precious time which could be
used more productively the skills hits
away prevents the ball from flying away
thanks to its special design the shooter
can perform up to 500 strokes in just an
hour of training the advantage of the
design is its compactness the skills
heads away can be attached to any post
beam or tree interestingly the cost of
the simulator is only $30
swimming this may sound amazing but
swimmers don't necessarily train in
Walter kayak pro swim fast is a special
equipment that allows you to train when
time or space is limited it's an elastic
swinging platform capable of monitoring
the pace speed and power of each
movement one of the advantages of swim
fast is the fact that it allows you to
develop specific force levels with loads
higher or lower than those produced by
water the swimmer also has the ability
to Train the upper arm belt separately
ie
while the other muscles are relaxed the
resistance level can also be set
manually moreover these simulator
guarantees the same resistance on both
the left and right sides thus a single
device significantly increases endurance
strength and improved swimming
techniques
growing some sports due to their
peculiarities don't allow athletes to
train all year round for example in
Scandinavian countries this applies to
kayaking and canoeing lakes and rivers
freeze in the winter and the weather's
windy so it's not possible to train in
the water that's why some companies have
developed simulators like the one that
you can see on the screen
kayak Pro speed stroke according to the
athletes allows you to work on your
rowing technique adjusting the
resistance the main advantage is that
the simulator creates forces similar to
those experienced during a race speed
stroke is equipped with an electronic
system which can adjust the length of
the paddle as well as the angle and
height of the seat and that resistance
the time distance and rowing pace are
displayed on the screen the simulator is
even able to show the heart rate and
time of the selected distance note the
compactness and the ability of the
design when training is over speed
stroke isn't going to take up extra
space it's worth noting that kayak pro
wishes to expand the training
capabilities of all rowing athletes
that's why specialists have also created
a rowing simulator on a sub board
hockey hockey is the ninth most popular
sport in the world if we take into
account only winter sports then hockey
is undoubtedly in first place it's not
surprising though the manufacturers of
sports goods around the world are
developing a variety of equipment for
hockey training
first of all we'd like to show you a
simulator known as the super dica
perhaps its main advantage is its
compactness athletes can hone their
skills and improve their playing
technique anywhere even at home the
super DK is a small device with an area
where the puck slides in the same way as
it slides on the ice on the hockey field
the main advantage of the simulator is
that it helps you to improve your stick
skills bright LED lamps are installed in
the field when they light up the trainee
should move the puck to us as soon as
possible the device can operate in three
different modes the most complex is
called the hotshot mode and is designed
exclusively for professional hockey
players the LEDs lights up for just one
second the retail price is 280 dollars
another simulator was developed by
hockey shots and is called the extreme
defender it's a pair of skates and a
stick the construction imitates a
defense player on the fields the athlete
can practice by passing tactics it's
known worthy that these simulator can
slide on the ice if you push it in this
case the trainees task becomes more
complicated extreme defender as the
ideal device for such a challenging
technique as the sorcerer pass the price
of the extreme defender is a hundred and
twelve dollars
and finally the last hockey simulator
that we'll show you today was also
created by hockey shot specialists the
speed deke is designed to perform
individual puck and Club exercises this
is an ideal device for athletes of
different skill levels the height and
position of the feet can be adjusted use
more than one speed date to create an
entire obstacle course that now everyone
can overcome easily its cost is $67
