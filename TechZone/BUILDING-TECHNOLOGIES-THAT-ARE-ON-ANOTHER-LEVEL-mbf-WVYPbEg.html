most popular material in any
construction is used to make foundations
floors and walls
in addition mixtures with cements are
used for cladding and of course concrete
is indispensable for road repair work
therefore every specialist knows that
it's sometimes difficult to give this
material the desired shape the curb
roller is a tool designed to solve this
problem
it's a surprisingly functional practical
and convenient machine for the
production of curbstones
previous leads who creates a perfectly
smooth curve without sharp edges it was
necessary to hire a builder with wide
experience in this field with the curb
roller a person with minimal knowledge
and experience can create a curb
typically concrete curved construction
machines have a bulky design while a
kerb roller is compact and mobile and
weighs only 72 kilograms in addition it
increases productivity on the
construction site and saves time and
money together with a kerb roller it's
possible to obtain 28 replaceable drums
for the manufacture of grooves and edges
of different shapes the manufacturer
also offers the production of drums on
demand new juror blocks traditionally
wooden molds are used in construction to
form walls foundations and floor slabs
their construction is simple and
effective but they're quite bulky and
heavy that is they are not perfect the
American company new juror offers an
alternative solution insulated concrete
sandwich forms their main characteristic
is that the material for the manufacture
is polystyrene foam the blocks are
therefore lightweight and easy to
transport from one place to another in
addition they significantly expand the
construction possibilities as they can
be easily changed in shape the mold can
be shortened at any time the unnecessary
part is simply carton that removed
today different types of insulated
concrete formwork are used in
construction for example those seen on
the screen have integrated steel
framework another feature of this design
is this unlike the traditional one it is
not removed afterwards polystyrene foam
blocks remain on the sites of the
hardened mortar and serve as thermal
insulators it is important to specify
that this permanent formwork does not
support any structural loads in summary
we can say that the use of these blocks
accelerates the pace of construction
increases the structural strength of the
buildings and ensures a minimum
production of debris at the construction
site
Lego bricks LEGO bricks as we know them
today appeared in 1949 only recently
however did construction companies
decide to take advantage of that design
today LEGO bricks that repeat the shape
of original LEGO pieces are becoming
more and more popular all over the world
the difference between these and
traditional bricks can be seen even with
the naked eye first of all every
components of the future wall has slots
it is their presence that gives the
whole system very valuable advantages
these bricks stack on top of each other
much more quickly and easily at the same
time the strength of the construction is
not affected and other differences the
peculiarities of manufacture and
material Lego bricks are created through
the hydro-pressure of a product created
as a result of sizing crushed gravel
through special sips
these brakes don't need to be baked
which also reduces the cost of
production at any time a hole can be
made in the block to fix the structure
with reinforcement steel in addition the
strength is increased with a special
solution which is poured into the holes
of the blocks in the construction
process this is how blocks the various
shapes are produced which can then be
used to build even a rounded corner
I surround Viets who if you need to
create an underfloor heating by hot
water it's necessary to install a
special layer of thermal insulation on
the concrete base during the
construction process today there are
several manufacturing technologies the
most effective and highest quality
results is achieved with the use of
polystyrene foam these panels exclude
the unwanted loss of heat and directed
upwards
don't break Li to the heated floor
surface pay attention to these
cylindrical protrusions their height is
about 20 to 25 millimetres the cylinders
are positioned in relation to each other
in order to optimally fix the heating
pipes the workers simply place them
between the protrusions the video shows
the thermal insulation panels produced
by the Canadian company isola foam group
the system is called Eisler rad Viets
who and among other advantages has a
very simple installation procedure the
panels have a kind of lock on each side
so that they just click into place
gorilla gripper perhaps the most common
problem faced by workers is moving
materials around the worksite the fact
is that they're often heavy and have
uncomfortable shapes and sharp edges you
have to get the hang of it to be able to
pick them up and in the transportation
process the person feels discomfort and
sometimes even pain gorilla gripper is a
small and surprising device that can
greatly simplify the work tasks of the
builders it is a clamp for transporting
various materials in sheet the gorilla
gripper will allow you to easily and
effortlessly lift the sheets of material
and then move it to the right place the
clamp is designed to automatically
adjust the thickness of the material if
you look closely you can see the rubber
pad attached to the handle it serves to
protect the material from damage there
is also a rubber surface on the handle
of the holder so as to not affect your
hands during transportation the
manufacturer guarantees a firm grip on
the panel's preventing them from falling
out in this way even the most fragile
and expensive materials can be
transported with the device the gorilla
gripper is suitable for moving gypsum
palace chipboard MDF doors and workshops
and it's price is $50
brick cutting the Dutch company ulrich
bv manufactures various brick cutting
equipment a large number of models are
available to meet the needs of various
contractors and construction projects
the use of this equipment becomes
indispensable in a wide variety of
situations for example it's useful when
building a wall installing a furnace
carrying out lining work or installing
sidewalks all of these tasks involve the
use of bricks of special shapes and
dimensions making these bricks on demand
would be difficult expensive and
impractical
therefore standard size materials are
cut to the required size previously a
pallet and a hammer we used to cut the
bricks but this method didn't allow for
high precision cutting the equipment
shown on the screen doesn't have that
disadvantage the bricks are molded
immediately and there's no possibility
of error which also eliminates
unnecessary construction waste
hey stop being lazy it's time to use
that brain of yours welcome to brain
time incredible facts from the past the
present and even the future the power of
nature and wild animals amazing facts
and unsolved mysteries you'll find all
this and much more hair subscribe now
