electric machine designed to work with
ceramic tiles is ideal for cutting tiles
glazed porcelain tiles and other
materials the works carried out by means
of a moving diamond cutting disc with a
diameter of 200 millimeters
the motor cutting unit as a mobile
structure and can be bent to create a
bevel due to the fact that the cutting
takes place essentially in water dust is
prevented from flying in all directions
the cuts can either be wet or dry the
manufacturer offers two models of tile
cutters the D u 200 L has a table size
of 850 by 400 millimeters
and the deu 200 lb L has equipped with a
1000 by 400 millimeter table this
equipment is produced by the comfort in
groovy the machine has been created for
jobs with an average load level
the micro mill not all CNC milling
machines feature a combination of
compact size and high performance the
micro mill is a device created by
experts from Rp 3d it's a three axis
machine that fits on the desktop and
it's controlled by a computer and allows
you to create precise and crafted parts
from a variety of materials this
numerically controlled device is ideal
for factories and small businesses as it
will simplify production and the work of
designers
the device processes materials
absolutely silently and as a closed
designs and minimize debris the
manufacturer says that micro mill is a
versatile tool as you can work with any
material as long as it's softer than
steel in addition the device is
lightweight and mobile can we move it
around the office and is easy to take
home and to work with the micro mill
takes up no more table space than an a4
sheet and you can buy this machine for
about $800
QBO with constantly improving devices
it's becoming easier every year to
create and transform your home into an
art studio one such device is QBO
a compact easy to use laser engraver
when we say compact we mean it the
device is so small and light that it
easily fits in a bag so you can engrave
objects anyway it's very easy to operate
using a special mobile application on
your smartphone you can select any
drawing or inscription
the laser engraver is placed in the
correct position and after pressing the
button starts creating the selected
image on the surface QBO can be used to
create engravings on cardboard fabric
leather cockerel and wood it's not
suitable for working with harder
materials such as mass or glass or
ceramics in the application that
controls the gadgets you can set a
password for additional security and
she'll be noted that the engraver is
equipped with a motion detector if the
engraving object suddenly changes
position during operation the laser
switches off instantly QBO can be
purchased for $700
mix G 1 plus and the Prusa i3 plus
desktop 3d printers were introduced at
the mark is a long time ago but each
year they become more sophisticated and
functional their main goal is the use of
cheap materials such as plastic
affordability makes production almost
unlimited
in 2014 the key Angua company
demonstrated two models of its own 3d
printer according to the developer the
mix g1 plus and the Prusa i3 plus
provided the best print qualities a day
advantages of the Prusa i3 plus include
increased frame stiffness a symbol
assembly procedure the ability to print
large objects and a highly
understandable assembly guide the
advantages of the mix g1 plus include a
flexible and variable frame which can
achieve a larger print size as well as a
simple assembly procedure impulsively
the printers are also relatively
affordable the cost of a standard 3d
printer is approximately 2,200 dollars
for the mix g1 plus is 470 and the Prusa
i3 plus is 490 dollars
Volterra people are used to simplifying
everything so that the execution of
daily tasks doesn't take long coffee can
be made at the press of a button you can
order a taxi with a couplet apps on your
smartphone screen the creation of
printed circuit boards is not included
in the list of easy processes their
production is a long and laborious job
requiring a lot of manual skill the
specialists are Volterra decided to put
an end to this this company is developed
equipment that meets modern day
standards and allows printed circuit
boards to be created by pressing a
couple of buttons
while Sarah is a compact machine that
can even work at home the device uses
inkjet printing with a special
conductive composition based on silver
and is something like a printer or
plotter which prints on the PCB
it should be noted that the device can
even create double layer printed circuit
boards this is because the printhead in
just a few seconds can be replaced by
another which prints with an insulating
compound a third head performs the
function of a solder paste dispenser and
you can buy the device for $1,200
knitter rate here we have a unique
device which is essentially a printer
for printing clothes of various
materials it's much easier to operate
than traditional missing machines but at
the same time it's relatively
inexpensive and affordable compared to
industrial equipment knitter aid can
create garments from a variety of
materials such as wool cotton and
acrylic the device can print simple
garments such as a tie or a scarf
completely independently but if you want
to create a more complex object from
several pieces the person will have to
help the device out knits arrayed
creates the different parts of the
garments and the person combines them
together
it should be noted that a fabric created
has exactly the same quality as if it
were woven in the traditional way to
create a model you can use absolutely
any graphic program and the model can be
imported into the knitter race
application with a couple of clicks the
main advantages of the equipments are
its compactness as well as its high
speed for example creating the
components of a woman's long dress takes
no more than five hours the cost of
knitter eight is $7,500
