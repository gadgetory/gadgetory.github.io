designers
the device processes materials
absolutely silently and as a closed
designs and minimize debris the
manufacturer says that micro mill is a
versatile tool as you can work with any

leather cockerel and wood it's not
suitable for working with harder
materials such as mass or glass or
ceramics in the application that
controls the gadgets you can set a
password for additional security and
she'll be noted that the engraver is
equipped with a motion detector if the
engraving object suddenly changes
position during operation the laser
switches off instantly QBO can be
purchased for $700
mix G 1 plus and the Prusa i3 plus
desktop 3d printers were introduced at
the mark is a long time ago but each
year they become more sophisticated and
functional their main goal is the use of
cheap materials such as plastic
affordability makes production almost
unlimited
in 2014 the key Angua company
demonstrated two models of its own 3d
printer according to the developer the
mix g1 plus and the Prusa i3 plus
provided the best print qualities a day
advantages of the Prusa i3 plus include
increased frame stiffness a symbol
assembly procedure the ability to print
large objects and a highly
understandable assembly guide the
advantages of the mix g1 plus include a
flexible and variable frame which can
achieve a larger print size as well as a
simple assembly procedure impulsively
the printers are also relatively
affordable the cost of a standard 3d
printer is approximately 2,200 dollars
for the mix g1 plus is 470 and the Prusa
i3 plus is 490 dollars
Volterra people are used to simplifying
everything so that the execution of
daily tasks doesn't take long coffee can
be made at the press of a button you can
order a taxi with a couplet apps on your

can even work at home the device uses
inkjet printing with a special
conductive composition based on silver
and is something like a printer or
plotter which prints on the PCB
it should be noted that the device can
even create double layer printed circuit
boards this is because the printhead in

another which prints with an insulating
compound a third head performs the
function of a solder paste dispenser and
you can buy the device for $1,200
knitter rate here we have a unique
device which is essentially a printer
for printing clothes of various
materials it's much easier to operate
than traditional missing machines but at

were woven in the traditional way to
create a model you can use absolutely
any graphic program and the model can be
imported into the knitter race
application with a couple of clicks the
main advantages of the equipments are
its compactness as well as its high
speed for example creating the
components of a woman's long dress takes
no more than five hours the cost of
knitter eight is $7,500
