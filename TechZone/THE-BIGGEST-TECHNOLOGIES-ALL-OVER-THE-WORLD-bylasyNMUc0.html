aircraft
turbofan engine produced by the American
multi industry corporation General
Electric it all began in 1973 when the
US Navy started operating the f-14 a
aircraft the course speed needed a
suitable engine at first it was decided
to use the Pratt &amp;amp; Whitney TF 30 model
but in the late seventies it turned out
that the engine caused problems so the
company decided to improve it
the advantage of the new engine was
there were no more operational problems
however the efficiency and thrust
correspond to those of the previous
model and were lower than the
requirements for the f-14 finally in
1979 it was decided to use the GE f-101
engine which was later renamed that
became the f1 10 GE 400
the engine you see on the screen is a
modified version of it and is known as
the f110 GE 100 first created in 1984
has a two stage compressor and two
turbines it has a diameter of one point
one eight meters and a length of 426 two
meters the traction provided by this
model is a twelve thousand seven hundred
kilogram force it's noteworthy that
today these engines are used in the
multifunctional four generation liked
fighters General Dynamics f-16 Fighting
Falcon the fighters have been equipped
with it since 1984 before that they use
the Pratt &amp;amp; Whitney f100 engines the
reason for a place in the engine was the
feather the f110 ge 100 had a much
higher traction in the Pratt &amp;amp; Whitney
f100
these super guppy if you've ever thought
about how large heavy and oversized
cargoes are transported the vehicle on
the screen is the answer to this
question the super guppy is a cargo
aircraft developed by aero spacelines
specifically for transporting heavy
loads its first flight took place in
1965 and it's noteworthy that's although
more than 50 years of parsons then the
super guppy continues to operate however
only five units were produced in two
modifications
be very for super guppy was built using
the fuselage of the boeing c 97 military
transport aircraft a military version of
the boeing 377 however it was modified
so its length is 43 meters and the
maximum inside diameter is seven point
six meters flatten Whitney's t-34 p7
turbine engines increase the vessels
payload to twenty four thousand five
hundred and forty five kilograms and
cruising speed to four hundred and
eighty kilometers per hour the super
guppy of the second modification
received the prefix turbine it's
equipped with the allison t56 turboprop
engines and the fuselage was redesigned
increasing the floor width of the cargo
area to four metres the length of the
compartment was also increased to thirty
three point eight meters and the payload
was upgraded to twenty four thousand
seven hundred kilograms the plane you
see on the screen is the last of the
five aircraft produced and it belongs to
NASA the aircraft is based at ellington
Field Airport in Houston Texas and it's
used to deliver large sized items for
the ISS the remaining four are now
mothballs and are located in the United
States United Kingdom France and Germany
overburden conveyor bridge f60 looking
at this huge conveyor bridge locater
than the Elba Esther district of Germany
one can easily guess why people often
call it a lying Eiffel Tower a total of
five such bridges were designed and
built between 1969 and 1991 by tack
craft this series of bridges was named
after 64 reasons to the number 60
indicates the thickness of the
overburden in metres which determines
the capacity
this bridge in particular as well as the
other three a location in different
parts of Germany and are still used for
open-pit mining the fifth bridge located
in the lusatia region was turned into a
large-scale Museum in 2002 which anyone
can visit the bridge is 80 meters high
240 metres wide and 502 meters long and
the working weight is thirteen thousand
six hundred tonnes what's more
surprising is that with such impressive
dimensions the giant construction can
move independently it's official full
name is the sloth propelled automated
unit providing transportation of
overburden from excavators to internal
dumps of quarry's by the shortest way in
case you don't know overburden is a
hollow rock that covers mineral deposits
such as a coal seam the structure
consists of a main bridge with a dumping
site and while not connecting conveyors
that transport the overburden these
supports are equipped with a wheel rail
mechanism these overburden conveyor
bridges are the world's largest mobile
industrial technical equipment
the MSC maravilla cruise ships bring
huge profits to their owners so it's not
surprising that are always trying to
build them bigger and more luxurious the
vessel you see on the screen is owned
and operated by the geneva-based company
MSC Cruises it was built at the STX
Europe trip yard in San Lazare France
please ceremonial launch took place in
June 2017 at that time the MSC
memorabilia was the 4th largest cruise
line in the world the first three are
lioness of the Oasis series by the Royal
Caribbean cruises
the mayor of Ilya is 315 point eight
three meters long 43 meters wide means
72 metres tall the dimensions as well as
the capacity are striking the liner was
designed to accommodate 4,500 passengers
and 1536 crew members the MSC maravilla
is the first of two twin Lynas
the second one being the MSC bellisima
and is scheduled to be launched in 2019
passengers who decide to go on a trip on
this liner before themselves in more
than comfortable conditions smaller
devices can be used on board thanks to
the near field communication technology
with its help passengers will be able to
communicate with each other as well as
to watch the schedule of events and the
shipping primary activities accordingly
this high-tech vessel allows you to take
bills open your cabin check the location
of your family or even find friends with
the help of a cruise map through small
fare the ceiling of this ship is a 480
square metre LED screen on this digital
sky you can see a variety of images
other features of the liner include a
Sun Deck beauty salons restaurants a
theatre an amusement park and even and
waterpark
Harriett since humankind learned about
electricity and began to use it for
their own benefit the demand for it is
constantly growing people use more and
more electrical appliances which
regularly leads to something that each
of us is experienced at least once in
our lives a massive blackout in order to
meet the needs of all people engineers
are developing new and increasingly
powerful ways to generate electricity in
2011 for example the construction of the
world's most powerful gas turbine
harriet again
it was developed at the General Electric
plant in Bell for France its capacity is
five hundred thousand horsepower this
turbine will allow the power plant to
generate up to six hundred megawatts of
electricity thus providing electricity
for up to six hundred thousand homes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
