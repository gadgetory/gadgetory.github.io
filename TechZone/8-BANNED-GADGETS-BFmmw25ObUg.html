electric blanket blankets with heating
are very popular in cold countries and
beyond the temperature is set manually
the areas can have different degrees of
heating and they can even be washed in a
washing machine despite the huge number
of benefits and the undoubted
improvement in the comfort of human life
they are banned in a number of countries
the combination of flammable materials
and a large amount of heat has caused
concern among safety experts
and not in vain for example according to
experts in the UK alone about 5,000
fires occur each year and the main cause
is the violation of safety precautions
when using electric clothes
another problem with these blankets is
the risk of burning for people who are
not able to feel pain or react
adequately to it that means small
children elderly people and also people
with diabetes
ecig arete if you ever get annoyed that
people in public places vape that is
Smoke electronic cigarettes you will
surely be happy now because in most
countries they are being banned
electronic cigarettes have a variety of
forms some use them to inhale nicotine
and others simply smoke flavored vapor
initially electronic cigarettes were
offered as a more harmless alternative
to conventional cigarettes it was also
claimed that with the help of wakes
vapes you can get rid of your nicotine
addiction in 2008 it was found that
there is not enough evidence to say that
it helps to quit smoking different
countries forbid vapes because they
create an attractive image of a smoker
which increases their popularity among
non-smokers in 2009 it was found that
the nicotine contained in these
cigarettes was more than it should have
been
moreover some cigarettes were marked
without nicotine but they still had some
and although advertising companies want
us to believe that electronic cigarettes
are safe in fact no one knows if they
are safe
so EU vape
Samsung Galaxy Note seven the phone you
see on the screen was shown on August
2nd 2016 the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 was
officially launched on August 19th of
the same year this improved version of
the previous model ran on the android
6.0.1 OS and has a very powerful system
despite this users around the world
experienced problems with this gadget
and in some countries it was completely
banned so in the US you could find
bulletins warning about the ban on the
use of galaxy note 7 on October 11th
2016 the phone was discontinued Samsung
asked the stores to stop selling it and
users were advised to turn it off and
stop using the reason for this were
multiple incidents with phone
overheating smoke coming out of it and
even fire as it turned out due to an
error in the design of the batteries the
smart phones cannot stand the power and
melted right in their hands in order to
prevent such incidents in the future
Samsung introduced new procedures to
control the quality of its devices
laser pointers as it turned out even
this absolutely safe toy can cause a car
accident and even crash an entire
aircraft laser pointers are a portable
tool that can generate electromagnetic
waves in a visible range in the form of
a narrow beam the rarest are green
pointers they have a wavelength on the
rage of 510 to 530 nanometers which is
near the maximum sensitivity of the
Twilight vision of a person for this
reason the green laser beam looks
brighter than others
therefore infrared filters should be
installed in these devices nevertheless
cheap models often don't have them so if
you aim at someone's eyes for a long
time you can damage their eyesight this
is just one of the reasons why the
pointer is banned in many countries
where their use is severely restricted
it turns out that the Ray of some
powerful pointers after hitting the eyes
can cause blindness if this happens with
a car driver or an airplane pilot this
can put endanger the lives of others for
a laser attack you can go to jail for a
couple of months or a dozen years
fidget spinner over the past few years
this toy has become frenziedly popular
and spread all over the world there is
truly a huge number of different
variations of this toy with different
size color and shape surprisingly the
design of some spinners can pose a
potential danger to humans we are
talking about sharpened edges or
protruding sharp parts which make them
look like cold steel arms careless
handling of these spinners can lead to
serious injury and therefore it was
decided to prohibit them
spy pen some countries are extremely
cautious about any objects that somehow
can be used to spy here we have a pen
with a built in camera that allows you
to record video and sound in superb
quality in accordance to its name the
looks of the pen don't reveal the
equipment inside
the good quality of the shooting is
remarkable filming at 30 frames per
second thus with the help of the device
you can quietly record the actions of
people their conversations and
everything happening around course most
people use the pen as a toy and it is
especially loved by spy movie fans
however no one knows for certain how and
for what purpose the device will be used
that's why if you try to carry a pen
with a built-in camera across the border
of most countries it would be
confiscated
Neill cube here we have an educational
toy designed to develop fine motor
skills but they can also be used for
stress relief neo cubes consist of a
large number of spherical magnets that
are attracted to each other and can
create bizarre shapes most often the
toys different size the diameter of the
balls varies from three to ten
millimeters despite the fact that the
toy looks extremely harmless and can
cause serious harm to humans the fact is
that young children tend to place the
toys on their mouths often swallowing
small details the ingestion of small
details of common toys often ends up
okay however since the magnet balls
attract each other swallowing two pieces
can lead to a trauma of the internal
organs for this reason some countries
decided to ban this dangerous toy
blackberry for the first time the
BlackBerry wireless communicator was
introduced in 1997 the first devices
looked like pagers and today these
mobile computers are popular all over
the world their advantages include a
QWERTY keyboard that simplifies data
entry and the ability to work with files
of a variety of formats another notable
feature of blackberries is the high
level of security
information between devices is
transmitted over encrypted channels
that's why many companies and even
officials use BlackBerry devices to
transmit sensitive data however high
security is not an advantage for
everyone
some countries have decided to locally
ban blackberry services the reason is
that such complex encryption does not
allow law enforcement agencies and
special services to intercept messages
and track user activity</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
