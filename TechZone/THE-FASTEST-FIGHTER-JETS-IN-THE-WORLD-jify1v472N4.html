fourth-generation fighter was developed
by d'Assaut aviation the development of
the Rafael aircraft began in 1983 it can
be used as a strike fighter bomber and
an interceptor guaranteeing air
superiority and air defense it can also
be used for bombing ground targets
Profiles construction is based on the
tailless scheme for the large triangular
wing with big influxes in the front of
the vehicle as an additional high
horizontal stabilizer the wing has two
sections slats in one section ailerons
part of the wing is made from titanium
alloys while other parts are made of
carbon plastic
the power plants of the aircraft
consists of two two circuit turbojet
engines which are built with the latest
technologies and materials used in this
field f-35
these are phantom multifunctional
fifth-generation fighter bombers
developed by the American firm Lockheed
Martin in three versions a ground
fighter for the US Air Force a
short-range takeoff and vertical landing
fighter for the US Marine Corps and the
British Navy and a water fighter for the
Navy the f-35 aircraft are equipped with
air-to-air missiles as well as cruise
missiles adjustable bombs weighing up to
2,000 pounds cluster bombs guided air
bombs and anti-tank missiles especially
for the f-35 fighter bomber a four
barrel 25 millimeter caliber cannon was
created on the modified f-35 a a gun is
installed inside the aircraft above and
behind the left air intake and the
ammunition is a hundred and eighty
rounds for the f-35b and f-35c
a suspended rear container with 220
rounds of ammunition attached under the
fuselage was designed
saab jas 39 gripen
this aircraft was designed by Saab a bee
in the mid-1980s the vehicles used to
intercept air targets conduct air combat
carry out shock and reconnaissance
missions the aerodynamic scheme of the
aircraft is a duck with an intermediate
triangular wing about thirty percent of
the design of the fighter is made from
composite materials the fighter is also
equipped with two s-shaped air intakes
the power is provided by a two circuit
turbojet Volvo Aero R m12 engine the
fighter cabin is equipped with extensive
viewing windows in three multifunction
displays the short control handle is
fixed right in front of the pilot's seat
and in the event of an electronic
control system failure the nasal wings
are automatically reset and the airplane
is automatically aligned thanks to his
aerodynamic scheme the control is then
transferred to the backup system in the
event of an engine failure electrical
energy is produced by an air micro
turbine the aircraft is also equipped
with backup batteries enough for ten
minutes of flight meaning you can reach
a landing runway if it's in sight
f-22 Raptor to date the f-22 is the most
expensive fighter in the history of
aviation the cost of one aircraft
excluding the funds spent on its
development is a hundred and forty six
million dollars the aircraft is an
integrated circuit and as a high lying
trapezoidal wing in the design of the
glider titanium alloys aluminium alloys
composites and radio absorbing materials
are widely used composite materials not
only make it possible to reduce the
level of radar visibility of the
aircraft but also significantly reduced
its mass all joints formed at the
junction of various parts and parts of
the aircraft have a sawtooth shape that
reduces the reflection of
electromagnetic waves the cockpit has an
uninterrupted light system made of
polycarbonate it has a special coating
that dissipates radio waves the power
for the f-22 Raptor is provided by two
dual circuit turbojet engines that allow
the aircraft to develop supersonic speed
without using an afterburner which is
one of the basic requirements for
fifth-generation aircraft
grumman f-14 tomcat this is a twinjet
fourth generation fighter with different
shaped wings manufactured by Grumman
aircraft engineering corporation the
f-14 focuses primarily on rejecting
missile strikes on ship groupings the
main element of the f-14 is the weapon
control system hughes a.n awg-9 for
close combat the Tomcat has a built-in
20 millimeter automatic cannon with a
combat kit of 670 full eight rounds the
basic missile weapons are for air-to-air
aim-54 or aims seven missiles located on
pylons under the fuselage the f-14 is
the only aircraft capable of carrying an
air-to-air missile of long-range
this missile worth $500,000 is able to
hit targets at a distance of a hundred
and fifteen miles
this gives the f-14 the ability to
destroy enemy planes before they appear
on their radar screen
su-35 this aircraft is designed to
intercept and destroy long range and
close-range targets on air battles
fighting or air supremacy and also to
destroy ground targets surface targets
and ground infrastructure covered by air
defense assets and located at
considerable distances from an air base
the aircraft combines the qualities of a
modern fighter and the quality of a good
tactical aircraft the su-35 fighter uses
two two circuit turbojet engines with a
special controlled traction vector and
an afterburner the cockpits equipped
with a holographic indicator on the
windshield including two liquid crystal
displays allowing it to work in multi
screen mode
the su-35 is equipped with a modern
weapon control system which includes an
opto electronic system and a
multifunctional weapon control system
the multimode anti jamming system
includes a mode for attacking ground
targets mapping the Earth's surface and
finding air targets at a distance of up
to 250 miles as well as ground ones up
to 125 miles su 57 this multi-role
fifth-generation fighter is being
developed in Russia and is one of the
most promising aircraft in the world its
main features are its high speed
powerful engine supermaneuverability low
visibility and also a powerful weapons
system and an advanced electronic system
at the same time most of the information
about the s257 at the moment is secrets
to this reason only approximate
characteristics of the aircraft are
known for example the span of the wing
and the length of the SU 57 is greater
than the ones in the f-22 but less than
the su-27 by mass it probably belongs to
the class of the heavy fighters
according to some reports the fighter
weighs about 41,000 pounds
the single cockpit is equipped with an
oxygen generator as well as two
multifunctional indicators for
displaying information as an armament
the SU 57 has a built in gun diameter of
30 millimeters
the McDonnell Douglas f-15 eagle this
all-weather fourth-generation American
jet fighter was put into operation as
far back as 1976 it was designed for
aerial combat and was developed as part
of a joint program of the Air Force and
NASA the aircraft is built using
titanium and aluminium alloys
high-strength steel and at least 5% of
composite materials the fighter is 64
feet long with a wingspan of 42 feet and
a maximum speed as a high altitude of 16
hundred and 50 miles per hour the crew
of the f-15 like other similar vehicles
consists of one person the fuel on the
f-15 is located in six fuel tanks four
in the fuselage and two in the wings
according to the latest information
this fighter will remain in the US air
force until 2025</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
