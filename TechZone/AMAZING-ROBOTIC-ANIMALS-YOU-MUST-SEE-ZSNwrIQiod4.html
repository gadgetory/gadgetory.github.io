Festo is a german manufacturer
industrial equipment and automation
systems the robot you see on the screen
is one of its specialist spin-off
projects during its creation the
engineers as you can easily guess what
inspired by the mechanics of an animal's
body a flying fox at rest as well as in
a state of activity the robot simulates
the movements of a flying fox almost
identically therefore it's able to hang
upside down clinging to a porch
emotionally labile unfolds it swings and
alternates a flight phase with a glide
as the material for the wings
the engineers chosen penetrable film as
well as lycra feets welded at 45,000
points if you look closer at the
material you can see the obvious
resemblance to beehives
thanks to this special design the robot
can keep moving without going down even
if the fabric is damaged it should be
noted that the developers have equipped
the Fox with an infrared sensor system
that transmits data about the
surrounding space wirelessly thanks to
them the robot can fly into
semi-automatic mode roburt modern
scientists and engineers increasingly
take their inspiration from animals to
create new robots especially from birds
in 2014 specialists from the University
of Twente in the Netherlands join the
ranks of electronic third creators ray
bird produced by clear flight solutions
is essentially a drone with the
appearance of a cork the purpose of the
machine is to provide a higher level of
security at Edmonton airports in Canada
the fact is that 8 million people come
here each year and the planes make a
hundred and sixty eight thousand flights
until 2014
birds were the main problem that had to
be faced as they flew into the airport
they crashed into the planes and hit the
engines previously lasers and sensors
were used to deal with them and the
presence of birds in the area was
accompanied by a specialist signal the
Roberge drone is a simpler and cheaper
way to slug the problem it imitates a
raptor in the sky and real birds don't
dare approach for fear of the predator
therefore the self-preservation instinct
prevents them from flying near the
airports the speed of the robot is 84
meters per hour the drone flies under
the control of an operator puts
specialists are already working on the
creation of an autonomous model
vionic wheel BOTS and there's another
amazing robots created by specialists
from the company Fester which we've
mentioned earlier perhaps the main
feature of Bionic wheel boss is this
unlike its natural prototype it won't
frighten even the most arachnophobia
people in addition their spider robots
like other faster electronic animals
looks very attractive the development
was shown in March 2018 it should be
noted that the robot can move in two
fundamentally different ways for the
first one to move forward the machine
uses three pairs of legs like a real
spider however in case of danger the
robot rotates the legs to take on the
shape of a wheel after that it starts
moving and rolling on the surface
reaching a higher speed than if it was
walking with its legs in the usual way
the second mode is also relevant for use
on smooth surfaces Bionic wheel bolt was
created to show the possibilities the
Scout robots will have in the future
Illume for a long time underwater
maintenance or inspection has been a
complex time and energy consuming
procedure fortunately more and more
engineers are working on robots that
will make underwater work easier
eeeh loon is a flexible underwater robot
developed by norwegian specialists at
first glance it's clear that the robot
looks a bit like a snake emus goal is to
conduct research on the ocean floor it's
worth mentioning that the machine can
stay deep for a long time and it doesn't
need to rise to the surface by air like
a human being the metal cylinders were
designed to make Elin look like a snake
for a reason the fact is that this is
the optimal way for safe movement in a
liquid environment the robots equipped
with a motor that powers it to
are also cameras for the operator to see
what's happening underwater in real time
another advantage of this robot assist
mode realer design thanks to which
customers can modify the eel into their
needs for example the machine can be
equipped with tools for simple repairs
perhaps to see our 200 humanity is
working hard to explore the ocean floor
and learn more about it
the crab stir see our 200 was created to
patrol the coastal area of the Korean
Peninsula the fact is that there are
very strong underwater currents in this
region so swimming in these conditions
is complicated for the robot you see on
the screen has no problem doing it
powerful legs are dear to the bottom
surface and grab onto the protuberances
so the submersible maintains the correct
position for its work as the name crab
stirs sea r200 suggests the engineers
were inspired by a crap the animal was
chosen for its ability to move quickly
both on land and at the bottom of the
state the crab stirs CR 200 as a
creation of specialists from the Korea
Institute of ocean science and
technology who is first shown in 2016
curiously the submersible is unmanned
notice the presence of Windows though
which are not really used to see the
underwater world from inside they allow
you to quickly see the performance of
the submarine from the outside when it
rises the robot weighs 600 kilograms and
its speed is one and a half kilometers
per hour
it should be noted that the front legs
can be equipped with manipulators to
perform various tasks underwater blue
robot to create this robot which mimics
the movements of a salamander experts
had to study the x-rays of the movements
of a real salamander while walking on
the ground or swimming perhaps that's
why the results in Clara BOTS looks so
much like this animal the robotic
salamander was created by the scientists
at the Federal Institute of Technology
in Lausanne Switzerland it was decided
to print the skeleton of the robot on a
3d printer
the robots driven by electrical circuits
that operate under the control of the
synthetic nervous system interestingly
the vertebrae of the robotic creature
are smaller than the actual vertebrae of
a cylinder however this was done on
purpose to achieve a realistic movement
with the available technology the
creators of the robot pursued a noble
objective to Clara bot allows a deeper
understanding of the locomotor system of
the vertebrates the NIEM knowledge
acquired can be used to create better
narrow prostheses for people
hey stop being lazy it's time to use
that brain Eeyore's welcome to brain
time incredible facts from the past the
present and even the future the power of
nature and wild animals amazing facts
and unsolved mysteries you'll find all
this and much more hair subscribe now
you won't regret it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
