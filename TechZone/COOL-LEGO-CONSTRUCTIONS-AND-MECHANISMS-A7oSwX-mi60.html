built completely out of LEGO pieces the
device includes the main game field
decorated in a space style a display
that shows all the data as well as a
mechanism to launch the ball formatic
cards with facts about the space and a
rotating mechanism in the form of the
planet Earth the Lego pinball machine
also has the ability to automatically
reboot in addition the mechanism is
equipped with sensors that provide a
fully fledged game process
coffee machine this device works like a
regular automatic coffee machine sand
labs designed the device made from LEGO
pieces in the style of the famous
American company Starbucks in order to
work all the devices sensors must be
turned on after that the user must put 2
euro into the Machine and put the cup in
its place
within 45 seconds the machine calls the
coffee and then heats the beverage in
the next 45 seconds rubik's cube solver
the swiss programmer hands anderson made
a lego robot capable of solving the
rubik's cube the device solves the
puzzle completely automatically the
ultrasonic sensor scans the cube and
determines its colors then the Machine
calculates the rotation sequence for the
solution and executes the turns of the
cube the robot needs three to six
minutes for the entire process it is
worth noting that the device works
without connecting to a computer since
it calculates the algorithm of the
solution with its own processor
Digital clock this mechanism was
completely created as of LEGO pieces and
his name is time twister for the digital
clock display contains a matrix of cubes
that are pushed out in order to share
the time each digit is equipped with a
small motor controlled by a conveyor
belt and small levers located inside the
clock
thus this allows you to push the pieces
or reverse them back the device weighs
18 pounds and is 32 inches wide and 14
inches tall
leggo sorter this is the Lego axial
sorter ASL 40 a Japanese engineer Aki
Yuki created the mechanism using Lego
bricks the main feature of this device
is the ability to automatically sort
different pieces of Lego the high
productivity of the machine allows it to
solve ten different types of Lego bricks
into ten special containers this device
has a small built-in electric motor
which allows the ASL forcier to operate
at a relatively fast rate
milling machine this machine made from
LEGO pieces can cut out various
three-dimensional images from
cylindrical floral foam at the beginning
you should draw any figure on a regular
sheet of paper then a special sensor
reads it controlling the cutting process
it should be noted that the device uses
floral foam because the Lego motors are
weak and are not able to work with wood
generator this cyclic installation
clearly demonstrates the principle of
wave gearing all construction materials
and mechanisms of the device are LEGO
bricks the wave gearing occurs thanks to
a frictional contact and it works
similarly to a screw this Lego device
has internal gears an output shaft and a
wave generator based on a small motor
milkshake machine the device is designed
in the style of the American company
McDonald's and built entirely of LEGO
pieces the user needs to put a glass in
the machine introduce the required
amounts of money as shown in the image
and then turn the special lever there
are two tastes to choose from if the
user wants the strawberry cocktail then
needs to move the levers that write and
if he or she wants a chocolate one then
to the left inside the device the drinks
are stored in bottles and special troops
allow the device to pour the milkshake
into the glass
ball games machine
this mechanism includes 17 modules to
perform various actions the device is
capable of moving 500 balls at the same
time the machine is 21 feet long and 5
feet wide and this unusual device on
average can reach a speed of 1 ball per
second and the entire path where the
small balls run is a hundred feet long
along the way the balls get thrown into
the basket loaded transported and lifted
spirally
Maus tank made out of Lego pieces the
fully operated super-heavy german maus
tank is 28 inches long and weighs 13
pounds the tank has a working chassis to
overcome various obstacles a controlled
gun with the shooting mechanism a 360
degree rotating Tower and retractable
headlights it should be noted that the
tank has an opening panel with a working
v12 engine and radiators as well as a
rotating periscope the Lego Maus is able
to unfold on the spot and controllers
carried out using a remote also made of
Lego
warehouse this is the prototype of an
automated warehouse made out of Lego the
device is controlled using a special
electronic display the machine has
conveyor belts as well as cables for
lifting and lowering boxes the display
shows which cell the user is selected
for operation and to change the
direction of the device simply set the
required location in the warehouse and
press the start button Harvester
a Lego tracked error a special device
made of Lego details work together to
perform the process of harvesting the
device has a lever for grasping the crop
and a tool for cutting it after that
the harvested crop is sent to the
trailer of the car the device is able to
collect not only light plants but also
larger ones such as apples or tomatoes
the Lego tractor s high cross country
wheels and seven engines altogether
potato planter
here's another agricultural device made
entirely out of LEGO pieces it's
designed for planting potatoes first of
all the machine digs a hole using a
special tool then the potato passes
through a conveyor belts and falls into
the right place at the end of the
process the machine covers the potatoes
with soil and level-set hay combine
harvester like a real hay Harvester
this Lego machine collects dry grass
turning it into sheaves the device is
equipped with 10 engines the combine is
14 inches tall 21 inches long and 11
inches wide the hay enters the special
compartment for processing where it
comes out already packed
after that the sheaf remains on the
ground and then it's taken away by the
Lego loader
Apothic ons servant this replica of the
famous weapon from the video game black
ops 3 is made entirely out of LEGO
pieces
the device has a squid head shark teeth
and dragon wings the puffit con servants
also has bright orange eyes than a lot
of tentacles just like in the original
game
