is a bicycle with an improved
transmission the fastest in the world
the creators of ceramic speed driven
decided that they want to abandon the
familiar chain the rest switch and the
cassette cluster as a substitute a drive
rotary shaft was used for the design
engineers worked for a year and a half
to create a transmission with the
frictional losses of less than 1% that
is the finished product was supposed to
have 99% efficiency when transferring
the power of the rider to the rear wheel
in July this year at the Euro bike
exhibition the developers finally showed
the transmission which proves they
managed to achieve the task the creators
say that thanks to the transmission you
can turn the wheels 50 percent more
efficiently than even the most
sophisticated and advanced modern
bicycles to achieve this results the
developers reduce the number of friction
points while carefully selecting
bearings it's noteworthy that the very
concept of a rotary shaft is not new and
is used in cars however all attempts to
adapt it to a bicycle have failed before
because there was too much friction the
solution that finally solved this
problem was a circle of bearings that
rotates just one chain ring instead of
five or even seven
ding bike lights every year more and
more people decide to use a bicycle as
the main means of transportation however
because of the huge number of cars on
the streets riding in the dark is not
that safe
ding bike lights helps to solve this
problem as it's a simple but effective
device that significantly improves
safety to illuminate the roads the
device uses LED technology to beams of
light are directed forward and an
additional light is directed down
lighting the road under the bike
statistics show that two-thirds of
accidents involving cyclists occur when
a car turns and accidentally runs into a
bicycle the problem is that standard
lights only light forward and backward
making the rider almost invisible from
the side and the dark
that's why ding is equipped with an
additional beam of light that
illuminates the ground this technology
makes the bike noticeable from all
angles the forward beam which lights
forward has a high color rendering index
it's color temperature is 5600 Kelvin
this is something between a fluorescent
white light and a standard daylight
white light source its power is 400
lumens
while a pair of the lower beam is a
hundred fifty lumens you can buy the
device starting at $70
zone DPM X the creation of the device
that you see on the screen took about
six years the developers of zone DPM X
had to create a speedometer that would
be comfortable for wearing compact
reliable and also affordable the final
device is the world's first speedometer
that can be attached to a person not to
a bicycle the device consists of two
parts connected together the upper
sensor is attached at the top of the
cyclists sneaker and measures the
cadence the number of pedal turns per
minute the lower one is attached to the
sole of the sneaker and is a calibrated
sensor whose task is to measure the
force when pressing the pedal
thus the device measures the speed of
rotation of the pedals and the force of
pressing and then transfers to receive
data to the bicycle if it's equipped
with cycling computer
one of the remarkable features of the
device is its small weight only 44 grams
which allows the cyclist not to fool S
on his or her leg in addition the zone
DPM X is water-resistant and capable of
operating in a wide range of
temperatures from minus 10 to plus 60
degrees Celsius after recharging it's
able to work for about 15 hours there
are two versions of the device the zone
DPM X single is attached to the left
sneaker and the zone DPM X jewels are
both the cost of the first one is about
450 dollars and the second one costs
$900
bitch lock this is a smart electronic
lock which not only protects the bicycle
but also allows you to forget about
using a key forever at first sight that
lock practically doesn't differ from a
traditional bicycle lock however there
are differences since the smartphone's
perform the function of the key in the
system to start using bit lock you have
to spend a hundred and forty dollars and
download a special mobile application
after its activation unlocking occurs
automatically as soon as the owner
approaches the bike the application
sends a signal to the lock using
bluetooth so the device recognizes its
owner
in addition to the main function that
Locke has many others for example you
can open the lock without approaching
the bike by the mobile application also
that lock allows you to always be aware
of where the parked bike is as it tracks
its location with GPS and shows out on
the map the device is equipped with a
battery with about five years of battery
life the lock is resistant to water and
changes in temperature so you can use it
all year round
barstow system and minibar mineral
designers developed a way to always keep
tools for the bicycle chain and compact
bits ready at hand the minibar is a
compact portable storage for six bits of
a standard size of 60 millimetres it's
equipped with two powerful neodymium
magnets so that it wouldn't accidentally
open during the ride the tool that comes
in the kits and is part of the
repository with three places for
attaching bits the two upper ones are
for the performance of torque and the
lower one for tightening screws the sole
is made of light welded steel pipe
showing excellent reliability and
compactness the mini bar is only 97
millimeters long and thirty-three and a
half millimeters wide
thus it practically doesn't take up any
space the barstow system is an
innovative system that allows you to
store tools right inside the bike it's a
complete chain breaking tool with
integrated chain link storage that fits
inside the handlebar thus the biker
doesn't even need to think about taking
these tools just in case they're always
at hand easily accessible as a set these
two devices cost about $60
mag lock bike pedal these are innovative
magnetic pedals for mountain bikes many
cyclists engaged in mountain biking used
contact pedals since they can
significantly improve the efficiency of
torsion however a traditional design has
a number of drawbacks you need special
shoes for one and the clamp in it is
quickly clogged with dirt dust in
addition some cyclists are uncomfortable
but the very idea of fastening their
feet to the pedals mag lock is able to
replace contact pedals and doesn't have
these disadvantages to hold the foots
these pedals use special magnets they're
easy to clean and it's simple to put
your leg in the right position in
seconds the device is designed in such a
way that it's easy to detach from the
foot which makes the Falls safer the kit
includes a special clip compatible with
any models of bicycle shoes besides the
user chooses how strong the connection
is between the pedal and the boot the
cost of these pedals is a hundred and
ten dollars
