about 8 tons of wood and the drivers
showed high level skills in managing
this technique
Sani excavators cooler excavators
produced by the International sani group
took part in a competition consisting of
several tasks the operators deftly ran
these machines using a boom of buckets
and some additional elements the
excavators managed to draw various
hieroglyphics with a brush open several
bottles pour liquid into the glasses and
cut a watermelon and an apple into even
pieces thought allness
photon wheel loader the front loader
floats on FL 956 f2 is a
high-performance vehicle and it can
perform even the most difficult tasks
thanks to a short working cycle and a 3
cubic metre bucket
so for example the photon can bounce on
the ground on its front wheels while
moving the rest of the car to the left
or right the high maneuverability of the
vehicle allows it to make similar
movements even at low speed
it's actually excavator
the Japanese company Hitachi has been
developing and producing construction
equipment for over 40 years now it
offers the widest range of hydraulic
excavators of all kinds including
reliable and durable models this
statement is clearly proven by this
trick performed by an experienced
operator on Hitachi excavator
cautiously but very confidently the
vehicle descends a steep sandy slope for
this that uses the boom in the bucket as
well as built in high-tech systems
Volvo FH this truck model has several
special characteristics for example the
Volvo FH has a payload capacity of 30
tonnes and the maximum speed at this car
is about 90 kilometers per hour but this
truck can also perform what is least

getting off the springboard the driver
accurately kept the truck at the right
angle

several stages of the ascent on the way
to its goal when the car is on the
railcar it immediately begins to unload
the materials

technique and the presentation was very
impressive
excavators carried out all movements as
synchronously as possible and the use of
turns bucket rotations and lifting on
