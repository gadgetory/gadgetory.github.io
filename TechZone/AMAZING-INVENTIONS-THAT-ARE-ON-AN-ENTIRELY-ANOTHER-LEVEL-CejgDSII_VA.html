to imagine anything more refreshing than
a cool shower in the open
magic showerhead is a portable compact
device that allows anyone to enjoy a
shower outside if you have a backyard
even if it's a small one and there's no
room for a real shower
at first sight the construction looks
like a wooden platform measuring 70 by
55 centimeters it weighs about 10
kilograms the number of heads can vary
from 2 to 11 it's noteworthy that the
shower is fully automatic and it
activates when the user stands on the
platform
transforming furniture this interesting
and unique piece of furniture was
created using a patented system
developed by an American engineer from
Iowa at first sight it looks like a
fence however if you try to sit on it
the construction turns into a bench you
can even lie down on it actually
Engineers all over the world are
inventing interesting and unusual
furniture for example this is a new desk
design you can store some personal
belongings in the closed compartment
when it's time to sit down at the table
the shutter slides away and the
structure turns into a table and a chair
finally the latest transforming
invention is a staircase with sliding
steps thanks to this unique feature the
stairs can be built crosswise which
means to such stairs will take up the
same amount of space as a stand of one
print brush XDR we are used to the fact
that printers are cumbersome devices
standing next to the computer
however the invention you see on the
screen breaks all the usual ideas about
it pre brush XDR is so tiny that it fits
in your bag or even in your pocket it
weighs about as much as an average
smartphone but it can work anywhere and
print on any surface such as metal
fabric plastic or wood surprisingly the
presser works in such a gentle way that
the pattern can even be applied to an
inflated balloon the print brush xtr
connects to a smartphone tablet or
laptop and can be controlled from a
special application you can use the
ready-made templates for printing all
create your own in the app the print
resolution is 600 dpi and the printer
uses inkjet technology the only drawback
is that the ink is water-soluble but you
can varnish the image if you want the
cartridge is replaceable and it holds
enough ink for five thousand printing
cycles the device can be purchased for
$300
quick cuts harvester gardening has
always been difficult and tedious
workers especially when harvesting
usually have to spend a lot of time and
effort on it of course people are
already used to it but engineers keep
trying to improve our lives manual labor
is being replaced by automation even
when it comes to small farms that can't
afford to bind large and expensive
special equipment the quick cut
harvester is an invention designed
specifically to harvest herbs all the
farmers who have ever worked with it
aren't happy to talk about its
advantages
it was developed thanks to specialists
from the American company farmers friend
the rotating brush covered with numerous
rope strands optimally tares the herbs
at the root and then rakes it into the
collection area
usually it takes three people about two
hours to harvest from one seed bed
moreover they are in an uncomfortable
position on their knees which quickly
leads to pain throughout the body the
same amounts of work is done by quick
cut harvester enforcement minutes with
only one person working and not having
to kneel down
thus the productivity of this device is
80 kilograms of herbs per hour the
device can work at any height ie
practically with any greenery grown the
grower claims that this harvester does a
better job than a knife the ways of the
device is four and a half kilograms and
the price is five hundred and fifty
dollars
Robert bed-bound patience in some cases
are so weak that they can't move their
limbs on their own however they have to
perform specially designed physical
exercises on a regular basis because
lack of physical activity has a negative
impact on all metabolic processes in the
body muscles and joints get atrophied
the organs may get damaged and it can
cause stagnation traditionally the
medical personnel are responsible for
the work with these kind of patients but
the procedures require a loss of time
and effort
that is one Robert a smart robot was
created it helps patients to start the
rehabilitation and progress little by
little first of all and is worth noting
that the robot can move from room to
room this allows the patient to exercise
in the comforts of their ward
instead of moving to a special ward and
stress out all exercises are carried out
under the close supervision of a
specialist medical staff can help with
special exercises for the limbs while
the robot takes over the weight of the
patient's body
interestingly the health worker can
teach the robot the necessary movements
after the demonstration the robot
remembers them and can independently
repeat them a certain number of times
and of course the invention is
absolutely safe the work can be stopped
at any second
véra the engineers at Volvo Trucks say
that this is an invention unlike
anything else they've made before at
least because you cannot get behind the
wheel of Vera because there is no
steering wheel Vera is an unmanned
electric truck without a cap introduced
at the end of last year at the moment
it's a concept car it looks much more
like a low platform on wheels than a
regular car though
véra can be equipped with a trailer and
transport loads the developers believe
that their invention will be used in
situations where it's necessary to
transport goods regularly and over short
distances the device is therefore ideal
for use in docks logistics centers and
factories according to the idea many
vehicles will be connected to a single
control center its tasks will include
monitoring the charge level position
loads and technical condition of the
vehicle
equipped er RB mm the latest invention
that we're going to show you today is
designed to help construction brigades
work easier and faster equipped er RB mm
is a mobile and maneuverable waste
container it's not a secret that during
construction and renovation works a huge
amount of waste is generated
it's often located in hard-to-reach
places where a truck cannot pass it is
in such situations that this vehicle
comes in handy it's not just capable of
driving in narrow areas take a look at
how the container Rises so that for
example you can dump the garbage from
the roof into it
the capacity of the bin is approximately
naught point eight eight cubic meters
and the maximum weight it can handle is
680 kilograms</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
