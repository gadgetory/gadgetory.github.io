introduced in 2013 by American
businessman Elon Musk the Hyperloop was
conceived as an overhead pipeline
located on supports where single
transport capsules were the length of
about 30 meters can move in the same
direction with an interval of 30 seconds
at a speed of 480 to 12 hundred and 20
kilometers per hour depending on the
terrain Hyperloop can overcome a
distance of 1,200 kilometers in just an
hour
linear induction motors placed in the
tube are responsible for the
acceleration and deceleration of the
capsule solar panels on top of the pipe
power the motors using solar energy
