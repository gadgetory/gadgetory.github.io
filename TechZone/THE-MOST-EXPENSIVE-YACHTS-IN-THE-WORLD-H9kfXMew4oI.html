kalila each element of this yacht
created at the american shipyard palmer
johnson is unique
kalila was launched on July 25th 2014
with five guest cabins for up to 11
guests
apart from guests the yeah accommodates
nine crew members the nose of the yacht
is unusually striking at first sight
with its backward slope and pointed bulb
the hull as well as the wings and deck
structure were created at the Norwegian
shipyard broad Rena and then sent to the
Palmer Johnson shipyard to complete the
project
the designers worked hard to ensure that
each curve of the golden hull looks
elegant and gives the yacht a
spectacular appearance it is noteworthy
that the hole was made of a strong and
lightweight carbon composite which
hasn't been used for this purpose before
the interior designers managed to
achieve a uniqueness of the interior by
using a bright color palette as well as
a variety of diverse and exquisite
fabrics each room is decorated with
paintings that are real works of ARDS
the floor-to-ceiling windows will allow
you to enjoy the beautiful views the aft
deck area is a hundred and ten square
meters with a Jacuzzi a bar lounge rooms
a kitchen and a two-star Michelin Train
chef today any wealthy person can spend
time at kalila if you want this yacht
for a week you have to pay approximately
two hundred and eighty thousand dollars
the cost of the yacht itself is
estimated at approximately forty million
dollars
Martha and at the time of construction
of this vessel it was already known that
it was not intended for any particular
owner but would be a charter vessel that
is why it was equipped with spacious
suites and seven guest cabins three of
which are VIP in the garage room there
is a limousine tender by Royal den ship
company as well as a semi-rigid
inflatable boat Nautica so you can fish
or go waterskiing guests do not have to
use the stairs to move between the four
decks as there is an elevator with the
transport hull a gym and a home theater
with panoramic images provides increased
comfort
a week on the ship will cost from 574 to
588 thousand dollars depending on the
season the estimated value of Martha Ann
is 70 million dollars
Venis during his lifetime Steve Jobs was
always a fan of minimalism which came
from his Zen devotion to simplicity so
it's no surprise that the yacht he
ordered was a minimalist one the hull of
the Venus yacht consists of extremely
simple and straight lines which gives it
a touch of elegance the construction of
the super yacht lasted for about seven
years most of the time was spent on the
coordination of small details Steve Jobs
along with the world-famous designer
Phillip Stark has meticulously polished
every single detail of the yacht to
perfection
unfortunately he was never able to take
a ride on Venus it was lodged on October
28 2012 a year after the death of the
businessman however the entire jobs
family was present at the event to mark
the completion of the yacht his widow
and their three children details an
aluminum and steel give the yacht a
futuristic look Venus is lightweight and
is considered very maneuverable there is
little information about the interior
decoration it is known that the
captain's bridge is equipped with seven
IMAX and the design is very Apple like
it is rumored that the walls in the
living area are made of special glass
blocks which provide a full 360-degree
view more than a hundred million euros
were spent on creating Venus and the
estimated total cost of this vessel is a
hundred and thirty million dollars
Alissa's this super yacht has a total of
15 Suites aboard and can accommodate up
to 30 guests there are also 22 cabins
for 42 crew members it is noteworthy
that the owner's suite has a separate
deck two elevators will help the guests
and the Kreutz and move between decks
one for 13 people and the other one for
eight people Ulysses was built by a
Norwegian shipyard clevon immediately
after the ship was completed it was
delivered to New Zealand billionaire
Graeme Hart in March 2016 for some
reason already in July 2016
this hundred and seven meter Explorer
yacht was offered for sale for two
hundred million dollars perhaps the most
important feature of Ulysses is that it
is equipped with a large 21 meter long
catamaran tender which can be easily
accelerated up to 50 knots
other features include eight dining
areas open and closed five bars and a
theater with a professional audio system
there is a heated swimming pool with an
area of five by eleven meters a spa a
massage room a beauty salon a fitness
center and beach clubs
eclipse the yacht you see on the screen
was built on commission for russian
businessman Roman Abramovich it was
designed by lots of beki design
development the exterior styling and
interior design were done by specialists
from Terrence Teasdale design limited on
June 12th 2009 the yacht was launched
for the first time but it was only
delivered over to the customer on
December 9th 2010 all this time the
yacht was undergoing refinement and
steam trials the length of the vessel is
one hundred and sixty two point five
meters and its width is twenty-one point
five meters we wanted to specify that
because at the time of its launch
Eclipse was the largest private ship in
the world
the crew of the yacht is 70 people and
the inside of the yacht can accommodate
36 guests at a time as the vessel is
private not much is known about the
interior decoration and equipment
standard yachts of this class are almost
always equipped with jet skis tenders
and boats so we can assume that they are
available on Eclipse too it is also
known that inside the app there's a
concert hall three canteens a cinema and
a wine cellar it is noteworthy that
Eclipse has two swimming pools one of
which can be turned into a dance floor
experts estimate that about 300 million
dollars has been spent on the
construction of the yacht the cost of
the Eclipse together with this
impressive amount of internal equipment
is estimated at 1.2 billion
