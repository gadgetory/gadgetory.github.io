American civil engineer Samuel benazzo
came up with a fundamentally new road
construction technology in 2016 the
American Society of Civil Engineers
recognized it as the most
environmentally friendly construction
method and here's why
the problem of tire recycling in the
modern world is very serious annually
every major city produces about 90,000
and tons of worn-out tires besides each
of them decomposes in the ground for
more than a hundred years mankind is
constantly searching for solutions to
give warn size the second life and
prevent environmental pollution
mechanical concrete is one of them
geogrid is widely used in road
construction usually it's a
2-dimensional or 3-dimensional honeycomb
structure filled with the loose
materials such as crushed stone geogrid
increases the bearing capacity of loose
and has Virginia's soils securing road
bases the technology of mechanical
concrete's implies the use of worn-out
car tires instead of geogrids they're
placed on the prepared soil tightly
against each other then they are
fastened together Builders fill each
tire cavity with crushed stone and then
lay asphalt on top it's noteworthy that
approximately 15 tires are used for one
cubic meter of mechanical concrete the
resulting design is inexpensive this
technology uses 50 percent less building
materials compared to traditional
methods the cost of maintenance is also
reduced as the coating has increased
strength and durability the road can
withstand loads of up to a hundred and
fifty tons per square meter
road markings renewal recently more and
more often thermoplastic materials have
been used to create road markings it
allows finishing the task in a short
time as a result the road has increased
performance characteristics in its raw
form thermoplastic looks like a powder
it's usually brought in huge bags the
material gets turned into liquid under
the influence of high temperatures about
130 to 150 degrees Celsius therefore
neither primary marking nor its updating
is possible without the use of special
equipment
in this case as it is necessary to
prepare only a small parts of the road
the workers use special devices with
manual control the constructor passes
along the pedestrian path updates the
turn and stop signs and some others the
advantage of using this material when
renewing the road markings is its
durability even if the road is subjected
to heavy traffic loads the updated signs
will last for at least two years
in addition thermoplastic dries much
faster than conventional paint once the
material has cooled down the road can be
used again other features of
thermoplastic for marking include
resistance to abrasion or chemical
reagents and high grip index
soil stabilization roads are not always
paved where the soil has ideal
characteristics for example in quarries
heavy trucks often drive on soil with
low load bearing capacity on large
construction sites it also often has
poor quality characteristics it is not
possible to replace it with any other
soil however there is a way to compact
the soil and make it usable
for this special binders and additives
are used they can have various
compositions the coating you see on the
screen will not produce dust after
drying even the wheels of large cars
won't get stuck in the soil
notice that the workers treat slopes
with a composition at the edge of the
road this is necessary to stop the
erosion process in other words the
treatment doesn't allow the rock to
collapse so that debris and stones won't
fall onto the road such stabilization of
the soil leaves behind a proper usable
Road
stabilization geogrid at the beginning
of the video we have already told you
briefly was a geogrid is and what it's
for it's time to focus on this road
construction technology in more detail
because it has a lot of advantages the
video shows the DuPont surface
stabilization geogrid it's a
revolutionary solution for parking lots
driveways and walkways the grid has a
three-dimensional structure when
unfolded it looks like a honeycomb
the materials made of a hundred percent
polypropylene so that the grid doesn't
rot in the ground when it's not exposed
to sunlight it can last for up to 25
years some of the advantages of the
material are its light weight
compactness when folded and water
resistance the use of geo grids reduces
the risk of flooding as it retains
rainwater during heavy rainfall the
finish coating has a higher density suit
neither wheels nor legs will get stuck
in the crushed stone if DuPont geogrid
is placed underneath it
heated asphalt countries with cold
climates allocate huge sums of money
each year to snow removal still nature
is not easy to cope with many people
constantly have to deal with snow and
ice a few years ago in Japan heated
roads were tested for the first time in
the process of construction under the
top asphalt layer a special grid with a
heating element is laid
it's noteworthy that the technology is
very similar to the process of laying a
piece of flooring in an apartment after
the first winter people realize that the
asphalt heating is very beneficial the
surface temperature is above 0 degrees
Celsius
therefore the snow after kissing the
asphalt not immediately snowdrifts
simply don't have time to form
thanks to the fact that the asphalt is
heated evenly and round-the-clock the
water on the surface does not freeze
therefore there is no ice formation
other countries decided to follow the
example of Japan Zoo today heated
asphalt can be found in different cities
across Canada USA Finland Norway and
Iceland it's interesting that in Iceland
the asphalt is heated not by electricity
but by geothermal meters
plastic slaps over the past 65 years
plastics production is increased by
about 190 times only last year about 380
million tons of plastic were produced
statistics show that mankind recycles
only 9% of the total plastic waste
another 12 percent is burned the rest
goes to landfills in the ocean over the
past 10 years people have begun to
better understands the problem of
plastic pollution that is why new ways
of fighting it's are being created last
year a mass campaign to promote Road
slaps was launched in the West African
country of Ghana unusual ones of course
recycled plastic waste was used for
their production the lifetime of the
boards you see on the screen is 500
years only after that time did they
finally begin to decompose at the same
time the cost of the slabs doesn't
exceed $1 this is 50 cents cheaper than
traditional concrete slabs</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
