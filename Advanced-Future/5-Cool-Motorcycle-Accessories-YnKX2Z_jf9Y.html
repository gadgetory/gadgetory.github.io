complete review of this product and many
more the grip lock is a highly visible

to the grip and the front brake of the

prevent opera
mystic motorcycle theft the grip lock is
made from 30% glass filled nylon

inserts that are claimed to be very hard
to cut the grip lock is adjustable for
different handlebar diameters and the
distance between the handlebar and the
front brake lever it comes with spacers

forth for adjustment
place it over the front brake and turn
the key to lock it and it's set it can
be adjusted to keep the brake tight or
loose here I have the brake just barely
on I had to set the handlebar with as
wide as it could go because of my thick
foam grips shown here and the edges of
the grip lock chewed up the soft foam
slightly but this doesn't seem to be a
problem with normal grips that's the web
