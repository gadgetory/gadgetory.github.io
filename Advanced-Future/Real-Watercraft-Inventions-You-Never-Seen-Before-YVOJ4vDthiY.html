amphibious boat ever made at the edge of
the water the iguana provides freedom
for passengers to embark safely the
iguana commuter is as capable on land as
it is at sea and can negotiate choppy
seas with ease it can reach speeds of
over 40 knots with its v-shaped hull
cutting effortlessly through waves and
troughs the boat has ample features as
standard which include a GPS with sound
system underwater camera key with stop
start and ladder deployment iPhone app
remote for carriage placement electric
anchor and the secure cozy cabin
operating the iguana commuter is easy in
deepwater the simple push of one button
deploys the powerful landing gear with
the landing gear down drive the boat
normally and push the joysticks the two
tracks will run to seamlessly kiss the
ground and safely take the boat out to
water over the waves a simple rotation
on the joysticks will turn the boat 180
degrees to safely park at the edge of
the water
with the ground pressure equivalent to a
human being and the electric drive the
Iguana will blend into the environment
and provide unrivaled freedom
deploying the electric ladder is quick
and easy one touch of the screen extends
the ladder offering safe stable and easy
access even in waves up to four foot the
convertible hardtop is a unique feature
to the iguana commuter at the touch of a
button the roof transforms from a
heightened sunshade to a completely
sealed water and winthrop air
the shock mitigating driver's seat is
fully electric which allows for both a
comfortable seated position or an
exhilarating in the wind experience
transitioning from Land's to C is simple
once the ladder is up push both
joysticks to activate the tracks and
launch the boats into deep water once
floating trim the engines down and start
with the touch at our back you move your
controls to the steering wheel and
throttle to move away from the beach
into deeper water the track system
cleverly folds away in only 10 seconds
into special recesses above the
waterline allowing the hull to maximize
its superb potential the boat is highly
capable on the water and offers a fun
and enjoyable sailing experience
quatrefoil is a sustainable electric
watercraft that promises a legendary
ride above the surface that changes you
forever
until now our work and saving animals
has been limited because we lacked our
own ship so last year we started
developing this amazing new vessel to
becoming a base of operations we're
using the same team that produces
original earth trace after extensive
testing and development we're now really
close to design completion the new boat
will be a trial wave piercer
without standing fuel economy and an
ability to handle almost any seas on
earth she will also run a spy sail
system that harnesses wind power
reducing the need to use engines and
shrinking our environmental footprint
she will also accommodate a full crew of
26 which will often include local
enforcement teams to ensure criminals we
catch are successfully prosecuted our
sea legs will fit inside the central
hole giving us high speed pursuit
options and an ability to get ashore
quickly when needed we'll also have our
equipment such as kayaks zodiacs flew
thermal-imaging drones and other
surveillance gear it will be a
self-contained campaign ship allowing us
to run more effective enforcement
missions that saves animals and catches
environmental criminals we're here in
Geneva for the test of the new horse
which is fly-by-wire system
the middle of the chest campaign right
now has been working really good it's
amazing to see that the level of
stability today is the same as or in the
car in effect so you really feel that
the water is not soft anymore is that
hard and you can jump around in the boat
everywhere you want to go and nothing
moves
so we've attained a level of stability
together it's fantastic and it's really
what we need because of tgd crossing
waves sideways I supposed to have been
both the rocks around and makes people
seasick
now the flaps are moving we want to
control both the roll the pitch and the
height
the system fly-by-wire system the
control position is a Jean Nouvel
meg-san calculator in between chapter
the majority of the row the control
along with a shed a derivative economic
the likely develop more instability of
Jabbar on a flat solid fold the flaps
normal user would literally click upon
