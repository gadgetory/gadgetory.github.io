power air enters the nostrils oxygen
enters the blood
the blood flows to the muscles the
muscles drive power power
more speed
introducing speed craft air how much air
do you breathe after our award-winning
flector zero and 360 market launches
we're back with a brand new product
reflector vortex the world's first crank
reflector the smallest accessory ever
for your bike with the largest possible
impact on your safety is specially
designed for bicycles with clipless
pedals that do not provide space for
reflectors with a set weight of 2.2
grams
vortex does not create any air drag or
dynamic imbalance just a stylish look
for your bike by day and safety for your
rides in the dark flector vortexes
design features a unique 3d formable
film which perfectly fits the shape of
almost every crank set on the market due
to its sealed surface flector vortex is
nearly indestructible and keeps its good
properties for a long time it can even
withstand a high pressure cleaner
flector vortex is discreet by day but
vibrantly reflecting at night and help
secure your space on the road its micro
prismatic technology reflects a
vortexing and strong beam of Lights back
to its source and attracts every car
drivers attention in comparison to
old-fashioned peddle reflectors flector
vortex increases your visibility through
its 360 degree beam angle and helps even
if your bike already has pedal
reflectors flector vortex helps you
master every dangerous situation in the
dark reflecting the light back to its
source making you visible with a
stunning glow all around
no compromise unfortunately flat tires
happen
the current flat repair options aren't
always the most reliable or easy to use
and pumps take a lot of energy and a
long time to inflate a tire co2
inflators are unreliable if you make a
mistake and Elise all the gas you're
stuck having nightmares with flats out
on the trails and in backcountry we set
out to make the fastest high-volume
lightweight mobile inflation device
possible
introducing the stop button the first
truly portable foot pump for repairing
any tire the stop pump engages your
largest muscles your legs you can
inflate a tire three times faster and
infinitely easier than a typical hand
pump it keeps your hands-free to do
other things it's also easy to stow and
put into use hands down the best pump
ever made the stop pump is the first
pump that we know of to incorporate an
integrated air filter this keeps the
incoming air clean from dirt and debris
that can damage the internals and keeps
your stall pump working smoothly for
years to come
the creators of stop pump have been the
brains behind bringing hundreds of
products to market over the last 30
years through a prolific career in
BattleBots we've created some of the
most extreme air systems in robotic
combat stomp up was designed to be light
strong and efficient just like our
championship robots we've left no stone
unturned in our design and development
process we truly started from scratch
when creating the stomp up it's not just
a pump design that's been converted to a
foot pump every component has been
purpose-built for the demands of the
foot pump the stomp pump will be made
in-house here in Marin County California
of the highest quality materials to
exacting standards by our expert crew
technology is moving in a lightning pace
from rockets that can explore the depths
of space to driverless smart cars while
some forms of transport have evolved
entirely innovation has neglected the
humble bicycle we've seen modern day
bikes get sleeker and lighter but
commuting to work on a bike can often be
physically exhausting and embarrassing
while most have ignored this modest form
of transportation the evo wheel comes in
five sizes and fits over 95% of all
bikes in the market and allows you to
transform your bike into a pedal assist
by in a mere 30 seconds attaching the
wheel is simple and hassle-free by
simply replacing the front wheel of your
bike the first of our fully wirelessly
control options is our Bluetooth enabled
control unit you can decide how much you
want the innovative power assist system
to help you pedal accurate from zero to
a hundred percent you can monitor your
speed travel distance and battery power
in real time alternatively you may use a
dedicated app to control the assist
level that you want the app displays
five different mode sets
giving you more authority over your
cycling experience Evel wheels
incredible pedal assist systems make
cycling uphill a walk in the park
charging the wheel is as simple as
plugging it into any socket a single
charge can allow you to travel up to 54
miles meaning your commute to work the
next day will be easy and hassle-free
make your commute to work enjoyable with
the state-of-the-art evil
would you like to improve your race
cycling or mountain biking performance
then let us introduce you to the new and
affordable power meter by IQ square a
power meter tells you exactly when and
where your legs are producing a certain
amount of force it helps you dose during
your write or workout so you can start
outperforming yourself and others power
meters exists in all shapes and sizes at
varying locations on a bike but every
power meter presents a disadvantage and
they're also quite expensive so we
challenged ourselves to decrease the
price while increasing functionality
well since we are attracted ourselves we
wanted to buy a power meter because it
was the thing to have and we did some
research on the different kinds of
parameters and the price point the high
price point would suggest that they
would be perfect and they aren't there
are lots of restrictions and drawbacks
and we didn't buy one but since we are
priority developers we started out with
the question why are they so expensive
and is it possible to make a power meter
that stands out and well it started off
with this question and we had lots of
talks about it and drawings and we ended
up with a power meter which we think
meets all those requirements to design
the perfect power meter we went through
rigorous development we theorized
designed and redesigned to secure the
best tack and products components for
each part of the power meter
so now we are proud to introduce the
first high tech power meter everyone can
afford it runs on the standard battery
and connects through bluetooth and a and
t plus the adapter is made of light and
strong titanium with a nanostructure
strain gauge deposited on the surface
our advanced low pressure molding
technique produces a waterproof casing
and a total product that is very light
here's how it works on the inside when
your lag puts power on the pedal it
causes a miniature banding of the metal
a strain gauge captures this pressure as
a change in electrical resistance which
is measured and simply Center your app
or by computer most power meters measure
the power of one leg IQ square can
measure both so you can see if they're
performing the way you want them to you
can then adapt your training accordingly
of course we've tested our prototype
repeatedly like here on the direct
trainer where we optimized the power
meter to reach consistent and accurate
results we've done everything we could
to create a great turnkey product so you
can instantly start using it upon
delivery installation on your racer
mountain bike is easy you simply place
the adapt in the crank arm and fasten it
with the screw it's connected to our
support app where you can enter
customized bike measurements for a
smooth fit when you've successfully
completed the installation steps the app
pairs with the power meter and you're
good to go
it's compatible with all apps software
and bicycle computers like Garmin and
Strava so you can use your trusted
devices to immediately begin training
with our products and start pushing your
boundaries
this is an opportunity you can't miss
it's easy to use has great features and
is now ready to be ordered here on
Kickstarter 1iq square power meter costs
you 149 euros or get 2 at 2:49</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
