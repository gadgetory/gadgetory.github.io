a simple twist once activated the LED
lights turn on illuminating your work
when not in use the spindle locks and
can be used like a manual screwdriver a
circuit sensor is located at the front
of the tool press the voltage detection
button and place the sensor within 1
inch of a switch outlet cord or fixture

buzzer will let you know if electricity
is present an integrated wire stripper

insulation sleeve and wires can be bent
using the bending slot on top take the
guesswork out of any electrical project
and use a rechargeable screwdriver that
just does more the hammer head 4 volt
rechargeable screwdriver hammer head
works smarter</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
