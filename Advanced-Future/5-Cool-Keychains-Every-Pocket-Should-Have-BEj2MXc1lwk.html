just like your smartphone combines your
apps games and media keyport combines
your keys every day carry tools and
smart tech into the ultimate everyday
multi tool you will use dozens of times
a day every single day I've been
designing multi key devices for over ten
years today I'm proud to introduce two
new key ports with more multi tool and
tech features than ever before the
keyboard slide 3.0 which works with our
patented key blades and the key part
pivot based on some of my original
designs from over a decade ago works
with your existing keys both new
products are all metal and engineered to
accept our brand-new multi-tool and tech
features such as the Bluetooth locator
knife blade and LED flashlight
each device is totally customizable for
any type of music
keyboards mission is to create a system
that allows each user to consolidate and
customize their own unique set of tools
and keys for everyday life we try to
integrate customer feedback into
everything we do the features in our new
products are a direct result of our
customers requests the keyboard slide
3.0 is made of precision machined
aircraft grade aluminum with a spring
steel frame the ergonomic soft touch
side plates are interchangeable with our
new tech and tool modules the keyboard
key blades and inserts slide in and out
with your thumb as needed like the slide
the key port pivot is made of aircraft
aluminum with stainless steel components
and works with our new tech and tool
modules the flexible linkage allows the
device to expand from four to nine of
your existing keys and various key port
inserts our new low-profile lanyard
attachment locks to the end cap when not
in use the biggest complaint about keys
is losing them the tracker compatible
key port locator is a Bluetooth
low-energy
crowd-sourced locator that helps you
keep track of your key port at all times
our most popular request from Edie Sears
is the addition of a knife wave so we
partnered with clicker knives to develop
our knife module the keyboard knife
provides a sturdy cutting blade that can
easily be removed for airline travel and
then just as quickly reattached when you
unpack your luggage we're creating a
partner platform for makers students and
companies to create compatible modules
for our products we can't wait to see
what you come up with to top it off we
have upgraded our Lost &amp;amp; Found program
this new online lost-and-found service
connects owners and finders directly and
anonymously add a click with no
middleman or number to call once you
register your key part with keyboard ID
you'll be able to use that same number
on your other valuables such as your
phone laptop and even your wallet such a
service typically costs around $20.00
per year but we're including the first
year free with any slide or pivot reward
whether you slide our pivot pledge today
and help us set a key for it in your
pocket
