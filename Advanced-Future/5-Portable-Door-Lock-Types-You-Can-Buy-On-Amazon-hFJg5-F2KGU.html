to you about an innovative new security
product that I have developed to secure
vertical doors in emergency situations
like all Americans it saddens me each
time we hear reports of or need to
respond to another active shooter
situation as a SWAT team medic I've been
working to prevent these tragedies in my
community through active shooter
response training programs over the past
few years I have instructed thousands of
people on how to react during this type
of Muricy lockdown situation I've seen
firsthand how quickly they panic and
lose their fine motor skills during
these simple training exercises this
typical reaction made me realize that

emergency or lockdown situation the

installed to secure a classroom or
virtually any commercial door in an
emergency situation as shown the
