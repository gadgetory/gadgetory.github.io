hard on our 2016 line and we wanted to
give you a sneak preview of what we've
got coming up into biking your vibes
later this year a year by 2015 this year
we're launching our most security lock
the head knob DX where they actively
retain all the same fantastic features
of the original wearable D lock we've
increased the luck with the cumference
and re-engineer the internal mechanisms
to make it more secure the DSP comes
with a 1 meter accessory cable which
keeps delete the ends of the D making
easy to carry the reflective strip helps
increase rotation people the head knob
DX in the DX e gold soul to curate the
super-bright series seemed like a really
obvious and logical step for the hip
lock work will change we've combined
high visibility with high security so
you've got all three security levels
you've got on the wearable chain locks
but each one features a really standout
high visibility sleeve on it makes you
more visible to road users to call as
part of the range for next year's design
professional enthusiasts the Flex is a
wearable cafe style combination lock
with the added feature of a dual
function led because maybe a cyclist
when we set up a block we wanted to
create a really strong lock but really
easy to carry we've continued to expand
the range since then at 2016 we really
have created the strongest and most
versatile range so far to check out the
full range of 2016 currency is the Euro
bike or into microchip have you ever
forgotten your bike keys or got annoyed
with your bike lock so what if you
didn't need a key to use your bike lock

if you actually didn't have to do
anything at all and your bike would
still be safe with I'd lock it
we created the world's first fully
automatic bike lock that does exactly
that
I'd lock it automatically unlock your
bike when you're in close proximity so
you can just get on it and ride and once
you leave your bike I lock it make sure
it's safe all of this is fully automatic
so you don't have to press any buttons
or struggle with your bulky bike lock
with I'd lock it you can worry less and
enjoy more the
because that's what bike riding should
be about I locket is built with strong
and durable materials and can be easily
attached to most bikes and II bikes and
if your smartphone runs out of battery
you can easily open I lock it with your
custom click code also if you don't want
to take your smartphone with you you can
simply use the I lock it key fob instead
to give you a higher security I lock it

integrated sensors also sets off an
alarm in case anybody tries to break it
or tries to carry away your bike so you
will receive a notification that someone
is tampering with your bike and the bike
seat get scared away so you want to
leave your bike for a long time simply
add our additional cable to secure your
bike with a fixed object no need to
carry an additional lock of course all I
lock it functions can be easily
configured with the I locket smartphone
