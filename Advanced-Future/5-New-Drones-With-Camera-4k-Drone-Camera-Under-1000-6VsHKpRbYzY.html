as you know the Evo is the latest
evolution in drone technology let's take
a look at Evo's compact design the Evo
aircraft is a foldable quadcopter with a
stabilized three axis camera gimbal and
an integrated 4k Ultra HD camera to
fully deploy Evo we will need to unfold
the top arms first and then the bottom
arms when folding up the Evo start with
the bottom arms and then the top arms at
the front of the aircraft we have two
computer vision cameras that are part of
the visual navigation system used for
obstacle avoidance and other autonomous
features below the 4k Ultra HD camera
built on a 3-axis stabilized gimbal
let's remove the gimbal guard by
squeezing the sides and pulling down the
three axis gimbal is made up of three
motors on the pan tilt and roll axis on
the front of the camera there is a UV
filter to protect the camera lens this
UV filter can be removed and replaced
with compatible neutral density filters
also known as ND filters we will talk
about ND filters and want to use the
right filter in another video on the
right side of the Evo under the air vent
is the microSD card slot even includes a
32 gigabyte u 3 micro SD card and can
support up to a 128 gigabyte class 10
micro sd card at the rear of the
aircraft we will find the power button
holding this down for 3 seconds will
power up the aircraft then we have the
near IR sensor used for obstacle
avoidance under the cover we have a
micro USB port used for importing photos
and video to your computer and then the
pairing button used to pair a remote
controller to an aircraft your remote
controller will already be paired when
the aircraft arrives from the factory
the bottom plate on the aircraft acts as
a heat sink we will also find the rest
of the visual navigation system
consisting of two ultrasonic sensors and
two optical flow cameras at the end of
each arm we have an LED light indicator
and a motor
the Evo is 2 clockwise motors and 2
counterclockwise motors each with a
quick-release propeller mount to install
or remove propellers easily to install
the propeller match the propeller to the
corresponding motor by color align the
propeller then
down and twist to lock the propeller in
place and finally on the top of the
aircraft is a battery release button
when removing the battery from Evo pick
it up and press down on the button then
slide the battery towards the rear of
the aircraft to install the battery
align it and slide towards the front of
the aircraft you will hear an audible
click to replace the gimbal guard pull
the aircraft upside down squeeze the
sides and align the gimbal with the
camera until it is in place introducing
a revolution in flight two years ago
zero zero robotics introduced the hover
camera passport the first flying camera
of its kind and won numerous design
awards led to a worldwide partnership
with Apple retail and touch the lives of
thousands now after two years of
research and development from the lab to
the sky we're proud to present the next
generation hover to the drone that flies
itself hover 2 is the most intelligent
most complete flying camera the world
has ever seen
with 4k video 12 megapixel photos and a
smooth super compact gimble hover - lets
you capture the natural world and your
place in it in dazzling detail taking a
photo with a drone has never been easier
use auto frame to select the shot press
a button and hover to will safely fly
into position this is possible due to a
proprietary obstacle avoidance system
the optical radar is a swiveling stereo
sensor that pops up with a small tap
delivering 360 degrees spatial awareness
other twos new suite of AI algorithms
appeared with the Snapdragon processor
is four times more powerful than its
predecessor
3d mapping in advanced visual
positioning allow hover to two planets
flight path and bypass obstacles in
real-time use Omni follow to track your
movements from the front side and back
with more stability at higher tracking
precision both made possible by the new
AI track shots are flight presets
inspired by classic filming techniques
that help you capture at the clips of
you and your friends cinematic themes on
the hover AM include filters music and
more to transform footage you just
captured into shareable clips with
professional appeal to unlock the full
power of aerial flight enable blast-off
moment uncaged and paired with the
blast-off remote and accessories hover
to responds with up to 23 minutes of
flight time and a 5 kilometer range
aerodynamics agility and finesse are
also increased
poverty is the easiest and most
intuitive flying camera yet the
technology of the future available today
Anna fee is a flying camera that
contains cutting-edge photography
software and hardware an integrated
camera uses the latest generation sensor
for spectacular 4k HDR videos at 21
megapixel photos HDR has a far more
dynamic range to the image
it's ideal for filming a sunset or a
bright blue sky with exposed backdrops
and if he is the only drone on the
market able to do this it's a camera
capable of taking unique photos and
videos that just aren't possible with
any other drone in the same category the
camera tilts from minus 90 to plus 90
degrees vertically and take shots from
all angles the camera is equipped with a
wide-angle lens
featuring a hundred and ten degree
diagonal field of view the optic was
specifically designed to limit lens
flare in all lighting conditions we
integrated an f-22 timeless this digital
zoom and an up to three times standard
digital zoom the zoom led us to create a
brand-new smart drone eco-tourism better
known as the famous vertigo effect
traveling is not about the destination
embrace the journey preserve this moment
but with what hand riding cameras choose
wisely we are the directors of our lives
seeking the most beautiful environments
and spotting the perfect angle to
experience your grandest adventures all
of this is possible with the xeno smart
and portable no matter where you go
digitally capture your own motion
pictures wherever you wish it's your
camera man using image tracking it
follows and records at leisure capture
the fondest of memories wherever you go

recording ability to record 4k videos
and attention to every detail brings
lively color and vivid images to your
photography
your game is far more than what you can
see
with f 2.2 aperture and wide-angle lens
discover the fun in photography Ultra HD
4k captures more than you can imagine
focus distance is through 2.5 meters to
infinity making aerial lens comparable
to thin and quality if you don't go out
you never know how big the world is
bring Xena 1000 meter transmission
distance with 23 minutes flight time get
a wider view of the world with a flying
speed of 8 meters per second
flying does not stop here what is the
true meaning of the word convenience
takeoff land in return at the touch of a
button every location precisely
calculated the xenos staple hover and
easy flight everything begins precedes
and ends in simplicity the world is a
big place but not too much for the Xena</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
