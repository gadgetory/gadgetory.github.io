is completely not really awesome
no way that is super cool
like my perfectly
I'll lift it up from the top now go to
drink money mug that's what is the money
mop I give it the thumbs up
have you ever thought of how coffee was
discolored here is the story that
inspired creation of our product its
origin goes way way back in the history
once upon a time there was a man who
owned some goats
well lots of goats his goat stumbled
upon a bush of pretty red berries ate
them and then went bonkers technican
come up with the idea of brewing the
berries it resulted in a rich chocolate
colored beverage that made him feel out
of this world this story and dedication
to coffee brought us together to design
something special the goat man it's
amazing in all aspect how it looks how
you carried and how your assembly it's
also sustainable bpa-free and 100% legal
I'd love to drink coffee in the morning
I have to have it and I wake up but I
don't like carrying around a big travel
mug and I don't like using all these
disposable coffee cups Stowe Joe is the
answer it's a cup for coffee for tea for
any beverage and it collapses into a
little disc that's completely sealed so
you can put it away in your bag a
backpack your pocket and take it out
again to use later a couple years ago I
was sitting with some friends having
coffee and we had this idea a few days
later they sent me these 2d drawings and
from there we kind of just went I knew
that we could make this thing we made it
a point to keep the design simple three
main parts are made from food grain
materials you can easily take them apart
and wash them in the dishwasher or by
hand and when they're hooked back
together they create a liquid tight seal
making good iced coffee at home quickly
is nearly impossible until now we've all
been stuck with two main options use a
cold brew recipe that actually takes all
day to make or try a brew of her iced
recipe that's so ridiculous you'd think
it was written by a chemist I've tried
them both and I went back to spending
time and money each day to swing by the
coffee shop
that was until last year when I came up
with a better solution the hyper chiller
is a simple patent-pending product that
enables you to turn fresh hot coffee
into perfect iced coffee in one minute
flat the hyper chiller was designed to
be compatible with my single serve
brewer and all other traditional brewing
methods it works when the hot coffee
flows into the center cooling chamber
which is surrounded with food grade
stainless steel and ice on all sides the
surface area to volume ratio and they're
through the roof so the hot coffee is
cooled by over a hundred and thirty
degrees in one minute with zero dilution
at that point it's cold enough to pour
into your regular glass over ice and
will still be strong or you can just
leave it in the high perch or a bit
longer and it'll be cold enough to drink
without any ice at all convenience was a
big influence on creating the hyper
chiller it's completely machine washable
and constructed of durable stainless
steel and bpa-free plastic I like a big
cup so I made sure it can hold a lot it
can chill up to 12 and a half ounces at
once start saving time and money and
enjoy perfect iced coffee at home today
hello there you're thinking about coffee
right now aren't you of course you are a
lot goes into the perfect cup great
beans good strong for
precisely the right temperature that's
why you spend up to $1,000 a year on
this stuff think about that for a moment
you're spending that money because you
crave perfection right then look what
you go and do with it you pour it into
this Cup great coffee depends
upon precise temperature but your cup
can't hold its heat can it which means
that by the time you've taken your third
or your fourth set no perfect coffee
isn't perfect anymore how would you like
to keep your coffee perfect right
through to your last sip tantalizing
isn't it this is ember and by lets you
keep your coffee at the temperature you
like for as long as you please I like
mine at 138 degrees hot how does Emma do
that excellent question not one I can
answer whew I'm afraid let's see I'm not
a scientist I'm a British actress I
don't think about that for a minute look
at the mug beautiful yes
this isn't nuclear fusion or brain
surgery here it's a coffee mug but it
just so happens that it's the best damn
coffee mug on list there and if you're
going to spend $1,000 a year on coffee
why not do it justice with the perfect
mug
and
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
