and write fast
every journey will be a stand-up
everybody will exercise your back
the track one opens up new possibilities
this is an all-season all-terrain
electric board for the first time a
track was developed with a
patent-pending tire like form factor
this allows for the board to benefit
both incredible traction of a track in
the fluid carving feeling of the board
for the past 10 years we've been
engineering everything from drones
aerospace all-terrain and electric
vehicles and realize there's nothing on
the market that combined all of this
coolest tech into one portable machine
we used our electric car experience to
reinvent the track as you know it we do
everything in-house we imagine design
patent build manufacture and test every
detail all here at flux our dream was to
create a portable vehicle that allows
you peace of mind knowing no matter what
situation storm adventure or daily
transit demands you face the track one

rain is a force to be reckoned with and
only our patented continuous track can
cruise through whatever nature</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
