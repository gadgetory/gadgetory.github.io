that's awesome
we are domi oh sports the company behind
the top-rated helmet audio system domi
oh after having successfully launched
and shipped our first product worldwide
we're here with our second product the
all-new domi Oh Pro the inspiration
behind dome EO was simple with our love
for music and outdoor sports we
struggled to find an audio product that
worked well when wearing a helmet many
didn't sound very good and all were
uncomfortable but most of all we never
felt safe using any of them they blocked
our ears from hearing the outside
environment cutting off a vital sense
when we needed it most
when we couldn't find something we built
a device that mounts to the outside of
the helmet but transfers sound into the
helmet using the technology called micro
vibration we adapted this technology to
transfer the full spectrum of audio
frequencies into the helmet resulting in
a powerful and rich surround sound
experience without blocking the outside
environment that was back in 2016
fast-forward to today and we've grown to
a team of 9 sold and shipped thousands
of domi o--'s worldwide received five
star reviews and worked with top-tier
partners in manufacturing
electronics and marketing our die-hard
customers kept telling us how much
better done√∂ would be with one important
addition voice communication so we
decided to do something about it the
dome EO pro features our new fully
wireless air mic a state-of-the-art
beamforming noise cancelling microphone
that delivers seamless connectivity and
voice clarity the device and mic mount
to the helmet using our snapping helmet
mounts backed by the toughest 3m
adhesive so they stay on no matter how
hard you ride we put hundreds of hours
into carefully designing and testing the
dome EO / we're Daredevils but we're not
naive we know that your helmet is the
single most important accessory for your
riding experience
so we designed the best damn helmet in
the market the jar fish ax a our smart
helmet
the Jarvis shacks AR helmet is made out
of a lightweight aerodynamic
polycarbonate carbon fiber shell with
built in wide-angle 2 K front and rear
cameras that offer 360-degree field and
the industry's first voice-activated
retractable heads-up display the charger
shacks AR helmet connects to your
smartphone via bluetooth allowing you to
see incoming call notifications Road
slip warning weather notification gas
station icon dangerous section warning
the speed warning traffic notification
GPS navigation and rear view images on
demand
I forgot to introduce our guest of honor
hi Alexa hey it's great to be here all
these features and more can be
controlled by voice command since safety
is our number one priority
the Jarvis Shulman has CNS do Tec safety
certifications anti-fog anti-scratch
anti glare visor and 100% military-grade
battery
our state-of-the-art technology empowers
every rider to enjoy the riding
experience and don't deny it this is
your dream helmet pre-order now
hi everyone my name's Matt my name's
James and we are the founders of limpet
a few years ago
Rotom ate self and left my bike outside
just leaning against the wall quite a
bug got with me but it's not the talking
to you and in that short space of time
someone pinched it I also had a bike
with a tracker on but it wasn't a
deterrent in itself so didn't stop
someone just taking the bike and they
just took the tracker off and threw it
away we needed an answer where we could
provide a plausible theft deterrent as
well as something with the tracking
capability and that's where the idea of
limited came from three years worth of
prototyping and we're finally at a point
where we could show you guys what we've
got we're both really excited we vote
for everything on the line to make this
happen and make it a reality and we just
can't wait to take this thing out there
take it to market and start helping
people keep their motor bikes and bikes
a we've really hope you like it
and thank you so much for your support
as bikers we're facing the road and its
dangers there our concern
safety our greatest challenge sharing
the road with other users we want style
or deserve safety
that's why rail introduces the first
illumines jacket for bikers
more than two-thirds that the accidents
are caused by a lack of visibility
however the available equipment today
settle for protecting us when falling a
trailers we decided to go beyond in
order to offer the most optimal security
to bikers we placed lights at strategic
and high visibility spots on the jacket
relying on a survey about the demolition
of motorbike accidents conducted by the
French insurance company than life when
we speak of safety our first thoughts go
to the high vis jackets if we want to
change that by joining style and safety
our team is composed of designers
stylists couturiers and model makers
with their French traditional know-how
our first prototypes were handmade in a
Parisian workshop thanks to our team of
creative engineers we were able to
associate handmade know-how and new
technologies
sober and elegant we've conceived a high
quality jacket the discrete integration
of the LEDs is a perfect fit for a daily
use placed in a strategic manner the 12
LEDs ensure that you are seeing both day
and night two additional functions allow
you to improve your communication with
other users an onboard accelerometer
intensifies the rear lights while
breaking a warning mode can be activated
for an even better visibility in the
most risky situations the removable
battery can last up to 8 hours enough
for you not to worry about it
you can even recharge your phone while
driving each jacket holds protection
shells made out of viscoelastic
materials it offers the best compromise
between comfort and safety
the luminous jacket is available in all
sizes for both male and female bikers
