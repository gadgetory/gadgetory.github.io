devices with a traditional multimeter is
a hassle dials switches tethered leads
and technical jargon add complexity and
difficulty and keeping track of
measurements can be a real pain as well
now there's an easier way introducing
violin the world's simplest Bluetooth
multimeter
vayan simplifies testing electronics for
malfunctions it can automatically
measure electrical output and send data
to smartphones and the VAIO app provides
you a live feed of all the electrical
measurements taken with vion ions
unibody design makes it lightweight and
easy to store perfect for your workshop
your home or your car connect via onto
your smart phone using bluetooth and
measure values and real-time vion reads
back stored measurements through voice
guidance so you don't have to worry
about looking down at your phone
byeon gives you a simple good or bad
result indicator so you'll know right
away in real time if your device is
working properly
vayan has colored LEDs built into the
handles for quick visual reference as
well flashing lights for connectivity
status use Buy in to check if your
batteries are running low if your
electronic devices are working correctly
or if their wiring problems in your home
Bayan caters toward both experts and
novices and supports most functions
found on traditional multimeters so
contractors and electricians can use it
on the job as well as a boy trying to
fix his RC car reading measurements that
Bayan collects is easy but for those who
like data you can review all the
detailed information displayed in the
VAIO app you can automatically detect
the error of the device and have the
measurements saved on the application
vayan is the easiest and safest way to
troubleshoot problems with electronic
devices
vayan eliminates the hassle and expenses
of calling for repair services anyone
can easily use it for countless
situations
unlike other multimeters biown has no
body making its paired probes easy to
store and carry
vayan the world's simplest bluetooth
multimeter the heavy-duty ratcheting
bolt cutter easily slices through guy
strand one smooth and easy cut does it
all the spring-loaded cable retention
hook snaps onto the cable in one
hands-free motion and prevents
individual steel strands from slipping
out of the cutting jaws a smooth ratchet
mechanism and long handles for high
leverage make the Cline ratcheting bolt
cutter the easiest to use on the market
we get dirty and comes up with such a
smaller range to cut to this one if you
google quarter-inch up than average
replace a whole nother two line cuts
better I can cut this one on two fingers
actually
the heavy-duty ratcheting bolt cutter
gets the job done easier klein tools for
utility workers since 1857 the most
important part of any electrical project
is you but do you have the right tools
for today's tough repetitive jobs the
kinds of tools that help you work fast
without taking a toll on your body
introducing the Greenlee micro tool line
new bolt cutter new cable cutters and
existing crimper as a step-up from
manual tools these micro power battery
tools can help you work faster safer
easier each tool is ergonomically
designed to be easier on the body
reducing the risk of repetitive motion
injuries to shoulders arms wrists and
hands the risks are real
studies show 29 percent of all injuries
involving repetitive use of tools result
in carpal tunnel syndrome and that could
mean five months away from work so step
up from manual tools to Greenlees micro
cutters and crimper the trigger is easy
to use reducing the amount of force on
hands by 93 percent compared to manual
tools
also the 350-degree rotating head can be
adjusted for tight spaces and angles
leading to fewer body contortions by
your team and they weigh in at just four
pounds plus gator ID is available for
all Greenlee micro tools to provide a
work history on a jobsite you take care
of everything now look to Greenlee for
tools that can help take care of you
faster safer easier
all types of connectors from tubular
cable sockets cable connectors and end
sleeves through two common solar
connectors can be crimped using the e
crimp kinetics offers a standard range
of more than 40 crimping dies and
locators to be used with the e crimp and
on request more than 1,000 special
crimping dyes are available all crimping
dies for the crimped system pliers can
of course be used with the ich ramp
crimping of large cross-sections is a
cinch using the Egret
even 50 millimeter squared n sleeves and
25 millimeter square tubular cable
sockets can be crimped easily and
without exerting a great deal of manual
force
noop X equal pliers have significant
advantages that make crimping easier and
faster due to their novel shape and
compact design they can be set down
safely on the work desk
this results in a convenient and
user-friendly working height when used
in the workshop the multi component
handle allows secure gripping whilst the
one-button operating concept enables
simplicity of use an integrated led
working light illuminates the crimping
area the reset button opens the pliers
at any time if an interruption of the
regular operating sequence is required
the use of locators is unique for a
cordless crimping tool they are
assembled in just a few simple steps
using the tool attached on the handle
the locators make a lining of connectors
and conductors much easier the
connectors are perfectly positioned and
don't require any fine adjustment or
further attention during the crimping
process crimping can be completed much
more conveniently and reliably than ever
before particularly crimping sequences
can be done faster and more precisely
there is another advantage when used in
the workshop the kunai packs a crimp is
much quieter due to the
electromechanical drive and the noise is
considerably more pleasant compared to
cordless electro-hydraulic systems
every crimp with a perfect fit the
crimping process is always completed
with the necessary pressure thereby
guaranteeing absolute process
reliability the multifunctional display
indicates the battery charge status
servicing and cycle
