perfect backup plan the portable
versatile talon by tactical modern life
presents challenges work sports
adventures small things can easily blow
out and become big talent helps keep the
small things small made with an advanced
composite technology and world first
patient pending design the talon packs
17 tools and features to match in a
pocket-sized carry it comes with metric
and imperial wrenches and rulers box
cutter bottle opener and standard
quarter-inch phillips &amp;amp; flathead hack
stripes the talon adapts to your life
simply swap out the hex drives for your
next adventure whether you need an Allen
head 30 stalks the Talon holds to within
its body a flexible elastomer keeps the
tools locked in place and ready when you
need them the original socket design
allows your hand to be positioned as you
would with a regular screwdriver a
feature that many pocket tools don't
allow the talon is made of one of the
world's most advanced composite
materials 40% lighter than titanium and
the strength of diecast metal plus the
material tech allows you to carry your
talent without fear of scratching your
latest phone or tablet the talon can go
anywhere you do and it complies with
current tsa requirements for air travel
the australian designed engineered and
manufactured talon multi-tool by
tactical compact enough to carry
everyday lightweight enough not to weigh
you down
heavy duty enough to get things done
talon in your hand enough said
two years ago we bought you tactic is
first crowdfunding campaign the one
bottle opener and now we have our latest
innovation ready for you
Talon pushes the limits with materials
technology and functionality its patent
pending design is made possible by using
an advanced composite material this
makes it super strong and enables the
unique unibody design that increases
strength and hardness we've also created
a dual purpose storage compartment into
the design to function as a socket
something that hasn't been possible in a
multi-tool until now we make the Talon
in Melbourne Australia and over the past
few months our team has worked closely
to perfect the design for manufacture
it's great to be involved again with the
same factory that produces our popular
one bottle opener this kind of
collaborations made sure that everyone
involved has a deep understanding of the
project and the high standards we expect
having a local manufacturer also reduces
the risks usually associated with
overseas manufacture now waiting on
shipments faulty products or delivery
delays will be right there in front of
the machine as they come off the line it
doesn't get any more personal than that
importantly tooling has already
commenced yes that's right we've made
the decision to launch straight into the
production process because we reckon
you're going to want one or two in time
for Christmas we're tooling the models
now and we'll be ready for full-scale
production well before Christmas thanks
for the support and look forward to
getting a talent in your hand soon
the Leatherman signal project for us has
been a dream come true it started with
an every third Thursday concept a show
we do where we build unique snowboards
and together we just decided to come up
with a line of tools specific tools for
snowboarding and from there it's grown
and do a great partnership you know
we're building all of our snowboards in
California they're building all their
tools in Portland and it's just a really
good relationship we started with a
couple carabiner tool it's just really
simple just gateway tools as we call
them to get them on our belt loops or
just in our pocket something we could
travel with everything is TSA compliant
and it was just about having the right
tool on you that didn't take up a ton of
space in your pocket or try to stab you
when you're riding down the hill
we're putting a team together right now
which is really exciting for us we get
to work with riders from all board
brands we're getting them on the tools
they're giving us feedback they're using
them in the field and we have a chance
to make some of the best tools ever made
what's the worst that could happen if
this is your answer then this is your
multi-tool but if you do real work
probably want a multi-tool built for
real challenges Gerber Center Drive is
the first multi-tool with a full-size
standard bit driver on the center axis
that means it drives screws just like
the real thing and you can interchange
your Center Drive bits with all the bits
you already own by finding another
multi-tool that can do that no keep
looking but this is no one-trick pony
Gerber Center Drive delivers a full
sized outboard knife with reverse thumb
support
the blade is still be percent longer
than the competition it's okay little
buddy a lot of guys have that problem
since real life doesn't wait the center
Drive driver knife and pliers are all
instantly accessible with one hand the
same can't be said for this one you also
get all the other tools you need
you don't so you'll have everything to
fix just about anything
the multi-tool just got a reality check
MTS is a modular system that utilizes
individual tool bits rather than
pivoting allen keys
four of which can be held internally
allowing it to be configured to match
the specific requirements of any bike
tire leavers snap magnetically to each
side forming an urban on ik handle
whilst the elongated body provides
superior leverage the head of the tool
features a pair of tool bit slots the
first is alway intensive like a wrench
and the second like a screwdriver there
is also a Torbett extender for tighter
areas common spoke key sizes are
situated around the edge of the tool and
the handles don't just offer a
comfortable grip MTS is enhanced when
paired with MTR a novel twist on the
traditional Toro internal sections for
storing the tool in its additional tool
bits are accompanied by a ripstop lined
zipped pouch for other cycling
essentials the top flap features a
concealed magnets are no longer do you
risk losing your tool bits a spare inner
tube can be secured to the underside
forming a compact bundle that will be
struck under a saddle or slit neatly in
a Jersey pockets
the module range has been designed to be
comprehensive enough for the users at
home that still remain suitable for the
road
the extensive product development and
prototyping have yielded a powerful yet
portable alternative to conventional
folding tools
