hide that game of tag played by millions
around the world
the all-new Michaels compact size means
you can go anywhere or anyone
Laser X
flip deck is a handheld action toy we
set out to build a toy where anyone with
any skill level can throw some sick
tricks look it is fun to flip stuff
adults grandparents kids like to flip
stuff anybody can play
having the toy communicate with you that
knows what you're doing knows what
tricks you're attempting there's a
precedent for a handheld gaming big
successful you now in 2018 there's a
technology available to us to be able to
build a toy where we can throw something
in the air catch it and it tells us
exactly what we did I see people
definitely playing it in breweries all
over the country it's a great brewery
bar drinking game right now we have four
colors our core color is neon green and
black it's made of a foam bottom with a
plastic faceplate on it
and we've got all the electronics and
buttons and all the sensors and stuff
and invented inside of the toy we use
some 3d modeling software to come up
with a way to make the foam we could
throw it up in the air and whip it
around and it's not gonna hurt to catch
it it gives a shock absorption that way
the game is safe the components for the
flip deck speaker at the top your
display right under that three buttons
which you use to navigate the menu three
lights the green light in the middle
tells you when you're ready to do a
trick under the logo you have your two
batteries in your capacitor the center
of mass is where the gyroscope and /
accelerometer sensor is so how do you
play flip deck free play you just flip
it in the air and the flip deck will
tell you if you landed something or not
flips FL yps which is our equivalent of
horse solo ladder where you play by
yourself gives you a trick list starting
from easier to harder you climb the
ladder attempting tricks when you
actually land a trick and the game tells
you what you landed there's nothing like
it it's a fun game for everybody but
it's also a game of skill it takes
practice to be able to do it
thing you don't land it flip deck Louie
there TZ a little bit or offer some
words of encouragement back when we were
growing up skateboarding we'd flip
anything we'd get our hands on the idea
of building something where you know we
don't have to argue on if that was a
trick or that was a trick you know the
actual toy would be the judge so why do
we need you and why we've done the
Kickstarter we think that flip deck is
awesome that everyone in the country and
eventually the world should have the
opportunity to play it well we're able
to build prototypes in the garage right
now afford to do it ourselves the only
way to get it in your hands is to
mass-produce it the main reason why we
went with the physical stand alone toy
is it's way more fun to flip than your
phone a lot of people aren't going to
want to flip their eight hundred nine
hundred dollar phones nowadays so we
thought it'd be cool to get people
interacting again you know enjoying
themselves and each other playing a game
that's actually tangible or not just
staring on a screen
