incorporating the very latest in GNSS
technology a modern rugged sleek design
introducing the new GC x2 from so kia
RTK GNSS has never been so simple just
open the GC x2 case and discovered this
bulletproof GNSS solution just one look
and you realize that this is something
new and different
the sopia GC x2 is a dual frequency
multi constellation GNSS receiver an
innovative shape packed with
leading-edge technology which delivers
RTK centimeter level performance don't
let the size fool you the GC x2 can
operate all day on a single charge
it can be used as a static receiver for
fixed point location capable of storing
hours of data in its internal memory a
pair of GC x 2 receivers can be used as
an RN ck base and rover system with
interference free data communication of
up to 300 meters the GC x2 provides a
lightweight and cable free RTK system
when matched with the s10 so Kia's
latest field controller the s10
controller comes with an integrated
cellular modem and bluetooth when used
with magnet software the s10 delivers
results with workflow efficiency and
productivity utilizing the integrated
modem of the s10 or other cellular
enabled controller the GC x2 is an ideal
precision networked Rover no matter what
your budget is for survey construction
GIS or small jobsite applications the so
kia GC x2 GNSS solution is for you
innovative simple lightweight rugged
affordable with a nude shape welcome to
bulk start the world of getting pol base
construction done fast and efficiently
both star provides a fast easily
repeatable process that delivers
consistent quality in half the time
compared to the conventional method and
both star is reusable to appreciate the
benefits of both star let's take a
moment to review an inefficient method
of building bolt templates the way it's
commonly done today
the conventional method is
labor-intensive and typically involves
the custom fabrication of a wood
template for each base without both star
it's a painful 14 step process riddled
with time-consuming steps opportunities
for costly errors and the inherent
safety risks that come with the use of
saws and drills at every step along the
way or each pole base material has to be
ordered and labor is expended measuring
and cutting material for the template
followed by inspection and then the
concrete pourer
after the pour it's time to travel
finish the exposed pole base top but
stop right there a huge inefficiency
exists at this point with the
conventional method there's insufficient
room to finish the entire pole bay stop
in one step that conventionally built
pole templates get in the way what
happens next is the crew must wait
around for 30 to 45 minutes until the
concrete sets up only then can the wood
template be removed to allow performing
the final finish pull the template too
early and run the risk of the bolts
sinking or shifting on the other hand
wait too long and the top can't be
completed with a quality finish leaving
unsightly form marks in the top of the
base this is the way it's been done for
years with little or no innovations
until bolts start introducing both star
and innovative multi-function pole base
template engineered to hold the anchor
bolts rebar cage and conduit securely in
place during the concrete pourer the
result of years of design refinement and
testing bolt star is a superior bolt
template designed by contractors to
virtually eliminate the drawbacks of the
conventional hole base construction
process install bolt star over the
conduits and place it directly on top of
the tube form both star is
self-supporting which means there's no
time wasted cutting custom support forms
and building templates out of wood check
both stars integrated bubble levels to
ensure a level base before securing the
tube to the h frame both stars unique
design features built-in slots for
anchor bolts between 5/8 and 1 inch in
size and accommodates the pole
manufacturers bolt patterns in
specifications what's more verified that
anchor bolts are set to the correct
elevation above top of form using bolt
stars bolt projection calculator wire up
the rebar cage using both star specially
designed cage positioning slots in each
arm these slots enter and firmly hold
the rebar cage during the concrete pour
in fact the slots are strong enough to
hang 500 pounds call for inspection and
you're ready to pour both stars for arms
feature wide openings that easily
accommodate the concrete shooter pump
including plenty of room for a vibrator
after the pour there's no waiting around
both stars patented arched arms allow
easy access with a trowel so the entire
top of the base can be finished in one
step
while anchor bolts are held firmly and
perfect alignment returned after the
concrete sets up remove bolt star and
save it for the next job bolt star an
innovative tool that's changing the way
we think about constructing pole bases
and significantly improving methods in
the industry</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
