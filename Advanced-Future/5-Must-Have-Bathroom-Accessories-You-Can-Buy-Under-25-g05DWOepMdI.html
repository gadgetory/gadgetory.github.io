this is without doubt one of the most
awesome Bluetooth speakers out there so
what's so special about it
well for one it's Waterson the whole
point of this is that you can stick into
your shower and use it right there all
you have to do is use your phone turn it
on turn on bluetooth you want autumn and
it pair it plops your uncle but the
shower is not the only place where you
have to use really any place you can
think of wherever you can stick it onto
a good surface that's where it goes and
even the distance is pretty amazing I
mean I've tried this about 10 15 feet or
so or great all the way across the room
or into the next room no complaints
there but what really blew me away about
this thing is the power of the speakers
I'm surprised how incredibly loud it can
get and you can control it right from
here while you're in the shower or from
your phone doesn't really matter works
either way I should say your mom call
you in the shower you don't have to go
out and reach for that phone wherever it
is all you have to do push the top
button hey mom ah yeah kind of busy
right now but if it's your girlfriend I
would recommend you keep talking you
know you never know so I can definitely
recommend the speed stick for anyone who
wants to keep on listening to the music
or having a phone conversation while in
the shower yeah you may not you know be
used to doing that but once you get the
chance you're actually going to do it
oh he's your tub drain getting stopped
up with hair every time you take a
shower are you fed up with hair
straighteners like this that are messy
and slimy and hard to clean well don't
hate your hair get a tubs room tubs room
is the all new and better way to snare
your hair and prevent claw tub drain

hair they do catch
on display while you shower and harder
to get rid of when you're done

trapped here water flows freely down the
drain and cleanup is always fast and

hi I'm here to tell you about an
invention that will revolutionize ature
that we all love to hate cleaning the
toilet recognize this the classic toilet
brush design has remained unchanged for
decades sad fact is it's completely
under progress the bristles clog up very
easily meaning they're extremely
unhygienic and hard to clean they retain
water meaning they drip everywhere and
they're also extremely inefficient you
have to scrub back and forth and they
never clean under the room two years ago
I decided to do something about it
in 2013 Gary brought together a team of
product designers engineers and material
specialists and went into the lab to
work on a new product that would help
change the way that toilets are cleaned
forever with its patented swipe clean
technology the silicon blades follow the
contours of the toilet bowl and reach
under the rim with ease swiping the
surface clean a silver-based additive
kills germs both during and after
cleaning and helps cut down bleach use
the blades do not get clogged up like
bristles and have a hydrophobic coating
that sheds water and dries quickly a
hollow-point head feature also helps
clear blockages air flows freely through
the holder to quickly evaporate any
remaining moisture let's look at how Lu
Glade helps overcome the main failings
of the toilet brush
the bristles of a toilet brush quickly
become cloth which is haunted as large
especially after it has dried with Lou
blade the smooth flat surfaces are
easily kept clean and clear with just a
gentle shake after shaking look how much
potentially germ filled and smelly water
is still contained in the brush Lou
glades hydrophobic coating ensures that
all water is almost immediately removed
the bristles of a brush only touch part
of the surface which is why you need to
scrub back and forth to get things
cleaned with continuous contact Lou
blades swipes the surface clean in a
single pass so there you have it
a very strong team a great product
manufacturing channels are ready and we
can be shipping by early December we
just need your help to raise funds so
that tooling can be made in
manufacturing again help us to take
cleaning to the edge we wake up each
morning to a brand new day a day of
balance and wellness we nourish our body
with healthy foods we physically stretch
our bodies in hopes of stretching our
minds everything we do goes back to our
well being but there is one piece we
often tend to neglect from the wellness
puzzle introducing turbo a simple and
effective addition to your daily routine
before the 19th century toilets were
non-existent people used to squat to
release two thirds of the world actually
still do and for good reason as we
adopted the toilet into our lives we
unknowingly added tension and straining
during bowel movements
studies have shown us the perpendicular
posture brought on by the toilet creates
a kink in my colon which makes it
difficult to go
it also makes us susceptible to a number
of other health issues by elevating your
feet that kink disappears your muscles
are able to relax and your colon is open
for quick and efficient release and
that's why we invented turbo turbo is an
elegant yet affordable solution that
makes a great addition to any bathroom
it's sleek design allows for flexibility
and comfort the unique ramp design makes
using turbo easier for any person of any
size the lower toe area allows you to
easily load your feet then you can
position your feet forward or backward
on the ramp to adjust to a squat that's
just right for you and with turbo
squatting is only the beginning
turbo comes with interchangeable massage
rollers to further increase your comfort
on the toilet not only does it feel good
but it can help with constipation too
your feet have pressure points that can
stimulate your colon when it's time to
go massaging with turbo also helps with
blood circulation which can improve your
energy levels to get you through the day
we have come a long way and we are
almost there the only thing missing is
your suffering</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
