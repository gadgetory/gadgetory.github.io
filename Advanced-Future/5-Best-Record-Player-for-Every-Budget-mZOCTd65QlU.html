I was selling high five products to
friends and the turntables that I used
to buy used to arrive broken as a naive
young engineer I just assumed I could
make something quicker than I could
repair the broken turntables and that
started the company I made something a
little bit visually different and gave
us a very very definite but small market
in the beginning when the company had
been going a few years we were able to
be more confident and going the duration
that we wanted to which was better sound
quality an LP contains a series of
vibrations but when it's standing still
it's in oil it only produces those
vibrations when it's rotated and those
vibrations are so small so minuscule
they're less than a millionth of an inch
or a thousand for than a millimeter so
that rotational speed is crucial and the
accuracy of the rotational speed is
crucial at a level that most people
can't quite comprehend so precision
engineering is a key to many of the
parts we make most of it is below
realistic measurement levels and we tend
to use people's senses their ability to
feel very very small dimensional changes
I'm in an industry where I do not
personally know a turntable designer
there are other companies that make
turntables but I don't know any
turntable designers at all and I feel
very lonely
design is absolutely crucial even for a
small company we have a team of five
design engineers and we are constantly
re-evaluating everything we make every
minute of the day we're trying to
improve trying to look at new materials
new techniques and our aim has literally
been musical pleasure but using our
engineering expertise to create that
musical pleasure
