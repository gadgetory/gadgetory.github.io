concealed carry handgun you'd make it
small lightweight easy to operate
extremely powerful with very
controllable recoil at Heiser defense
LLC we have done just that
we manufacture the world's smallest most
powerful handguns our guns are literally
built like a tank right here in the USA
using aircraft grade stainless steel
having been tested by firing 5,000
rounds in just under two and a half days
with no breakages malfunctions or
failures our current family of Heiser
products includes the PSone pocket
shotgun the P AR 1 pocket AR and our
signature head II Jane empowered line
geared toward women while the PS 1
chambers 410 or 45 long cold rounds and
the P AR one fires two to three rounds
both guns feature multi caliber
interchangeable barrels the PS one and
pai one both weigh approximately 22
ounces due to the absence of an external
safety both have intentionally long
trigger pulls with a factory spec of 12
pounds both are constructed of stainless
steel with or without a black icing I
finish and due to their small thin
design neither prints a profile through
most clothing ladies will love our heady
chain line of guns featuring many of the
same benefits of the ps1 and pai one the
heady Jane is also chambered with
powerful 410 or 45 long colt rounds yet
is only seven tenths of an inch wide
small enough to fit easily into any
purse it also comes in five different
customizable colors including aqua pink
and purple on stainless steel finishes
for zombie green available with either a
stainless or black finish the key to our
guns unique combination of high power
with low recoil lies in its
revolutionary design which incorporates
several patented technologies first its
stainless steel frame adds enough weight
to hold high calibers while avoiding the
risk of hand injury next our guns
feature the lowest bore axis in the
business effectively eliminating muzzle
rise finally our unique grip takes
recoil into the skeleton allowing for a
straight back
low felt recoil firing a hyzer couldn't
be simpler the convenient ambidextrous
thumb latch on the side allows for fast
and smooth tactical reloads while the
Lube free double action trigger module
sits on roller bearings for a smoother
trigger pull and best of all these guns
are virtually maintenance-free alright
Jason just spill it we have a gun that
shoots pellets full of pepper spray this
there's no way this ends well because
when you pitched it to me you're like oh
it's like a paintball gun
but it does pepper spray and I'm
thinking Oh pepper spray we've been
there before yeah then we open this
thing and it's Robocop's gun are you
kidding me with the co2 cartridges and
then I open up these pellets it's like
an Excel with a jawbreaker in his
automatic you you've got the yeah so
this is from the salt supply company
this is from my nightmares is where it's
from some of the practice rounds but
they're very hard and they're filled
with military-grade pepper spray this is
home defense yeah this is good someone
the hell out of your house it's also
non-lethal I'll tell you I mean this is
gonna do damage though I guess let's
load the practice rounds practice rounds
yeah all of them no let's do have them
okay
all right seven ball mag oh wow it
really does it loads just like a like a
paintball gun
well no no like these like bullets and
then I guess we have to pressurize this
yes all right we'll get high protection
as well and then you pull it out it
screws all the way out and you load this
guy in at this point we got the co2 in
there all right here we go
oh it just put it just oh the co2 that
was the co2 cartridge in ours
alright I'll just shoot it into the
trees and is live holy
how you feeling scared
big fire so freakin best you don't need
to arc it it just write down the site
yeah now we need to kick it up a notch
and go with live rounds alright let's
give it a go
the moment that puffs I want to get you
in there I'll pop up alright here we go
alright it's live it's coming at your
face and three two oh oh
no stop stop don't move don't move don't
move
eyes closed oh geez it did pop on you
alright
oh my god it's all over your face oh my
god alright are you okay oh my god my
eyes burning getting near you oh my god
rag Oh what was it like just like
immediate blindness and stinging okay so
what's weird is I only saw a little puff
and then you just stood up it didn't
even look like much of your face was in
there the moment I stood up I couldn't
see well now it's your turn
hi folks Aaron Boyd here wanted to do a
quick video show in how the life card
operates there's a latch here on the
upper part in the frame this is the
barrel latch slide that back you can
tilt the barrel up I'm gonna just put a
snap cap in there slide the latch back
close the barrel and it will lock closed
there's a similar latch on the bottom on
the handle just slide that forward and
split the two halves go all the way till
it locks open from there it's gonna
operate like a normal gun do you just
cock the bolt pull the trigger reset the
bolt to the half cocked flush with the
rear of the frame that's the position
that you're gonna use to fold it closed
there you go hi Heather here quick video
review this here in front of us is the
sting ring by streetwise this comes in
black as well but the one I have
obviously is pink this little guy has 18
million bolts in it really compact easy
to use I'll show you in a second so
here's what you get you get the box you
get the plug-in charger you get the
instruction manual with everything you'd
need to know very simple and easy to use
so you don't need a lot of instructions
and here's the device itself so here on
the front just streetwyze security
products you see a little red light
there in the front it's turned off
because the unit is off here is the
on/off switch when you're holding it
because you would hold it like this
excuse me let me do that the other way
you would hold it like this switch
towards you is off this port is where
you'd plug it in to charge nothing on
this side nothing on this side on the
back side towards the palm of your hand
there is a button this is what's going
to complete the circuit and set it off
when it's turned on I'll show you in a
second here is the the side with the
metal prongs no problem touching it
again when the units off so all you do
is you would hold it in your hand you
can hold it walk around with it off
until you need it hopefully you never
will but in that case all you do is
you're gonna flip the switch up for on
red light tells that's its on and then
I'm gonna squeeze this in my hand which
is going to push this button to complete
the circuit and set the electrical
charge off so I'm gonna be quiet and
squeeze it so you can hear what 18
million volts sounds like squeeze and
unfortunately on the camera it kind of
just looks like it's lighting up like an
LED light but there are no lights on the
end of this at all what you're seeing is
actually a spark if you're in person you
can see the sparks flying and slightly I
don't want to say projecting out because
they don't shoot out and they won't
touch they won't zap you unless you
actually touch this to someone or
something but you can see the electrical
charge so this tiny little guy very
powerful 18 million volts again this is
the sting ring by streetwise really cool
product and something I will take with
me when I walk the dog and then out and
about in the city alone and just want
some extra protection I hope this helped
you
you
you
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
