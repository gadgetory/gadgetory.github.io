the world this is the story of two men
Berto pica psychiatrist and Explorer and
Andre Borschberg engineer and
entrepreneur a team driven by a vision
of the future and a passion for
innovation and the first airplane of
perpetual endurance able to fly day and
night without fuel
together with their partners they wanted
to show the power of pioneering spirit
and clean technologies to bring
solutions for a better world Solar
Impulse the adventure showing that
change is possible inspiring generations
promoting innovative solutions to the
challenges of humanity inventing a
brighter future
solar energy made it possible to fly
many days and nights in a row without
fuel crossing to oceans and remaining
airborne longer than any jet plane in
history 2016 has seen the completion of
this pioneering adventure flying 40,000
kilometers around the world without a
single drop of fuel
like Solar Impulse the cleantech
revolution has taken off presenting new
ways of thinking and doing to achieve
the impossible and you can be a part of
it the Boeing 747 it opened up the world
to long-range flight
it carries millions of passengers per
year along with millions of tons of
cargo and it's widely regarded as the
most successful large aircraft ever
built but with fuel prices climbing
higher and higher the question became
could Boeing make the queen of the skies
even better could the 747 become a model
of modern fuel efficiency the 747 -
eight is an all-new airplane that is
really built off the backbone and the
foundation of the iconic 747 to remake
the 747 Boeing took the world's best
performing large airframe and updated it
with the advanced technology developed
for the 787 Dreamliner in addition to
adding powerful 787 type engines Boeing
engineers developed an ultra advanced
wing designed with complex curves and
raked wingtips at one point during the
design we reached a point where really
concerned we couldn't form the wing
skins into the shapes needed with our
traditional building processes so we
brought a team together that brought in
a new technology to form the wing skins
on the southern for 7-8 and it's been
very successful with its advanced new
wing and engines and a host of other
improvements the 747-8
offers the lowest operating costs and
best fuel efficiency of any passenger
plane or freighter in its class
in fact the new 747-8 can boast a
double-digit improvement in fuel
efficiency from the previous model the
seventy-first 7-8 represents a lot of
big milestones for the phone company it
is the biggest commercial airplane that
we've ever produced it's the world's
fastest commercial airliner and it's one
of the most efficient new large
airplanes out there in the marketplace
at the same time we wanted to create a
really quiet airframe that also lands in
the same airports and can take off from
the same airports of the 747-400 in
remaking the 747 for a new era boeing
engineers showed that sometimes
innovation means finding a way to make
the best even better when you change the
wing on an airplane you that you
effectively are creating a an all-new
airplane the result is a next-generation
aircraft that sets a new benchmark for
large aircraft fuel efficiency and noise
reduction
imagine a boat that glides effortlessly
across the waves at three times the
speed of typical marine craft getting
safely to your destination with style
and comfort the wicked works every shape
is
aviation technology and
it's unique wing geometry and body
structure exploits an aerodynamic
phenomenon known as wing in ground
effect an aircraft experiences
when it
in close proximity to the ground
producing additional live from the
increased air pressure beneath its
weakest
flying above the sea surface means that
the air fish hate experiences no like
making it fuel-efficient fuel
consumption per mile
than conventional high-speed marine
craft at high speed classified as a
marine craft and powered by a car engine
running on unleaded petrol the air fish
bait is simple to maintain and
inexpensive to operate with a payload of
1,000 kilograms the air fish age cruises
at up to 90 knots with a range of 250
nautical miles the air fish 8 is simpler
and safer compared to conventional
aircraft its inherent aerodynamic
stability and mechanical simplicity not
only makes crew training quick it also
minimizes the risk of accidents caused
by human error
the a fish ate the land immediately
with minimal control importance shoot
the need arise
the potential of the air fish ate is
and limitless it is ideal for tourism
transport logistics and even maritime
patrol in regions where infrastructure
is limited the air fish aid redefines
maritime transportation with winging
ground effect technology to make passage
the unexploited places more convenient
safe and fast
71 today remains this mysterious and
enticing aircraft its its menacing it
looks so sleek but really this is
completely a form dictated by the
function of the aircraft we had a need
to know what was going on in other
countries and the way that we were going
to do that was having a photographic
aircraft that could fly very high and
very fast and much faster than the u2
which preceded it the sr-71 was that
answer for the US Air Force and for the
United States the sr-71 was a tremendous
leap forward in technology in many
different ways
fighters at the time could go about Mach
2 this could go Mach 3 it could fly
incredibly high now there were aircraft
that could reach the height of the sr-71
but only in a zoom climb and only
temporarily
whereas the sr-71 to fly at level
attitude at 80,000 feet or higher there
was no other aircraft at the time that
could do that it was a magnificent
platform it was untouchable and yet it
had not only photographic cameras it
also had systems that performed
electronic intelligence as well and it
had a side looking airborne radar which
was another sensor which was very
effective speed in the 1960s was what
stealth is today
speed was survivability in fact the best
way for an sr-71 to deal with the
surface air missile shot at it was just
simply to speed up there are some great
ways to realize and understand just how
fast the sr-71 was an sr-71 flew from
Los Angeles to DC in just a little over
an hour now imagine in that amount of
time one would drive to the airport and
maybe get your bags checked in and this
airplane flew from coast to coast and
little over an hour originally when the
sr-71 was developed there was the
possibility that it could be used over
China or even over the Soviet Union it
wasn't a
used in that way largely due to
diplomatic efforts but it was used in
the dangerous skies or North Vietnam
during the Southeast Asia war and it was
also used over North Korea during the
Pueblo crisis in 1968 and it was used in
other places around the world the air
force operated the sr-71 an aircraft
that had a capability that no other
country in the world had and the sr-71
could go get photographs and
intelligence information that was
desperately needed but that no other
aircraft and no other Air Force could
get for decades ago one aircraft rewrote
the history of air travel
she effortlessly accelerated from sub to
supersonic speeds flying faster than a
rifle bullet and out racing the Sun
Concorde in 1976 it took three hours to
fly London to New York it now takes
eight concorde changed everything from
the flight engineering to business
flight and of course the world of luxury
and style
sadly Concorde one of our best
achievements is becoming a distant
memory save Concorde group in
conjunction with our French partners at
olympus 593 has been at the forefront of
the preservation of Concorde
with the main aim of returning Concorde
back to flight as a symbol of our
national heritage and pride scg includes
ex concorde engineers who spent their
lives working on her these same
dedicated people are willing and able to
see the reality of returning a Concorde
of flight we strongly believe she must
keep pride of place alongside our other
flying icons while we can still marvel
at the Vulcan or Spitfire
where is our best aircraft of all where
is Concorde there will be significant
costs involved to get Concorde in the
air but cost is irrelevant until the
owners allow the fly the Concorde fleet
are all young aircraft having thrown a
fraction of the hours expected on a
commercial plane and most importantly
there remains no technological reason
why she can't fly again</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
