virtual reality kit in addition to a hat
set you also get a gun or a joystick or
even a light saber a standard controller
or a steering wheel no problem
hi I'm ginger I'm a sci-fi fan I love
virtual reality as Maker
I'll bring any idea into reality I hope
you research on virtual reality for
years last year I quit my PhD and
devoting myself into the development of
an VR kids
the hat set allows you to have 360
degrees immersive experience the field
of view is 100 degrees diagonal it's
like having the bath seat in an IMAX
theatre NVR kit uses a full HD screen
each half of the screen is close to a
square
however our unique a spherical lens
ensures that you'll always see things in
standard ratio
with the aspherical lens there will be
no more aberration and we are kit works
in all of these platforms he has to lie
axis high mu sensors and the saver
groups of customizable buttons you can
play any game you like however you like
the inertial navigation algorithm how
don't we trust the motion of your head
but also the position of your body our
one step control mode allows you to
control the action of the character in
the game with one simple movement how
about fire at all
hold the button and since their
interfaces are open and available
through an lead developer for example
with an independent account you can
shoot anywhere you want our hashtag will
never make your eyes uncomfortable the
pupil distance is adjustable
and it doesn't matter if you wear
glasses or not just put on the headset
there is enough space for your glasses
of course using your own glasses is the
best way for you to see to ensure your
safety you can open the window now you
can see outside you can combat your
friends and conquer them with your
strength and agility this is the entry
our kit standard you can also try the
wireless version I just tried out the
end VR headsets very interesting very
happy to see more headsets coming to
market and I think the end VR headset is
certainly a great option for people
looking for a wireless solution to
experience virtual reality
take out the battery reload and resume
your battle this is our originally
design transformable bag you can use it
as a vest or pack up your entire kit and
take it anywhere of course we will mail
you the kid with this bag my name is
Andrei Lavrov I'm a hockey coach my
biggest passion in hockey is a skater
this is one of the reasons I'm doing a
crushed ice that dogs are just awesome
and a lot and I think I can recommend
this big two hockey players of any level
if you want to have fun if we want to
prepare a skating technique
the stadium is quite similar to red ice
fog you don't know simple striding on
them this helps a lot like if you make
the proper stride of its land dogs fill
it with your hottest ride ever
this helps to improve the balance it
helps to understand their justice
towards the Johnson
Iko Statham is quite similar to them hi
Scott
that dogs
health estates always had potential to
be a lot of fun growing up but the
technology just wasn't good enough to
let us do what we really wanted back in
1997 we set out to turn pogo sticks into
a whole new sport our concept was based
on the idea of having a portable
trampoline something you can jump three
six or even ten feet high on but also
take anywhere you want to go the v4 is
the portable trampoline we'd always
dreamed up with the v4 you have the
ability to add or remove air and
completely change the stiffness of the
bounce someone who weighs 300 pounds can
jump on the same exact v4 as someone who
only weighs 80 pounds all you need to do
is change the air pressure in less than
a minute
you can perfectly tune the v4 to each
riders preferences pumping more air in
to jump higher and taking air out to
jump lower this makes sharing it with
friends and family a fun-filled
experience that everyone can enjoy
you can also collapse the v4 to make
transportation a breeze whether you're a
pro or just stepping on to the v4 for
the very first time you'll love the
weightless flight like experience you'll
get the basics in minutes and from that
point on there's no limit to how far you
can challenge yourself with the v4
you'll be able to jump up onto ledges
down stairs and over gaps of all sizes
while nailing down some pretty awesome
tricks after playing around on the v4
you'll never look at your surroundings
in the same way again obstacles and
features that are too high for bikes and
skateboards are perfect for the v4 so
those of you looking for a fun way to
stay in shape the v4 will work most of
the muscle groups in your body and get
your heart pounding immediately it's a
killer cardio workout and the best part
is that while you're having fun bouncing
around you won't even realize how
quickly you build a sweat
in order to achieve superior build
quality and maintain the high tolerances
necessary for the v4 to work we
manufacture and assemble it right here
in our Southern California shop we work
closely with our suppliers to become a
part of the build process and as each
component is made or right there to test
them
this streamlines are manufacturing and
ensures that every v4 we make is up to
our standards if you're looking for the
portable trampoline that we always
dreamed of v4 is going to knock your
socks off whether you want to use it
simply for exercise or to jump eight
feet high and do crazy tricks on is up
to you and we know you'll love every
second of it
join us and help change the way pogo
sticks are seen forever
so tell us about this attachment to the
pocket hammer boy here's real attachment
how about a shot how does it attach to
the hammer attaches right here
it's a rail attachment on the actual
hammer itself it's right there at the
bottom it's that difficult to to put on
or is there something you can do and
quick no slides right on tighten it down
you're ready to roll
the tips on the arrows you can put any
tip on the pocket shot arrows that you
want that's correct okay
interchangeable okay and then you put
that inside the pocket shot narrow pouch
goes into the arrow pouch on the hammer
the pockets on rail got your whisker
biscuit up front okay real on the bottom
okay get your button all right so what
range would I expect to a bow fish with
this anywhere between 812 meters all
right let's see if you can hit that jug
over there that's good 12 meters at
least nice shot very good
keeper that's a keeper
very cool very cool got it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
