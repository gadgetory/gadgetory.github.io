crystal the designer of posture pulse
after 10 years as partner and designer
at my own apparel firm I decided to
combine my love of fashion with my
passion for tech and make items that are
well-crafted fun to use and make life
better posture pulse is the first
product launching from body lab our New
York City wearable computing space our
team has spent 18 months on development
so far and been through 10 versions
after consulting with chiropractors and
going through several rounds of testing
we've got a fantastic working prototype
the posture pulse is a simple standalone
training band with a wide comfortable
elastic strap and adjustable velcro tabs
the battery recharges using a standard
USB cable and will last for a week of
normal use we're excited about how far
we've come but with your support and
input we'd like to make the final
refinements to posture pulse then bring
it to market I hope that your is excited
about our project as we are and that
you'll help us make our goal a reality
thank you for watching and thank digital
devices have created an epidemic of poor
posture a few minutes of slouching over
a screen can cause short-term stiffness
and long-term back and neck problems
we've developed Aleks
to help you correct poor posture Aleks
is the only wearable posture tracker and
coach that helps you avoid neck pain now
and in the future when your posture is
poor for more than a few minutes
Aleks vibrates to gently remind you to
correct it
Aleks measures the position of your neck
and head in real-time using an extremely
precise pivot sensor and three axis
accelerometer because alex is positioned
on your neck it can track the exact
position of your head and neck to
determine bad posture we've used
flexible lightweight materials to make
sure that alex is always comfortable to
wear a companion coaching app lets you
fully customize Alex adjusting the
frequency and intensity of alerts and
guides you to address bad habits and
tracks your progress towards better
posture over time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
