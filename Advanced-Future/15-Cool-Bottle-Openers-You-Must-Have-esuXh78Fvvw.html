and get started on this review so first
thing I wanted to go over was all of the
features that includes so let's go ahead
and go over the tools real quick over on
this right side as you can see we have a
Philips shaped kind of flathead driver
that also works as a flathead
screwdriver and I found that useful for
everyday things I definitely don't get
too much leverage but plenty good for
tightening up those loose screws over
here we have the main keychain hole and
this is plenty big you could fit
paracord through there if you really
wanted to and it's plenty easy to get
your keyring on there I've also found
that it kind of works well as a little
finger grip as you can see my thumb
doesn't come off of it too easily kind
of like the spider codes have on their
knives up here we have a little contour
which is really nice and some jimping as
you can see so they really put a lot of
thought into the details here and this
provides a nice grip for mainly the
can't the bottle opener here and I'm
also kind of for the pry bar over here
of course we have our bottle opener so
that is very simple but I'm very
effective previously the lemon let me
back out here a little bit with my
camera previously the Leatherman bruiser
formerly known as the pocket tool X
bruiser was offered in a couple
different variations it looked the same
as this same size same thickness same
everything but they came in a stone wash
finish and then also a darker steel
finish called smoke and currently
Leatherman just makes the stonewashed
finish which you see here and it's
rather attractive I really do like the
stonewash finish it's got a nice rugged
kind of hard use look to it you know not
too shiny nothing that's gonna get
scratched up it's already got a little
bit of wear to it so that's rather
appealing and you can see that it's very
very small now I've had this for about
two months I purchased this at the end
of December 2012 and I've been carrying
it on my keys along with my daily my
other daily keychain tools and I've been
trying this out alongside those to see
how it works and I'm pretty happy with
it so the short answer I'll take right
up front is that it's a nice tool fairly
inexpensive and I do recommend it
you
okay so I wanted to show you a product
that I just finished up a little while
ago it's a it's well it's a bottle
opener as you can see and I got my
favorite NFL team there but what's
different about this is that it has this
rare earth magnet in the back and what
you do is you know you've got your
bottle right when you open it it just
kind of drops the cap and it catches it
right there so it's pretty cool you know
I've seen these in some craft beers and
I've seen these online and I always kind
of wondered how how people made these
hi I'm mark manga I'm a beer lover and
this is my invention the gropin er the
name gropin er comes from grab and
opener it's designed to engage and
remove pass through a quick one-handed
grab simply let the ring hang loosely on
the middle of your index finger while
your middle finger rests on the trigger
as you grab the bottle the magnet helps
position the hook under the cap which is
cleaved off with a pop the cap is caught
by the magnet and kept flat when not in
use the same magnet keeps the group and
are handy on the fridge or any steel
surface one grope inner works just as
easily for a lefty as it does for a
righty turn it around and its tail is
perfect for leveraging pull tabs on cans
this beautifully designed and crafted
tool is made in the USA of tempered
aluminum and it even works with twist
caps it comes in five decorative
anodized colors or to industrial
abrasion resistant H types patent
pending
well I want to do a quick video on this
bottle opener I think this is the
coolest bond over for a beer guy slash
knife guy this is the the K Bar K barley
and as you can see it is basically a
very nice larger bottle opener that has
a ke baare USMC style handle super
awesome obviously does you know standard
bottle opener but in the back it also
has a spot so you can use this for twist
offs you have a really hard twist off
you can just use that as well they've
all the ridges here to us snugly fit
onto a standard bottle cap this works
really really well just got this not too
long ago in a box of goodies from going
here but do some videos on the other
stuff that got from there like I said I
saw this a long time ago really really
one in one they're all over the Internet
but going here headed for 595 and yeah
it's just super cool absolutely love
this thing so I wanna give you a quick
demo but it's nine o'clock in the
morning so I'm really want to open a
beer this is a lambic beer but this has
a cork underneath the bottle cap okay so
I don't have to drink this right now and
I want to the side I want to waste
anything but at least I know this will
be corked after I open the top there's
actually awesome stuff big fan of this
it's very low in alcohol content super
fruity just awesome but I like it
because I can sip on it for a while and
I don't necessarily need to get a buzz
or anything I just like the taste of it
so okay now this is not a twist-off or
anything this is also oversized alright
so it doesn't fit on on this this fits a
standard bottle cap but anyway we have
to flip it over and there we go so it
works great you can see this one like I
said has a cork in there so I'll have to
drink it right now alright alright this
is the bottle opener ring from BevMo
this is part of the moe I know it's not
beverages but this is moe so this is
made by shark skins nobody's paying me
to do this I just thought it was pretty
cool so it's a ring on the bottle opener
you can either wear it like this and
still fully open bottles with the bottom
or you can wear it top out and people
think you're in some kind of strange
cults and you can you can go from there
and you know wear it on your wedding
ring hand are you married yeah I'm
married to alcohol and I open a beer you
just hook into it with the Rings pop it
off Cheers
there go the cops are gettin too close
you
remember how awesome it was to command a
battalion of plastic army men when you
were a kid get back into the action with
the army man bottle opener this
battle-ready bottle opener is formed in
the shape of an American GI in the prone
position use the soldiers rifle to pry
off bottle caps and taste victory
the bottle opener is made from diecast
metal so it's tough as nails
the bottle opener is not only stronger
than its plastic inspiration it's also
bigger measuring nearly 5 inches in
length the bottle openers hefty weight
offers a satisfying feel as you crack
open a cold one win the battle against
thirst with the army man bottle opener
you like Star Wars then this hunk of
junk might be for you pretty cool I'm
kind of diggin it man right in a galaxy
far far away for a beverage that's needs
to be opened you should be able to do it
you've got the little tab right there so
that you can pry open your drinks of any
sort grape knee-highs or whatever you
may drink now I've already tried it and
I wanted to show it to you because I've
got this drink here which I'm gonna
drink and I just want to show you that
because of the small size there is a
little bit of an issue it's not a big
issue but you don't get a lot of
grabbing area so what I've noticed is
that the teaching actually has to be
kind of at the top or you don't it's not
able to get in there but it does start
really low you see what I'm saying
usually this cutout would be bigger and
I understand why it's not because then
the whole thing would have to be bigger
or they would have to cut deeper and
take out the the center turret here
which would kind of destroy the look of
the device but it works you know if you
get it low you're gonna have a really
low angle of attack for opening up your
drink but it does work in fact let me
show you so are you bringing the Falcon
in here slip it under there and boom
with that
you do it in one motion I've also
noticed that doing it in a couple is
kind of is sometimes more helpful but
there you are
I don't always watch sci-fi but when I
do I watch Star Wars
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
