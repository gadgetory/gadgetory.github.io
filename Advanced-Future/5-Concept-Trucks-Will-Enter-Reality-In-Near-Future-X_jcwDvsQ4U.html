certain places it can be found in
certain people
the Wright brothers call these Outer
Banks their home for years
this is where their invention was born
where their dream took flight
in 2011 our inventors set the wheels in
motion on the super truck project a
challenge set before us by the US
Department of Energy to build a truck
that improves Freight efficiency by 50%
the focus was the entire vehicle I mean
the only part we carried over from
production was part of the cab the body
white so this was a unique opportunity
where we were able to optimize the
entire vehicle tractor and trailer
together the entire atomic development
was driven by simulation which is what
we use to evaluate the aerodynamic
property of a particular model and then
we iterate on the process to tweak that
model to get maximum aerodynamics we can
get out of it we had people working on
powertrain of course dedicated to the
powertrain improvements we had a whole
team dedicated to the vehicle
improvements at the end of the day was
all about building this complete vehicle
that everybody was a part of one of the
most important lessons that we learned
during the powertrain development for
super truck was how important it is to
consider everything as a system so we
took a very systematic approach
developing not only the powertrain
components but marrying those components
to the transmission and the whole truck
this whole truck is the system that was
created together so that's the
innovation of thinking about a vehicle
in this way instead of a tractor or
trailer or just an engine or a
transmission
in the end creating one of the most
advanced and efficient trucks ever built
a global team dedicated to making our
own dreams take flight driven by a
culture of innovation continuous
improvement
stubbornness dedication
passion
we built this together
this is Volvo super truck
more than 3,000 pounds life
40% less drag
70% better fuel economy
fuel-efficiency is at the heart of
Volvo's innovation and design
this is what we do
this is what we know
of all the accomplishments of the
vehicle I'm most proud of the people in
the way they work and perform to finish
this project a lot of the knowledge that
we gained through this program was
already transferred to trucks that our
customers are driving today beginning
with model year 2016 we introduced a few
vehicle changes affecting aerodynamics
that were inspired by learnings from
super truck the biggest change was the
bumper that went across the board and
all the VNL models one of my favorite
parts of the super truck project was
that in the powertrain system we were
able to develop a variety of
technologies some which were much closer
to the customer such as the wave piston
turbo compound and fuel injection system
which will be able to deliver as part of
the 2017 powertrain update we were also
able to develop technologies which were
much more advanced such as the waste
heat recovery system which will take
many years until it's ready for the
customer this technology is already
changing the trucks you drive today and
it will shape the trucks of tomorrow the
spirit of invention lives within us
so we'll keep reinventing
at the IAA in Hanover ma n unveiled its
brand-new truck study called concept s
it's highlights are presented by dr.
Arthur - Allison a design studio the
advertise concept s as a design study
which shall present a new way of
dramatically reducing fuel consumption
and co2 emissions so instead of zone the
harm spoiler dizzy automat we took
several aerodynamic measures in order to
reduce drag for example did we
incorporate sensors which detect the
shape of the trailer and automatically
adapt the spoilers to it further
measures were taken like streamlining
the exterior shape of the truck side
enriched reading mode isn't substituting
the rearview mirrors by small cameras
integrated in those little wings each an
ever exterior part has been integrated
into the overall shape of the truck to
avoid aerodynamic turbulences but today
are being caused by fuel tanks and
battery containers I see the businesses
with all those measures not only lead to
a beautiful appearance but to a
dramatically reduced fuel and emission
consumption of 25% so powerful Damodar
inch bowel survey the gazettes gave
almost no but it's not only about
technology what we need is a legislative
reform allowing us to slightly adapt the
exterior dimensions of our trucks and
trailer combinations we hope that our
concept s helps to initiate a political
discussion and maybe then the next truck
generation looks like this
here it is the future truck 2025 from
Daimler thanks to a so called highway
pilot this truck drives autonomously on
the freeway the concept vehicle gives a
technologically accurate idea about
commercial trucking of tomorrow the
aerodynamic design and modern LED
lighting that replaces conventional
headlights bring the face of this
concept vehicle to life it convincingly
combines functionality efficiency and
emotion comparable to an autopilot in a
plane that radar sensors and dual camera
system of the highway pilot makes
autonomous driving possible without
relying on other vehicles or any kind of
guiding infrastructure this highly
intelligent system relieves the driver
from tedious driving as he gains time
for other tasks and communication
the intelligent highway pilot reacts to
a wide range of traffic situations such
as moving over for approaching emergency
vehicle in spite of all the
sophisticated technology it is the
driver who remains in charge and in no
way will the highway pilot replace the
driver it simply makes this job easier
while increasing the overall safety
because this truck basically drives in
an environment where driving is boring
monotonous not very exciting highway
pilot takes over and it never gets tired
it's always 100% sharp it's never angry
it's never distracted so this is a much
safer system due to this increased
safety
lower fuel consumption in overall
reduction of costs the future dropped
2025 fundamentally changes commercial
traffic the job of the truck driver and
the business of commercial trucking but
the question remains when will you see
this truck on the road near you
obviously the biggest part for us is to
get legislation ready and get in a legal
environment that allows us to do that to
do so as you know in Europe it's right
now illegal to drive these vehicles
in public roads we have some states
united states that already allow that so
in u.s. we can in Arizona for example in
Nevada for example we can already drive
this truck today and it base to who's
going to be first so wherever we're
going to have the legal environment that
we need we will introduce that
technology
we've built technology trucks those have
conventional engines but we pair them
with very sophisticated systems that
increase both the efficiency and the
safety of those vehicles now all of
these are potentially game-changing
technologies and we'll continue to work
on those but we wanted to push ourselves
and our vendor partners just a little
bit further so let me take a quick
moment to introduce some of our partners
on this project we have Bill Kahn and
Victor Garcia from Peterbilt motors we
have Adam Hill with Great Dane trailers
and we have Steve Gillette with capstone
turbine and so here today for the first
time publicly Walmart's advanced vehicle
experience which are seen in the video
is the power train which is made up of a
micro turbine a battery storage system
and an electric motor moving inside the
cab through the sliding driver's door
you'll see the key difference that
allowed for the more dramatic Aero
design the driver sits in the center of
the console rather than over to the left
the dash is electronic and therefore
customizable to the gauges and
performance data that a particular
driver wants to monitor and it's all
finished off with a full-size
comfortable sleeper moving on to the
trailer not only is this the first time
a trailer has been made out of carbon
fiber but it's actually the first time
one piece 53 foot panels of carbon fiber
have been manufactured looking at the
front of the trailer you can see that
the nose is convex which increases the
aerodynamics of the entire package as
well as adding additional cargo space
inside the trailer my name is Bill
Kahneman manager of advanced concepts of
Peterbilt motors and the program
director on the wave project we missed a
little bit about the aerodynamics of the
truck but let me elaborate a little bit
farther you notice with the center
console driver were able to taper the
nose of the vehicle in more
another key feature is that because we
have an advanced powertrain we do not
need to have the radiator in from the
vehicle anymore this relates to 20%
improvement in aerodynamics over melt
over Walmart's existing Peterbilt fleet
if you think about it
20% aerodynamic improvement relates
directly to a 10% improvement in fuel
economy hello my name is Adam Hill from
Great Dane trailers and I would like to
talk to you today about this newest
technology at Walmart commissioned us to
build this true piece of equipment over
the road trailer is made primarily of
carbon fiber material carbon fiber is
about 10 times stronger than steel but
it's lighter than fiberglass and that is
one of the biggest reasons that it was
chosen to highlight the technology of
this equipment this trailer has the
capability of being fully loaded with a
standard cargo load it can handle
forklift traffic for backhauls and it is
100% DLT legal there are several
technologies that went into this trailer
besides the carbon fiber which gives us
about 4,000 pounds of weight savings
when SPECT very similar to a
conventional Walmart fleet trailer hi
I'm Steve Gillette with capstone turbine
gas turbines were evaluated by Peterbilt
back in the 60s while they proved to be
robust fuel efficiency was lacking an
advantage of the capstone microturbine
is that it can operate on natural gas or
other fuels this will help Walmart
achieve its goal of using 100% renewable
fuels in the future the emissions is
extremely low and does not require after
treatment or use any diesel emissions
fuels the micro turbine is spinning at
high speed on air bearings so there's no
oil to change and the turbine is
air-cooled eliminating the need for a
large radiator which allows for a more
aerodynamic design truck like the one
you see
you
you
