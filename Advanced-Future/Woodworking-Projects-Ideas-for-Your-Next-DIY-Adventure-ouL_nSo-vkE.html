bought a small tea candle I need a way
to hold it well you're in luck my friend
this video will show you how to make a
simple yet intricate candle holder to
impress your dinner guests to make this
candle holder all you need is a miter
saw a drill and most importantly a
scroll saw you also need a 2x2 piece of
wood to get started turn off the design
links in the description below
take your 2x2 which should actually
measure to one and a half by one and a
half inches and measure out a block to
match the height of your design cut this
piece off with your miter saw so you end
up with a block that is 1 and a half by
one and a half by 4 and 3/4 inches next
attach your design to two adjacent faces
of the block I use an adhesive spray for
this but you can use whatever you want I
don't really care after using the drill
to make 4 pilot holes like so you are
ready to start scroll I started by
cutting out the center of the design
first just thread your blade through the
pilot holes and scroll I chose to make
my candle holder out of oak a hardwood
like oak prevents the workpiece from
breaking or cracking and drinks on on
the other hand a softer wood may be
easier to control and cut once you
finish the holes in one of the faces
repeat the same steps for the opposing
sides until you get four nice little
tunnels through the body of the piece
once the interior cuts are all done you
can move on to the outside you're going
to eventually have to cut off one of
your designs so keep some tape handy to
reattach the sides you remove as you go
not only does this keep your design and
tack so you can see what you're doing
but it also will provide a flat surface
and stronger support for the remainder
of your scroll
packing tape works best but I got away
with using scotch tape because that's
just how I scroll once all the sides are
done remove the tape and bask in the
glory of your candle holder
I used a rotary tool for some intricate
detail sanding before applying my finish
you may be thinking to yourself hey that
looks pretty bad but you shouldn't be so
quick to judge at least this candle
holder turned out a heck of a lot better
in my first one well that's that now you
can sleep easy
your candles are elevated you can put
stuff in it if you want maybe some pins
a cup a bottle some tools some wine some
spoons a plant or even your favorite
candle I don't know your life do
whatever you want with it for this
project we used a win 16 inch variable
speed scroll saw an oscillating spindle
sander a 4 by 36 inch belt disc sander
and an 18-volt cordless drill first off
print three copies of the design linked
in the description below use some
adhesive spray to attach the three
sheets to some reasonably sized boards
keep in mind the smaller the boards the
easier scrollsaw will be next drill
through five of the six cinder circles
to make pilot holes for the scroll saw
make sure to leave one circle as is
without a pilot hole this will be the
base of your cup you're now ready to
start scroll saw on first cut out the
inner circle by fishing the blade
through your pilot hole pin blades are
usually the easiest and quickest type of
blade to attach and remember as with any
woodworking project it's always safety
first
once your blade is nice and taut you're
ready to start sawing the flexible worm
light will help to illuminate your path
as you make your way around the circle
while the blade guard foot and cast iron
based limit vibration in the wood once
you have finished cutting out the full
circle attach the blade and slide your
workpiece out repeat this with the
remaining four inner circles we need to
cut before moving out to the outside of
the circles it can be tricky to stay on
the line so if you're gonna make a
mistake try and favor the side of the
wood that can be later sanded off as
opposed to cutting out a sliver of your
cup when you're all done you should have
five wooden rings in one base piece they
aren't perfect but neither am i so it's
all good use your belt sander to smooth
the tops and bottoms of all pieces along
with removing the design paper you
attaches the beginning of the project
next glue the five rings together using
the wood glue of your choice
make sure the circles are straight and
fully sealed then clamp the piece
together and let it dry
once it's done you should have an object
that looks a little something like this
now we can move on to our oscillating
spindle sander before sanding attach a
wind dust extractor to make sure your
sawdust and shavings don't fly
everywhere then smooth out the inside of
your tube so that the rings are all
flush with one another
once it's done you should have an object
that looks a little something like this
finally glue on the base of the
cylindrical tube again make sure it's
totally sealed and correctly aligned
before clamping down the piece after the
tube thing has a chance to dry take it
back to the oscillating spindle sander
and have a go at the outside when you're
finished you should have a smooth little
wooden Cup to put stuff in or do
whatever you want with I don't know what
your plan is you made it not me anyway
this is a great project to introduce
beginners to the scroll saw and the
spindle sander today I'm going to show
you how to make a bandsaw box using the
wind to speed 10 inch bandsaw with
standing work light we will also briefly
be employing the help of the wind twelve
and a half inch thickness planer and the
wind variable speed oscillating tool I
started off by looking up other people's
designs for bandsaw boxes online
everyone else online demonstrated such
creativity and showmanship with their
bandsaw boxes I couldn't wait to get
started making my own version first I
had to make a block of wood to construct
the bandsaw box from because the wind to
speed 10 inch bandsaw has the ability to
cut depths of up to six inches I decided
to make a ten by six by six inch block
of wood as my starting point if this is
the size that sounds right to you then
grab four two by sixes to construct your
own wooden block next while donning your
favorite business-casual playing off
both faces of the board's so they are
nice and flat after that glue the faces
of the board's to one another with
liberal amounts of glue to make sure the
entire face gets covered finally clamp
the board's tightly to one another and
leave them overnight to dry once the
boards are nice and dry use the wind
bandsaw to cut the slab into ten inch
segments now you have a nice six by six
by ten inch blocks of wood to work with
next draw glue on the design that you
want to cut out for me I chose a design
that would be next to impossible to mess
up after quickly messing up my design I
decided to revise my plans to something
even easier
a half-circle a few things for beginners
to consider first and foremost
understand the relationship between the
width of the blade and the turning
radius of the saw if you don't think
your saw blade is turning sharp enough
then you may need a thinner blade once
you have cut out the box the next step
is to cut a flat piece off the back set
this piece aside as you will need to be
gluing it back on at a later point in
time after that it's time to cut out
your drawer for mine I chose to slice
off the bottom of the slab in order to
have easy access to cutting out my
drawer to make your drawer cut out a
solid piece from the center of the block
perfect
next set aside the rest of your bandsaw
box and cut off flat pieces from both
the front and back of your drawer
finally cut the center out of the drawer
to allow for room to put stuff now it's
time to glue everything back together
you should have three pieces for your
drawer the front the back and the base
go ahead and use wood glue and clamps to
put these back together leaving out the
middle piece in order to leave room for
stuff inside your drawer after that glue
the other components of your bandsaw box
together clamp them and leave them to
dry separately from the inside drawer
piece once the pieces had time to dry
unclamp them and then see if your drawer
fits odds are it'll take a little
sanding in order to get it to the right
size I used the wind variable speed
oscillating tool with a low grit
sandpaper in order to remove the excess
material after a bit of sanding the
drawer should slide perfectly back into
your fans out box finally using the
excess scrap make a little handle for
your drawer carve out the handle with
the bandsaw and then glue it to the
front of your bandsaw box look at that
cute little guy once the handle has a
chance to dry your bandsaw box is
complete and there you have it now you
have a place to store all of your hopes
and dreams and maybe even at that good
car times have changed buddy you're an
adult now and adults spend money on
their gifts but you can still hang on to
some of your cash by making your friends
and family their very own magic wine
bottle holders to get you started you
need a 2x4 and something to measure with
for our demonstration we'll be using a
miter saw a drill press with the 1 and
1/2 inch Forstner bit and a sander
first things first make a 40 degree cut
on one end of the wood line up and
safely secure your 2x4 before starting
the cut
next measure nine inches down on your
2x4 if you're using a wind dual bevel
sliding compound miter saw make sure to
use your laser to maximize accuracy
using the same 40 degree angle line up
the piece of wood along your measurement
to cut off the other end
next measure one and a half inches down
from the upward facing edge of the board
be careful to measure from the correct
side otherwise the wine may not bounce
right after making the crosshairs secure
your wood to the drill press and line up
your measurements some drill presses
such as the whim 12-inch drill press
include a laser to increase precision if
you have this luxury make sure to use it
to insure your wine holder balances
perfectly once you've lined up and
secured the woods go ahead and start
drilling
your wine holders about done finally for
aesthetic and textural purposes you can
sand down your holder until the sides
are smooth and sleek this is no effect
on the woods ability to hold wine but it
does make for a better gift feel free to
add your preferred lacquer to really add
a special touch there you have it
the do-it-yourself wine holder an easy
and cost-effective gift for any
woodworker to create add some
gravity-defying alcohol to your life
with the wind magic wine bottle holder</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
