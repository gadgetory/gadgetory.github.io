and never miss another update
would you like your bike to operate like
an electric bike but don't want the
hassle of a battery maintenance and a
hefty price will a super waitlist for
you simply turn your bike upside down
replace the back wheel with the super
wheel attach the chain turn your back
upright extra brakes and off you go the
super wila seal turned up to the ebike
it is lightweight has no battery and no
range limit literally leaving the
destinations infinite you can go
wherever you want for as far as you
whenever satine ages of us inspired by
the power-steering system in my father's
new truck ears on them I knew I want to
invent a new technology to improve the
cycling efficiency I keep searching and
trying for different development concept
the superevil is powered by assist and
powered by rage of the user the action
and reaction falls across by the weight
of the user they store the India upper
section of the spring mechanism between
rotations in a way the mechanism is
compressing the woman's actions through
the spring using the center as the pivot
this additional energy will reduce the
frictional force in the opposite
direction of the wheel and therefore
both facilitate the rotations
for over a century inventors have been
pursuing ways to create the joy and
freedom of biking out on the open water
none have succeeded in igniting the
imagination of people around the world
until now the Shiller s1 is a premium
bike and an ultra portable boat that you
can enjoy riding on anybody of water
wherever you live or want to explore
enjoy a morning spin discover secluded
beaches and experience an aquatic world
in a whole new way getting out on the
water should be easy
we designed the s-1 to go from land to
water in under 10 minutes and with a
compact footprint you can store your s1
in a city apartment or take it with you
when you travel the s-1 has a patented
drivetrain featuring gates carbon drive
belts and like every bike you've ever
been on has a saddle handlebars and
pedals only on this bike your pedaling
turns a propeller instead of wheels
integrated handlebar steering allows you
to easily turn the s1 and navigate
towards wherever you feel like riding
want to slow down or come to a stop just
stop pedaling it even goes in Reverse
quiet clean and human power the s-1
features a pivoting drive unit for
shallow water navigation allowing you to
safely access sensitive marine habitats
it also means you stay almost totally
dry going in and out of the water
nothing is more important to us a
chiller than bike safety well we can't
do anything about bad drivers and narrow
bike lanes on land we did design the s-1
has cut of the land to give you maximum
stability even in rusted it and a rugged
inflatable pontoon to provide for nearly
1,000 pounds of buoyancy
riding a bike is one of the best
workouts you can get for your
cardiovascular system and for keeping
fit while normal cycling is great for
your legs it doesn't do much for the
muscles of your upper body what if there
was a bike that could give your arms and
upper body the same kind of workout you
get by rowing or going to a gym
hi my name is Toya and I came up with
bicycle which does exactly that by
adding a secondary paddling system for
your hands you can now achieve the same
kind of workout with your arms and upper
body as with your legs in addition to
your lower body you can work your biceps
triceps chest shoulders lats abs as well
as the entire core by using varying
riding techniques and all this while
enjoying beautiful outdoor scenery and
breathing in fresh air
twice the workout twice the fun
bicycle is particularly useful when
going up hills and your legs get tired
as you can just take over with your arms
this here is over 20 percent gradient
use twice circle as a normal bike a hand
cycle or combination of both twice full
comes with gears so you can increase or
lower resistance to perfectly tailor
your individual needs and is equally
suitable for both women and men chest
pads provide full upper body support and
prevents riders formation contact with
the chain ring there is also an optional
chain ring cover twice sigil is easy to
operate
steering handles can achieve tight
maneuvers and double is arm cranks we
believe that the most enjoyable workout
happens when it's combined with
adventure
if you were the kind of person who likes
working out outdoors then this is the
right product for you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
