pepper spray with keyring in today's
world people have access to numerous
digital services through the use of
various devices if you do the math a
person may easily have more than 15
different accounts security experts
agree that for a password to be truly
secure it must contain a random
combination of letters numbers and
symbols remembering such a secure
password is not a job meant for us
humans in the past few years hackers
have proven over and over again just how
vulnerable our computer systems can be
major companies like eBay Dropbox and
LinkedIn have reported cyberattacks that
have compromised users information and
passwords this is why we created
passport it's a security device that
allows you to generate store and use
unique insecure passwords for all the
services apps and devices you use
passport is small enough that you can
comfortably carry it in your pocket or
purse along with your keys passport is
easy to set up and simple to use it can
connect to your devices via a USB or
bluetooth and it's recognized
automatically on all major platforms
here is how you use your passport first
access your passport by entering your
master key
the only password you'll ever have to
remember then access the login screen of
the service you'd like to use on your
preferred device finally browse your
passport for the appropriate account and
selected
passport will automatically log into
your account say goodbye to using
unsecure passwords and having to
remember any of them ever again should
it fall into the wrong hands
passport incorporates several security
mechanisms to protect your privacy it
encrypts your data using the same
encryption algorithm the US government
uses to protect top-secret information
our free synchronization app also allows
you to create and store an encrypted
copy of your account for easy recovery
in case of loss or theft gatekeeper is a
wireless key fob that's automatically
lock your computer when you walk away
when you walk back gatekeeper will have
unlocked a computer by the time you sat
down
thanks to gatekeeper your computer is
never left unlocked and vulnerable to
snooping you don't have to waste any
valuable time locking and unlocking your
PC when you get up from your computer
there's nothing to stop a colleague
helping themselves with gatekeeper the
computer will lock as soon as you leave
your desk using gatekeeper couldn't be
easier simply insert the included
battery and download the software how
the dongle and you're ready to go there
are three unlock modes the first of
which is automatic when set to automatic
gate keeper will unlock your PC within a
customizable range anywhere from three
to thirty feet this mode is beneficial
for people such as IT professionals
where frequently leaving and returning
to their workstations providing security
without wasting precious time the second
option is touch to log in when in this
mode gatekeeper requires a user to tap
gatekeeper against the Bluetooth
receiver in order to unlock the computer
this mode ensures that only the person
with the key fob can access a computer
even if gatekeeper is in range
finally log in using gatekeeper and pin
requires the user to enter a password
alongside the presence of gatekeeper
before the computer can be unlocked this
two-factor login option is the most
secure as it adds a second layer of
security to logging in this is ideal for
use in hospitals and healthcare
facilities by doctors and nurses for any
other industry that needs to protect
confidential information but what
happens if you lose your gatekeeper
thankfully the gatekeeper also functions
as a
Bluetooth tracker so you can find it and
your keys with the gatekeeper app on
your phone this works while you're
within 30 feet of gatekeeper providing
it not connected to your computer when
located gatekeeper for shine and the app
will give you an idea of how far away
the key
