is a little drawing machine we hope
you're going to love
Linus drawers like you it copies your
motions
you
even hang it on your fridge
you
simply fetch the latest drawing with a
push of a button the world is filled
with useful products things that are
going to make things quicker or faster
and what the team at liners are trying
to produce is something to play with
it's something to spend time with this
it's fun and it's it's energetic and
it's ambitious in in its construction
we're designing the app for PC Mac
Android and tablets and we're
integrating simple tools so everyone can
have fun with it load of friends drawing
and play at Black was to see how it was
drawn and edit
arrays and add to it take a picture and
trace over it
Linus work straight out of the box but
only you can really bring it to life our
aim is to build a community of users
that will develop new and exciting
creative ways to use it you want to
develop it together with you and can't
wait to see what you will do
you
you like to play code or make things
you'll be able to hook them up to Linus
you have connected to Raffi pie or
scratch get several machines to work
together go big to the pantograph or
playing groups guessing that someone's
drawing it's not completely digital it
has a bit of real human warmth and
something happening in front of you
rather than a printer where it's just
something secrets happening inside and
out is coming this perfect finished item
you're kind of watching it happening
this is you arm swept a small yet
powerful robotic arm with built-in
Bluetooth and this is you on swift Pro a
premium and powerful robot arm equipped
with stepper motors and encoders you arm
Swift Pro is designed for delicate ideas
that need high accuracy to make it
happen now it is precise enough to do
laser engraving of complex images to
work on your artistic inspirations
or to play games intelligently both you
arm swift and you arm Swift Pro are
completely open sourced and easy to
extend it for example make a fan that
follows your face and summer with the
improved end effector they are super
easy to attach different kinds of
sensors actuators benefit from the
integrated growth port you arm swift
series supports seed growth kits and
open em the camera modules to make
creation projects easier than ever you
arm studio is a simple all-in-one
software for everyone to control and
program there you arm it integrates a
graphical programming interface based on
blockly gesture control based on leap
motion and more it's the best software
tool for beginners to explore the power
of robotic arms yuan swift series is
still up to work without being tethered
to a computer press the button to teach
it press again and it will repeat the
task once or forever then take a rest
the you arm play mobile app makes remote
control as simple as possible it
connects to you arm automatically simply
enjoy playing and have fun what's more
experienced programmers can explore more
powerful vision features in UCS you arm
creator studio applying computer vision
and logic to your robotic project has
never been this easy different from you
on metal the previous version of you arm
you on swift series has been completely
redesigned to meet the demand of
enthusiasts it has four degrees of
freedom and enhanced movie range the
all-new unibody design makes all
components well protected
they have no wirings required what's
more buttons on the base controlled
built-in functions and can be programmed
to do whatever you like
standardized plugin makes it possible to
switch between different end effectors
within 30 seconds compared with you arm
swift new arm swift pro is powered by
high quality gearbox with stepper motors
combined with the 12 bit encoder it
moves smoothly and precisely no matter
how much you know about robotics and
programming you can always find
something new to learn and play with you
arm swift or you arm swift Pro the best
entry-level open-source robot
you
this is control the robot it has the
same DNA as sophisticated hundred
thousand dollar industrial robot arms
elegantly reduced down to desktop size
and made as affordable as a coffee
machine now anyone can own their own
robot just plug in a laptop and take
control with a full range of
articulation through six axes Controls
uses are as unlimited as your
imagination from teaching your children
to code through play to clever
applications for small business to
science and education uses control the
robot provides endless opportunities it
works right out of the box and the
completely open source interface means
you can control it with your favorite
programming language or simple
conversation or text commands or use
physical manipulation to teach it
repeatable tasks you can also connect
multiple arms to work together end of
arm tools are easy to change and will be
available for endless uses including
grips laser engravings suction pads
spray nozzles 3d printing and more with
a camera control can also find and
recognize all users will be able to
write their own applications and share
the code globally creative database of
control the robot programs from creating
a miniature factory for your business to
raising the next generation of genius
inventors hello i'm maker arm the
world's first multifunctional robotic
arm that fits anywhere in your workspace
I have changeable tool heads that allow
me to do some really neat stuff and I
can help my humans make just about
anything
I can 3d print freely since I don't live
in a box
I can auto level so my humans don't have
to I can make things up to 30 inches
long and 10 inches tall on any flat
surface I can make high quality 3d
prints with both filament and resin but
I can do a lot more than just 3d
printing I'm great at building the next
big thing like this I can cut sheets and
3d print corners I can pick and place
sheets and panels together and create a
custom PCB I can solder
assemble components I can even work with
fellow maker arms
voila
here's our finished project a custom
laptop I can be operated wirelessly on
all of your devices plus my humans can
teach me tricks and send me remote
instructions I was made for creative
people everywhere I can make really
impressive toys
paint on canvas and fabric and create
custom invites I can etch glass engrave
plastic and leather carve metal and wood
I can also plot designs
and yes I can even decorate cakes
another cool thing my humans can design
their own custom tool heads for me it
feels great helping my humans build
their dreams
