mix it possible to achieve fast speed
race while maintaining extremely high
structural rigidity this lets the extant
40 to efficiently perform high dynamic
machining of all heavy materials
exceptional precision guarantees these
characteristics make the F set 42 the
iview machine for a wide variety of
applications in various industries
custom fit to your production
requirements the episode 42 offers
enough space for the machining of large
volume components the trapezoidal side
columns are filled with fiber reinforced
especial concrete which guarantees
highest possible oscillation and
vibration dampening as well as
temperature stability driven by backlash
for a portal drives on both sides the
low moving masses of the rigid portal
enables simultaneous plant asset and
five-sided machining with high precision
and speed the v h6 designed by similan
is an ultimately powerful two axis
milling head completely based on zero
backlash short motors the drive ensure
maximum dynamic behaviour and agility
the v h6 stands out by extremely slim
design and its minor interference
contour in the decisive lower area of
the four it's specially designed for
high performance cutting of hard and
tough materials like titanium steel for
cast-iron you get a multiple spindle
technology must the v h6 handles all
processing steps with ease from roughing
to finishing all in one setup without
the need to change machines this reduces
setup times and vapor production costs
my capacity rates of the F said 42 it
can be assured anytime by also machining
various materials like aluminum or sanik
alloy the responsiveness agility and
speed of the digital drive coupled with
the enormous blotting force of the
milling head and the right source of
spindle lead to exceptional chip removal
volumes in all materials whether you're
machining large sized press and stamping
dies structural parts made out of steel
and titanium for large size aluminum
parts the ED said 42 stands its ground
the F said 42 is extremely variable in
its technical features work area milling
head options control systems as well as
accessory options can be added to
