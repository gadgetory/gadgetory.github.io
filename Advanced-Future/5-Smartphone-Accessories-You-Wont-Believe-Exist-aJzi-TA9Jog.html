maybe bottom skin but as we go through
life being in the Sun exposed to
different chemicals pollution things we
eat toxins our body's ability to repair
itself isn't quite to the job that often
can develop into skin malignancies given
that the skin is one of the most exposed
organs it's the biggest organ in our
body each year more people get skin
cancer from the Sun and then get lung
cancer from smoking cigarettes one
American dies every hour from melanoma
and is one of the only cancers the
United States that still has an
increasing incidence but there's good
news unlike most cancers it is possible
to detect and treat skin cancer up to
95% of skin cancer deaths are
preventable by early action our mission
is to end all preventable skin cancer
deaths and it is possible that's why
we've created
so the hood is a polarized magnifying
lens that attaches to any smartphone
camera once attached it allows you to
take medical grade images of your molds
together with our app you can track your
moles your skin cancer warning signs and
even share the images with the
dermatologists
it's now instead of waiting weeks having
an uncertainty and concern about your
own health
you can answer back within hours it
gives you not only peace of mind but you
get a prioritized dermatologist
appointment instead of waiting on three
weeks where you go through a family
doctor and then two dermatologists the
dermatologist will tell you hey come
straight into my office and I'll get
removed for you right away so for the
past 15 years we've worked hard at
developing the most capable medical
grade devices for dermatologists now
with who'd we have created a device
specifically for consumers that has been
designed to be friendly accessible
intuitive we really want to eradicate
skin cancer and I believe this is our
best shot with your help our vision is
to add the dramatic scope to the family
of medical tools we keep in the home
with who'd skin cancer could become a
thing of the past and we can spend less
time worrying and more time enjoying the
things we love
horizons vision is to allow everyone
owning a smartphone to experience
immersive three-dimensional augmented
reality it really is a first of its kind
horizon uses the technology that you
already own to make augmented reality
available anywhere anytime and to anyone
your smartphone camera finds the target
and overlays virtual images on to your
environment creating vivid
three-dimensional experiences you can
use anything as a target a dollar bill
your coffee cup or even an iPad screen
with just a tap on our app a choice of
experience a flip of the phone and the
horizon is ready to go
augmented reality lets you dive into a
world where your imagination is brought
to life in everyday settings augmented
reality can bring anything from joy and
entertainment to real-world
practicalities such as optical learning
hands-on design and the visualization of
models
when designing horizon simplicity and
usability is at the heart of augmented
reality as we had imagined
with the cardboard google brought
virtual reality to everyone with a risin
we are doing the same thing but for
augmented reality this led us to a
product that is both intuitive in its
use and only a fraction of the price of
current solutions we are a small and
dedicated team of designers developers
and programmers and what we have shown
you today are just some of the concepts
that we have built to showcase the
fascinatingly large potential that
augmented reality has to offer with a
Rison we are giving you the chance to
truly experience augmented reality and
to combine it with everyday real world
applications we are excited to be
bringing augmented reality to everyone
what we need is an initial investment to
cover some of our production costs but
also to kickstart app development so
back us today
still using the old fashioned way to
measure sizes and distances measuring by
yourself is always difficult you get all
sweaty it's hard to know how to do it
right either way it can be a waste of
time and effort feeling frustrated and
bothered now you have a better measuring
choice the eye pins spatial ruler from
the eye pin spatial ruler app plug the
eye pin spatial ruler into the iPhone
headphone jack then you can easily

can save the measuring results and also
instantly share them
