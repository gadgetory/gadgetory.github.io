evening I'm Jay Rogers and the CEO and
co-founder of Local Motors and I'm
sitting in an ally ally is the first
self-driving cognitive vehicle and it is
super exciting to have the training
wheels off on this amazing technology
today we launched dolly
in National Harbor Maryland on a
beautiful day with 250 attendees and
this is a huge day in automotive history
not only is it the day where Ford Motor
Company was incorporated June 16th 1903
but also it's the day where we got
people comfortable with the idea of
riding around in a completely
self-driving vehicle his name is Ollie
why don't I have him introduce himself
Ollie why don't you say hello hi
everyone my name is Ollie I'm a
self-driving vehicle powered by IBM
Watson technology I can help people get
around National Harbor thanks ollie
Thank You Jay by the way I like your bow
ties that's great
all I am hungry where can I get some
food National Harbor has some great
seafood would you like that that sounds
great what's good well try the crab cake
cafe all right I'll go there for dinner
okay look don't forget your umbrella
there is a severe thunderstorm warning
tonight all right I will
Thanks so what you just saw was me
conversing with ollie which makes my
life better as somebody using
transportation here in National Harbor
and that natural language and
structuring of otherwise unstructured
data was super real there is a real
thunderstorm this evening and all he was
letting me know and I'm riding and
interested in where I want to go to
dinner and if you can think about that
it's just a little nugget of what it
Maiden's that I don't have to take my
phone out of my pocket in order to be
able to try to structure data out of a
lot of different inputs that are there
but rather using the power of Watson IOT
in order to be able to take a lot of the
inputs that are out and around me that I
wouldn't even
thinking about and make my ride in a
nollie even better that's the power of
getting things done quickly and and
really what's meaningful to us is that
we started on this project three months
ago and three months ago doesn't mean we
made a prototype we sold our first 10
Ollie's today and so the ability for us
to be able to go from an idea with a
community designed vehicle and put it to
rights and make it in a three-month
period of time and then sell vehicles
and move in sparks up our micro
factories and makes it possible for us
to make this great technology come to
life it's been an amazing day
so these vehicles these Ollie's are
going to be on national Harbor streets
and all summer long we're testing and
improving and engaging different data
that we're pulling out of the vehicles
the sensor set on this vehicle allows us
to be able to feed data to Watson and
feed data back to Ali to make life more
enjoyable the goal to have 30 vehicles
on these streets by Christmas to be able
to connect all of the sights and the
sounds that are going around from living
to entertainment to exercise and to work
is really what will make national
harbor's transportation ecosystem come
alive and make it more enjoyable to get
around on a daily basis making and
selling and servicing and operating
vehicles locally is what local motors in
its name is good at that's what we do
and so Ali not only will start at
National Harbor but this is a nexus for
us to be able to deliver the next sets
of Ollie's and their self-driving system
all over the world by the end of the
year you'll see Ali in Copenhagen and
you'll see him in Las Vegas you'll see
him in miami-dade County and several
other places around the world so that
means that you're seeing this technology
deployed not only for the people of
Washington DC but really for more
feedback and more engagement across the
world undoubtedly the biggest challenge
that we've had comes as a result of the
speed at which we move the ability for
us to be able to get a product conceived
designed branded and out into the market
in order to be able to take orders and
then produce is something which is
incredible because it fits at the clock
speed that technology is finding its way
into the market and the clock speed
where consumers are changing their
preferences but what it means is that
perception of what's possible has to
along faster too often we hear people
walk down the street and say wouldn't it
be nice if but they don't imagine that
it's even possible and yet that
innovation is right around the corner
so today perception needs to change and
we're super happy to have that
opportunity to make that the greatest
challenge that we have since we've
already figured out that moving fast is
possible so we're all about it and thank
you for having having the time and
taking the time to join us tonight on
this great day in history and this great
day today for us in National Harbor it's
been a pleasure to share this time with
you
thank you
you
you
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
