this is beeline moto feelin moto is a
beautifully intuitive navigation device
change the way you like
nearly three years ago we can kick-start
a blush trip back navigation device
device we've shipped up to over 3000
people it's been sold around the world
ever since we don't just ride push bike
now we're about to be like motor we've
taken everything that people love so
much about that first place order into
finding the ultimate navigation devices
most likely its high-tech it's tougher
but at its core is that same concepts
have kick start to my storm in 2010 a
beeline moto attaches to any bike in
moments with the twist lock mechanism
and a variety of different marks setting
up routes just takes a few taps on the
smartphone app or you can even upload
GPX routes and once just set up you
don't need a data connection it's very
useful to have it when we arrive in with
a group and you don't always have to
ride in a pack you can have your own
ride and get the destination you just
have to follow one direction it's very
easy we've kept the interface
intentionally really simple there are
two modes for navigation
there's route mode which guides you
along a specific route and takes you
through every single turn and then those
compass mode which simply points you at
a final destination and gives you the
freedom to choose the route
some of the best parts are being on a
bike is that you don't have to be
hindered by traffic it definitely might
be like is not freedom moves through the
traffic and nowhere and going but also
create my own route them I need to I
love the simplicity and just being able
to get information quickly it's amazing
it's waterproof and shockproof and has a
really sturdy mounted mechanism battery
lasts for 30 hours of use and is been
charged by USB the display works great
in direct sunlight but also has a
backlight - nighttime lighting and the
app will track all of your rights so you
can go back and see what you did I think
I love most about dealers
it only gives you the information that
you actually need or as I have a phone
up there's just so much going on that
you actually lose track of what's
happening it really brings back for a
sort of purity of
riding a bike again you just put it on
and was good to go we've learned a huge
amount in developing one product already
and all that knowledge and experience is
going straight in for beeline motor
we've now got a fantastic team behind us
and a really great relationship with our
manufacturer in China we're working
closely with the motorcycle community
and the feedback so far has been
fantastic you learn have been excellent
at asking what we want what we need so
very excited that the new products
coming out and work extremely well we're
incredibly excited to bring v-line motor
tonight with your support we can make it
happen thank you very much
