happens you've kind of got to be able to
second-guess the taxi in front of you or
the pedestrians coming up I end up
getting nearly at least one today the
young driver lost concentration and hit
me from behind I was extremely lucky
that day the doctor said that 95% of
people that would have sustained those
injuries would have been killed by them
roads that were built really a hundred
years ago for far less traffic in terms
of cycling at night I feel way less
visible sometimes I choose not to cycle
home at night it's a lot more dangerous
bloodstains CC unique spray difference
are the reflected products on the
markets when you apply it to surface the
reflective particles will stick together
with a special adhesive making this very
invisible by day but light up at night
in the glare of headlights
Rome is renowned for its safety
innovations lifepaint takes the
principle about 20/20 vision
protecting passengers inside the car to
protect those outside too I think you've
just got to be visible as you can and
that's the good thing about life brain
as it makes this very hard
view to be miss putting something on
that make you scream out of drivers like
me is a fantastic thing
I think cycle safety in London is not
all about bicycles
it's about cars is about pedestrians is
about sharing the road with other users
so it's great that a car brand has got
involved to essentially help cyclists
and help drivers in the end and save
lives
a bike parking solution that would lift
your bike for you wouldn't require
physical strength and would save floor
space it's all possible and it is here
it's parkus how it works
drive in the front wheel when the wheel
is fixed hold the saddle to lead the way
and let parkus do its job to remove the
bike just grab the saddle and pull
firmly towards yourself many bike
enthusiasts face a problem a lack of
storage space all the available by
parking devices that solve this issue
require great physical effort so parkus
was invented as a solution the idea was
born in 2014 and developed for over a
year by the end of 2016 a fully
functional product was created parkus is
a solution that can be used by everyone
from teenagers to the elderly it also
saves at least 40% floor space and it
looks stylish
parkus it's easy fun and simple
hi I'm professional mountain bike rider
jeff lenosky I'm going to show you how
to install as Victoria airliner the
first step is sizing the air liner to
the tire wrap it around the rim mark the
intersection next using a sharp blade
cut the insert perpendicular at the mark
the next step is to join both ends using
the zip tie carefully trim off any sharp
ends from the end of the zip tie and now
it's time to set one side of the tire
onto the rim once I have one side of the
bead on the tire it's time to put in the
air liner in order to make this airliner
go on the tire a little bit easier I'm
gonna wet it with some water and that
will act as lubrication the next step is
gonna be to place this thing inside the
tire just like I would seat a regular
tire I'm gonna start at the valve stem
and work my way around in order to get
this last bit of the tire on you're
gonna want to use a tire lever and be
careful not to damage the rim strip now
the tire seated I want to remove the
valve core and inflate it just like I
would any other tubeless tire make sure
you hear all of your beads snapping into
place and then I'm gonna let all the air
out so I can add my tire sealant you're
going to want to put your tire sealant
in through the valve stem
once the sealing is inside the tire I'm
gonna put the valve stem back on and
then play it back to full pressure
once the sealant is inside the tire and
you're all inflated give the wheel a
spin and a couple of bounces to swish
around that sealant that is the entire
vit√≥ria air liner installation process
this was my first time ever trying and
it went super smoothly hopefully you
find this video useful and now if you'll
excuse me it's time to go shred some
trails
cycling is great for your health your
budget and your planet maybe you bike as
