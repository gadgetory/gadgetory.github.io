never miss another update these Nine
Inch ironworkers pliers were designed to
cut and twist rebar tie wire what makes
them unique are the deep channels on the
knurl for a strong grip when twisting
and pulling wire but the grip is better
at the puffs and it looks less likely to
be making slips and mistakes as you're
going along and you could just keep
flowing the spring-loaded action enables
self opening for a quicker workflow
exclusive handle tempering absorbs the
snap when cutting wire hook bend in the
handle provides added grip and leverage
there are also induction hardened side
cutting knives at the hinge
there's smooth operation and that like I
said the cutters and the teeth the other
grab haul the wire no slipping they feel
comfortable as if they were broken
already
the heavier forged steel construction
makes these pliers are much more durable
overall tool manufactured in the USA by
Klein tools for professional trades
people since 1857
for lunch Kevin O'Brien on the inventor
and the blockbuster bolster won it
straight through here we've got the
hundred mill traditional bowel stuff
been around for a lot of years used for
cutting blocks bricks and everything
else when cutting the block you can only
cut part of the block and also there's a
danger bit coming off a striking point
and hitting your thumb or your finger
what they did they tried to get over
that problem bringing in the mushroom to
protect your hand when cutting it but a
lot of bricklayers don't like using them
because when you cut the block and
follow that through this bit of plastic
comes down and hits you on the back of
the hand
the block buster bowel stuff we've got a
230 mil blade which is the depth of your
block striking point on the top but just
as important is the handle on the side
so your striking point is on the top of
the bolster and your hand is over well
out the way we've also introduced
hundred mill lines offer your bolster up
to your mark
spin the bolster round cut the block
eliminates the use of a tape also used
on your gables you cut ups on your
Gables your angled cuts straight through
the block Buster's not only good for
cutting blocks with you can also cut
bricks of it there you go
nice straight cut the block buster
bolster a lot quicker a lot more
accurate and a lot safer
no doubt this is familiar to you as well
the material comes in sacks and the drum
mixer can't manage to deliver mixing
results of the required quality in these
cases the TMS mm compact mixer is in its
element thorough mobile and reliable
just take a look at what it can do the
TMS stands firmly and is ultra compact
even narrow doors are no obstacle it's
always there where you need it other
advantages the fold-out step for easy
loading the ripping bar for opening
sacks of material with ease the three
are mixing tool for reliably mixing a
wide range of types of more tart plaster
Street and concrete segmental slide for
a trouble-free emptying into a turtle
wheelbarrow and protective grille with
safety cut out and under-voltage release
as well of course
what's more the TMS is easy to clean no
tools are needed to take out the mixer
the solid hexagon driveshaft is
extremely rugged and long-lasting and
loading into vehicles is child's play
one man can do it alone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
