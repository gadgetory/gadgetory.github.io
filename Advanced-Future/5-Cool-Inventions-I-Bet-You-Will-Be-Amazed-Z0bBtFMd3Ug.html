we all know flippers are fun whether
it's at the beach on the boat or on
vacation somewhere warm however we also
know the problems they can cause when
we're trying to get into and out of the
water it could be walking across the
beach trying not to trip over your
flippers while trying your best not to
look silly or maybe it's when you
struggle to climb a swim ladder and you
realize that wearing your flippers
probably wasn't the best idea my name is
Lee that's me behind the wheel and
that's my 10 year old daughter she had
struggled with swimming for years and
after her last attempt at swimming
lessons she was left feeling defeated
and upset and like any good father I
wanted to help so we tried flippers but
the problem we quickly ran into was she
was always in and out of the water
playing with her friends and that
involved the hazards of walking and
climbing with them flippers have been
around for 75 years and we've lived with
these problems because up until now
there hasn't been an alternative and at
10 years of age I couldn't expect my
daughter to start wearing water wings or
a life jacket with her friends when I
couldn't find a suitable solution for
her I decided to come up with one on my
own and that solution was tail fins an
innovation that has taken the
traditional flipper back to the drawing
board with its patent-pending Hydra wing
design we were able to get rid of the
long front fin that had caused all those
problems in the first place
and still provide stability and speed
and with the Hydra wings placed up and
away from the ground walking is now a
breeze and climbing swim ladders has
never been easier tail fins has taken
into account the complete user
experience and we can say with
confidence that getting into and out of
the water has never been easier and
we're certain that tail fins will be a
success but for that we're gonna need
your help as the creator of tail fins
the journey up until now has been
amazing but the highlight by far was
when I saw my daughter's from the length
of the pool for the first time she was
wearing her tail
in today's world technology is
constantly evolving and new products are
emerging yet most people still listen to
music using traditional headphones or
earphones we wanted to bring you a new
way to listen to music with the most
advanced technology the next step of
listening to music is now here

conduction technology that is wireless
and hands-free the battery PCB on/off
switch and LED light are located in the
Bill of the cap 0.i uses bone conduction
technology that sends vibrations into
the skull and directly into your
eardrums the bone conduction speakers

sound 0.i uses Bluetooth technology that
allows you to listen to music and answer
phone calls and it's all put together
into the simplicity of a hat it has a
built-in microphone so you can answer

you travel and when you do your device's
travel with you then you know plugging
your devices in different countries can
be a challenge whether you travel often
or once in a while you've probably used
one of these at least once in your
lifetime
simpler travel adapters only plug into
one type of socket Universal adapters
aren't the most travel friendly because
they're big bulky and can be quite heavy
well after countless prototypes
extensive testing and customer feedback
we created a better solution to help
travelers plug their devices anywhere in
the world introducing micro the world's
smallest universal travel adapter with
surge protection compacting all the
benefits of a bulky universal adapter
into a cool gadget that's as small as a
single socket adapter bringing over a
hundred and fifty countries from all
seven continents into the palm of your
hand squeezing all plugs from around the
world into a compact space for maximum
versatility micro is super small weighs
only 40 grams is durable then very
travel friendly plugging in the micro is
easy micro accepts all major plug types
from around the world the adjustable
integrated casing makes it easy to cover
any third pin safely
the release mechanism is spring-loaded
and easy to use top slide to plug into
the Americas and over 54 countries
simply twist to use in Australia in over
29 other countries and when you're done
push to store and block bottom slide to
plug into Europe and over a hundred and
twenty-five countries simply connect the
integrated modular third pin extension
for access to the UK and over 47 other
countries when you're done you know the
drill
push store and lock the built-in fuse
protects your devices wherever you
travel because a blown fuse is always
better than a fried laptop phone or
tablet simply replace the fuse and
you're ready to go wherever your travels
may take you the world's smallest
lightest Universal travel adapter keeps
your gadgets safe and makes plugging
your devices easier than ever before
