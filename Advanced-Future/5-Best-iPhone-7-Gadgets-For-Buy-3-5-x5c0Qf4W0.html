in the course of life first you must
learn to stand to take a stand to stand
together
stand tall
and to always stand out the I stand 7
from Yost and the indispensable
companion to your iPhone 7 6 or 6s
triple your phone's battery life and
always have a stand built in the case
and at the ready connect standard 3.5
millimeter headphones
wherever you are stand out
yo stand hi everyone we want to talk
about how to pick the right zero touch
mount for your car there are two zero
touch car mounts zero touch dashboard
and zero touch air vent let's start with
zero touch air bed since all events come
in different shapes and sizes we want to
make sure yours is compatible zero touch
air vent tends to fit best with parallel
blades so in order to clip onto the vent
there needs to be space on either side
of the blade as well as behind the blame
for zero touch to wiggle on to some
blades may be a bit thicker but if you
gently wiggle the mount from side to
side it should attach just fine do not
force it in now there are some vents and
cars that zero touch air vent won't fit
properly
those are circular vents that don't have
parallel blades criss cross vents since
there's not enough space to wiggle on
the mount recessed vents that prevent
your phone from docking onto the vent or
thin vents that easily slide in
different directions which can't hold
the weight of your phone the description
below also has an ongoing list of
incompatible car vents we've tested
check to see if yours is listed below
now if zero touch air vent does not fit
well we suggest using zero-touch
dashboard mouth we also recommend the
zero touch dashboard mount if your vents
are not in an ideal place for visibility
or if you live in extreme climates that
require you to frequently use your air
vents on high since the air stream may
cause interference with the voice
