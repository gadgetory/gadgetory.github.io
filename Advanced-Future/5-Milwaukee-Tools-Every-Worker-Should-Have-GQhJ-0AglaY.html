nothing that we've ever seen as far as
power and runtime goes and it was like
sort of a wild factor excellent power
and the telephone banner he gives a cool
plenty of power throughout the whole day
it runs cool has lots of torque charge
laughs for a long time we're very happy
with it I don't see any overheating
issues with the 12 amp hour battery it's
excellent
nobody else has anything comparable with
all the amount of power at the runtime
the 12 point old battery we can run all
day on our 8-hour shift no problem no
slowdown on saying no I had to switch
the batteries I have full power all day
long until the bitter end runtime is
never really an issue anymore we get a
full day at least out of that yeah I was
impressive twelve point old battery
charge is quick lasts long time and kept
the power it's very important that all
the batteries are interchangeable you
just change the mouse you don't have to
buy a new new batteries for every tool
that you pick up it's an amazing line-up
and you can work just as efficient as a
corded tool with batteries all day did
change the way we work big time the
efficiency productivity of everything
day in day out operation it's very
important to have the new twelve point o
batteries we're running a heavy-duty
tools doing a heavy duty thing
the timbers are inches wide by 1342 just
call the Milwaukee chainsaw with the 16
inch please get plenty of power it
definitely did not expect it to work
like it does we cut everything from our
power poles to got oak trees down now
with it and goes right through perfectly
it never bogs down it's actually
performed better we think then the gas
ones do
the Milwaukee chainsaw lets me cut any
kind of hardwood any diameter that I run
up against it cuts faster than the gas
the marquee chainsaw cut really fast
really swift through with the big
Timbers that we're using on this jobsite
the m18 fuel chainsaw far exceeds
anything we've ever used the long run
time the torque it performs well above
what we possibly could have expected I
was impressed at a 12 point old battery
charges quick lasts a long time and kept
the power 12 point no batteries cut
through all day long without slowing
down or anything the battery life on
that Milwaukee saw was phenomenal
it's quiet - never big and taut while
we're working keep the fumes down it was
everything we would need it if I had a
choice between a gas-powered in a
Milwaukee chainsaw I would take the
Milwaukee chainsaw
when I actually need to do some chipping
I want something that's got the power
that's gonna handle it I was a little
skeptical this SDS max is definitely
taking care of that it feels like the
real deal
like it should have a cord on it but it
does not I was blown away a performance
just like your quartered one you know
just as fast felt later I love the power
you make a big tool for big jobs it will
get the job it would break the break
to punch holes through it it does
everything that it says it's gonna do
I'll give it ten yeah SDS matched with
this nine old battery offers a lot of
power and flexibility
I used it about a half an hour chipping
out mortars the SS max you can feel it
doesn't vibrate doesn't bounce around it
feels as powerful as a quarter it's a
solid cordless tool with a solid battery
the longevity of having that nine point
all is it's it's key I don't feel
there's anything that you couldn't do
with it to be able to have tools that
are compatible with each other to be
able to share batteries and chargers is
is hugely advantageous and when you put
them all together with the nine point
all and then the fuel brand it's just
gonna outlast everybody else honestly
I've never used anything like it
I would have to say that SDS max is
nothing what have you do
from the world leader in cordless
innovation Milwaukee introduces the m12
hammer vac the industry's only universal
dust extractor engineered to fit your
current concrete drilling solution the
m12 hammer vac is compatible with all
major brands SDS plus rotary hammers and
hammer drill for high quality debris
filtration the tool features are
replaceable certified HEPA filter that

and a three position switch with auto
mode that turns the tool on and off
automatically self powered by m12 red
lithium battery packs the tool provides
maximum portability with no cords or
hoses for unmatched versatility get the

if you knock out programmed by Milwaukee
really embodies kind of what we do as a
company we go out and talk to the user
and really try and redefine the process
of what they do in this instance we went
out looking for ways to innovate on a
knockout punch and we learned very
quickly that if you wanted to change the
way these guys work you had to go start
to finish through the entire process the
accuracy is very important you may be
running a whole rack of pipes there's no
room for error I mean we're running
conduits at the top of a panel they've
got to be exactly right on the mark so
with the cross hairs that allows us to
be exact and get our hole exactly where
we want it that way it eliminates
offsets
now I'm not spending time measuring to
make sure that dies in the right spot
because I can't see it I can see it easy
enough that I'm already lining up the
crosshairs on my marks that I put on
there hence the name is quick it's light
it's easy there's nothing to it there's
three pieces you can put on put it all
together up in the air or on top of a
panel and then slip the actual tool on
when you're ready to do the knockout I
don't have to hold 15 pounds of a
hydraulic pump and try to thread the die
on the inside of the can the productions
faster with the Quick Connect because of
the fact that you're not holding all the
weight up of those hydraulic heads
it's just as easy to pop a half inch
hole as it is a four inch hole and the
fact that it cuts through thick steel
very easily and without much effort
really impressive from the strength of
it it's it's easier to cut them out it
purses the old knock out cutters with a
pump you gotta really pump it hard to
get a cut and the battery fired one in
the walk is just awesome when it comes
to cutting with the battery you're not
lugging around the big hydraulic
cylinder on a jobsite we're swapping
batteries out all day long with it being
the same battery you know we need to
knock something out you just go grab it
off the charger but I think the three
main benefits of the force logic system
are accuracy speed and safety there's no
other die cutter on the market that's
anything like this that's that's this
simple now to see something come out new
is just totally different than what
we've been accustomed to it's quite
something to the whole system combined
from the dyes the Knockouts the
quick-connect the tool itself as a whole
they're just the perfect product for
electricians the some of the parts the
tool the punches and dies the
quick-connect alignment system really
redefined from the ground up the process
for hole making and at the end of the
day and body the easiest way to punch in
the market today
introducing the Milwaukee tick tools and
equipment tracker designed to track
anything and survive everything on and
off the jobsite managing tools and
equipment to cross multiple jobs with
multiple crews can be almost impossible
without a tracking solution tracked by
one kit the Milwaukee tech solves this
problem by integrating with the apps
inventory management solution for a
seamless tracking experience the tick is
a small tracking device that can be
glued screwed riveted or strapped to any
tool or piece of equipment you want to
track a Bluetooth signal inside of the
unit broadcasts the location of the tool
or piece of equipment up to 100 feet
from any device with a one key app the
app will continue to receive the signal
even when the app is closed and the
phone is locked we know that your tools
and equipment take abuse on the job the
tick is designed specifically to survive
in these conditions the durable
weatherproof design protects internal
components from water and dust while you
b-rated plastics keep the tick from
getting brittle when exposed to sunlight
for long periods of time we've designed
the tick to be as subtle as possible
with a low profile structure and flat
back to ensure that you can put this on
a variety of surface types tracked by
one kit the milwaukee tick is designed
to track anything and survive everything
on and off the job site</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
