CEO of music over the last four years
we've been working hard in a lab
creating the smartphone of headphones
I'm proud to introduce music one we have
a custom 40 millimeter driver so it
separates your lows mids and highest so
you get that rich HD sound music one is
packed with so much technology we have a
strong but lightweight headband
we have aircraft aluminum hooks that
proper weight and balance capacitive
touch controls to adjust your volume and
track interchangeable cushions so you
can find that perfect fit between on the
air and over here
music one are the only headphones with
programmable hotkeys these hotkeys act
like a remote controls a television or
radio preset in your car so with one
touch I can activate my favorite Spotify
playlist I can share a song on Facebook
or Twitter I can listen to live news
sports scores and more music one has a
long-lasting rechargeable battery that
lasts up to 30 hours when connected to
Bluetooth music one has an extra-long
wireless range users who choose over ear
cushions can listen with custom DSP
settings and passive noise isolation
without sound leaking in or leaking out
music and spotify have come together to
create the first truly connected
listening experience music is the
first-ever wireless fully connected
headphone with Spotify allowing users to
play share and control your favorite
music service music one truly connects
you I never before
evening is it a hobby for me to my
future career I need full 360 degrees
down what's good no console you already
know them as the iconic headset worn by
streamers and pro gamers around the
globe you want those razor Krakens a go
anywhere do anything own everyone
eSports solution a 3.5 millimeter cable
provides universal compatibility along
with its premium aluminum band and
unidirectional boom bike hi my name is
Rob janeski and I'm a lead designer for
ikg brand today we are at ISA in Berlin
and I would like to present you our new
line of products this is quite serious
this is our our first our first product
from Y serious this is why 50 or we are
really proud of this this product what's
really special about it that is
extremely light and we are using great
premium materials we have aluminium on
the ear cups we have stainless steel on
the headband this part here is
reinforced with glass fiber so they are
extremely durable they are also
extremely flexible ear cushions this is
memory foam they are extremely light
they're super comfortable and sound this
amazing so check it out
these are the world's first headphones
lets you seamlessly sync up with
multiple friends and listen together we
all know that music is one of the most
powerful ways to connect with each other
so whether it's introducing a friend to
the artist you love expanding your own
musical tastes or even creating music
yourself we wanted to bring all of these
interactions together into a new
listening experience the art comes with
a mobile app help you see what other
people nearby are listening to you can
spin up a station regardless of where
your music is playing from or tuning
with other people and discuss the
current song when others join into your
station their headphones also sync to
your color ARC's light ring can be
personalized with countless color
schemes to match your mood or style and
dimmed or turned off completely privacy
settings lets you easily decide who you
want to share with and if you don't have
the app or are just feeling lazy you can
use the RF intuitive touch gestures to
control playback and sharing headphones
are now as much a personal statement as
they are a tool for playing audio and
just like your taste in music
they're a way to express who you are
since we started in September 2013 we've
gone through over twenty iterations of
the arc before finally being satisfied
our emphasis is on clean minimal design
that is striking but at the same time
subtle so that's their own style
consignment months of hard work
perfecting our acoustic design paid off
with the finely balanced audio response
reproducing your favorite songs as they
were meant to be heard for arcs cushions
we use the highest quality faux leather
and noise isolating memory foam so you
can listen for hours on end without any
discomfort
so the school candy crusher headphone
has an adjustable head Bank and very
soft ear pads it has a bass boost
function which works very great the
weight is around 450 grams and it has a
great building mic which also works very
great with gaming the length of this
cable of 60 inches for 150 centimeters
with a 3.5 millimeter jack the minimum
frequency is 21 heard and the maximum is
20 kilohertz this headphone doesn't have
a volume control which is release the
opportunity for this headphone because I
really like everything about this
headphone but I do miss the form control
