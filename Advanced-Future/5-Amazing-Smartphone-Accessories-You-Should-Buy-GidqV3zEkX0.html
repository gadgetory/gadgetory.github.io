hey everyone Dan Barnes here with phone
silver and I want to introduce you to
our brand new phone soap Wireless if
you've got a samsung s8 a pixel to an
iPhone 8 or an iPhone 10 you're gonna
love this new product
inside you'll find a circular wireless
charging pad right in the middle just
set your wireless charging compatible
phone on that and it will charge
immediately without a cord you'll also
see we've added two UVC lights on the
bottom so you're still going to get
complete coverage killing all the
bacteria on your phone on the back
you'll notice you still need to plug
phone soap into the wall with this port
here and on the other side you'll see we
still have a standard USB charging port
so while your wirelessly charging in
site you can still charge your e-reader
or your Apple watch at the same time for
any other phone we know you guys are
gonna love this new wireless tech and
hey while your wirelessly charging your
phone
clean it sanitize it at the same time
with phone soap Wireless if you want any
more details about unboxing and using
the device check out the video on the
film soap three page hey guys ryan here
at road microphones and this is the
videomic me
it's the latest addition to our video
micro range of microphones and it's
designed to help you get better audio in
the videos that you shoot every single
day on your smart phone
now the videomic me is a directional
microphone that's designed to help you
get better audio directly with any video
shot on your iOS or Android device it's
a directional microphone and it actually
cancels out sound that comes in from the
rear of the microphone and only picks up
the sound in the direction that you want
to record so whether you're mounting the
phone and recording directly in front of
you and cancelling out any sense from
behind you or whether you're mounting it
in selfie mode and wanting to cancel out
any of the sounds in front of you like
crowd noise or traffic noise and the
videomic me is a perfect market to get
rid of those sounds that you don't like
now in the back of the mic is a headset
output jack so that you can actually
listen to the audio as you record it and
make sure that you're getting exactly
what you want
now often what happens when you're
recording outdoors in a windy
environment you'll often hear the wind
reacting with a microphone making it
really rumbly and very hard to hear so
to combat that we're actually supplying
it with a wind sock which
straight on to the end of the microphone
and it means that you can record even in
very windy environments outside and get
totally clean audio the video mic me is
designed to fit a wide range of
different devices including both iOS and
Android devices as long as the headset
input on the device is on the opposite
side to the actual camera itself purely
so that you don't see the microphone
when you're filming straight ahead now
it comes with a little adjustment on the
back so that it can be mounted on a wide
range of different devices regardless of
whether you have a case on or not that
mount can be simply adjusted by just
twisting it off and then squeezing it on
against the body of the device itself to
get it to the perfect thickness and keep
it there nice and secure so there you
have it guys that's the videomic me I
think it's time to all get much better
audio with the videos that we're
shooting every single day
this is ludicrous a cool playful and
interactive case that will have your
fingers totally addicted the coolest
case ever designed

makes your phone spin at top speed
