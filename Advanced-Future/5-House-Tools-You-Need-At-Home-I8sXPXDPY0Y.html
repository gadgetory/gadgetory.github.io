it's important to become familiar with
how to operate your flexi Oh 590 it
features a two-stage trigger you first
pull the trigger on the gun partially to
start the turbine then pull back
completely to start spraying for a
controlled even pattern before starting
your project it's important to practice
and get familiar with the sprayer a
spray poster is provided and is an
excellent reference guide you can also
practice on a piece of cardboard dial in
the power and flow controls and spray
both a vertical and horizontal pattern
once you're comfortable with the
settings and spraying you're ready to
start your project remember to properly
mask and cover anything that will not be
painted take a look at the masking guide
for suggestions and instructions
pre-taped poly is another fast way to
protect trim and windows simply tape in
place unfold and secure where needed
point the sprayers six to eight inches
away from the surface as you begin to
spray evenly in a direction parallel to
the surface remember to keep your arms
straight as you spray avoid bending your
wrists or slowing your pace because it
tends to leave too much paint in one
spot to ensure full coverage overlap
each spray pass by 50% when spraying in
interior wall start by spraying one wall
at a time along the ceiling floor and
corners then fill in using an
up-and-down pattern for other surfaces
such as wood follow the grain to achieve
the best coverage and finish during the
spraying process remember to
periodically wipe off the nozzle with a
damp cloth to remove any dried paint if
your surface is smaller such as a corner
or spindled a lower volume and narrower
pattern on the sprayer works best and
use the detail finish nozzle for your
fine finished projects and thanks to the
patented lock and go design you can
change colors or materials in a flash
with a twist and release of the cup
