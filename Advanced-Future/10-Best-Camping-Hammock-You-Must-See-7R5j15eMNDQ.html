hammock the Hydra hammocks gives us the
Bliss of a hot tub and the supportive
comfort and freedom of a hammock the
hydro hammock is even great on the beach
your body is going to love absorbing the
rich sea minerals when designing the
Hydra hammock and heater system
prototypes I focused on durable marine
quality safety and versatility the
materials canvas texture aids and safety
as it minimal eise's slip hazards and
the weight of the water works as a
ballet add instability these have even
been tested with over 700 pounds
the idea for this came to me by chance I
ordered extra durable material to make
an ultra strong hammock for suspending
high in the tree the heat of that day
and the security of the hammock gave me
the idea to add water it worked the
hydro hammock is actually more efficient
as it comfortably envelops one's body
requiring less than half as much water
compared to a bathtub with new contact
designs for hiking and camping easy
setup even elegant stands and insulation
for winter use hot tubs use old water
chemicals and loads of electricity and
just how it's not fluorinated water salt
water and then how you can just pretty
much bring anywhere with the precious
waters right next to the ocean anywhere
you want like the most
public places just have it all
chlorinated you don't want to get in for
my family and the whole world actually I
want to make this a thriving success on
the market everywhere we owe it to
ourselves and to the future to do what
it takes to increase our time and
appreciation in nature and to on earth
water as we navigate throughout this
life we find ourselves bound to the
earth yet constantly beckoned by the
heavens is in this space the space
between Earth and sky that our soul
longs to be but the natural world holds
us ever earthbound 2013 was the dawn of
a new era with the introduction of our
new Bay hammock shelter thousands of
people began to rise above the hard flat
ground and start camping elevated in a
cloud of protection and now we are
excited to unveil the next evolution of
noob a hammock shelters the new base
Stratis
the new based strategy is a lightweight
modular hammock shelter that uses a
layered design to protect you and your
gear from rain wind and insects as a
system the new base Stratus is a
360-degree refuge that is compatible
with any camping hammock a delay Stratus
understand the beauty of simplicity with
just four stakes and two suspension
lines there's no need for cumbersome
tent poles or unnecessary weight when I
was in the Amazon I fell in love with
the youth of the hammock he keeps you
off uneven ground and it gives my back a
lot of support in this video I'll
quickly show you how to set up a
hennessy hammock I have the hammock set
up in a way that everything comes out in
the order that I need it this also means
I don't have to lay anything in the mud
or the dirt the first things that you
need to put up are the tree straps the
tree straps have two loops on the end of
them that you put your cord shoe
Hennessy hammocks use a figure-eight
lashing in order to make it secure and
easy to untie later on
at least three figure rates are needed
to secure your hammock and I finish off
with two half hitches on the bike the
tree straps are put at head height and
the top line is somewhat taut so that it
has the perfect angle and the correct
height if you set your hammock too low
you're going to be dragging on the
ground
if it's too high it's going to be
difficult to get into all righty this is
the Golan X hammock our family loves
there right now we have it just hanging
outside in the backyard and taking it
camping the kids love in it it's super
light which is awesome and it folds up
really really small just since this
little pouch with seriously is it one of
the size in my hand and I'm not I'm a
tiny person it has really nice thicker
straps so I don't worry about the kids
we've had three kids in this at once not
recommending that you have transmitted
limbs that we have it fits my husband's
weight perfectly and it has nice
adjustable lots and lots of room to
adjust for any width of tree so you can
see that this one's obviously twice the
width of the other ones and it has these
really awesome carabiners that hold
nicely and stay together everything
feels very secure and very well-made
it's really nice we've got the black and
red one the colors are like really
vibrant and nice it's very comfortable
the kids look swingin
the outdoors is not just somewhere you
pass through to get from your apartment
to work there is no end to the
adventures we can have it's only we seek
them with our eyes wide open we weren't
meant to live and work in a world of
cramped spaces so croa
is here to help
be me
I can be alone Selena

crew bhai bridge for you you can order

should be better now they are hi guys my
name is Tyler here to tell you about my
new favorite hammock available from
hammock sky.com also available on Amazon
I picked the natural color I think it
went well as you can see I chose to put
mine permanently inside my home this
hammock is super sturdy made of a cotton
polyblend
and my favorite thing is it's very
breathable taking lots of naps in it I
don't sweat another thing is that the
straps on the end they are super sturdy
if there's a weak point on this hammock
I can guarantee you that it will not be
here it definitely is a two-person
hammock what's great about that is that
you can fit two people in it me and my
wife were able to fit in it great as
well is that when I'm in it and I really
want to lounge out for me and it will
stretch out take as much room as I want
not feel restricted by the size of the
hammock can get in any position I want
to to be just as comfortable as I can
possibly be very minor complaint is the
only one I have I wish the edges were a
little bit thicker maybe a thicker hem
on the sides so that you knew where the
edge of the hammock was but at this
price point this is the hammock that
cannot be beat I would definitely
recommend this hammock from hammock sky
calm don't wait pick yours up today let
me know what you think make sure to
thumbs up this video if it helped you if
any questions comment below I'd love to
answer them thanks guys have a good one
hello everybody I'm Dutch and this is
the chameleon
I threw hike the entire Appalachian
Trail in a hammock and I've never been
satisfied with the various hammocks that
I've camped with over the years so I
decided to engineer design and build
from the ground up what I believe to be
the perfect timing
the chameleon the chameleon will adapt
to your environment and is truly a
revolutionary piece of equipment and
will improve the way people camp forever
this comic can be used in all seasons
while allowing you the flexibility to
adapt your comic delay in any direction
and to enter and exit either side of the
hammock our patent-pending vision zipper
was specially designed by us for tonics
the zipper is separable and reversible
so you can either have no bug net to
save weight and close the hammock for a
bug free experience or a touch a vented
top cover that will retain heat inside
the hammock most importantly you can
flip the bug net or top cover over so
you can lay in any direction for the
hammock body we started with our own
fabrics but is known for being light
strong and extremely comfortable with an
inner woven six-way ripstop ridge that
was the first for the industry we offer
different options of this fabric to
accommodate a wide range of body weight
and with a large selection of colors so
you can design the perfect climate for
your style the bug net invents are made
from ultralight no-see-um mesh to keep
the bugs at bay while still enabling
ventilation and visibility the top cover
is made of our lightweight 15 denier
argon 90 fabric which is water resistant
retains heat and comes in a wide variety
of colors there is a specially designed
vent that not only allows the moisture
of rust to exhaust but also gives you a
window to the world
I designed the titanium beetle buckle
for the chameleon and it is extremely
adjustable and detachable so you can
pack your wet suspension separately with
this system you can hang two hammocks
side-by-side with a spreader bar using
the same trees and under the same tarp
we are using our own proprietary Dyneema
webbing which is up to
30% lighter than the standard polyester
webbing of the same braking strength the
numerous B rings inside and outside the
hammock will allow you to attach storage
pockets to the P cloth and pile points
that can be adjusted from inside the
hammock on the outside there are
multiple paths cooks for securing
different lengths under Clips the
chameleon is made by dedicated craftsmen
and is of course made right here in our
Lancaster Pennsylvania facility
ideal for backyards and campgrounds the
Eagles Nest Outfitters double deluxe
hammock is lightweight easy to set up
and provides ample room for two let's
take a closer look
so weighing in at just 26 ounces the
double deluxe is designed to hold up to
400 pounds it's constructed with a
durable and breathable woven nylon so
that's the majority of the material that
you see here we do have some triple
interlocking nylon stitching there to
hold the pieces together and provide the
structure when you're laying in it on
either ends there is some nautical grade
hang line so that's going to provide
some stiffness and rigidity to the
hanging structure of the hammock and
they're attached with two wire gate
carabiners so they're aluminum wire gate
carabiners rated to 400 pounds they're
not rated for climbing so be aware of
that you're just at that 400 pound
weight limit of great construction and
good materials in the Delta - la crema
so this hammock was designed to be a car
camping hammock or something that you
bring to the park you know in your
backyard it's a little bit bigger and a
little more bulky than the backpacking
style hammocks but it's still
lightweight easy to set up and provides
the relaxation and comfort that Eagle's
Nest is known for they do recommend that
you don't hang it more than 18 inches
off the ground when you're actually
inside the hammock so be aware of that
try not to hang it too high it could be
kind of dangerous but all in all it's
very comfortable
and easy to set up system so one more
cool feature with the double deluxe is
that it has its own stuff sack that's
kind of attached to the whole system so
this actions of stuff second when you're
hanging in the hammock like I am now it
even actually a little pocket see you
can throw books in there you can have a
phone maybe some snacks it's a nice easy
to access pocket when you're done with
the hammock you just stuff it back in
there and it has a built-in compression
strap you can really get a nice either
pack size or keep it nice and compact to
throw in the car so there you have it
it's the Eagles Nest Outfitters double
deluxe hammock providing more width than
their regular double mast hammocks it's
a great option for take into the park
the backyard or the camera the flying
tent is a multifunctional Alto gear that
combines a hammock a mosquito protected
hammock a waterproof clothing tent that
can also be set up on the ground with a
BB can and a fancy rain poncho
all-in-one smart and reliable product
the flying 10 can be set up without any
additional tools in just about seven
seconds and you can be converted to its
different functions quickly and easily
this makes it one of the smartest most
versatile outdoor gears that you can
possibly get
as outdoor enthusiasts we love the
simplicity of the flying tent but it
took us a while to get there
the biggest challenge was to merge all
these functions into one smart products
that allowed small packaging without
compromising its functionality after two
years of hard work our team was finally
able to come up with a truly unique
product that exceeds all our initial
expectations the times when annoying
mosquitoes and showers of rain could
easily destroy your hammock experience
our definitely over the flying tent was
designed to be your perfect outdoor
companion under all weather conditions
it consists of high-quality waterproof
materials and it comes with all kinds of
useful features that make your outdoor
experience even more enjoyable

features of the flying tent on our
website till then thanks for watching
and see you out there
this is super simple to set up it'd be
great for day to day hanging out in the
yard camping and backpacking as well it
comes with obviously the included bug
net comes with a Ridgeline
however the straps are sold separately
the first thing equals nest outfitters
recommends is setting up this included
ridgeline so what you want to do is set
this up on you know trees or however
you're going to stabilize your hemlock
set that up around eye level or maybe a
little bit above eye level depending on
how tall you are there's two included
carabiners that clip right to the
specific adjustment point that you want
to use on your strap after that you just
hang the little clip right here on the
top of the bug net so you just clip it
on this is actually a sliding adjustable
attachment point here so it makes it
really easy to you know get whichever
point you want beneath this clip there's
actually a bungee cord so you know when
you get in your hammock you can actually
move that up and down
you
