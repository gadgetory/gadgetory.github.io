gear s2 you simply turn the app tray tap
to open and request the car by having a
third operating system alongside here
and here what Apple watch uses in the
Android wear you're requiring app
developers to to adapt their um your
apps for for yet another system and so
far they haven't really been been doing
that on the market share for Samsung
hasn't been enough or there haven't been
enough you Samsung smart watches out
there for for people to you know think
that that's near really worthwhile the
battery life for all these watches your
range abit new Samsung is promising you
know two or three days here which is
impressive especially alongside the 18
hours that the Apple watch promises of
course you will depend on usage and
until we've had a chance to test these
watches you know we we don't know how
well they're going to deliver on that
promise finally fixing the Apple watch
user experience with watch OS three
which will arrive as a free upgrade this
fall users can look forward to
significantly faster apps with
background updating a control center and
app dock and lots lots more every Apple
watch user hates using apps they're so
slow they're barely worth the effort but
that's not the case anymore apps under
watch OS 3 are up to seven times faster
than they were with watch OS 2 and
thanks to instant launch the open in a
flash certain apps can also be updated
in the background and they now have
native access to the digital crown Apple
also added a whole bunch of new AP eyes
that will improve watch OS games
allowing for embedded video speaker
control and more watch OS 3 now boasts
the breathing exercises lets you share
activity data and add support for
wheelchair users which changes the time
to stand notification to time to roll
ads to specific exercises and tracks
wheelchair movements Apple has
redesigned the find friends and
reminders up giving us an app dock for
all our favorite titles adds a letter
rating to allow the custom replies to
your messages as an Apple pay support
for third-party apps and improve the
messaging experience
we're finally getting some new faces too
but there's no support for third party
options instead we'll get a Minnie Mouse
with a variety of different outfits new
activity faces in digital analog and
cronograph options and a clean and
simple numerals face finally there's a
great new SOS feature which
automatically calls the emergency
services when you press and hold the
button on the side of your Apple watch
it's a location aware - so when you're
traveling and knows which number to dial
when we start to think about what we
should do in terms of the design of the
watch we really went back in time this
is all about reinvention of modern-day
timepiece we decided if we're going to
do the Moto 360 we must do it round it's
a growing ambitious design
now remember presenting it to the
engineers for the first time a sort of
dual reaction of excitement and sort of
direct fear of how on earth we're going
to be able to realize that so most of
the technologies that have been created
in the past have been for rectangular or
vectors all the cool components
technically completely brand-new ground
up in order to support this design
vision
we like wearing watches because they
represent our personal style and because
they make us feel good the quality of
the craftsmanship in the design is
incredibly important when it comes
together for it to feel just distilled
and elegant if you can close your eyes
and you can feel the grain and you can
feel how authentic it is then we have
the right leather it's the same with
metal there's just a quality that you
can feel moto 360 is an invention of the
modern Titans iconic an amazing piece of
technology is a game-changer moto 360
begs to be won
you
before we started designing a SmartWatch
we also serve one important question
everybody has his own ideal watch a
watch he truly desires what SmartWatch
does a consumer really want it is their
ideas that inspired us to create this
piece
first of all it has to look like a watch
because a watch is a watch I don't want
a miniature smartphone or just another
gadget to show off for me a watch
represents timeless fashion and a sense
of style consumers are looking forward
to a SmartWatch with timeless design
what we are trying to make here is more
than just a classic watch many of the
classic watches are round shaped that's
why we've chosen a classic round shaped
case beam pile we've maintained the
characteristic of a watch luck
the watch ezal and the crown we have
specially designed a number of watch
faces for customers to choose from no
matter whether it is business casual or
sporty for me the size of the watch and
strap is really important
most Smart Watch designs are for men but
for women it's a little bit more
difficult to find a suitable watch size
through our extensive surveys of male
and female consumers we've discovered
the most common and wearable size and
luxury watch making now the diameter of
the watch surface is 42 millimeters it
is the most compact design in round
shape watches we have also designed
straps they fit women's wrists we have
plenty of choices in the materials and
designs of the straps no matter whether
you prefer a stainless steel strap or a
leather one all the straps are
interchangeable
you
Jade true craftsmanship as in the making
of luxury watches we've chosen sapphire
glass as the watch surface the same
material as another luxury watches the
smooth stainless steel unibody is
meticulously made by a multiple of
procedures with masterful polishing
which gives it an even richer feel
something that is worth mentioning is
that in this tiny space we have
attentively added all the advanced
technical components inside it I like
be intricately and thoughtfully designed
if I have to choose a SmartWatch it
should bring me a more remarkable
experience in a classic watch a
SmartWatch of course needs to be smart
within we positioned the crown at 2
o'clock just press it lightly and the
classic watch face emerges and
remarkably we've brought the amazing
functions of Google now to your wrist
and of course it is equipped with
state-of-the-art activity tracking
functionalities providing a simpler way
to monitor your health many consumers
have the desire to earn a true
SmartWatch this inspired us to design a
SmartWatch with exquisite craftsmanship
eyewash is sophisticated yet not
extravagant I believe we have made a
true watch the watch the office today's
technology with classic watch styling
you
hi babe Hey yeah I didn't want to bother
I need my hands for your old day
yeah go ahead
let's guess uh yeah gotta fill it got
you got a Billiken sky we gotta finish
gotta get it to my side that's it that's
a fresh
things that really sets us apart on this
new watch is that the screen does
feature a dual layer LCD so it does do a
lot of power saving functions because it
lowers down the resolution as well as
the color which you'll see here in just
a few seconds it lowers down into a
monochrome feature
so even unlike many other smartwatches
when it's not actively being used it's a
blank screen you can't just look at your
wrist and see what time it is this one
always shows it it's also completely
customizable just by tapping it you can
see different colors and you can even
just hold it down and you have an array
of different watch faces that you can
work with
exactly very simple very easy to use
just quick taps the other really neat
thing that this has is it features our
sensor based technology so by just
tapping the tool button here right on
the upper side of the watch they'll take
you to different things such as fishing
chart data
steps Fitness all the good stuff that
everybody wants including a compass
altimeter and even a barometer and that
all works regardless of whether it's
actually tied to a phone or not so even
if your phone dies your watch being a
smart watch usually becomes useless but
not in our case that is amazing I mean
all the cool features it's almost like
you have like an all-in-one you can do
you can exercise you can go fishing you
can do so many you know activity events
with this watch this is also come in
different colors yes it is the one model
but it comes in four different colorways
including this orange a bright rescue
red yeah so very high brightness high
LCD clarity so you get a perfect picture
quality no matter what the lighting is
an olive drab green a very different
olive drab as well as a plain black see
very sleek very stylish amazing amazing
you know you also have some really cool
app features to go along with the watch
tell us a little about it yes so working
with the Android wear system there are a
couple of different key apps such as run
keeper which you can use to monitor your
run as well as cycling for everybody who
does all of that there is the view
Ranger app which will allow you
different access to trail maps and
hiking tools and such like that as well
as my personal favorite lately has been
the my radar being a motorcyclist you
never want to get caught out in the rain
too bad so - yeah so you could even just
pop up my radar and it will actually
show you a radar map on your watch
screen to give you an idea of what
exactly you're going to be dealing with
that day that is amazing technology and
I'm loving that Casio is really bringing
it with this Smart Watch I guess
anything last not least we should share
no just to come on down and check it out

everyone Kevin Rose here today we are
talking about the Tag Heuer connected
SmartWatch the first thing you'll notice
with this watch is the screen size it's
a 1.5 inch screen which is one of the
largest in the industry with this 1.5
inch screen you have a case eyes of
forty six point two millimeters which is
pretty big it's twelve point eight
millimeters thick and screen resolution
is 360 by 360 with 240 pixels per inch
so by default it's in a very dimmed
state you're not going to see much
there's no tag branding on the exterior
outside of just a little bit of copy in
the upper right that says Tag Heuer
connected the connected watch comes with
three different dials here you can see
the chronograph classic Carrera styling
tap once to start the chronograph you
can see the red hand they're moving tap
again deposit and then DoubleTap to
reset to change dials simply tap and
hold and it brings up the interface to
quickly swap them out here's the GMT tap
and hold again and we can swipe over to
the three hand so each of these dials
comes with color options if you tap and
hold on the chronograph here and then
tap on the gear icon it brings you up to
the theme selection screen here you can
choose blue face white face I'll choose
white and you can see you have a classic
Carrera white chronograph so under the
hood this is a Google wear watch so it's
running the Android operating system
that means you'll have access to all the
applications that are available on the
Google Play Store it also has all the
built-in functionality that you'd expect
text message notifications calendar
notifications emails and even access to
ok Google tell me the score of the
Warriors game
and you can see it displays the score
right there this watch has a rubber band
and titanium case which means it's light
weighs 81 grams so it feels right around
the same weight as an Apple watch even
though it's much larger in size coming
in at forty six point two millimeters on
the outside you have a single pusher
here this will exit out of certain menus
and also activates the watch so that
when it's asleep you can see the display
and then has a fixed bezel on the
outside so in the back here you'll
notice that all there is is a
connectivity for the charger it's a
closed back there is no reader built in
here to read your pulse or anything like
that here's the USB charger it simply
slides over and kind of just you can
feel somewhat of a magnetic connection
there so it locks into place and then
you can lay that on its side on your
desk and it just starts charging so
let's talk about the competition it's
pretty tough you have of course the
Apple watch but also on the Android wear
side you have the Huawei and $399 the
Huawei has a 1.4 inch screen which is
very close to the 1.5 inch here but they
have a higher pixel density at 286 PPI
and a 400 by 400 screen versus the
screen here being 360 by 360 another
Google we're contending is the Samsung
gear s2 this watch price is out at $299
has a 1.2 inch screen and is 39.9
millimeters in diameter the gear s2 also
has a 360 by 360 screen but has a 301
PPI so slightly denser pixels so the tag
connected watch prices out at $1,500
which may seem expensive but there is a
trade-in program at the end of two years
you can take your watch back to tag and
for an additional $1,500 trade it in for
a mechanical Carrera so I'm a little
split here because I'm a mechanical
watch guy but I'm also a tech guy if
you're looking for the latest and
greatest in tech you're going to find it
elsewhere and watches with heart rate
sensors and a little smaller and form
factor with higher pixels per square
inch but if you're looking for that
classic Carrera dial and the tag name
this is the watch for you plus it gives
you a great upgrade path to mechanical
watch in the future
assumes the rumour mill started to churn
out whisperings of Apple getting
involved in the watch world every watch
brand worth of silicon got its R&amp;amp;D
department into looking at ways to
smarten up its offering that meant balls
a world this year was full of concepts
but very little in the way of completed
watches a part that is from mundane this
watch uses the technology created by
frederik constant CEO Peter stars and
Phillip Karn founder of full power
technologies under their manufactured
and movement technologies umbrella by
putting in the Helvetica design
Montaigne has created a SmartWatch
there's those smart and still looks like
a watch in fact this is the first time
both the words watch and smart have been
given equal importance the only clue to
its smart capability is the sub dialed
six o'clock which provides the analog
data readout from the app which allows
the information to be stored on whatever
device you're connected to the smart
part is the activity and sleep tracker
that is part of the movement which is
quartz and has a battery life of two
years rather than more than apples 24
hours as we said it doesn't look like a
SmartWatch this is technology you can
really wear to the office first and
foremost it's a great looking much with
the Helvetica design making it a draw
for font geeks as well as the studiously
stylish with the smart part feeling like
an added secret rather than the emphasis
of the whole design it is 44 millimeters
which could place it more in loot
watches for men category and as it is on
a leather strap you might not want to
work for a full-on workout making this
more watch for those who want to monitor
how their daily
contributes to their overall fitness
that said in terms of wearing it out and
about it is very versatile and we should
know we tried it on with everything from
ripped jeans to a lace dress it may not
be for after dark but it does work
incredibly well as a daytime piece which
means you'll get a lot of use out of the
technology element as well this is a
SmartWatch for those who want some tech
on their wrist but who don't want it in
a computer screen format
it's the SmartWatch for smart people if
you will so you like to run but not like
run run just you know run or you like to
swim competitively against your kids or
you're a biker not that kind of biker
boom there we go you also like to do
this and this and this
which means you should probably wear
this beat yesterday with Evo active
you
