Hogs supernova control it with the power
of your hands over 30 moves to master
Air Hogs supernova the powers in your
hands
please
you're equipped to play tonight with an
unlimited number of players all these
words you get you get the brand-new
laser excuse you double set for $79.99
and shipping it free batteries now in
beauty extra lots were sold separately
must a general
breathe
time for school
you're looking into the eyes of a robot
and he's looking back at you he's
curious about who you are and what
you're up to this is vector this is a
video about vector he's the new creation
from hongki he is a character a robot
that has meant to live in your home he's
always on he's alive the idea is really
that vector becomes part of the family
or that home both on the emotional
character side but then also on the
utility side vector is really the first
robot that uses advanced deep neural
networks to do a lot of perception and
understanding of the world around him
what he does feels intentional he can
react to inputs in his environment in
his life we generally want to find one
defining feature and then build from
that
for vector curiosity was a big one what
they're saying is you officially live in
a time when robot sidekicks are a real
thing it's a step closer to that sci-fi
robot you know that everyone wants to be
friends with that step closer means
you've got a robot in your house waiting
for you to get home
autonomous like a Mars rover aware
enough to avoid Falls like a tightrope
walker and always excited to welcome you
home like a loyal companion vectors no
slouch roommate either he's happiest
when he's helping out ask him the
weather and then he'll show you he can
set a timer and cause a commotion when
it's finished
activate robot alarm
and he can connect his robot brain to
the internet to answer your questions
he's a little robot who brings a lots to
your house he's also a little robot with
nearly 700 parts that one right there
that's his sole part okay I made that
one up but the little guys got soul
let's get someone in here to tell me
what all this stuff actually does how
does he here the vector has a microphone
array which allows it to hear voices and
noises and understand where it came from
what's he used to see vectored uses a
wide-angle camera
why doesn't he fall off the table for
crop sensors how come he doesn't bump
into stuff has this laser disc sensor
right here in the front whoa robot
lasers how do we know he won't use that
for evil we have a very strict quality
control process to make sure that no
evil robotic overlords emerge from from
vector this thing is just awesome
there's got to be a huge amount of code
inside the robot there is a huge amount
of code inside the robots a few million
lines of code at this point that
software really encompasses everything
from the character to the low-level
operating system to the cloud
functionality he has a camera in his
face and that's actually one of his
primary sensors not just capturing the
light in all the pixels but it's making
sense of those pixels he knows what it
is and where the stuff is that code
creates his intelligence and his
personality we think both about the IQ
and the intelligence as well as the EQ
and the emotion you feel something for
him you bond with him relate with him
care about him and you feel that he can
relate to you and give you something
back he is your friend he was built to
help and delight and entertain you that
is delightful and entertaining so
instead of sitting back and waiting for
the robot apocalypse on key is making
super-smart robots built to bring joy
and companionship to humans did I
mention he likes to be pet
vector is a really big milestone for
robotics because for the first time ever
there will be hundreds of thousands of
people living with a robot in their
homes and that has never happened before
vector is ready to live in your house or
at least he will be after the snap sweet
robot dreams buddy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
