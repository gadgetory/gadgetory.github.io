never miss another update Anna fee is a
flying camera that contains cutting-edge
photography software and hardware an
integrated camera uses the latest
generation sensor for spectacular 4k HDR
videos and 21 megapixel photos HDR adds
a far more dynamic range to the image
it's ideal for filming a sunset or a
bright blue sky with exposed backdrops
and if he is the only drone on the
market able to do this it's a camera
capable of taking unique photos and
videos that just aren't possible with
any other drone in the same category the
camera tilts from minus 90 to plus 90
degrees vertically and take shots from
all angles the camera is equipped with a
wide-angle lens
featuring a hundred and ten degree
diagonal field of view the optic was
specifically designed to limit lens
flare in all lighting conditions we
integrated an f-22 timeless as digital
zoom and an up to three times standard
digital zoom the zoom led us to create a
brand new smart journey called tourism
better known as the famous vertigo
effect
a DJI true innovation is seeing the
bigger picture every iteration is the
culmination of all that we do to bring
you the very best here's everything
you've been waiting for and beyond this
is Mavic too
the aircraft comes in two new additions
Mavic - pro and Mavic too soon
both cameras utilize DJ eyes latest
three access simple technology ensuring
smooth stable footage in any situation
Mavic to pro commands a powerful
one-inch sensor offering me greater
image quality with superior light and
color performance co engineered with
Hasselblad the new camera houses an
adjustable aperture lens for more
control over your lighting environment
capture stunning aerial photos and 20
megapixels with extreme detail Matic -
Pro supports a 10 bit D log M color
profile that yields higher dynamic range
for more flexibility in the grading room
Matic - zoom is all about dynamic
perspective with a 2 x optical zoom lens
it offers greater safety efficiency and
more creative opportunities the 48
millimeter focal length compresses your
perspective enhancing the parallax
effect for a classic cinematic look
you're able to punch him quickly for a
tighter shot even from a hundred meters
away keeping a safe distance from your
subject don't be fooled by the sides
Matic twos zoom lens is powerful
constantly adjusting to your commands
for seamless zoom control and autofocus
tracking this keeps your subject clear
while you focus on framing
Mavic to zoom gives you access to Dali
Zoo for an otherworldly warped
perspective
both editions record 4k video with an
advanced h.265 compression so your
images retain even more detail speed
things up in a dynamic aerial hyperlapse
with a simple tap of a button four
different modes give you a variety of
shots for any time-lapse situation
maduk 2 also supports enhanced HDR photo
an improved technique that blends a
sequence of photos for greater dynamic
range and image clarity it wouldn't be a
Mavic if it couldn't go with you
anywhere anytime we kept that same
foldable design and tweaked a few themes
that make a world of difference after
countless hours of research and testing
Mavic to three fine chassis and low
noise propellers make it DJ eyes most
advanced aerodynamic aircraft to date
these subtle yet powerful improvements
give you a smoother quieter flight for
greater discretion when the situation
requires Matic to extends your creative
potential with up to 31 minutes of
flight time in a match speed of 72 km/h
in the sport mode the all-new occu sync
2.0 provides a 1080p transmission signal
up to 8 kilometers so you can edit full
HD footage directly from the cache on
your mobile device 2.4 25.8 gigahertz
auto-switching offers better performance
in environments with busy signal
interference
for the first time in a DJI drone Mavic
2 boasts obstacle sensors on all sides
of the aircraft it's digital nervous
system continually transmits data to a
new more powerful central processor
the aircraft analyzes every inch of its
surroundings to move around obstacles
without stopping so you can focus on
capturing the perfect shot when you have
a need for tracking at high speeds stay
fully immersed in the action with active
track 2.0 aided by its vision systems
Matic - Maps a 3d view of the
environment for greater accuracy and
tracking up to 72 km/h
trajectory prediction algorithms also
help to maintain course when your
subject is blocked by an obstruction DJI
goggles users can enjoy an enhanced
experience with a clearer video feed and
lower latency
meet err selfie to the first HD
pocket-sized flying camera with its
compact design combined with its sturdy
construction you will want to take it
everywhere you go
enhance your phone's capability with
this picture-perfect photo and video
accessory
taking selfies is now easier and a lot
more fun it's simple to operate from
your smartphone with its easy-to-use app
sharing and posting your images to
social media is a cinch
advanced technologies in a high quality
camera surrounded by a ultra durable
frame with air selfie two's
anti-vibration and in-flight stability
system you can capture amazing memories
of your favorite moments and view your
friends and family in a new weapon
available in four different colors to
suit your personality
err selfie too small is the new bit
our initial focus has been to deliver on
that promise of the autonomous flying
camera and to make it real basically to
create a film crew that fits in your
backpack it's a camera that understands
the scene it's looking at and has the
ability to move itself those two things
together are just enormous ly powerful
this is a very ambitious product and to
make it possible we had to develop
custom hardware we built a device with
13 cameras that see in every direction
and at its core it uses an NVIDIA tx1
it's the same thing that's found in
self-driving cars and that's what runs
the sky do autonomy engine the first
step in the vision processing pipeline
is understanding where the vehicle is
and how it's moving to do this we look
for regions of high texture in the
environment and we track those as
landmarks in the real world that we can
triangulate and track our motion that
motion estimate is the foundation for
everything else we do the next step in
the processing pipeline is building up a
3d understanding of the world to do that
we compute stereo depth maps from each
pair of cameras and these get fused over
time into a dense 3d understanding of
the environment
from there the r-1 uses a combination of
deep neural networks to understand the
people around it it knows what people
look like and for every person it sees
it builds up a unique visual identifier
that it can use to tell people apart so
that it can stay locked onto the right
subject motion planning system turns all
the information about the environment
into useful action so it balances
avoiding obstacles keeping the subject
in view and capturing amazing video to
figure out how the vehicle should behave
by predicting four seconds into the
future
these planning commands get turned into
action in the physical world in rotor
speeds and gimbal angles this is an
incredibly complex system but the end
result is simple the vehicle moves
itself in a beautiful smooth cinematic
way to capture amazing video
