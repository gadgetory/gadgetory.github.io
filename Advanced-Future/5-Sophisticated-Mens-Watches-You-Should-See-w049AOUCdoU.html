hi Kickstarter my name is Adrian and I'm
the designer of sequins after three
years of research and development we
just finished our first functional
prototype we are ready to redefine the
future of smartwatches but we need your
support to make this happen
please join us and be part of a smart
watch revolution it's time for a change
time
what is time
the measurement
a fundamental structure of the universe
or just something we made up to keep
things in order
time is intriguing
time decides the boundaries of our lives
what does time into you
for us time is beautiful
time is elegant time is the capturing of
moments we are tired of oversized and
flashy watches we want to go back to the
fundamentals beautiful design together
with world-class materials we think we
succeeded
our watch is inspired by mid-century
watches the Belle Ã©poque of watch design
the watch is made of high-quality
stainless steel with Japanese high
precision movement and sapphire glass
crystal together with vegetable tanned
leather strap in our search for the
perfect leather we have visited many
tanneries in the end we found a small
tannery in the north of Sweden producing
among the finest vegetable tanned
leathers in the world all our watches
come with a 5-year warranty
how would you define a luxury watch
usually we think of high quality
exclusive great design and of course
expensive but does it really have to be
expensive you see the main reason high
quality watches cost so much is because
of the distributors wholesalers in
retail stores that mark up the price of
a luxury watch by up to 1000 percent our
team at Philip polarity set out to
change that by cutting out all the
middlemen we bring a line of Italian
luxury watches directly to you at a
fraction of the retail price
last year we presented our second
timepiece collection and with the help
of over 18,000 backers we made
kickstarter history by becoming the
world's most funded timepiece project
this year we are very excited to present
you our new watch collection but before
we do that here's how we made it first
we took inspiration from the three most
iconic monuments in Milan Venice and
Rome
then after months of extensive research
and development we created three unique
watch series each with its own character
and story to tell to ensure a premium
quality standard of your timepiece we
teamed up directly with world-renowned
professional manufacturers that have
decades of experience in watchmaking
industry in fact we're so confident in
the quality of our watches that each
timepiece will be backed by a 10-year
warranty to make sure you have the best
fit possible we will use premium Italian
leather to handcraft a comfortable
stylish and durable strap that will fit
your wrist perfectly here is our full
collection for those of us who love
dress watches we've designed the Rome
series for complex watch lovers we've
created the Milano series with its
distinctive dial structure and a
striking bezel and finally we have the
Venice series a sophisticated
