wearable camera that provides a shutter
wheel to control the shutter speed
allowing you to set it up to 1 mm of a
second for 32 seconds freely if you
haven't heard of mocha cam it's the
world's smallest 4k camera the rotatable
screen module allows you to find the
best filming angle and double the
battery life the spare battery that
simply snaps on magnetically can extend
your battery life to 4 hours for video
filming now alpha brings more surprises
here's how he made it even better
mocha cam alpha s has an umbrella image
processor and provides 4k 30 frames per
second or 1080p 120 frames per second
video features it means you can get 150
speed full HD slow-motion video
same to GoPro Hero 5 with the 1.5 5
micrometers Sony image sensors the
low-light performance has been
significantly improved in addition to
Wi-Fi alpha provides Bluetooth
connection which is more stable and
consumes less power they can turn your
phone into a Bluetooth remote and get
GPS information for geo-tagging or show
the trajectory with the built-in G
sensor alpha can get better image
stabilization on video recording alpha
has dual status lights so even if
there's no screen module they can show
the camera status clearly the dual mic
system provides stereo recording
capability
alpha uses a type seat board to connect
the camera and screen the micro HDMI
port provides a new preview and playback
mode now it's the totally new feature
and most important part this shutter
wheel with the new design buttons in
manual mode you can turn the shutter
wheel to set the shutter speed freely up
to 1 mm of a second or 32 seconds in
other words you can now use mocha cam
shooting long exposure night ticks or
even the Stars
what's more after applying all these
great features alpha is 20% smaller than
the previous generation and 35 percent
smaller than GoPro Bureau 5 we're also
able to offer two options this time
alpha and alpha s alpha uses the same
image processor - mocha cam the frame
rate is similar to gopro hero4 and
provides all the other features of alpha
s
hi my name is Eric I'm a passionate kite
surfer engineer and the CEO of Revell
the Revell Arc is the world's smartest
4k action camera
so why is our cameras so smart
well we've built in four different
sensors into this camera that measure
elevation rotation speed magnetic north
as well as other motion telemetry
we use it for electronic image
stabilization which takes out all the
bumps and jitters from your video but
beyond that we've built in a secondary
stabilization system which has a motor
built into the back of the camera which
keeps it always level to the horizon no
matter what you're doing including if
you mount the camera on a hubcap of
event
think of it as a gimbal a camera and
more combined into one compact camera
which is waterproof and you can mount
anywhere you're not going to mount this
anywhere this means you can kite loop
barrel roll and even backflip while the
rebel art keeps your footage stable and
level to the horizon this has never been
possible before with any other camera or
a gimbal system so what else do we do
with all this information we capture all
kinds of live data including how fast
you were going how much airtime you got
even how many g-forces you pulled on top
of all that you can connect external
sensors like a heart rate monitor to
measure your excitement when things get
a little crazy
the final piece of the puzzle is our
sensory AI which analyzes the data
associated with your footage and makes
intelligent decisions it then determines
your most exciting moments and
automatically creates a shareable video
without hours of physical editing or
even a computer at revel we believe that
life was made for adventuring not
editing we want to make it as easy as
possible for you to shoot edit and share
your best moments instantly we can't
wait to see what you will be able to
create with the Revel art thank you
we got this whole camera from camar√≥n
that let's see what we can do 360 degree
4k Ultra HD you can view all your videos
360 using VR goggles put this head round
you can see what I can see let's take it
up in a helicopter
you can also do live broadcasting like
periscope there's a go to the tree but
in 360 degrees 90-minute record time
that's longer than any other consumer
360-degree camera
aku's there
about skydiving
you can also share directly to all the
social media apps well without here is
calling a tortoise you can also do
360-degree time-lapse and I'm using the
app to adjust it for communicating
delicious it's very good
so that was the 4k live-streaming 360
panorama video camera from camera Rama
we had a really really good couple days
running around Hawaii shooting with it
got a lot of good 360 video 360 photos
made a lot of cool friends and this 360
video this is the future you know it's
fun to be a part of it so if you're
interested in this technology jump on
board it is it was literally the future
of video and I want to thank camera Rama
appreciate the camera and Aloha from
Hawaii
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
