hi my name is Matthew Stefan and I would
like to show you our team's latest
creation the multi pass mini this small
inexpensive device provides you a secure
and easy way to access your usernames
and passwords it works whether you go
and on any computer or smartphone
the multi pass project came to be a
little more than two years ago when
dozens of security minded individuals
from all over the globe came together to
solve the problem of remembering
passwords our first device was
successfully crowdfunded in December
2014 raising more than $125,000 six
months later we had delivered the multi
pass to our backers they loved it but of
course they had feedback and suggestions
on how to make the multi pass even
better with their input we've created
the multi pass mini the mini is smaller
and easier to keep with you completely
scratch-resistant more affordable and
easier and quicker to interact with the
multi pass mini provides you with an
easy way to access your credentials
whenever they are needed it integrates
seamlessly with Google Chrome and
Firefox support is currently in the
testing phase each user is uniquely
identified with a smart card which
contains the encryption key to that
users credentials database this not only
allows one card to work on multiple
minis but also multiple people to share
one mini and even if you're not using
Chrome or Firefox you can still use your
mini to log you in it can behave like a
keyboard and type your logins and
passwords for you on any computer tablet
or smartphone for the last six months 50
beta testers from around the globe have
been using multi pass minis and
providing us with invaluable feedback as
a result the multi pass mini Hardware
went through three iterations and is now
finalized we are confident you will love
it
by October 3rd we received Cee and FCC
certifications which means that Minnie's
can be shipped the world over our vision
for multipaths is to give users the best
of both words first-class security and
the simplicity of a single pin number
and while the multipass core team is
located here in Switzerland hundreds of
people from around the globe with you
and contribute to our project the
complete solution is open source the
wizards of years of work and
interactions with our users now we need
your help in order to fund our second
Mujib as mass production run and deliver
the multipass mini to the hands of
everyone
