I am Anthony and I'm Luke and we are the
creators of torch the Universal Co
heater I came up with the idea for torch
a few years ago when I was flying to
northern Michigan for my little
brother's wedding in December now
there's a saying that we have out there
there's no such thing as being cold only
being unprepared so I didn't want to
show up to the wedding is something huge
and bulky so I started looking around
for a heater that I could put in the
coat that I had and to my surprise there
wasn't anything out there
that's when I called up my old friend
Luke from engineering school and we
started developing torch
what makes torch so special is that it's
thin and flexible enough to be installed
in almost any coat and it transfers
between coats in seconds the torch unit
comes with the torch Co heater itself a
battery a charger and multiple
installation kits the torch has four
heat settings and can last for up to
five hours on a single charge over the
past two years we have developed torch
with our own money and we've already
manufactured our first run of functional
prototypes in order to make torch a
success we need your help to complete
the patent process and manufacture our
full-scale production run to bring to
market we are excited about the future
and we know that together we can make
torch a success well I know those
okay easy because either
okay and it's gotten old
I like it it's very very comfortable is
nice I mean actually this thing here for
the head is quite nice love to keep it
imagine to happen on the beach with a
lovely nipple get those for when drinks
fall chaos ensues we've all been there
spilling our wine beer scotch or
favorite drink and the more we drink the
more likely we are to knock them over
after exhaustive research and lots of
wasted alcohol we set out to create the
first bar where that won't fall
we are happy to introduce the
revolutionary mighty mug bar where line
able to withstand knocks from 360
degrees so you can say goodbye to
staining your carpets pants and making a
mess and get back to enjoying your
relaxation time grips to any smooth and
solid surface such as your table desk
counter or bar the magic is in our
patented smart grip technology which
allows my tea mug to grip when hit but
lifts when you need a sip once placed
down mighty mug creates a powerful
airlock within its base in this position
you are protected against any accidental
knocks and bumps constructed of
crystal-clear BPA free Tritan plastic
for enhanced clarity mighty mug bar
where is virtually unbreakable and his
top rack dishwasher safe for easy
cleaning after launching our travel mug
last year and receiving press from
around the world many asked us for a
mighty mug to enjoy their adult
beverages so we got to work designing 3d
printing and crafting the greatest
barware line ever for entertaining at
home on a boat in your RV by your pool
and even by the edge of your bathtub
mighty mug bar where will instantly
amaze and wow you quickly becoming your
go-to for drink time we have completed
the development process and all
manufacturing tooling is being finalized
at this time
backers can choose from a group of
awesome rewards whether the party has
begun to wind down or the tides have
gotten choppy you might not still be
standing but your mighty mug will thank
you for watching and be mighty hi my
