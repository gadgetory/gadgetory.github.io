and drinking clean water but what about
the air you breathe do you realize that
you actually ingest 12 times more air
than food and five times more than water
introducing the supremo personal air
monitor a keychain sized air monitor
that plugs into your iphone and lets you
see what you smell the app gives you
real-time readings from temperature
humidity and air quality based on
precision measurements of volatile
organic compounds a coloring number
scale tells you the quality of the air
around you opt into our community and
share your results and contribute to a
worldwide real-time air quality map we
are constantly surrounded by toxins in
the air around us from common products
like cleaners and dirty clothes to smog
pollution secondhand smoke paint and pet
waste the most obvious results are the
one in twelve people who suffer from
asthma or the more than half of
Americans who live in areas with
unhealthy air quality but in reality
almost everyone is subjected to poor air
quality at some point during the day
Premal can monitor your air wherever you
are or confirm your suspicions so you
can do something about it
hello my name is dr. TJ Osborn you know
after 23 years in practice one of the
things that I have found out that it
separates sick people from healthy
people is that healthy people know their
numbers if you don't know your blood
pressure you're gonna have heart issues
if you don't know the numbers about
what's in the air that you breathe
you're gonna have breathing issues
that's why I find that a personal air
monitor is absolutely required for
people to be healthy Spri mo keeps you
informed whether you're at work home
school
outside a bar salon restaurant or the
airport spree Mo was founded by Ray
combs and Harold Hahn Ray has helped
bring about products like the Palm Pilot
and Amazon Kindle and is passionate
about improving indoor air quality to
help his son who has asthma Harold has
been studying chemistry for years at New
York University where he got his PhD and
hails from China where air pollution in
many cities makes it impossible to go
outside thus primo air monitor lets you
be fully aware of those deep breaths
you're taking in spree mo is helping
people breathe easy wow they're so great
today okay everyone let's take a deep
breath
it is incredible how much we rely on
weather forecasts and so-called local
temperatures the truth is that those
values available online or through apps
come from weather stations that can
easily be dozens of miles away
nothing beats measuring the values by
yourself right where you are but that's
just not possible and silly so we have
created the world's smallest a weather
station that can easily fit in your palm
simply plug weather point into your
device and start the app simple as that
it consists of four sensors for
temperature humidity atmospheric
pressure and ultraviolet radiation with
this information you can have the most
accurate weather forecast anywhere you
are also by measuring atmospheric
pressure you can know you altitude more
precisely than GPS devices you can also
measure UV radiation and limit your
exposure to these harmful UV rays the
housing is made from aluminium and
titanium and ensures longer life time
when you're not using weather point it
is safely placed on your keychain so you
don't have to worry about losing it
whether point doesn't use a battery well
who likes them anyway it doesn't even
require internet connection but building
hardware is costly we invested a lot of
resources into making weather point
possible and now we need your support to
make it available and affordable for
everyone thank you I'd like to introduce
you all to a very exciting and
interesting thing
now I've put a lot of thought and
research into ways of seeing small and
delicate things with the naked eye as
you can see traditional microscopes are
big and heavy they can only be used in
certain places but now the perfect
microscope has been invented let me
introduce you to the new guru go
microscope it's very easy to use you can
just mount on the back of your
smartphone there are no cords and no
additional batteries since it's a small
microscope you can utilize it anywhere
and anytime now let's take a look at
this small microscopes amazing
performance as you can see here well
can't be seen with the naked eye can
easily be verified with this product and
the image is high resolution compared to
other microscopes let's take a closer
look it's astonishing how this small
microscope can enlarge the target by up
to 400 times its original size
the nurugo microscope not only can it be
use for research and education but it
can also be utilized in fields that
require a microscope such as work and
everyday lives the two key factors for
producing the high-resolution image are
the lens and the lighting the lens is
capable of enlarging the target by up to
400 times its original size and this
lighting technology has also been
patented you can also get video without
any additional batteries or cables
everyone had an amazing response when I
upload the videos and images taken by an
arugula microscope on SNS if you simply
and easily want the best results
anywhere and anytime
narubu microscope is the answer I really
like my new Rugal microscope new Duggal
microscope will be your new eyes expand
your horizon change your world
this tiny lens is the only one for
expanding your world
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
