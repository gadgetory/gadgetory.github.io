person's most basic tool
it carries a person's identity money
business and for an object that carries
such precious things I want someone to
take pride in what they're caring
we sorted dango to take every day
products and breathe new life in them
but we want to really do it through
materials different manufacturing
processes taking it and really kind of
pushing it over the top along with
quality I wanted to offer some
functionality to the wallet so we wanted
to offer a multi-tool that has more than
ten functions
as the world becomes cashless cards are
now our primary way of paying our
wallets become cluttered with an array
of different types of cards all for
different purposes
from credit cards to loyalty cards
that's why we have created the pitaka
card holder it's stylish sleek and slim
design enables you to store all your
cards in one place small enough to fit
into your shirt pocket with no
mechanical parts and thanks to the
magnetic mechanism the pitaka card
holder can be opened with one hand for
maximum ease and comfort once open
easily access the card you need use it
and simply place back into the holder
saving you time it's magnetic modular
design enables you to add as many cards
as you like
ensuring cards will not fall out of
place by using carbon fiber and enhanced
by our proprietary arraignment core
technology we ensure the durability and
reliability thanks to the unique design
and special customized high-speed
cutting tool it ensures the cards will
not fall off from the holder even if
they're facing downside the new pitaka
card holder stay slim stay simple
you
hi my name is Arthur Wu and I'm the
founder of radix products and I want to
show you something I designed called the
radix one Riddick's one is a slim wallet
that replaces large bulky and cumbersome
wallets
I had always carried a thick wallet in
my back pocket and never thought it was
a problem I've also always suffer from
lower back pain during a visit to the
chiropractor I was told that having a
big fat wallet in my back pocket was
contributing to a tilt of my pelvis
causing me to lean more on one side than
the other this was a contributor to my
back pain moving my wallet to the front
pocket belt but now had a giant
uncomfortable wallet in my front pocket
this led me on my quest for a slim
wallet the design is fairly simple the
silicone van wraps around two
polycarbonate parts sandwich credit
cards and ID's in the middle the band
also acts as a money clip and holds cash
on the outside the wallet is designed to
hold four to ten cards comfortably
having a silicone band means that the
wallet will keep its tension and not
stretch out over time having parts that
are injection molded and compression
molded means I can lower the price to
increase the value for customers there
have been many iterations of design and
I'm confident that we have a great
product on our hand
you
