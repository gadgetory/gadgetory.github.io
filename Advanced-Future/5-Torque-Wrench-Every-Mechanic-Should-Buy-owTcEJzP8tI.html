usually too small for most hands to
easily attach conduit connectors
traditional methods of attaching lock
nuts like a screwdriver pliers or
fingers don't work klein tools conduit
lock nut wrench turns a complicated
operation into an easy to hand task
perfect for hard-to-reach half inch and
three quarter inch connectors this lock
nut wrench works in deep or tight boxes
where pliers and fingers can't the
patent-pending driveshaft design lets
you easily loosen and tighten conduit
connectors using a stationary twisting
motion heavy-duty steel construction
enables needed torque to loosen or
tighten connectors the innovative
conduit lock nut wrench lets you work
smarter not harder
when installing lock nuts Klein tools
for the professional tradesperson since
1857
talk leader applying tools are used to
deliver a set talk to a fastener three
types of mechanism are used to alert the
operator that the set talk has been
achieved these are slipping breaking or
clicking slipping torque wrenches and
torque screwdrivers provide a guarantee
that the set talk cannot be exceeded
when the set torque value is reached the
tool slips free for a short time until
resetting occurs slipping tools are
ideal for high quality assembly
operations where application of the
correct torque is essential accurate
process control is ensured by
eliminating both under and over
tightening through use of the proven
talk leader slipping technology the
tightening torque is not influenced by
the operators hand position reducing the
likelihood of warranty and rework
through incorrect tightening braking
tools are ideal for production line use
where the ability to fit spanner
accessories make them extremely
versatile talk leaders unique 20 degree
braking mechanism gives the user both
movement and reaction time once the
target torque is reached reducing the
risk of both over and under tightening
braking wrenches maximize productivity
in restricted space applications through
their compact slimline design tall
replacements and downtime costs are
minimized through a long-lasting durable
design proven by talk leaders rigorous
lifecycle testing process
click tools are designed for the lower
volume user where economy is of
paramount importance when the set talk
value is reached the operator will hear
a click
feel an impulse and there'll be
approximately three degrees of tall
movements this small angle of movement
provides a very short reaction time
between click and over-tighten so the
tool needs to be used slowly and
carefully continued application of force
after the three degrees of movement will
cause the torque applied to increase
above the required limit click tools are
also length dependent the position of
the hand on the tool alters the torque
produced so the operator has a
significant influence over the
tightening process particularly below
100 Newton meters for more information

hey this is Brennan from Tecton here to
show you how to use the Tecton 24 330
3/8 inch drive torque wrench first the
torque wrench has a two-piece scale with
the main scale on the handle body and
the micrometer on the knurled handle to
set the torque wrench loosen the lock
nut at the end of the handle this torque
wrench has increments of 5 foot-pounds
on the main scale and 1 foot pound on
the micrometer I'll be tightening the
header bolts on our engine which has a
manufacturer's torque setting of 25
foot-pounds to set the torque wrench to
25 foot-pounds turn the knurled handle
so that zero is on the bottom of 25 lock
the torque setting
tightening the locknut then you are
ready to go it is important to use a
torque wrench slowly and steady so you
do not miss the torque setting you want
when the desired torque setting is
reached you will hear a click
do not continue to move the torque
wrench after you hear the click or you
can over tighten the nut or bolt when
you are finished make sure you store the
torque wrench at the lowest setting to
maintain accuracy introducing two new
electronic torque wrenches from
gearwrench the 3/8 inch drive eight five
zero seven six and the half-inch drive
eight five zero seven seven these new
electronic torque wrenches make
extremely accurate tightening easy
because they're flashing visual and
keeping audible alerts let you know
before you reach the target room so
there's less chance of over torquing
fasteners and the vibrating handle
confirms you've reached the torque
settings electronic torque wrenches are
different from beam and micrometer style
torque wrenches and weights many text by
beautiful they're more accurate these
new key wrench models are plus or minus
two percent accurate and clockwise
orientation and plus or minus 3% counter
clockwise they're more versatile they
switch from foot counts and Newton
meters to inch pounds and more at the
touch of a button different scales don't
require different wrenches there's no
unwinding after each use since their
electronic not mechanical there's no
need to reset the spring back to its at
rest position you simply switch the
power off they're more resistant to
low-level shock even slight impacts can
destroy the calibration on micrometer
torque wrenches minor shocks generally
do not affect electronic torque wrenches
but probably the biggest reason why
electronic torque wrenches are gaining
in popularity is their ease of use setup
is quick and tightening faster to the
correct torque is easier so you can get
more done in less time
here's how easy it is to use the new
electronic torque wrenches from
gearwrench first press the power button
to turn the wrench on the numeric
display will appear it's important you
don't apply any torque pressure to the
wrench during setup select your
preferred unit of measurement by
scrolling through your choices using the
unit button these new wrenches offer
five choices foot-pounds Newton meters
or inch pounds are the most popular your
choice will stay in the wrench memory
until you change it now you can set your
target or press the set button scroll up
or down to get the right torque then
press set again to lock in your choice
again this number will stay in the
wrench memory until you change it you've
selected your unit of measurement and
target torque so now you get to decide
how close to the target sorts you want
the flashing LED and audible beep alerts
to start this is called the target
torque alert and there is no correct
setting it depends on your personal
preference and working style for example
if your target torque is 80 foot pounds
and you want the alerts to start when
you're halfway there at 40 foot-pounds
you simply set the target torque alert
to 50% but if you don't want the visual
and audible alerts to start until you're
much closer to your target torque you
might select 25% then the alerts won't
start until you hit 60 foot-pounds set
the target torque alert by first
pressing the % button using the up or
down arrow buttons scroll to the target
torque alert you prefer then press the %
button again to lock in your choice now
you can go to work here we've set our
target torque with 75 foot-pounds with
the torque alert at 15% as a target
torque is approached the visual and
audible alerts begin once a target has
been reached
both alerts turn continuous
and the handle vibrates the 3/8 in half
inch drive electronic torque wrenches
come with a gearwrench one-year limited
warranty and a 90-day calibration
guaranteed</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
