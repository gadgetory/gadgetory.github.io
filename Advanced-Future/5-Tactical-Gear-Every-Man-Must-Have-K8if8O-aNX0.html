protection system is the world's first
fully integrated mission modular
protection system designed engineered
and tested to protect from blunt impact
blast fragmentation and ballistic
threats the head protection system
enables quick armor up and down and
strikes the ideal balance between
protection and lethality revisions
helmet shells utilize high-tech
composite technology the shells are
lightweight and deliver advanced
protection that exceeds military grade
testing requirements inside the helmet
shell the fully adjustable modular
suspension system an adjustable
retention system maximize comfort and
stability the modular protection
attachment system consists of a
multi-purpose front mount rail system
three position visor and ballistic
mandible guard all designed to fit a CH
style helmets the system can be worn in
any combination with each component
seamlessly integrating with the next the
front mount is a lightweight
multi-purpose nvg mount featuring a snag
free design it is the platform to armor
up in high threat situations for
enhanced ability the front mount has
three attachment points that align with
the existing holes of the ACH 2 helmet
rail systems are available interlocking
long rails and standalone long rails
both fit flush with the helmets
curvature and are available in four
sizes to ensure optimal fit with the
helmet interlocking long rails
interconnect seamlessly with the front
mount and can be used simultaneously
with the visor and mandible guard stand
alone long rails function independently
and work with commonly used nvg mounts
head born accessories such as a camera
or light can be quickly attached to the
helmet by sliding the device onto the
rails the three position visor provides
high impact protection while offering
maximum field of view and flawless
optics the visor easily clips into the
front mount with a simple one-handed
movement its unique pivot arm allows for
three in-service positions up for
maximum ventilation vented for cooling
and airflow and locked in the down
position for full-face maximum ballistic
protection the visors smaller mechanism
has been refined for an improved seal
against the helmet and mandible keeping
out water dust and fragments
additionally revisions advanced coatings
provide best-in-class anti fog and anti
scratch protection the mandible guard
offers protection for the lower face and
jaw it is available in two options a
ballistic mandible guard or a wireframe
mandible guard the ballistic mandible
guard provides maximum ballistic
protection across the entire surface
area the wireframe mandible guard
provides non ballistic impact and blunt
force protection the mandible guard has
been specially designed for a full range
of motion allowing for maximum
situational awareness two buttons on
either side allow the mandible guard to
be tilted downwards at varying degrees
for improved sight compatibility night
vision device use airflow eating and
drinking pushing the mandible against
the chest provides a quick hands-free
way of returning the mandible guard back
to its original position
the mandible guard strapless design
enables rapid attachment and removal
when wearing the mandible guard certain
weapons sighting techniques may require
adjustment by rotating your weapon at a
45 degree angle and tilting your head
you can maintain a laser object field of
view for targets up to 100 metres
together these components create a fully
integrated and modular head protection
system that delivers best-in-class
protection from blunt impact blast
fragmentation and ballistic threats
soldiers and law enforcement officers
around the world can count on revision
for the ultimate head and face
protection
this is the Schrade SC pen 400 tactical
survival pen one of several models in
the Shrey tactical pen series designed
to hold up under adverse conditions the
SC pen 4'o manufactured from CNC machine
6061-t6 aluminum can be used to write
whistle for help
start a fire and for self-defense in
emergency situations to write with a pen
unscrew the whistle cap to prevent loss
screw the cap back on the opposite end
of the pen to store the cap while the
pen is in use blow through the cap to
signal for help the whistle works best
when the cap is removed from the Pens
body to use the fire striker
simply unscrew the striker plate from
the tip end of the pen shaft by turning
clockwise rethread the striker plate
back into the end of the pen shaft with
the striker plate exposed once ready
unscrew the middle of the body of the
pen to expose the ferrule ride to cast
sparks remove the black protective
coating on the Ferro rod apply modest
pressure and quickly sly the striker
plate down the Ferro rod in an emergency

I'm dr. Chad walk designer the essayist
activist ababil beau and the owner of
survival artery systems after 15 years
as an automotive design engineer I knew
it would require all my engineering
expertise and practical experience in
the field I started out with a concept
that packed down to the old critical 21
inches was able to store take down
arrows inside the riser and was truly
ambidextrous my engineering calculations
proved that a thin walled riser was
actually stronger than a solid riser of
reduced cross sectional area next I had
to find a way to get a 21 inch bow to
extend to 60 inches which is a great non
stacking bowline I achieved this by
using over center folding brackets that
gave the bow an additional four inches
now that I had a workable shape I
reduced the weight to the extreme using
some very intense engineering analysis
to ensure it was designed for what we
call infinite life which basically means
the bow can theoretically lost more than
500 million shots to achieve the power I
needed I chose a deep flex composite
fiber from the same company that does
all the big names in the industry when
the first prototype came in and we took
that first shot we knew we had a winner
in our hands after 18 months of
development it was the exact product I'd
hoped for I never actually intended to
sell it but there's an ex-special forces
friend of mine said to me people who
know what they are doing or the type of
people who are quickly gonna realize
just how valuable and well thought out
this bow is
you need to put this on the market and
thus was born the SAS tactical survival
bar with features like a 21 inch
aerospace grade aluminum riser that is
treated to reduce glare and allow for
excellent paint adhesion a symmetrical
grip with surprisingly economic shape
allowing for the only truly ambidextrous
survival bow on the market aerospace
grade folding brackets with an over
Center action extend the bow to 60
inches yet allow for super compactors
the bow actually fits in most day packs
it will down Lodge dear the Ronin is the
first commercial fully enclosed 3/8
ballistic helmet weighing in at four
point eight five pounds and offering 80%
of ballistic protection to the head the
Gentoo Ronin is a full Kevlar shell
equipped with seven millimeter ballistic
plates or a full mandible the panels are
bolted on and supplemented by powerful
and 15-year denim magnets replaceable
polycarbonate lenses with built in micro
jet fans keep condensation from
collecting creating an instant de
fogging system housed with a speed
regulator and switchable forward and
reverse air flow create a condo a fact
mounting accessories include a
night-vision base picatinny rails and
future informational displays the
extender allows for custom sizing using
screws to adjust distance for larger
heads the Ronin is multifunctional and
at the forefront of additional
protection to our soldiers and law
enforcement death attack the future of
tactical this is the ding-dong breaching
tool a sledgehammer a battering ram a
pry bar
all three are essential breaching tools
for operators who need to get through
doors quickly the ding dong combines
these three tools into one tight package
the hammer head features machined cross
hatching that effectively bites into
doors and other surfaces as you smash
into them minimizing slip and maximizing
impact the pry bar at the end of the
handle is perfect for wedging into door
frames the Ding Dongs fiberglass handle
features two molded rings equally spaced
to create mechanical stops for the
operators hands ensuring a solid grip
when Ram
into or swinging at objects the dingdong
comes with the unique mounting system a
fiberglass plate that mounts to MOLLE
compatible gear mechanical snaps in a
heavy rubber strap keep it in place
proudly built in Portland Oregon for
