inventor of the ideal concealed pistol
also known as the cellphone pistol and
that's because it takes the shape of an
ordinary smartphone and allows a pistol
to hide in plain sight
you
the mission and ideal conceal was to
make a pistol that could be carried the
same as a traditional smartphone this
would be the ideal conceal in its
holster basically to use it you open it
depress the safety
what's the handle will deploy and then
it's actually ready to be used to reload
it or load it you simply open it that
way place two shelves in there close it
latch it because this youth gun also has
hard sights on it which some of the
other very small pistols did not have we
wanted to have people have a way to cite
it in the future this area here will be
able to carry a small laser so we're
doing all the things that are necessary
to make a really great pistol but also
to conceal it very easily you should
invest an ideal conceal because it will
essentially help to get this product out
on a worldwide basis very quickly and
our goal here is to help people protect
themselves so we invented the ideal
concealed pistol so that you can carry a
pistol for self-defense and not have to
have it be difficult on you ideal
conceal carry the revolution salt is a
gun but it's not like any gun that
you've ever seen it was designed around
the belief that a firearm shouldn't have
to take a life in order to protect a
life from that simple idea we started by
completely rethinking the bullet instead
of LED salt was designed to shoot a
specialized round filled with powerful
toxin
- instead of killing the target salt
opens up on impact in a cloud it
instantly causes respiratory and visual
distress so while an intruder or a
curious child will be incapacitated
encounter wouldn't be fatal
this rethink also lets salt be used not
only offensively but defensively as well
so if an intruder is kicking down your
door solve allows you to shoot the area
around it before the danger is on top of
you this creates a protective cloud of
toxin between you and the intruder
before he's ever a threat to you or your
family our last big idea was to make
salt easy to use for everyone so we
replace the violent bang of black powder
with a silent power of compressed air
the result is a fear free user
experience so the only person that
should have anything to be scared of is
an intruder and that's all a safe gun
for a safe home so now all we need is
you the testing the Rd the prototyping
is all done and we're ready to begin
production but salt can't be made
without you without all of us really
wanting a better way to keep the people
we love safe so if you're is intrigued
by the ideas as we are we'd love to make
you one just click our support button
and together we can make the world just
a little bit safer at the end of the
last century a revolutionary pulse
energy weapon called the advanced taser
m26 was created to take away your
control the impulses can infiltrate your
whole network
hits anywhere on the body stopping even
subjects under the influence of hyper
stimulants PCP cocaine or meth
amphetamines the m26 has been used to
safely subdue emotionally disturbed
persons save suicidal subjects control
the hopsicle drivers incapacitate
dangerous subjects safely and armed
standoff
and even rescue hostages the special NX
phaser can even stop aggressive large
animals without injury the most powerful
less lethal weapon ever developed the
m26 is now deployed by over 2,500 police
agencies the m26 has reduced injuries to
officers by up to 80% the m26 has saved
millions of dollars in litigation and it
has saved over a thousand lives
the salvo 12 contains a system of rods
and baffles to contain the blast of a
shotgun
the rods allow gas to escape into the
baffles while preserving the function of
the wad after it exits the barrel
the modular system of Rods baffles and
caps allows for the customization of the
salvo 12 depending on your desired
weight and noise reduction specs this
also allows for easy cleaning of the
suppressor we have seen significant
reduction in decibel levels making the
blast of a shotgun quieter than an
unsuppressed 22 rifle the salvo 12 also
significantly improves the perceived
recoil of a shotgun making shooting a
more enjoyable experience for all the
salvo 12 attaches to your shotgun
through a removable choke system a
variety of chokes are available to fit
your specific weapon here's a standard
weapon the alternative within seconds is
easily mounted to the top of the weapon
there is no obstruction to the sight
picture for the operator and there's no
obstruction to the functionality of the
weapon or the rail system it still
allows an officer the ability to attach
a flashlight on their weapons once the
weapon is fired the bullet travels down
the barrel embedding itself inside the
alloy projectile with no chance of
escaping instantly becoming one solid
unit the projectile immediately
separates from the weapon as the docking
unit is instantly ejected then a new
bullet is cycled in for follow-up shots
if necessary the alternative is as
accurate as the operator using it once
the projectile impacts the threat it
will send a shock wave of pain to the
suspect without the internal damage that
a penetrating bullet would cause and now
here's a simulation of police training
and when to utilize the alternative
stop it
