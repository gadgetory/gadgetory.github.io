men's foodini jacket many of us use RFID
technology in our daily lives these
digital key cards often provide easy and
convenient access to all of the places
that we frequent on a regular basis our
home office parking structure
pool etc but until now there's been no
easy way to copy Beach devices leaving
you vulnerable to expensive fees should
you lose one and inconveniencing you
when you need to share access with a
spouse friend housekeeper or dog walker
and having a different key card for each
location can be a hassle enter Kesey a
small device that fits on your keyring
allowing you to copy up to four RFID
devices the process of copying an RFID
credential onto Kesey is simple first
hold down the button you would like to
copy the RFID credential to when the LED
light turns red simply hold key Z over
the key fob or keycard
the LED will blink red while Kesey is
reading the device when the process is
complete the LED will turn green to use
it simply press the button near the
reader and it will work just like the
original easy works with the most
popular low frequency RFID devices from
many manufacturers using different
protocols and if you move or no longer
need access to an RFID credential you
can simply reprogram that button to copy
another device and if you need to give
access to anyone it's as easy as holding
your Kesey to theirs and holding down
the button the simplicity and
convenience moves with you GZ the RFID

Saltzman let's face it as much as we
love our smartphones and tablets they're
not the most ideal for typing on for a
long time whether you need to type up a
document for work or school making lots
of notes or writing lengthy replies to
email messages but on the flip side not
everyone wants to bring a bulky external
keyboard around either especially when
you're in a coffee shop like this that's
why I love the idea of a virtual
keyboard if you haven't seen these
futuristic accessories that protect a
QWERTY keyboard onto the table or desk
in front of you and through Bluetooth
connectivity the words wirelessly show
up on your touchscreen device as you
type it's pretty while so there's two
different products on the market that I
wanted to put to the test
the VK 200 virtual laser keyboard from
CTX technologies and the epoch from
cellulite both claim to do the same
thing but there's a clear winner let's
see how they stack up first up sighs as
you can see the VK 200 and epic are
basically the same size the VK 200 is
around 15% smaller and lighter but not
much of a difference overall more
importantly though the keyboards are
very different as you can see the epic
keyboard isn't too epic
not only is it somewhat blurry and not
that easy to see in a bright environment
but it's smaller than a typical keyboard
which means your fingers are sort of
bunched up the keys are not laid out in
a typical keyboard fashion either
there's also no function keys the VK to
hundreds keyboard on the other hand has
78 keys instead of 68 on the epic and
it's much wider to give more separation
between characters which makes it look
and feel more like a normal keyboard
the VK 200 also has function keys along
with familiar Windows and Mac keys for
shortcuts and there's multimedia keys as
well for wirelessly controlling your
music on a nearby smartphone or tablet
perhaps most importantly the VK 200 is
more accurate than the celluloid
keyboard and it allows for faster typing
without missing a key I also love the
home row option so you can keep your
fingers rested on the home row even
giving an audible warning if your
fingers drift along with a virtual mouse
mode - which is a great idea unlike the
epic the BK 200 has an oled screen to
show you information like the last three
characters you typed battery status
along with menu options and settings and
more
next up battery the BK 200 can be used
for up to three hours compared to just
two hours with the epic that's a big
difference and finally let's talk about
added features while connected to a PC
you can update the VK to hundreds
firmware to add new features and better
functions over time the epic cannot do
this
the VK 200 has typing games to sharpen
your skills it also has a little hole in
the top corner as you can see to easily
attach it to a key chain by the way CTX
also has a VK 200 model with a green
projector which might cost a little bit
more but as twice as bright as red more
pleasing to the eye in my opinion and
comes with a protective case as well the
price is comparable between the two but
the VK 200 from CTX technologies
outperforms the celluloid epic in
performance battery versatility and
added features if you're looking for a
compact keyboard that you can bring with
you wherever life takes you pick up the
VK 200 virtual laser keyboard I'm Marc
