Scott come Fuhrman founder of clinically
fit the developers of the extensor first
thank you for buying our product I want
to take a few minutes to show you
exactly how this device works and help
you make the most out of using it you're
going to notice that the in your bag
they're going to be a series of finger
bands in three different sizes the
device fits on both of your hands with
the blue thumb bands fitting on either
one of your hands first thing you want
to do is find the bands that fit most
suitable to your fingers place them in
the device and then slowly a few times
for each one going through the motion of
prestretching your finger bands which is
going to activate the elasticity in
these bands making it a little bit
softer and a little easier to use next
you're going to notice that there's a
grid on here and this grid has three
different rows that allow you to
increase or decrease tension for each
one of your fingers individually the
first thing we're going to do is place a
device on it slips on either hand and
like a glove and just by sticking your
fingers in these bands both the blue and
the gray securing the strap to your
wrist
you'll be ready to go make sure that you
seek approval from your physician if you
have any kind of a condition before
beginning any exercise program
by incorporating all of these different
exercises each time you use them the
device will help you overall just
increase the overall fitness in your
hands your wrists and your elbows now
the device is meant to be used for no
more than a few minutes a day a few days
a week we certainly don't want to get
into creating an overused problem while
we're trying to heal an overuse issue
for those of you out there that may have
a hard time because whatever reason is
your hands are in a very weakened state
you can start out with three bands two
bands or even one and allow your whole
hand to get stronger over time and allow
yourself to improve and the device will
grow with you and when you feel
comfortable you can add that second band
the third band and the fourth and then
eventually incorporate increasing
tension into this grid again thank you
for buying our product we think it's
going to do a great job at helping you
become more effective in using your
hands your wrists and your elbows it's
really going to help to decrease pain
just follow the instructions again a few
minutes a day just a few days a week and
you will get the results that you need
this is a camera a band with two HD
cameras that connects to your watch
was that our train with a self facing
camera quick question what's hammer your
parents coming over for photos and video
chat seven so you know 6:30 I'll be
ready

facing camera
