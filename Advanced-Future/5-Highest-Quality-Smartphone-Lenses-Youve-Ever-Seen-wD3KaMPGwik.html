I would say that my journey with
photography started when I was a kid
every summer my dad would would get me
one of those little 27 shot disposable
cameras and I'd have one last all summer
you know as I grew and continued to love
photography what I found is that my gear
bag grew my cameras got more expensive I
was able to shoot
absolutely stunning images but it all
came a cost and that cost was simplicity
the iPhone came along and it changed
that for me it brought it back to the
beginning in almost a poetic way that it
wasn't about the gear anymore it was
back to the simplicity of just composing
an image and capturing it
chase Jarvis the photographer said the
best camera you have is the camera you
have with you that's a perfect way to
describe the iPhone when Apple came
along and challenged us to create the
best ever lens for an iPhone I knew that
it was time to call Zeiss life flies by
you and is made up of these little
moments that only happened once and then
they're gone
for me photography allows me to capture
that moment and not just have it but to
relive it in a way that's unique to me
and I think that's why I've continued to
have a love affair with photography and
I think I always will

actually got the very very first iPhone
when it came out I can't remember the
exact thing but there was something like
kill their deal with our plan at the
time our whole fam got the did Jin won
so I'm an OG camera like on that one Oh
probably trash I wasn't even shooting
photos then that was like my freshman
year of high school mm like eight or
something almost 10 years ago now yeah I
like the color if it is fall it's
officially fall sweet we got the 8 plus
I think I think I listed a silver it
looks white to me in but you know but
yeah the silver I've had the phone for
about like 16 hours now I just activated
it yesterday so it's like it's like a
fresh test right now
what the iPhone does for me is it just
brings down like you it's just
photography it as simple as form it's
just point and like shoot you can keep
it that simple and it's cool to show
people like you have the exact same
camera I'm like you can do it too
with the eight plus I'm super excited
about the portrait mode on it just
because it's a lot better than the last
one oh this is my first time using it so
like 30 seconds and so far so good it's
a lot better than the beta yeah I really
enjoy using the 18 the most just because
it's a great focal length at the 18 the
wide just getting a few little snippets
of the scene and with the seven plus in
the eight plus like now that you have
both of those lenses it's cool to take
the 18 and throw them on both because
you can have like you know the 18 wide
but if you throw the 18 on the telephoto
it almost makes it like a equivalent of
like a 35 millimeter
all right some tips some tips I am such
a sucker for composition and I think the
best way to get good at composition is
prime lenses which I mean works perfect
with the moment lenses work spur cooler
than any camera and it also - if its
prime and you have less moving parts
it's going to be a lot more quality of
an image
