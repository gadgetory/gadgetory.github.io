ride with an at-home carwash that's as
good as any professional cleaning all
you need is a foam master cleaning
sprayer the perfect all-around tool for
cleaning degreasing and disinfecting
your vehicle it's even distribution of
foam ensures the most controlled scratch
free wash possible putting your cleaning
sprayer together is a breeze simply pour
the cleaning solution into the easy to
fill mouth of the tank next connect the
tank to the sprayer and the nozzle to
the hose finish by attaching the sprayer
to the nozzle to choose how much
solution you want to release adjust the
dial setting turn the dial to a to
release the lowest concentration of
cleaning solution for the highest
concentration turn the dial to eat once
you're set you can start cleaning to
rinse simply disconnect the sprayer and
tank before you spray taking care of
jobs the clean and easy way that's a
better day this is the rapid xx5 and x12
high-speed car chargers the x5 charges
up to five devices twice as fast as
regular chargers the two front ports use
something called intelligent recognition
to read your devices in charge
accordingly sending out up to 2.4 amps
they power devices almost twice as fast
as your average wall charger with a
five-foot cable the x5 easily extends to
the back seat providing a steady stream
of 2 amps to each of the three back
ports that's enough power to charge a
phone tablet and handheld gaming device
all at the same time with the x5 charger
everyone can claim a port and get a full
battery fast if you're more of a solo
driver Rapid X also makes the x1 with a
single lightning connector that charges
an Apple device at twice the speed
whether you need to charge a single
device or a whole group if you drive
chances are you've got a speeding ticket
and let's be honest
some of you more than others don't worry
we get it you're important you're super
important
your slow motion tossing your hair in
the wind important and you got to get
there 42 seconds earlier I get it me too
the thing is you're not and speeding
that's some serious stuff
fact is we spend eight billion dollars a
year on speeding tickets and that's just
in North America this stops now that's
why we designed trapped up this round
little Marvel can save your life as you
see all right
you're trapped up and notify your
potential driving on Earth's such as red
light cameras and school zones by
flashing red I'll leave them flash green
to let you know when you're speeding
also this little guy flashes blue for
those hidden speed traps and camera
crews we rely on you and everyone else
to help find those around your city when
you see a speed trap and you're trapped
tap doesn't light up it means you're the
first one to find it you're like a
modern-day Columbus it's tapped twice
and boom you just saved everyone cash
possibly a life sounds like that could
be annoying right no it's not just tap
the device once while it's lit up to
silence it I think the speed trap is no
longer there double tap to remove the
alert and update the community thinking
about studying fake alerts don't bother
we have algorithms to prevent false
positives that's fancy talk for it won't
work I know what you think Scotty I
already have now why do I need this good
thing they're easy to use I'm not
distracting at all
and yes you know there are other maps
and apps that can help you too
problem is they're confusing and
dangerous to use so dangerous they force
you to take your eyes off the road now
this this is easy and safe all right
let's say your car isn't available and
you need to use your friends right you
can't take that fancy now system with
you with trap tap it's simple to change
cars just pick it up and move it what's
that is the attachment wrapped app to
your bike and you're ready to ride so
let's be real we want you to be safe and
lower the amount of money you waste on
speeding tickets so you can continue to
do the things
we are trapped at you're not so annoying
that backseat driver
hello again empty fastest route found -
early bird cafe you and me we're busy
people and being busy means checking
your phone even when you're not supposed
to even when you're on the road but now
there's Navi hold on we gotta get this
KC talk to me hey Adam quick reminder
first thing today about coffee with
Connie and Greg at the earlybird already
on my way
see what's brilliant about navdy is this
master route phone automatically
rerouting to save ten minutes
perfect never been this way before I'm
gonna switch to Navi - see what's so
brilliant about Navitus it's display is
focused in the distance so your eyes are
never off the road it's also 40 times
brighter than your smartphone and it
dims automatically so it's easy to see
day or night in fact sorry gotta take
this one - Greg and I actually want to
do Birds cafe out on 60 - smiley face Oh
awesome
luckily Royce is one of my favorites
Abdi uses Google Maps and built-in
offline maps so you'll never get lost
like out here in the desert and it's
connected to your car which means that
gas rerouting - nearest gas station text
Connie be there in 15
