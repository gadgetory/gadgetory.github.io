and by doing it we're learning what
learning what the right answers are
there are a lot of robots out there that
will take one step and put one step in
from the other but they take a huge
amount of energy to do it or any small
disturbance so these robots that are
just sort of demonstrations will follow
from the fair there's only a few robots
they're even close to Cassie as far as
being able to dynamically walk around
having only two legs is a much more
complicated problem that we don't fully
understand yet as compared to four legs
you know a biped and you can think of a
two-legged table is not gonna be very
stable so there's a lot you have to do
there you really have to move your feet
around if you think about any sort of
disaster scenario where they say do we
have any robots that can go into this
space the answer is always not yet
imagine you've got a fire building and
the fire chief isn't really sure if
somebody's still in the building
and they have to make a difficult
decision about whether they're gonna
send one of their firefighters in this
is dangerous if you have a robot that
has the same capabilities as a person
you wouldn't think twice about sending
that robot so that's my guiding star is
putting this out into the world and
making something actually useful meet
Valkyrie Valkyrie 162 125 kilograms
superhero robot we really wanted to
design the appearance of this robot to
be one that was just when you saw I'm
gonna wow that's that's awesome so it's
a 44 degree freedom robot very capable
very strong completely self-contained we
have a two kilowatt hour battery lots of
onboard computing got a seven degree of
freedom arm and six degree of freedom
hand three degree freedom pelvis and we
have a six degree of freedom leg when we
were designing the robot we we were
thinking about the competition from day
one and we wanted a very modular system
specifically with the arm we can yank
one bolt and one connector and we can
take the arm off it happens in a matter
of minutes and so we wanted to be able
to replace components major components
on the robot in under 15 minutes the
robot is designed also such that the
arms are actually identical so with just
reconfiguring a piece on the arm a right
arm can suddenly turn into a left arm
power is stored in the backpack here we
have a battery you can pop this panel
off you can do a couple bolts slide the
slide the battery out and then slide a
new battery in so as you can see in the
head we've got cameras both lidar point
cloud based camera systems in the chest
we've got cameras we have sonar
in that in the chest in the stomach
optimal area we have cameras on our on
our forearms for when we're grasping so
we can get a good view from there moving
on down we have cameras and the knees
we've got cameras in the in the feet
pretty much when our when our operators
are running the arm running the robot
any data any piece of data any image
that they would want to see from what
the robots seeing is available to our
users that's a saw considerable overlap
and what the DRC was trying to
accomplish and NASA's NASA's goals as an
agency we want to get to Mars likely
NASA will send robots ahead of the
astronauts to the planet these robots
will start preparing preparing the way
for the human explorers when the humans
arrive the robots and the humans will
work together in conjunction building
halves laying foundation and just
working together in that in that tight
relationship so technologies such as
Valkyrie are gonna really lead into the
the type of robotic systems that will
one day be the precursor missions before
the astronauts go to Mars really strong
a powerful robot superhero robot blowing
NASA meatball what more would you want
Oh takes place in Honda's headquarters
in Tokyo hello Waseem Oh welcome mark
it's nice to meet you I'm absolutely
nice to meet you too I am do you like to
introduce myself with sign language my
name is a symbol well done
pleased to see you
pleased to see you too can I shake your
hand nice to meet you thank you please
come this way
thank you let me follow you
ASIMO has been programmed to walk slowly
when guiding people
let's play soccer I'd love to play
soccer with you by the way you also
played soccer with Barack Obama didn't
you shall I place the ball for you there
you go
now I'll go over here and wait for your
kick okay
here I go
oh nice kick a sumo ha
ASIMO let's do this again this time I'm
gonna put the ball in a different place
okay I see mo anytime you're ready
ASIMO determines the ideal position from
where to kick the ball do you I go wow
you knew exactly where the ball was
you run Wow
please show me how you do that too
it runs fast and it keeps its balance
next a sumo demonstrates its ability to
jump on one foot its hip knee and ankle
joints work together to perfectly absorb
the impact of every jump ASIMO can also
remain perfectly balanced on one leg
you
Gosselaar however your sample in the
Josiah tarabusco dr/dt for this one
since I saw you what casino Hardaway on
the filter all amigas people have no
time you'll see this
I saw no suffer none of the users using
only TOC make people's house so fatty
fatty co2 site stuff can all go down
in your own i'ma yes your mind
it was fun so pause
you know Cole
Oh
empanada
Oh babies toc-toc much
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
