made from most materials the hand tube
bender bends 1/8 1/4 5/16 3/8 and 1/2
inch and 3 6 8 10 and 12 millimeter
outside diameter tubing in a variety of
wall thicknesses the wall thickness
requirements for 1/4 inch stainless

tube bender for a minimum of 0.02 8
inches or 0.7 1 millimeters and a
maximum of 0.06 5 inches for 1.6 5
millimeters for a hand two bender with a

hi everyone
Troy here slag off road today we want to
show you a product revision and update
this is our air over hydraulic ram mount
the new revision as a billet machined
steel clamp was internally threaded
fasteners the beauty of this design
versus our current design or previous
design is this places the RAM in the
center line of the axis which you are
bending the previous version had the
random sitting off-center couple inches
which caused the bending moment of
bending arm and the image shaft this
will fit the GMR Pro Tools Pro Tools HD
g d squared model 32 Woodward's back i
have right here a piece of mission 3/4
corner wall do em I'm gonna hook it up
to some air see if we can do you'll also
notice up here we have a digital readout
I don't know if you're able to read the
digits but you can watch that thing
works the cool thing about this it's
going to agree with no degree ring
degree wheel indicator nothing a bump
it's completely internally driven but
let's moving parts keeping things simple
so there it is engine three quarter
quarter well do them
we've been at 68 two of the spring back
here we bent at sixty seven point one
degrees on the first row I will release
this machined battle here which is also
included in the kit release that pull
the pin retrack this assembly I'll redo
it and shooting up our we've been on the
second pass all right here second pass
so yeah I will tighten this machining
thumb knob push the valve see how far we
go in the same stroke</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
