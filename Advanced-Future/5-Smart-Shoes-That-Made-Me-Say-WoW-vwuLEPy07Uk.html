another revolution in the world of
travelling experiences the barcelona
street project a couple of devices that
will help you make the most out of your
trip placed in a pair of smart shoes
which connect with your phone they will
get you exactly where you want to go
this is how it works
synchronize your shoes with your phone
choose your destination put your phone
away and enjoy the views if you need to
go left your left shoe will vibrate
two consecutive vibrations on both shoes
means you missed the turn

useful because traveling is not only
about the destination it's about
enjoying the journey

first smart shoes that can teach anyone
how to play like it work proper balance
and away shift is critical to generate
power and consistency on the golf course
Caiaphas is the world's first wearable
that track this information from the
ground up by seamlessly integrating a
thin pressure and motion sensing
technology into your shoes after doing a
one-time pairing with your phone just
take a swing out on the range or on
course an eye or it will store all the
information with key positions of your
swing isolated automatically you can hit
multiple swings in a row and instantly
receive an evaluation
the best part is you can see every
technique used by the pros and make it
your own by comparing your swing right
next
learn about your strengths in areas you
can improve with a complete summary of
stats and actionable insights and then
your ability to share that data and
receive feedback allows you to interact
with your friends and coaches even when
you're not with them learn to play like
a pro in no time with Iowa expensive for
that equipment have been used across
many sports especially in go until now
only the best players had access to this
valuable data because of I fit all this
data is now accessible to any gopher
goes on course and on range for the
photo file which gives me confidence
I am constantly striving to get better
and that it will help me to pinpoint
exactly where in my golf swing and a to
put being able to see all this
information and comparing it to
professional sheds life and all
uncertainties and happy food I hope it
you can just worry and go you have to
clip or tag anything and the shoes
themselves are really comfortable and
beautifully designed hi my name is Jacob

thousands of hours testing and
developing a shoe status durable
breathable and waterproof so you can

era of the smart shoes for girls and
beyond change the way people train play

and map my run account check out one of
the get running videos before going for
your first run
watch out Nike your self-lacing shoes
may suit beat the match these are the
puma auto discs they aren't on the
market yet and we're told that only
fifty pairs have been made so far but we
got lucky and managed to get an
exclusive look at one of them here in
Hong Kong in a nutshell the auto discs
are essentially sneakers with built-in
motors that wide up or loosen internal
laces at the push of a button this saves
a long hassle for athletes who often
have to retighten their shoelaces on the
tracks while this concept sounds very
similar to Nikes hyperadapt the auto
discs have two advantages over them one
is that the motors are embedded in the
tongues instead of beneath the soles
thus allowing the auto disk to flex like
ordinary sneakers secondly the auto dis
supports bluetooth and can be controlled
with a smartphone app in which you can
jump straight to your decide tightness
and also monitor the shoes battery
levels running low and Guice just place
the heels on the dedicated while it's
charging mat until the indicators stop
blinking luckily for me this pair of
auto discs were my size so I got to run
around with them to my surprise they
felt very much like normal sneakers but
with the ability to wrap tight around my
feet thus making them more ideal for
running and there was always a sense of
satisfaction whenever the mechanics were
active or maybe I should say the shoes
felt futuristic that way even though
Puma has already seeded several auto
discs to athletes like Usain Bolt and
Rickie Fowler since last November little
is known about them no technical specs
no prize
no release date just yet charters are
the auto dis won't come cheap but for
serious athletes these sneakers are
probably worth every penny
especially if future versions can
automatically tighten themselves up on
the fly</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
