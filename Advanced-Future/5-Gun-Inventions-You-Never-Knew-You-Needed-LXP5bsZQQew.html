introducing the mantis X a unique
firearm training system the diagnosis
shooting issues and coaches you on where
you need improvement while you're
practicing the mantis X is analyzing the
movements of your gun before during and
after each shot it highlights and helps
you avoid errors like pulling healing
anticipating recoil breaking your wrist
off or death or typing grip while
pulling the trigger there's never been a
firearm training system like giving you
real-time feedback through your mobile
phone
the mantis X is designed for live fire
on the range
dry fire airsoft co2 and more it
attaches to any handgun with a rail or
rail adapter you don't need a special
target and the mantis X works at any
distance hi I'm Adam this is Andy we're
the creators of salt salt is a gun but
it's not like any gun that you've ever
seen it was designed around the belief
that a firearm shouldn't have to take a
life in order to protect life from that
simple idea we started by completely
rethinking the bullet instead of LED
salt was designed to shoot a specialized
round filled with a powerful toxin
so instead of killing the target salt
opens up on impact in a cloud that
instantly causes respiratory and visual
distress so while an intruder or a
curious child will be incapacitated the
encounter wouldn't be fatal
this rethink also lets salt be used not
only offensively but defensively as well
so if an intruder is kicking down your
door
salt allows you to shoot the area around
it before the danger is on top of you
this creates a protective cloud of toxin
between you and the intruder before he's
ever a threat to you or your family our
last big idea was to make salt easy to
use for everyone so we replaced the
violent bang of black powder with a
silent power of compressed air the
result is a fear free user experience so
the only person that should have
anything to be scared of is an intruder
and that's all a safe gun for a safe
home
so if you're is intrigued by the ideas
as we are we'd love to make you one just
click our support button and together we
can make the world just a little bit
safer
Alvah great shot

Charlie you may own a gun for home
defense but do you have the skills to
defend your life or your families now I
target laser training system allows you
to practice with your own firearm like
shooting a basketball being accurate
with the firearm requires regular
practice with high ammo cost and range
fees it's not always practical to get to
the gun range now you don't need to you
can practice at home using the eye
Target Pro laser training system the eye
target system uses a laser in place of
the bullet using an app that runs on
your phone you can see exactly where
your shots are hitting all the top
competitive shooters know the value of
dry-fire training the US military
teaches dry fire training techniques the
eye target system makes dry fire
training much more fun you can train
your grip your sight alignment your
trigger control and it helps overcome
the anticipation of recoil you can keep
scoring compete with your friends track
your progress
the laser functions like a snap cap
making it safe for your weapon trained
safe trained smart train with a target
available.i target procom here's a
standard weapon the alternative within
seconds is easily mounted to the top of
the weapon there is no obstruction to
the sight picture for the operator and
there's no obstruction to the
functionality of the weapon or the rail
system it still allows an officer the
ability to attach a flashlight on their
weapons once the weapon is fired the
bullet travels down the barrel embedding
itself inside the alloyed projectile
with no chance of escaping instantly
becoming one solid unit the projectile
immediately separates from the weapon as
the docking unit is instantly ejected
then a new bullet is cycled in for
follow-up shots if necessary the
alternative is as accurate as the
operator using it once the projectile
impacts the threat it will send a shock
wave of pain to the suspect without the
internal damage that a penetrating
bullet would cause

hi everybody this is Tim with tactical
walls I'm here today to tell you about
some new mod wall accessories as you
know we've got mob wall it's our system
it's the panels and it's the storage
accessories we've got two magnets
holding the pistols here we've got an AR
mag holder which is designed to fit in
the mag well and it suspends the rifle
in the mag well it with a high density
polyethylene hanger doesn't damage or
hurt the inside and the solvent doesn't
affect it but that's not we're talking
about what we're talking about the mod
wall system how it's designed to help
you store and display your guns but then
you've got the problem of what do I do
with my mags and you end up with a pile
of mags you got a mess of mags around
the house and they start to multiply and
like you if you're like me you end up
with a whole lot of mags for each gun
because no one likes to just keep
reloading the same mag or two at the
range you got to have a whole bunch of
them keep feeding them so what we've got
is we're working with mag storage
solutions they make a mag organization
and storage system that can be used in a
variety of ways we've adapted it to work
with our mod wall system and it's a
really cool system we're gonna go ahead
and load the mess imagine see in front
of me up on the wall behind me you'll
see how easy the mag storage solution
system is to work with mod wall I'll
start with the ar-15 system and you've
got a series of slides that allow the
magazines to very quickly simply and
easily
pop in - and you'll see that it's got
some positive retention here with the
natural flex of the material below the
last two and you're able to organize and
store six ar-15 mags real quick and
simple you're able to take a visual
inventory if you've got any translucent
mags you can see what's loaded how
loaded is it and then we've also got the
pistol system here to the right pistol
system comes with a whole bunch of
dividers and you set these dividers to
the width the desired width of the mags
are storing so you can store single
stack mags we've got in this case some
sig p320 mags and I've got it set up to
accommodate three mags on the right for
the sig and I've just got some extra
device
here in the middle and I'm going to go
ahead and put these 4 Glock mags on the
left-hand side of the system so I went
ahead and pre set up my dividers to
equally break up the space for the
magazines I wanted to display here and
we've even got some room on the bottom
for a couple ammo boxes so we'll go
ahead and put those in and there you go
we've got all of the the mess of mags
we've had out here on the table we now
have very neatly and cleanly displayed
on the wall you're able to get a quick
visual inventory and it helps you not
only store but also protect and present
your gear very well so that whether
you're getting ready to plan a trip to
the range you know what you need to grab
what's for what system what firearm and
the great thing about these being model
all accessories it's very quick and
simple to rearrange the system to suit
your needs or say you did want to go to
the range you literally could just go
ahead and take this entire rack right
off the wall you could put it in the
case and take it straight to the range
if you want just to help keep your stuff
real clean and real organized or say you
didn't want this here you want to let's
move this over here out of my way for a
sec and we'll go ahead and put the AR
stuff we'll put the AR mags here in the
middle instead so I mean no tools very
simple very quick you're able to
organize and reassess what you've got so
that's the mag storage solutions that's
the mod wall system you can check it out
at tactical walls comm I'd like to thank
you guys for watching take care and God
bless</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
