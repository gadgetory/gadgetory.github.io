above the on/off switch red washers are
made of softer materials for hose ends
with Nick's or minor damage black
washers can be used with a hose that has
a sharp edge that could cut into washers
made of softer material place the nozzle
end of the pivot Pro on the ground and
insert the hose turn the hose attachment
knob counterclockwise until the fit is
snug go ahead and turn the hose on to
check for any leaks if so make the
connection just a bit tighter now you're
