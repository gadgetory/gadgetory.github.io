today we're looking at the 2014
cardsharp collection from Ian Sinclair
the new packaging is very minimal using
three layers of black card
we take off the single piece neoprene
band inside we have the car sharp for in
natural it also comes in black the body
is CNC machine from one piece of
aluminium and the blade is stainless
steel we have a new rivet to keep the
blade in place on the body there are
spring-loaded hinges made from Knight
anole to stop sagging and we have to
safety spiders that act as locks to give
ultimate rigidity in both open and
closed positions the card sharp 3 is a
low cost straightedge knife there's a
stainless steel blade with a
polypropylene body it has a new design
blade lock to prevent blade tremor and
there's a childproof safety lock to keep
the blade in place when in card mode the
card sharp 2.2 is the evolution of the
card shop - it borrows the feature of
the two-stage safety slider from the
card sharp 4 it also has the same rivet
as the card sharp for used to keep the
blade in place it has a stainless steel
surgical grade curved edge blade as with
the card sharp - there's a childproof
safety lock the ridges on the back add
to the strength of the polypropylene
body
today at CRKT were taking a look at the
innovative snap-loc knife first released
in 2004 designer ed van who shook up the
industry with this original design this
ended up collecting quite a few
accolades over the years including most
innovative knife at the blade show let
me show you how it works the snap lock
mechanism is simpler than it appears
simply push down on the top of the cam
and use your thumb to swing the blade
open 180 degrees you'll feel the blade
click into place and the blade is
securely locked up now to close the
knife push on the cam stud here this
will disengage a blade and swing the
blade to the closed position once it's
closed the perfect fit ensures that no
part of the sharpened edge is exposed
let me show you that one more time push
down on the top of the cam and use your
thumb to swing the blade open 180
degrees to close the knife push on the
cam stud here this will disengage the
blade then swing the blade to the closed
position pretty cool mechanism overall
an incredible award-winning innovation
that would be a great conversation piece
at any knife party overall when the
knife is open its about six and a
quarter inches long and the blade is
around 2.5 inches the overall weight is
2.5 ounces which equals about 71 grams
which is very lightweight the blade
shape is a subtle drop point or close to
a modified warrant lift style and it has
this attractive bead blast finish the
handles are completely stainless steel
with a lanyard hole feature the whole
package comes with a quick-release
paracord lanyard that you can clip on to
the back of the knife here there are two
options available a plain edged blade
that's model number five one zero two N
and there's this blade with triple point
serrations which is model 5 1 1 2 n
thanks for watching and thank you for
caring CRKT knives and tools
er a to the guppy from CRKT was designed
by lawns Barbara and Tom Stokes
it's a hard-working multi-tool with
dozens of everyday uses the adjustable
wrench jaw opens to a half-inch for
light repair and assembly jobs a
high-carbon two inch stainless steel
blade can be opened and closed easily
using the blade slot the removable bit
carrier is a high intensity LED light
and has two locator posts and strong
magnets to hold it securely to the
guppies side the removable bit and
Driver are held securely in place in the
tail of the body the stainless steel
clip will hold the gup-e in your pocket
or gear and can also be used as a money
clip the carabiner detent will open
bottle caps and metal jar lids the gup-e
is a versatile multi-tool that is a
convenient carry option for a variety of
everyday tasks
