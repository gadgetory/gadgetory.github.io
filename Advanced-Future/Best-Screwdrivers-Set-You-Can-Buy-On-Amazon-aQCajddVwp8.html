birra world renowned is probably one of
the leading manufacturers of high
quality precision screwdrivers for
industry and various trades and really
are super few if you've ever had the
chance to use one you will see the
difference straightaway what we have
here is a 7 piece electricians set vda
tested which means that they go through
the batch process each batch
individually tested so what we're going
to open this up and have a look at the
screwdrivers that we've got here take
them all out so you've got half a dozen
all rolling around up and down there all
of your popular size is that you're
gonna come into and a mains tester as
well every good set should have a mains
tester so I'm going to leave that so
let's just have a look at these here so
what we've got here if you can just come
in on the tip this one's what they
called a plus/minus tip it's from the ND
sort of traditional Philips but it's
also for special fittings on some
electrical component tree you need this
plus minus T which is like a slotted
Anna Phillips but this is recessed will
do both</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
