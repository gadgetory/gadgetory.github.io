and talk to you about some new
headphones from Seoul the ad phone I've
got in front of me is part of a range of
three new models this is the WH 1000 x
mark 2
you can see it's available in two colors
in a champagne finish and also black now
it has industry-leading noise
cancellation which is amazing you have
to check it out to listen for yourself
this kind of noise cancellation is very
cleverly done it's based upon dual
sensors so there are two lots of
microphones built into them to be able
to accurately understand the kind of
background noise that's going on but
more than that the headphone has
artificial intelligence noise
cancellation so it automatically
understands the different types of noise
that are around you when using them and
then everything is done automatically
now not only that but this has got a
brand-new feature this ass the ability
to understand atmospheric pressure now
we call an optimization feature and not
only does it understand atmospheric
optimization it can understand you now
this means to say that the headphone can
be set up to compensate for how big your
ears are to be frank whether you've got
long hair where he wear glasses like
this
now of course sound is important and
they have high resolution audio
capability for playback s master HX amp
technology built-in and dsee aging which
you can switch on if you wish to enable
you to play lower bitrate file in high
quality but of course connection from
your music player to the headphones is
important and you have L doc you have
optics HD now plus aptX and the usual
connection system is provided by
bluetooth to enable to get your music
from your player or your phone
smartphone into your headphones now the
smarter technology and we call it
smarter technology because this kind of
technology developed by sun this kind of
headphone really extends how you can
control what you listen to
as well as enjoy in terms of music play
by by that I mean you have things like a
quick attention mode so if you're
wearing the headphones you simply place
your hand over the ear cup this side and
you get full access to what the
announcement is or the steward or the
tendon if you're in an aircraft so hear
them clearly and what they want to talk
to you about anyway based on that we
went to stage further and of course
these feature
thanks to this very tactile surface here
very small lovely coating on these
headphones you should try them and you
can control the volume up and down you
can track skip backwards and forward you
know if you connect these headphones to
the new Sony headphone connector then
you can really go to town because then
you start to be able to control how your
noise canceling works either
automatically according to your movement
what your activity is you can even go in
and set your favorite settings for those
types of activities because remember
your phone your phone has sensors inside
it to respond to movement and activity

allow you to have automatic control over
your listening noise cancellation
