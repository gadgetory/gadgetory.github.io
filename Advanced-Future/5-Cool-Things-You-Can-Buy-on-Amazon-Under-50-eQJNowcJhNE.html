had one land on your sandwich we have
and having to throw food at ourselves is
what inspired us to create something
everyone can use to capture the flies in
and around their home you might not
realize but fly to carry eagle matter
from your pets waist or your neighbors
and head waste into your home and
deposit it on food prep surfaces and
food where they excrete digestive
enzymes and then slurp it up yep the
garbage can't fly chef works because
flies are naturally attracted to your
garbage it doesn't require a chemical
attractant unsightly flypaper or chasing
a fly around with this water the trap
also includes a disposable cartridge and
a quick release button that allows for
hands-free disposal directly into your
garbage can and it also works for those
annoying little fruit flies so
interesting let Dennis show you how it
works the garbage can fly trap is a
device that is installed in the lid of a
garbage any flies being attracted to the
set of your garbage seek the easiest
route to gain access we have designed
the garbage can flytrap to let flies
think they have found Oh No they enter
through the center of the trap on the
exterior of the garbage can under the
quick release button and follow their
nose to a disposable project below
located on the interior of the garbage
can the disposable cartridge is lined
with flypaper which prevents their
escape to replace the disposable
cartridge simply press the quick release
button allowing the cartridge to fall
into your garbage and snap on a new
cartridge and you are ready to capture
more flies
after seven prototypes and receiving
valuable feedback from product testing
we are finally ready to introduce this
innovative device to the market as a
team with more than 40 years of
professional experience between us will
draw on our engineering design
manufacturing and marketing and sales
skills to deliver a superior product I
receive my MBA from San Diego State
University and Dennis received his
engineering degree from University of
California San Diego we would love to
make the garbage can flytrap available
to everyone that has ever been bothered
by a fly but especially to you and this
is where you come in we need your pledge
to me our manufacturers minimum initial
order with this money raised we can
start production and ship the garbage
can flytrap literally worldwide make a
pledge and let us send the garbage can
fly shop to you as we all unite to say
no more to the dreaded fly on our
sandwiches our kitchen and anywhere else
it matters please pledge please share

I love to drink coffee in the morning I
have to have it and I wake up but I
don't like carrying around a big travel
mug and I don't like using all these
disposable coffee cups Stowe Joe is the
answer it's a cup for coffee for tea for
any beverage and it collapses into a
little disc that's completely sealed so
you can put it away in your bag a
backpack your pocket and take it out
again to use later a couple years ago I
was sitting with some friends having
coffee and we had this idea a few days
later they sent me these 2d drawings and
from there like we kind of just went I
knew that we could make this thing we
made it a point to keep the design
simple three main parts are made from
food grain materials you can easily take
them apart and wash them in the
dishwasher or by hand and when they're
put back together they create a liquid
tight seal
we think you're really gonna like this
product save some space help the planet
have more fun with your cup
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
