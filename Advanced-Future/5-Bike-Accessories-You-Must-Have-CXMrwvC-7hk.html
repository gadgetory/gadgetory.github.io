multi-tool based on appearances it seems
as if the tradesmen multi-tool is like
every other multi-tool and like any
solid multi-tool the tradesman has its
allen wrenches Torx wrenches screwdriver
a spoke wrench and even this little
press the valve tool unlike every other
multi-tool the tradesman holds a
complete chain repair system your
standard chain tool hidden quick link
storage and clever quick link removal
tool never be stranded out in the middle
of nowhere again with all of this
Coolidge it's amazing that a tradesman
multi-tool is small enough to fit here
and here the Blackburn tradesman
multi-tool it may appear similar to
other multi tools but with its quick
link storage and quick link tool the
tradesman multi-tool was anything but
similar my friend
cycling through the city is an amazing
experience
but there's one problem that all
cyclists share and that is navigation we
are very active cyclists ourselves and
we've often experienced how using your
phone while cycling is both awkward and
sometimes even dangerous and having
headphones in your ears telling you
where to go just makes you lose some of
the sense of freedom that cycling
normally gives that is how the idea of
Heiser was born we wanted to create the
simple affordable and easy-to-use
product that will help find your way to
the city I suppose like a magic compass
but instead of pointing North it points
to your final destination in that way
you are free to choose your own route
through the city just open the app set
your location and attach Heiser to your
bike the LEDs of the outer circle show
you the direction and the central LED
indicates the distance to your goal so
now you can find your own way through
the city without being in danger of
getting lost and who knows what amazing
places and experiences you can find by
not choosing the route most travel
Heisey is made out of machined aluminium
making it sturdy and waterproof and when
you're not using the device you can
simply hide the rubber band within the
device and put it in your pocket that
way you can always bring it with you be
it to find that new restaurant after
work or to discover when cycling abroad

like sticking to the Main Roads highs of
