perspective hi guys I'm Lorenzo
hi I'm Carlo everyday smartphones are
becoming smarter but the battery life
remains critical we'd like to use our
phones without the fear of running out
of battery of course there are solutions
such as fire cases and extra batteries
whether you're not portable enough or is
to forget we designed a product so
compact that will follow you everywhere
a cable the size of an inch we call it
in charge it's a very simple product yet
so useful that we believe everybody
should own one that's why one of our
main goals was to keep it affordable

we spend an average 70% of our day next
to a USB port and every time it's a
chance to top-up for batteries there are
over five billion USB ports around the
world in charge will fit into your
pocket and you wanted to fight with
tangle cords ever again thanks to its
remarkably complex design you can snap
it onto your keyring and there's no
chance to forget it at all we spent the
last three months design the product and
testing the prototypes and now we are
finally ready to start the production in
charger will be available with both
lightning connector and micro USB so
it's compatible with most of the devices

get your own in charge as a special
price so please consider backing our
project and share it with your friends
