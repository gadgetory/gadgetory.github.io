relationship with joy it's been since
1986 so 30 years to see this new helmet
and where they've gone with it to see
what the engineers have done you know to
see what marques has suggested with the
engineers and to see what this has
progressed into it's just absolutely
amazing I actually wore this in Malaysia
for the zx-10r
launch I spent six hours in the thing in
the in the heat of Malaysia and the
ventilation was was brilliant I didn't
change it then I only changed today
change the backpack padding and the
cheek lighting so tilts it gives you
that extra four mils of vision it's a
really really good help today was the
first time I rode with it and the first
impressions are really good I noticed
mainly the vision for me you know I kind
of see more going down the straightaways
and through the corners which just helps
tremendously riding a super bike and
then also the air flow a little bit so a
hot summer day when we have two races in
one day on 1,000 it's pretty tough being
in a great helmet like the X 14 I think
will help a lot
I had never had a problem with my Expo
of buffeting it all but when I put on
the X 14 I actually kind of noticed that
it was doing a little bit so a big
advantage with the export team keeps my
head stable and and again help him keep
him with my eyes focused on what the
heads that's the most comfortable I've
ever won my part I going to drop racing
you either program a good it and walk
one or kayaking Morrissey sorry you
don't know all that what sticking stuff
sizes and they own a no turning offices
and this is 31 or 40 more think oh that
this discussed my mother from the Guinea
have to go to can't devote all modulus
or no sky say spoken or we don't know
position cortical being up there yoku me
edit so they got a scaredy-dog are
people of its looked on all riding the
nickname the most of the list a lot of
them can be double team instead o cuvier
no hero the gamma figure a parity
limited very much time so they've
another that did that personal authority
to take board in a certain way you know
that right now it's gotta go College
there's nothing my favorite feature I
mean of all the new stuff is the fact
that they kept it the same price as the
x12 I mean X bar was a premium helmet
it's a really nice helmet they're
telling us all the stuff they changed
all the stuff they improved and when it
came to the end and the TS to tell us
the price everyone was like and he said
there's the same as the existing helmet
which is I mean that's quite a feat so
definitely hats off to that good job Zoe

hey there this is Alan with sitaji here
today to talk to you about our Bluetooth
multimedia button multi media button
lets you control your music that's
playing through your smartphone unless
you play a pause adjust the volume as
well as skip tracks all wirelessly it's
really great to have in your pocket or
just on you while you're exercising or
in the car it's really easy to use only
about the size of a quarter so in this
video I'm going to show you how to pair
it to your phone as well as go over the
contents of the box what it comes with
so first things first let's get this
pair to the phone so I'm gonna go to my
iPhone here go to my Bluetooth settings
and turn bluetooth on next I'm going to
flip over the multi PD button and
there's a small button indentation right
above the battery casing so you're gonna
need a pen or a paper clip something
small that you can use to just press and
hold that button for about five seconds
and that will put it into pairing mode
you be able to tell because there would
be a blue light blinking right on the
top of the device so that my Bluetooth
list on my phone here I can see pop
multimedia if that's the media button so
I'll touch that get paired up so that's
all there is to it now it's ready to use
so if I go into my music here we can try
it out so let's press play
music starts to play I can also pause
adjust the volume up or down as well as
skip tracks so thanks to its low profile
it's really easy to just have in your
pocket while you're running you can also
place it on your bicycle handlebars or
steering wheel using this universal
mount really easy to use just slides
right on there and then you can place it
on your steering wheel or bike handlebar
is really great while you're running it
also comes with a keychain attachment
that you can loop through this hole at
the top of the unit here keep it in your
keychain keep it on your pot in your
pocket just control your music
wirelessly when whenever you're
listening to it on your smartphone
