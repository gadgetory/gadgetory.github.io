more so this time vacation has been more
of a vacation than in the past when we
didn't campus suited for the kids
hi my name is Alena I'm the founder and
inventor of Pluto the first tender
controlled safety device for swimmers we
came up with this idea after a family
member of mine almost drowned during a
vacation so we said come on there must
be something we can do against it when
you drive a car you put your seatbelts
on
when you drive a bike you have a helmet
on but when you're in the water you're
all on your own so we said let's find
something that helps you when you get in
trouble so we came up with this idea of
a sensor control safety device that
helps you whenever you get in trouble in
the water rescue me Inc presents the
rescue me a two-in-one emergency tool
which breaks windows and cuts seatbelt
quickly and easily in case of an
emergency this quick powerful and easy
to use tool will keep you and your loved

vehicle in an emergency this essential
tool will be part of your everyday life
as it can be attached to your keychain
and be with you at all times the two and
one
rescue tool cut seatbelt and breaks
windows
a rescue me product this patented sharp
deterrent technology has been tested in
research for years
and we stand behind our product 100% we
believe in it so much we're willing to
get the water with the sharks ourselves
just to prove it to you
watch what happens bra first test we
were able to come up Caribbean reef
sharks pretty large ones actually it
would be not only really scientific but
safe at the same time we actually tried
the shark bed to a real added bully and
as a shark for frenzy and feeding we
were able to throw that into the water
right in the area where the sharks are
feeding and when they came up to
investigate the shark man they fled so
in the second tester is really quite
exciting I actually put the shark bands
around both ankles and got into the
water with the sharks and when I was in
there we were feeding the Sharks and
coming all around and as the Sharks
approached me you notice for obvious
repellent reactions as they approached
the bands on my feet
during the third test we decided to get
more of the controlled type of testing
so we actually took a lead weight and
wrap the shark bands around that again
put it in the water and Chum the Sharks
to the surface and when we did that we
had some really astonishing propelling
behavior and I hate that was awesome I
think this product will be very
effective for the recreational
beachgoers something is swimming in a
beach environment where it's in shallow
water and a shark comes through it is
investigating and using its electrical
sense in those types of situations I
think this particular device will be
very effective at repelling a shark I
may even have very strong applications
for somebody
dangling off the edge and a shark comes
through a curious in investigating I
think difficult build Emma's room super
like most 11 month olds is curious he'll
put just about anything into his mouth
Friday it was a plastic wrapper and that
wrapper got lodged in his throat his mom
Stephanie says she was frantic and ran
out the front door there was her letter
carrier he just grabbed my son and to
the Heimlich on him and out it came
people choked frequently the United
States about every five days a child was
going to die in this country from an
obstructed airway life way an adult will

designed to be used by any layperson in
a medical emergency for young or old
when you've lost an airway to choking

physician see a lot of bad things and
some of them stick in your mind a
brother through his sister great to
catch it in her mouth unfortunately slid
down into her airway the window of
opportunity at four minutes of not
having oxygen had passed by the time she
made it to me and she died this is
something that happens frequently in the
United States that doesn't have to
pretty much anybody can use this device
