hey guys this is Zoe with spigen and I'm
here with our thin fit series for the
iPhone 7 and 7 plus it comes in five
premium colors that's ideal for matching
the color of your phone the thin fit
comes with a compatible space for metal
plates if you have a magnetic car mount
but keep in mind that they don't come
with the case so make sure to buy them
separately the same is found in the 7
plus with button cutouts and made of a
hard PC material here we take the iPhone
7 for demonstration inserting the left
side of the phone at an angle and gently
pressing down its remaining corners for
a perfect fit and among our color
choices this one is our thin fit jet
black cutouts are comfortably sized for
you to directly access the buttons a
great plus about this case is that is
lightweight and thin making it perfect
for one-hand usage even with a small
hand like me raised lips on each side
ensure the screen and camera untouched
whenever the phone is placed flat on a
surface now the only notable difference
between the 7 and 7 plus is its camera
cut out the thin fit 7 is stretched out
a bit more to support its dual camera
and the bottom of the case is precisely
designed to leave the dual speakers and
the charging port for quick and easy
access detach two corners to remove your
phone and notice that the case gave
little to no bulk thanks for joining us
delivering quality spigen

close to the vent until they snap
together and that's it you're free to
rotate the phone in any direction that
