type of aerator that fits into your
existing tap by optimizing water and
creating a mist you can do exactly the
same things you do today only with 98%
less water this is what happens with
your regular faucet most of the water
either bounces off your skin or just
passes your hands without touching them
at all that's millions of gallons of
water literally slipping through our
fingers and down the drain we need to
change that and that's why we want your
help so how do we save 98% of the water
without losing functionality the trick
is in atomization you break up the water
into millions of droplets and basically
you're creating a heavy mist with our
mist you're getting contact with much
much a greater percentage of the water
almost all of it that's why you can wash
your hands do your dishes with just a
fraction of the water coming out of your
tap but sometimes you need more water
that's why we develop the switch in
switch mode you still save 85% of the
water compared to your regular tap but
you still get all the water you need our
world has changed drastically over the
past decade with the advent of new
technologies we have seen a revolution

remembering to floss your teeth is hard
you practically need your own personal
dentist to remind you on a daily basis
wouldn't it be awesome if you had
someone who could not only remind you
but also encourage you to floss your
teeth regularly well now you do meet
flossed I'm your personal floss reminder
floss time is the first smart floss
dispenser designed to help you build
daily flossing habits it simply mounts
to your bathroom mirror and acts as a
visual reminder to clean in between your
teeth with the push of a button
floss time automatically dispenses the
perfect amount of law dentists recommend
you floss at least once a day
so if used regularly floss time lights
up with a fun smile for a job well done
but it's a period of 24 hours passes
with inactivity floss time frowns at you
with a reminder light we know we're
supposed to floss but most of us forget
traditional floss designs are built on
century-old technology and are dependent
on us remembering to use them which
means they don't get used enough
Schloss time is a habit-forming device
that will make flossing easy yet nearly
impossible to forget the device comes
with an entire years worth of floss
has a dual user mode and includes
colorful animal snap-on's
to make flossing fun for kids as well
this is a regular car booster seat and
this is my fold the grab-and-go booster
seat it's more than ten times smaller
than a regular booster and it's just as
safe thousands of families already love
my phone it's perfect for carpooling and
when I go on vacation I prefer to pack
light a day with the grandkids is so
much more fun and every time you get in
a taxi hey guys come on that still not a
taxi
thank you it's the most advanced compact
and portable booster fee ever instead of
lifting the child up my fault works by
holding the seat belt down it's that
simple
grab one and go
