first modular fast access carbon fiber
wallet with RFID blocking and anti
degaussing feature
nobody likes bulky uncomfortable wallets
that's why we designed pitaka the
modular design gives you the opportunity
to customize your wallet based on your
current situation you can decide from
different modules what you want to bring
the carbon fiber design is super strong
with stunning that looks it's ultra slim
compact and easily fits in any pocket or
purse with its cool and clever design

with a quick flick of the wrist designed
more than four cards pitaka can hold all
your daily essentials cash keys coins SD
cards and much more just play with it
and within seconds add or remove modules
based on what you want to take for the
day
besides the stunning design pitaka is
100% rfid-blocking and it will keep all
your cards secure and safe from the
risks of card hacking he talked and new
wallet is the world's first of its kind
with a special anti degaussing module it
will prevent the magnetic strip cards
degaussing as seen in many other wallets
we use the best carbon fiber material to
design pitaka
and the body itself is tough enough for
even more amazing things you can use it
as a screwdriver and bottle opener slim
strong secure and safe that's Batak a
new wallet
join us and together let's put a pitaka
new wallet into everyone's pocket
today I want to talk to you about the
ascent which is our our newest wallet
and this is really an accumulation of
all of the ideas that we've gotten from
customers from our element wallet and
we've been selling our element wallet
for four years now but I want to show
you all the different features that make
up this wallet so come on over here
this is using our our top grain our five
ounce top grain leather and what we've
done is we've gotten better and better
at at getting very quality stitching on
our products and so we're stitching this
whole thing by hand and this has the
same 65 year heirloom warranty that all
of our products have and so we've made
sure to keep that keep that in mind as
we've been designing this you'll see
that it's a lot more like slim more slim
and low profile than the bin the element
wallet and you'll see how thin it is as
well um it's it's stout and when you
hold it you'll feel that it's got a
little bit of weight to it but it's
actually it ends up feeling really
really sturdy you know this is a
minimalist wallet and so you'll see that
it's not stacked full of cards but you
still want to know that the cards that
you have are there and that they're safe
and this most certainly does that
the best feature about this wallet that
I like is that you can pull this and it
ejects your card I'm at that point you
put your most commonly used card on top
and you'll pull that out and use it and
put it back slip it and then the card
slip the strap slips right back in on
the back side you've got cash and you
can pull your cash out of this slot it's
placed just so so that your cash doesn't
press out of the bottom where you can
press it down and it stays nice and snug
at this at this perfect height
um on the top you use cards and items
that are less commonly used and so I put
our tray backs come up here and in
addition to that just cards that I don't
use as often and you know just like a
baseball glove as you use this product
it becomes it gets this nice patina on
it this leather has what's called a pull
up and so it will age and it'll get this
very very nice look like an old baseball
glove so that's the that is the ascent
it is an awesome awesome product so
thank you for watching many of us need
to carry a badge to work every day you
need it to access doors and show your
identity we tested more than 50 badge
holders and found many problems however
you still need to carry a badge with
your wallet and keys to work which can
be inconvenient
at gobo we decide to make things simple
introducing gobo badge holder in wallet
we over engineered the construction to
make it durable and easy to use the
cover is made by high-strength
polycarbonate to fully protect your car
the enhance structure on the back
increases strength while reducing weight
the manganese steel clip allows you to
carry the holder anywhere you want
the clip is secured by a reinforced
structure to make sure it consists in
any situation the metal spring holds
cards securely even when only one card
is loaded
honestly I feel like a wallet is a
person's most basic tool
it carries a person's identity money
business and for an object that carries
such precious things I want someone to
take pride in what they're carrying we
sorted dango to take everyday products
and breathe new life in them but we want
to really do it through materials
different manufacturing processes taking
it and really kind of pushing it over
the top along with quality I wanted to
offer some functionality to the wallet
so we wanted to offer a multi-tool that
has more than ten functions
so we started thinking about today's
wallets let's face it wallets are either
bulky and uncomfortable or way too
minimal so we came up with something new
it combines hand crafted traditional
materials with an innovative design meet
Jin Jin has just two compartments you
can access everything we need in one
swift motion the stainless steel clip
can hold 10 cards 20 bills for any
combination of the two so there's no
wasted space coins Jan has a pocket that
holds everything from coins to keys to
USB sticks we've also given Jin a
concealed drawer for the small items you
need to keep safe oh and once again
we've got your back
Jin comes with an RFID blocking harvest
so forget about your information being
stolen everything about this wallet is
thin and light we make out of leather or
microfiber so you can choose the style
that's right for you Jin is tiny but
it's got room for everything you need
everyday everywhere this is our second
campaign and once again we're ready for
production we just need your support to
make it happen from our whole team here
at Koala gear we want to thank you for
bringing Jin to life</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
