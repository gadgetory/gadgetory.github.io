elegant home speaker system that
combines two pairs on performance

technology the citation series is a
dynamic listening experience and it is
very easy to control it's also flexible

or connect them all to create a 5.1
channel surround sound system what's
great is that you can stream the same
music throughout your home or play
different tracks in different rooms but
the citation series is really for people
looking for more than just superior
sound Harman Kardon patent with Scots

beautiful design it really is a piece
that stands out but it fits in any home

touch capacitive sensor in the cap so

switch between them
and to make it easier to recognize them
you can rename each one easily in as
many times as you want one of the
