everything is accessible via the
internet with data breaches like Equifax
and the ongoing Cambridge analytically
it's very clear that your data is out
there right for the taking
surprisingly enough one of the easiest
way for hackers to capture your data is
from old hard drives or computers simply
reformatting your device when you are
ready to sell or recycle it doesn't
guarantee that it's actually gone red
key is the solution to actually deleting
your old data securely it takes the
complicated gooeys out of the equation
and has an easy-to-use plug in and play
system simply plug in your red key into
your device before startup and initiate
the one with the easy-to-use menu that
is embedded into the key stop worrying
about that old MacBook or PC that's
taking up space in your closet with red
key your data will true be gone forever
charger Ito is the world's smallest
mobile device charger it's small enough
to fit on your keychain and plugs into
an electrical outlet to hold your phone
securely against the wall as it charges
it's not an external battery that has to
be charged separately or a wire that has
to be plugged into a USB device to
charge running out of battery sucks and
carrying around a charger sucks so we
designed charger Rideau to be much
smaller and more portable than standard
chargers the charger Itoh fits into any
standard US outlet and there are three
versions one with a micro USB connector
and another with a USBC connector to
charge things like a droid Kindle or
other tablet as well as one with an
apple lightning connector to charge
iPhone 5 and above
phone keys wallet charger ito never
leave home without them
the single-use plastic straws yeah just
right there don't you know that plastic
straws are bad for the environment what
is this if you're gonna suck suck on
this this is final straw the world's
first collapsible reusable totally
badass draw straws are supposed to be
convenient right so we decided to do
something about it this is final straw
final straw folds up to the size of a
car key and fits in a sexy case final
straw is small enough to fit in your
purse or pocket but if you don't have
pockets you can just Oh where'd it go if
you can remember your keys when you
leave the house you'll remember your
straw it fits on your keychain so
there's no way you're gonna leave it in
your car and there's no need to worry
about keeping it clean included in each
straw is a specially-designed squeegee
simply pull it through the straw to make
sure it's squeaky clean final straws BPA
free dishwasher safe and with our
patented design the ends are soft so
it's safe for human children and their
adults there you go little buddy this
straw may seems small but because of its
size it's actually very harmful to the
environment
straws can't be recycled so they're
often left here in the ocean where they
hurt and kill my friends in the sea
there you go go be free since you've hit
play on this video we've discarded this
many straws in the US alone pretty bad
right included in each straw are some of
these little cards next time you're at a
restaurant leave one with the bill and
let them know to only serve straws upon
request there's a movement happening and
you can be at the front of it together
we can make a really big impact and save
our oceans one straw at a time so I'm
going to demonstrate for you how easy it
is for you to connect to your ripple

to communicate with them and they're
able to communicate with you all the
while able to dispatch any emergency
resource you need at the click of a
button it's that easy so now I'm going
to demonstrate for you how easy it is
for you to alert your team when you're
in a serious emergency so pump your
device three or more times and a call

system immediately calls you back now
