rigid hi I'm David shank off TV host and
licensed general contractor I'm here on
the jobsite to give you a first-hand
look at rigid hyper driver
it's a new line of 18 volt cordless
Sanders we've got a 16 gauge finish and
an 18 gauge brad nailer here to show you
what I really like about going to
cordless it gives you the freedom to go
wherever you need not only do you not
have to drag around a compressor and
hose with you but you don't have to
worry about the noise that the
compressor either that can come in real
handy if your client is actually on site
during a remodel like this one now I've
used other cordless nailers in the past
and they never seem to perform as well
as my traditional pneumatic mailers but
with hyper driver these tools feature
brushless motors making them fast and
powerful a lot of other cordless nailers
use gas cartridges which not only smell
but have to be replaced all the time
which gets expensive with rigid you only
need one of their eighteen volt
batteries and you're good to go now one
question I get a lot from my peers is
how long is the runtime obviously
cordless office a lot of convenience but
what's the point if you constantly have
to change the battery well I can tell
you first hand that both of these
mailers keep
the brushless motors gives you up to
fourteen hundred and fifty nails per
charge on the 16 gauge and up to 2000 on
the 18 gauge for me that's easily
several jobs I can complete without
having to change the batteries on top of
all that you've got an LED light a
selectable trigger switch a tool free
power adjustment and even a belt clip
best of all rigid hyper drive nails are
covered by rigid lifetime service
agreement giving you free parts and free
service for life when you register if
you're looking for a new solution for
your finished work rigid hyper drive is
the answer that's quite a mess you've
got there nothing the rigid 10-gallon
stainless steel wet/dry vac can't handle
if you've got a life then you've got
messes household messes garage messes
and messes caused by the children that's
the power and versatility of the rigid
10 gallon stainless steel wet/dry vac
now that's a good-looking vacuum look at
that steel I would say they don't make
them like that anymore but rigid does
that it would look great in my garage</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
