is the manhole body cover lifting system
today I will demonstrate the MagTek and
key tech lifting attachments in
conjunction with the steel lifting
trolley the advantage of the product is
that it can be operated safely by one
person allowing them to lift covers
equal to their own weight in total
comfort the lifting trolley has a cover
on sitting facility which works with
both the mag tech and key tech
attachments to break the resistance
caused by compacted dirt or corrosion
the advantage of the night tech system
is that there is no need to clean the
keyholes so you simply place the magnet
on the cover engage it by turning the
lever to the on position then gently
push down on the trolley handle to raise
the cover this means that the product
can be used all the year round including
during the winter when the covers are
iced in position and the keyholes are
not accessible the key tech spreader bar
is secured to the cover using lockdown
keys three tip profiles are available
for indoor covers the key Tec can be
bolted directly into the lifting sockets
mic tech is used exclusively with
metallic covers key tech can be used
with any type of cover the best of both
package combines the speed of the mag
tech with the universal capabilities of
the key Tec

introducing the rigid octane hammer
drill delivering best-in-class torque
with octane power and intelligence to
make this tool intelligent we designed a
processor capable of identifying the
battery's power output allowing the tool
to maximize current in high demand
applications with a powerful next
generation brushless motor we unleashed
a tremendous 1,300 inch pounds of torque
while generating less heat and wear for
longer motor life
the micro clutch design increases torque
control giving the user over 100
settings
thanks to precision gearing built into
the slip clutch the rugged three-piece
design is built to handle whatever the
jobsite throws at it and an ambidextrous
mode selector allows the user to quickly
switch modes in any position while the
360-degree Chuck Lite is designed to
provide Shadow free visibility to the
workpiece
we designed octane terminals to deliver
maximum power and intelligence when
paired up with rigid octane batteries
this smart communication starts with an
electronic handshake the instant the
trigger is pressed the battery and tool
identify each other raising power output
to overcome high demand applications
when other hammer drills are slow to
deliver the rigid octane hammer drill
powers through quickly delivering over
65% more power when paired with octane
batteries the rigid octane hammer drill
delivers best-in-class torque with
extreme power and intelligence and is
compatible with all rigid 18 volt
