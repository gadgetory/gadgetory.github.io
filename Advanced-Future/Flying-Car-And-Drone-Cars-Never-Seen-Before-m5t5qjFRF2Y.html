never miss another update we'll look up
the bubble copter are autonomous air
taxis that are electrically powered and
can start and land vertically we've
already proven that the technology works
yes this developer I don't obviously
owns the world is now ready to share our
vision of inner cities in the next 10
years we want to demonstrate how it can
be implemented in the traffic context of
a big city
the initial step will be a
point-to-point route for example going
from the airport to the city center
which comes along with minimal
infrastructure requirement in very low
capital risk
in order to significantly increase the
capacity of volocopter routes and
systems you can implement hubs
and Hoppus the hub is like a train
station where up to 1000 people can be
handled per hour
the transaction of willow copter and
passengers in a hub is a flowing system
conclave Cummins if that's all
frustrated and this is what it looks
like
approaching the hub passengers land on a
platform and are then transported into
the building thus the landing site is
immediately free for the next air taxi
once in the building processes are
slowed down you can disembark safely and
without stress protected from wind or
rain in the map wah and paths in the hub
in addition to processing the embarking
and disembarking batteries or fuel cells
will be changed automatically of
Kelantan fiscal Lawton once recharged
the air taxi goes into the parking deck
or sets off for the next flight to hop
South azides the hub ensure safety for
example in case of emergency all flight
vehicles can land and be parked in a
very short time this is an amazing
moment in time you are now at a point
it's feasible to build a new type of
personal transportation vehicle that
will take you to the air Kitty Hawk is a
california-based company and at Kitty
Hawk we're really proud to be part of
this global movement to rethink - to
reimagine how all of us can about every
day but Kitty Hawk we know the
technology is feasible because we are
ready doing it today we're introducing
Cora a vehicle you've never seen
Quora is 100% electric in there for
emissions free like a helicopter Cora
takes off and lands vertically no
runways or airports needed Cora can
cover trips up to a hundred kilometres
at speeds faster than 150 kilometres an
hour and unlike cars on the road Cora
will never be stuck in traffic hora is
self piloting which means you don't need
a pilot's license we're really at the
beginning of our quest it's one thing to
design and rigorously test an aircraft
but it's another thing to make it useful
to society that is the reason that we
are so excited and proud to be working
with the people and the government of
New Zealand to roll out a commercial air
taxi service New Zealand's got a strong
history of expanding and pushing the
envelope with a lot of different
technologies for a small country we
punch well above our weight New Zealand
it's known all around the world for
their aviation standards we have a
government that recognizes that if we do
our job and they do their job ultimately
in the decades to come there will be
tens of thousands of these aircraft we
think this is the logical next step in
the evolution of Transportation
I think everybody on earth they dream of
flying especially as a kid we look up in
the sky and you see a bird or you even
have dreams at night where you just
start flying and now and with flyer
we're gonna be able to walk out to that
dock today get inside of it and start
flying I feel completely prepared to get
into flyer and takeoff we did the
training yesterday so we did the
simulator training and then we did the
strap down where he turned on the
vehicle and kind of revved it up and it
was tied down to the ground I felt the
power of flyer and now to take the
straps off and just start flying it's a
kid's dream come true
it's a complete breakthrough in aviation
to have something so simple so intuitive
that someone like me can just get in and
enjoy the freedom and the joy of flight
that was incredible it's like it
so here at lilium we are developing the
world's first entirely electric vertical
takeoff and landing jet
we want to establish and build a new
means of transportation
although you're working on it every day
you still got these moments where you
think wow that is something really
really cool that we're doing here and
and it just feels amazing to be to be
actually a really big part of that
so here at liliom we are developing the
