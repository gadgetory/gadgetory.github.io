Oh
Oh
you
here I'd love you to how logical
innovation we are currently developing a
wearable smartphones in the form of a
glove our main aim is to push the
boundaries of wearable
telecommunications and move into a new
area of a fully wearable world people
who are into sports or any other
physical activities often struggle to
carry and use their smartphone in its
full usable capacity glove these aimed
at people who engage in sports and other
demanding activities whatever the
situation glovesy is right for you both
founders are sparring athletes and faced
a major problem while exercising the
difficulty to use and carry their
smartphone smartwatches and fitness
trackers did not work efficiently for
them the reason these devices must be
paired with an existing smart phone
while operating them multiple issues can
arise no feasible way to initiate a call
or send a text message take videos and
photos or even be able to use popular
applications on a small SmartWatch
display and that tells websi was born a
wearable smartphone in the form of a
glove can do so much more than just a
regular one we strongly believe that
glovesy will exponentially increase the
quality of our lives not only in sports
but often other activities of our daily
routine for thousands of years human
beings have taken notes in the same way
by writing down but focusing on writing
down means that you easily miss the
action now there is finally a much
better way to make sure you never fall
behind introducing titan mode a small
portable recording device that
automatically turns what's being said

writing everything down when Titan note

how we can actually improve our
customers lives your text is converted
