you to hideaway the bottle you'll always
reach for because it's always within
reach experts suggest that for optimum
health
the average active person drink over 10
glasses of water every day but for those
of us who are always on the go it's
nearly impossible to stay hydrated
without reaching for disposable bottles
of water or sugary sports drinks bottled
water may be convenient but it's not
cheap it costs more than two thousand
times more than tap water even though
it's less regulated for health and
quality then there's the bottle every
minute US consumers throw out ninety
thousand plastic bottles in less than a
quarter are actually recycled the rest
end up in our landfills and in our
streets parks and beaches we need a
convenient solution to disposable
plastic bottles that fits our active
lifestyle
so as a freelance product designer I'm
traveling a lot visiting clients
visiting factories going to trade shows
I was looking for a water bottle that
would not take up a lot of space in my
carry-on and I started looking around
for a product that would work that would
still be functional and it wasn't out
there as I'm going through airports I'm
seeing so many travelers probably with
the same problem and I figured this is a
problem I can solve myself you know once
I had a solution for business travel I
realized this had great application my
personal life especially in the outdoors
going backpacking or just on hikes
I could bring water with me and when the
bottle was empty it it collapses and
goes away and takes no extra space in my
back you know that black hole inside
your car should have had a drop stop
that bottomless pit Carmita triangle
should have had a drop stop that
annoying gap between the seat and center
console should have had a drop stop now
you can stop the drop withdraw stop hi
I'm Jeff and I'm mark and our amazing
invention will save you time money and
maybe even your life watch this money
down the drink make up jewelry cell
phone but with drops up you'll be saving
cash in a flash and you'll never have to
search for anything ever again we came
up with the idea of drop stop after my
phone fell I took my eyes off the road
nearly hit a pedestrian and almost
smashed into a pole don't drop and drive
keep your eyes on the road not in your
gap
the secret to drops up is his built-in
slot designed to go around the seat belt
catch a Goering to the seat that means
nothing's getting through not a dime not
a toothpick and since drop stop slides
it's always at your side drop stops not
some cheap piece of foam
it's high-grade neoprene built to last
look at all the crumbs and dirt now
you're free from debris drop stop may
look too wide but it's squishy inside
which means one size fits all and since
the gap is always a dark shadow drop
stop blends with any color interior drop
stop works on the driver's side and the
passenger side so if you call right now

Oh
the world around us is changing as we
speak and with that change comes a
constant evolution of capturing Eliza's
GoPro allowed us to be present in this
world recording her beauty of being
there right in the action drones allows
us to take beautiful steady aerial
images from the sky we combine vests of
both worlds and created air air let's
should take aerial videos and photos
simply by throwing your GoPro
you
this is how it works start recording or
connect your GoPro to the remote or
smartphone app now simply snap the GoPro
in slide the two wings into each other
and screw them on to the head you can
start shooting
we have taken air into the forest upon
the mountains out on the water into the
city and this is just the beginning

your GoPro air we'll be ready for it

and throw air straight up to take
incredible aerial selfies

take with you on your adventures

bag and you're good to go
hi guys my name is mark and I start out
air with a couple of friends almost a
year ago what started out as a fun
experiment to get our Gophers in the air
without use of a drone turned out to be
an amazing experience on its own and the
results they look more alive and dynamic
than ever before the feeling you get
when you freely throw your GoPro in the
air is one that we want to share with
everyone and that's why we are bringing
it to you fast for the past year we
sketch modeled and prototype so we have
the perfect design and now we are ready
for mass production the manufacturing it
is all done in the Netherlands and we
are ready to go the minute we reach our
goal we are very curious to see what
you're going to do with there step up
your GoPro game and back us today
