speakers the most fun you can have with

playing music used to be easy you'd put
on a record or put in a new C
but these days it can be a real hassle
it's not connecting introducing boom
touch the amazing speaker that only has
to touch your music player to work
that's right
no Bluetooth no wires you just lay it
down for amazing booming sounds the
secret is magnetic field induction which
isolates and amplifies the audio signal
when a device touches down instantly
creating amazing sound no plugins you'll
have to bluetooth or anything you are
the volume levels without a speaker here
are the levels when connected to a
typical speaker and now we lay the same
device on the boom touch speaker as you
can hear and now see the levels are even
stronger boom touch is compatible with
any device that has an external speaker
can play music continuously for hours
and is super lightweight and portable
that makes Boone touch perfect for
working outside relaxing by the pool or
entertaining guests wherever you are
simply lay it down for amazing sound you
could pay more than $100 for a Bluetooth
speaker your are guys how's it going so
today I'm gonna be giving you a review
of the basic verb Bluetooth speaker so
without further ado let's get into the
review so the bass egg is a sleek and
durable portable speaker which uses the
surfaces to conduct sound using this
metal desk on the bottom of the product
to transform everyday objects a good
desk coffee table over that matter any
surface into an omnidirectional speaker
by wave vibration conduction rather than
traditional front firing speakers
so before I go any further I'd like to
show you the ports on the bass egg we
have the mini-usb line in to charge the
product and LED indicator a switch
between bluetooth off and on and another
led you may be wondering how to connect
the bass egg to your device all you need
to do is switch the basic to the
Bluetooth setting go to bluetooth on
your device you should see basic in the
devices pane and all you need to do from
here is pair the device and the bass egg
and you're all set so here's a sound
test
one thing that I found with the bass egg
is that when you turn the volume up to
its loudest on the device the audio from
the bass egg is very distorted I also
found that the adhesive at the bottom of
the metal disc is very sticky a bit too
sticky in my opinion but it just might
be my unit to charge a basic all you
need to do is plug the mini USB into the
base egg and it's your computer and the
red LED should light up on the base egg
which turns off when the charge is
complete and you might be wondering what
if I don't have a Bluetooth device to
use the product with basic allows you to
use a headphone jack instead of
Bluetooth which is a very nice touch so
my overall opinions are that the bass
egg looks amazing aesthetically sounds
great however it's very very heavy and
it retails for around a hundred pounds
I'll leave the cheapest link to the
product in the description box below
