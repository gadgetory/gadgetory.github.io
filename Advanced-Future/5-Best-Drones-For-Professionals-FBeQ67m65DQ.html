powerful flying camera that you can take
anywhere it's so clever
it activates by recognizing you just
launch it from the palm of your hand
it even returns when you call it and
land like this easy can't get everyone
in the shot no problem
watch as it hovers precisely in place
always at your command control it with
your hands
remote controller mobile device or DJI
goggles using GPS spark knows where it
is even if you don't it'll even sense
obstacles to avoid things in front of it
and come home safely
think you got smooth moves Sparks
footage is smoother it takes the shake
out of your shot so you look like a pro
not feeling the control steps performed
preset flight maneuvers with a single
click
and get those epic shots here's a way to
stand out from the crowd
spark automatically adds shallow
depth-of-field to your photos if you
don't know how to fly just tap fly let's
see if you can handle sport mode
spark keeps you in the frame so all you
need to do is act naturally edit your
epic videos and share them instantly
spark your aerial creativity anywhere
all you need to do is seize the moment
I'm going to show you something
incredible is fascinating an immersive
flight experience it is a drum without
remote control simplify your filling and
tilt reform to control position in
direction if you want to fly forward
just a tilt forward bow do you fall flat
and the drum will remain in that exact
position using advanced satellite and
sensor technology for this reason we
have named our flagship flight mode
avatar flying the ghost zone is super
easy because all you have to do is just
tell your smartphone to control it a lot
of times remote controls can be tricky
and hard to use and you're not sure
which way to move the stick as for
controlling the gimbal it doesn't use
dials on remote controller anymore it
has been integrated with VR goggles
looking up and down what do you see is
what I get I have no technology
experience whatsoever
I can't even swipe my computer clean but
anyways I flew this just held the phone
and tilted it and it did whatever I
wanted I looked around and a camera
moved with me from takeoff to a point
from orbit mode to selfie mode even
those maneuvers that take two operators
with remote control all these functions
have been integrated into even play app
what's more you can download the videos
and pictures from the 4k spherical
camera through Wi-Fi and share them to
your social media also you can keep your
stories of flying in flight records and
flight rankings
similar to driving cars some people
prefer a manual transmission and other
automatic we like to think of ghosts
drawn as an automatic transmission
flying experience making it save
inconvenient for anyone to fly even zero
experience required the Mavic pro is not
just a new drone it's a whole new type
of drone we merged power and smart
features making it easy for everyone to
fly and create beautiful images the
toughest challenge for us was to find
the sweet spots between form and
function when engineering the folding
arms we wanted to save as much space as
possible we really wanted to make it
quick to unfold and leave enough room
for the powerful processors and system
system this took several attempts and
many many prototypes
in one of our earlier prototypes the
arms took up way too much space when
folded almost two-thirds of the entire
volume combined with the space that we
needed for the internals this meant the
Mavic was much larger than we wanted and
another attempt the amazonian took up
half the volume but there's a lot of
wasted space in between body and arms
eventually we solved this problem and
creates an easy flick to unfold
mechanism seam from above the Phenom sit
flush against the body when folded we
carved out two indents at the rear of
the airframe to fit the motors saving
additional space the rear arms fold out
in a three dimensional motion and snap
into place in one sweep with this design
you can have your Maverick Pro unfolded
in under five seconds powerful
components generate a lot of heat
especially when they're placed close
together so for the first time ever on a
DJI drone we integrated a heat sink at
the base made from museum aluminum alloy
and a centrifugal fan behind the good
wall
the fan pulls in air from the front of
the aircraft and channels it across the
heatsink anticipating heat we wouldn't
go through all this trouble without
making sure you have a great camera we
spent thousands of hours trying to
region air and shrink the stabilization
technology found in our phantom series
one of the major challenges we ran into
when making a stabilized camera this
small was a stiffness of the electrical
wires the mechanics the structure and
the brushless motors had to be
specifically engineered to take this
into account plus it's the first DJ
camera that's able to rotate 90 degrees
for portrait shots we also wanted a
remote controller for the maverick pro
that would feel natural and familiar in
people's hands so they would be more
confident when they fly that's how we
came up with a small controller that
expands with a pair of grips these grips
also clamp your phone keeping all of
your controls in easy reach the Maverick
pro concentrates some of our most
advanced technologies into one compact
body it's an incredible tool to turn
everyday moments into fantastic art
wherever you go
New Age accuracy is very important when
doing cell tower inspections my job is
basically to take pictures of the things
that they need to be inspecting in that
way it gives them kind of a precursor if
actually sending a person up the pole
what I like the most about the age five
twenty is the stability and the high
winds it's not a very friendly
environment it can be quite hostile at
times just knowing that it's gonna stay
where you want it to be that just comes
in so handy especially when you're
flying around $100,000 or pieces of
equipment you need to be able to find
out how far apart things are you need to
see if this corrosion if there's
something that needs to be manually
inspected and you go from your standard
camera to a thermal camera just flip
them in and out I don't believe the
drones can replace the hue and I don't
think they're even intended to all the
drones are really here for is to make
the human experience safer and more
productive I love this bird as
construction site supervisors one thing
that this technology is definitely
bringing to the table is efficiency the
H 5:22 take a lot of data that we need
for our VI M software and our ortho
mapping also the H 520 provides that
accurate data the bird takes off by
itself flies the waypoints by itself
takes the correct photos needed for the
job comes back and lands its autonomous
it's fantastic p90 provides more
resolution so more dots per inch which
means you can get a higher quality more
precise mapping of your jobsite I'm very
happy with h5 20 we'll be using it a lot
more in our construction sites I can
tell you for sure
the ultimate goal in search-and-rescue
is to find the missing person most of
the time if you're looking for a missing
hiker they're gonna have probably built
a fire could probably have been in an
area for a while so you'll be able to
see where they've been
they've been doing the e90 is by far one
of my favorites followed closely by the
thermal camera p90 has the clarity and
the capability of being able to see my
route stuff in a travel I could put it
up real quick fly ahead of us about a
mile see what the Train looks like and
then bring it back so I can eat a frog
in my surgery
with unique CT camera there's our
thermal imaging camera I can do a search
for a body or a heat source and then be
able to switch that payload out to
another camera to get an actual closer
view of what we've found and if that's
our actual target that we're looking for
the low-light feature allows me to make
that happen aged 520 stands out it's
take a little orange and it makes it
very very easy to see for visual line of
sight at a distance when you're in a you
saw our environment it's what do I need
and what don't I need the fact that it
is portable that's the big thing I mean
this has all the engineering features
that we need for search and rescue it's
like they sat down with us beforehand
and they built everything we needed in
search-and-rescue into this bird the 520
is a great product it's leaps and bounds
above all the other competitors as far
as what law enforcement needs for crash
investigation I can get on to a scene
and I can't ask the 520 to do an
automated flight gathering all the data
I need on the scene in under 10 minutes
in one flight
eh by 20 it's a very easy product to get
out of the box and use and train people
I'm very happy with h5 20 feet ability
and reliability
I need a UAS that works the first time
every time what do you need for
incredible aerial imaging a brilliant
camera an aircraft you can trust and the
intelligence to make every shot
cinematic the new Phantom 4 pro has all
this and much more
The Phantom 4 pro camera has an F 2.8
apertures mechanical shutter and large
one-inch sensor coming together to make
brighter more detailed imagery record
cinematic 4k video at higher bit rates
with more advanced compression and a
wider dynamic range 4k 60 frames per
second recording gives you stunning
detailed slow-motion aerial video the
phantom 4 pro is as adept at stills as
it is with video capturing every detail
at 20 megapixels its mechanical shutter
eliminates rolling shutter bending grab
the perfect moment using burst mode
all of this makes the phantom4 pro the
most advanced aerial camera ever found
in the Phantom series The Phantom 4 pro
is now a huge step forward I'm taking
photos of the lava when it's darker out
and the glow of the lavas coming off of
it the image sensor that's in this
camera now is 1 inch sensor 20
megapixels that extra dynamic range
allows me to really get everything into
one shot in the landscape that's
extremely important see your shot
clearly even in direct sunlight with the
new ultra bright 5.5 inch monitor that's
more than twice as bright as most
tablets inside is DJI light bridge
technology it automatically detects
interference and switches from two point
four to five point eight gigahertz
transmission at takeoff cutting through
the noise for more reliability the
built-in monitor on the Phantom 4 Pro is
so bright I'm actually able to see in
direct sunlight and that's really
allowing me to compose my shot and get
what I really want to capture active
Trek has now been expanded with three
new intelligent flight modes profile
tracks your subject horizontally from
any side spotlight locks the camera on a
subject while you fly in almost any
direction circle swings 360 degrees
around the subject tap fly has also been
improved adding reverse tap fly making
it perfect for aerial selfies
flying The Phantom 4 Pro is even more
worryfree a set of rear visual sensors
has been added to existing forward and
downward sensors combined with new
infrared obstacle sensors on its sides
the Phantom 4 Pro has five directions of
sensing if image signal is lost it
returns home while dynamically avoiding
obstacles and even flies back along its
original flight path until signal is
regained every minute in the air counts
the new high-capacity battery flight
time has been increased to 30 minutes
when it comes to speed the Phantom 4 pro
is 10 miles per hour faster with full
support of its obstacle sensing systems
with it's stunning camera 1 inch sensor
ultra bright monitor obstacle sensing
and intelligence the phantom 4 pro
brings professional quality aerial
imaging and flight capabilities to more
pilots around the world</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
