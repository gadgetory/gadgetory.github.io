biking is in my blood a long time ago my
dad designed one of the first biking
computers and I've always wanted to
follow in his footsteps by further
improving the biking experience so I put
a lot of work into customizing my own
bike over the years and what started out
with safety and visibility in mind
quickly became a much larger project
this is the story of how I came to
create Helius bars the first integrated
lighting system for your bike it's time
to turn your ordinary bike into a smart
bike
at first visibility was obvious I
started by designing handlebars with a
powerful built-in headlight and rear
LEDs allowing for a wide range of
functionality the most important goal
was to create a presence for bikers that
would increase awareness for others on
the road I wanted to convey information
about my next move to the rest of
traffic blinkers were a key component
but so was the design of ambient
lighting the rear LEDs allow me to
choose a color for a particular ride or
turn on the visual speedometer which
changes color according to the bike
speed allowing cars to see if I'm
turning or slowing down creates a safer
experience on the road then I realized
that security should continue even after
riding like most people I was used to
locking my bike up but I wanted more
peace of mind so it gave the bars a GPS
feature and now I can simply text my
bike to find it at any time these
features were great
but designing a smart bike meant
building a software platform to connect
to my smart devices and for this I
brought in another programmer and
engineer to accomplish the goal
I wanted the bike to recognize me and be
ready to ride when I walked up I also
wanted the bike to safely provide
directions a feature that would keep my
eyes on the road
now we're eager to get back on the
streets with the smarter bike and we
want others to join us we're already
looking ahead at new ways we can improve
the biking experience but for now keep
it in 2005 relight introduced the
world's first bike lights running on
magnetic energy today real light is
mounted on one out of three of all bikes
in the Danish cities and worldwide sales
has reached more than 10 million sets of
magnetic bike lights magnetic energy
means no battery which means that the
light is always on and this daytime
running light feature is what yields the
largest safety effect research based on
a large-scale test showed reductions in
accidents up to 19 percent now real
light introduces the next generation of
this life-saving magnetic bike light
relights EO mounts on your bike in
seconds with a new patent-pending
mounting system remount the light can be
mounted in any vertical position on the
stays and you can easily move it to
another bike the magnet on the spoke has
become smaller and more powerful
most importantly the light platform has
been upgraded to provide high light
intensity and good side visibility while
the repower technology keeps you safe
even at a standstill
as with the original this new version of
Revo lights will provide unprecedented
360-degree visibility with a functional
headlight that allows you to see where
you're going in a smart taillight that
can sense your speed and will flash when
slowing down
we're on IndieGoGo to add the next level
of function into our newest version of
the lights we want to add in the ability
to connect our already smart lights to
your phone to provide a number of
awesome features for starters real time
battery life so you can make sure your
lights are always ready for your next
ride with Eclipse the battery now snaps
directly into the ring making it much
more accessible while removing any need
for cables or parts near the hub and
making installation a snap we want our
lights to work with any riding style so
this new version will include a feature
that recognizes the time of day and
turns the lights on for you if it senses
you're about to ride to achieve the
lighting effect Revo lights calculate
your speed and for the first time we'll
be able to give you this data so you can
accurately track your speed and distance
and work towards the riding goals when
developing Revo lights we focused on
creating innovative essential tools for
commuters like handlebar activated turn
signals to make it easier to grab a
driver's attention when turning we also
plan to add features for any commuter
like weather alerts letting you know
ahead of time what to expect and
ensuring you never get caught without
your jacket but with all these added
functions we wanted to make sure your
lights are secure so just like with the
previous version of our lights they are
designed to be locked up along with your
wheels so if you do have to leave your
bike on the street you don't have to
worry about removing them or having them
stolen celebrate the launch of Eclipse
we partnered with pier fix to bring you
special edition bicycles with Revo
lights already installed exclusively for
IndieGoGo
whether you're an everyday commuter or a
more casual rider we have you covered
with the Revo lights Coolidge and Reva
lights a royal bicycles
