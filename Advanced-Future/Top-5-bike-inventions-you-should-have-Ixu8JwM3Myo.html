tim loves his bike well-loved
tim has been looking for the best way to
protect his bike but he hasn't been very
lucky
Tim feel safer now with Sherlock
Sherlock is a small GPS tracker hidden
in the frame of the bicycle it's
connected to a mobile app that lets him
know where his bike is at any time we
want to set cyclists free from the fear
of theft which is something we've all
experienced we've been working on the
design and the electronics of Sherlock
for about a year now for the printing
the first prototypes and studying how to
make it as small as possible so it can
be hid then inside the frame of the
bicycle
Sherlock is designed to be easily
installed in the handlebars it can fit
any shape of tube thanks to its flexible
design and it is completely invisible
from the outside so the design of the
bike is not altered and thieves cannot
see that it is there if your bicycle
moves and it's not you moving it you
will receive an immediate alert on your
phone
Sherlock tracks the position of your
bicycle directly on your smartphone to
help you be reunited once again we are
now running tests and finalizing the
design of the product but we need your
have to get Sherlock into production be
like team support us today and get your
hands on one of the first Sherlock ever
made
you
the sports switch arrow system is the
quick release arrow bar mount your rode
bikes handlebar and easily attaches and
removes without tools which lets you
convert your a road bike into a
triathlon bike sort of on demand as you
need it the air bars have a built-in
safety mechanism so that they're very
securely attached here and above they
slide on and you just clamp down the
lever and they're locked in place the
seat post is the other half of the
switch arrow system it basically lets
you ride a road bike with a steeper
effective see tube angle so in the
normal Road position it simulates just a
normal 73 degrees C tube angle of a road
bike but as you're riding you can easily
switch it forward into a steeper C tube
angle it takes you up to about 77 76 77
degrees lets you ride with a more open
to c2 hip angle and also feel more
comfortable for the arrow position so we
get both positions on your road bike you
have your regular Road position that's
intact you also have a better narrow
two years ago my girlfriend asked me to
give em all by so she could ready to
work which I did and then I got scared
scared because large cities are not
always a safe place to ride a bike you
have to swallow MUA between particles
the size of a truck and urban drivers
are not always the most patient or
diplomat citizens so I started asking
myself how could I make this better for
her and I made a list of all the basic
specifications that a perfect urban
mobility system would need to eat you
need maneuverability which means a short
wheelbase and a steep head - to reduce
your turning radius so you can manage
extremely tight corners a large front
wheel to overcome any obstacle the city
puts in your way a small motorized rear
wheel to increase acceleration and climb
steeper roads you should be standing in
an upright position because there is a
lot going on in the city you need to
keep an eye on your surroundings and be
able to get on and off very easily it
needs to be simple easy to use intuitive
and almost maintenance-free
after months of brainstorming the basic
idea of the stinky bike was born a
vintage concept with a modern twist a
lot of sweat and tears later with many
talented people who join the project we
ended up with amazing product and now
with your hub the sticky bike could be a
game-changer
you
it's rare for established bike companies
to collaborate on a new product together
especially to grow a new category that
is barely recognized by our industry for
this project we turn an extra cycle each
brought our unique strengths together it
was a natural partnership because we
shared the same vision removing barriers
to urban mobility hi I'm Josh Homme I'm
a co-founder and the team captain at
turn buses what I love about Josh is
that he's a brilliant pragmatic doer who
is deeply passionate about bicycle
quality and design these days he runs
turn an international company based in
Taipei that is devoted to finding new
and innovative ways to make bikes fit
better into our everyday lives and they
have the patents to prove it hi I'm Ross
Evans inventor and founder of extra
cycle 20 years ago I set out to make a
bike that would change the world as an
idealistic engineering student I landed
in war-torn Nicaragua in a tin and
cinderblock shed i welded together a
bike that would alter the course of my
life and as it turned out the lives of
people worldwide
the city is full of incredible
opportunity and things to explore
designing a bike that can unlock the
hidden treasures of our cities is a
challenging design problem for this
project we at turn an extra cycle each
mod are unique strengths together to
build a special bike the cargo node
it had to have integrated lighting
robust smart and always ready a bike
with a passenger seat meet a friend go
out on a date it's a must quality parts
wide gear range it's good on the hills
and strong brakes stop you fast it even
has a pump hidden in the seat post carry
your laptop laundry kitty litter camping
gear picnic supplies you name it all the
bikes are important because they allow
you to take a product which is
incredibly efficient and it's one of the
best inventions ever the bicycle and
they make it important whether that is
being able to fold it and bring it on
bus onto the subway into the trunk of a
car so that it fits into your life in
this liberated landscape there is a new
opportunity if you could unlock your
city what would it look like what would
your life look like
here's how you can support the vision
back us on our Kickstarter campaign page
and join us in the magical unfolding
landscape of an ignited light be moved
because life has a way of unfolding
beautifully when you follow your heart
like miracle you got me feeling so</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
