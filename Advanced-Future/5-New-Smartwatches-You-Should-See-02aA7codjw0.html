longest lasting SmartWatch stop charging
and start living
after years of research and networking
with top watch manufacturers we realized
that many popular watch brands use up
our materials and atom plated markup to
their watch prices we immediately took
this as an opportunity to create a watch
brand that not only utilizes the best
materials but also offers unbeatable
prices my name is Dmitry and my name is
Tasya and this is teh leo
when you buy a tailing a watch you're
paying for a high-quality Swiss movement
timepiece engineered from premium parts
and materials when you buy a watch from
other leading launch brands you're
paying for their brand name along with
inflated markup prices some watches that
use our same materials can cost up to
five hundred dollars right now you can
pre-order one of our timepieces on
Kickstarter for only $90 each Tahlia
watch is engineered with a precise Swiss
movement interior so you could be sure

you can quickly mix and match any watch
face with any of our fine leather straps
one of our watches can have many looks
for a variety of different occasions
each watch already comes with one strap
but if you'd like to add more straps
just add $30 for every extra band to
your selected pledge we decided to name
our collection after breed gods and
goddesses to pay tribute to my fiance's
Greek heritage for the men's collection
we have the Apollo the Poseidon
the Hades and the Aries and for the
ladies collection we have the iris the
Artemis the Athena and the Aphrodite
we name the swatch Brandt a Leo which
originates from the Greek word Dalia
when translated this word means perfect
in English this is the standard we keep
in mind when creating our product
experience our goal is simply to provide
you with the highest quality watches for
prices that other reputable watch brands
simply can't compete with and call this
