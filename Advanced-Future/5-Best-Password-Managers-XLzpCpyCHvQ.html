hi everyone welcome back to Joann tackle
ever I'm Joann and I'll be taking a look
at the gatekeeper wireless computer lock
and tracker with Bluetooth 4.0 I have
the black silver and gold versions here
with me today and it's also available in
blue the PC lock and tracker is great
for protecting your content from prying
eyes and it's especially useful in
office and hospital settings it's also
compatible with both Windows and Mac
here's a look at the included
accessories that come in each box you
get one gate keeper key and USB lock to
cr2032 batteries are also provided
you only need one and the other is extra
there's also a keyring in the package
and a Quick Start Guide as for
dimensions the gatekeeper key measures
45 millimeters by 25 millimeters by 7
millimeters and it weighs only 10 grams
it has a simple design with a chic and
modest pattern at the front this is the
black model and here's a closer look at
the silver and gold keys I like their
subtle coloring there's a keyring hole
on the right corner of the key with the
keyring attached just hook it on to your
own keys and take the gatekeeper key
with you wherever you go here's a group
at the bottom of the key for removing
the back cover use your fingernail to
take off the cover inside is the battery
compartment for installing the cr2032
battery insert the battery with the plus
icon facing up next download the main
application software then install the
firmware update once you have finished
downloading the software insert the USB
lock into a USB port on your PC or USB
hub connected to your PC then click OK
you won't be able to auto lock and
unlock your system without registering
your key first
once you click register key touch your
gatekeeper key to the USB lock and the
pairing process will take effect next up
you can choose to skip or imput
credentials if you skip the process you
will not be able to unlock your PC
automatically if you decide to input
your system password and click done both
the auto lock and unlock features will
become available to you after the
software update let's move on to the
firmware update make sure all three
items are checked off place your key
next to the USB lock then click Next the
firmware will update without a hitch and
then you're all done you can change if
the lock distance from near to far I've
tested the near settings and the key
seems to lock the system once it's 10 to
15 feet away there's an option to test
the lock and unlock settings make sure
to save your settings
you make changes and quick gatekeeper
only if you wish to deactivate the lock
and key functions keep in mind that your
computer will not lock while this window
is open just close out of the gatekeeper
window to start using the locking key
I'll place the key just outside my room
door and leave it there
once the key is far enough away the
system will automatically lock itself if
you have a long complicated password
instead of inputting the password each
time your PC is locked the gatekeeper
will automatically log you back in once
the key is near the USB lock more
features include the gatekeeper
enterprise solution for businesses this
software can manage all gatekeepers on a
network and give access to application
settings as well as event logs there's
even a gatekeeper app so you can keep
track of your important items like your
bike book bag and more via the Bluetooth
location tracker
you can even set alarms when items are
out of range
open key is a device to game at the
password problem we all need passwords
but as many security professionals have
pointed out just using a password is not
sufficient to protect your private
photos or anything for that matter we
need something that is less prone to
being stolen or compromised the solution
has long been two-factor authentication
with two-factor authentication even if
your password is compromised you have
something else like a passcode that
changes every 30 seconds that has to be
entered in order to log in but then the
problem is how to manage two-factor
tokens easily and transparently no one
wants to carry a keychain with multiple
tokens and a phone with multiple apps
just to log in that is where open key
comes in open key removes the hassle of
forgetting your passwords and serves as
a universal two-factor authentication
platform that can replace your multiple
Hardware tokens and apps the way this
works is the face of open key has six
capacitive touch buttons these buttons
serve two purposes first in order to
enable the device for use a pin must be
entered this way if open key has ever
lost or stolen it will be unusable
without knowing the pin the second
purpose of the six buggy's are to
support multiple authentication methods
such as the one-time passwords used by
Yubikey Google Authenticator and the new
universal two-factor method open key can
be configured to your desired preference
for example pressing button one can
enter your user name and password to
unlock your laptop or workstation
pressing button two can login to your
LastPass account using the Google
Authenticator method of two-factor
authentication and pressing button 3 can
log into your email using the universal
two-factor method of authentication
since we support universal two-factor
you can login to an unlimited number of
accounts such as Dropbox Amazon and
Salesforce just to name a few
with open key there is no longer any
reason to carry around a janitor's
keyring of tokens key fobs and use
multiple apps just
access the sites you need to securely
open he is waterproof durable and
smaller than a typical USB flash drive
so how secure is it open key supports
pin protection so unlike other tokens
and key fobs if open key has ever lost
or stolen it will be unusable without
the pin all of the keys and passwords
are encrypted with military-grade AES
encryption if an incorrect pin is
entered open key blinks three times if
an attacker attempts to guess the
passcode the device will perform a
factory default wiping all sensitive
data after 10 failed attempts the device
is even protected for more advanced
physical hacking attacks by using
Hardware security features in fact open
key is the world's first token to
implement self-destruct and plausible
deniability features a self-destruct pin
or a plausible deniability pin can be
set when you first activate your open
key with the self-destruct in if you are
ever forced to give up your PIN the
self-destruct pin can be provided
instead which will wipe the open key
with the plausible deniability pin if
you are ever forced to give up your PIN
the plausible deniability pin can be
provided instead which will activate the
open key but using a second profile that
contains passwords that were set up to
look real and may even work to log into
websites but are just dummy accounts
these features make it possible for
journalists or for those who live in
restrictive countries have an encryption
to use the open key and since the
mentioned second profile only functions
as a regular password manager it would
be plausible that they're open key did
not utilize encryption
best of all open key is always open
source and we believe that transparency
is the key to security only you own your
keys and you don't just have to take our
word for it this can be verified by you
or by independent evaluation this also
means that unlike other vendors who
embrace security through obscurity open
key will be open and able to adapt to it
you
welcome to yubico in this video in the
how to series I will show registration
of a Fido Universal second factor or u2f
security key by yubico with my Google
account in the Chrome browser as you can
see in my inbox I have already enabled
2-step verification on my account
to protect my account with a security
key I click on my username then on the
accounts link and select the Security
tab in the password box click on the
settings link next to the 2-step
verification label then select the
security keys tab I currently do not
have any security keys registered so I
click the add security key button which
brings up the security key registration
page
click on the register button insert my
security key by yubico wait for the blue
light to flash steadily then touch the
gold disc
Google shows me I now have one security
key registered on my account
I can add more security keys for backup
etc let's see it in use so I first log
out of my account logging back in I
enter my password as normal however I
now get a 2-step verification page
showing the security key dialog I insert
my security key by yubico wait for the
blue flashing light then touch the keys
gold disk and I'm in strong 2-step
verification with the touch of a button
as I touch ID you'll be able to access
your computer's user account your
Facebook Twitter Instagram or any other
website online accounts that you
previously would lock onto the password
and all of it with just one touch you
can use much stronger and longer
password 12 or more symbols without any
problems just put your finger on the I
touch ID and you're in you don't need to
worry that people around you your
classmates colleagues business partners
buddies your wife or husband would see
your password your private photos videos
documents and any other information will
always be protected
