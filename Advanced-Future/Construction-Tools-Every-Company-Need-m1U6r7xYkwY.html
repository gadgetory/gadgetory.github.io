and never miss another update the tools
were using with the DX nines were
awesome it's seamless because the tools
are so easy to handle and they're easy
to run the project team and it's an
organization it's really important that
we work with our customers to get
real-time feedback take that input and
warp it into the next generation tool
got a really good feel to it but really
sturdy comfortable you come up with a
narrower handle which is better now
instead of operators feeling the impact
in their shoulder now it's gonna be
spread to their elbows so it's more of a
natural ability
you compare that tool the puddle welding
and bent over
that's no comparison welding is so hard
on your on your hamstrings and I go hold
my back would be so stiff and then I've
seen this and I was like man I gotta
learn how to do that that's a lot easier
to train a guy on healthy versus balding
you take your shot you take a look use
your card if need be one zine normally
one guy going 10,000 square foot Willie
Higgins
some people do and we wanted to make a
little more robots so there's about 120
different parts that either been changed
upgraded or modified they also have a
digital service indicator on top which
hopefully will give our guys more
insight of what the tool is doing it
allows us to get feedback from our guys
which guys are doing what how much
they're doing it's now we're giving the
customers real-time diagnostics and when
the Tonys between give the operator
motor information at their fingertips to
really see you know what's happening
with the stools we're taking the decking
tools digital
if you really value your employees and
you care about your employees and you
want to keep those employees how could
you not go to Hill T and say hey what's
our alternative here they care about our
projects they want us to see
consider them to be a partner that
opened our eyes to what hilt he's really
about qubit is a new blade designed to
run on most oscillating multi tools the
blade uses a patent-pending technology
that allows technicians to cut exact
rectangular holes necessary for the
installation of retrofit boxes the blade
can penetrate sheetrock in seconds qubit
is easily attached and can be rotated a
full 360 degrees locking in 30 degree
increments to cut the technician places
qubit in the desired location and simply
pushes the oscillating blade through
creating the exact rectangular hole
required to install the retrofit box the
blade is completely safe to use and will
not harm the technician my name's Tim
dhoka and I'm a few Dekker I think it's
great I think it's really good compared
to the last model the 3.3 battery a lot
stronger lasts a lot longer
the clutch doesn't have to be turned up
all the way so that helps so ly I think
that makes it last a little bit longer I
was able to put 1,800 screws with this
one compared to about 800 to 850 with
the old model filo Vandermeer
and perhaps me the most about this tool
was the length of the life of the
battery and the light weights but yet is
harmful and a typical day when I'm using
this tool here I'm doing a ball at 3
bundles worth of deck number 12 text
screw 3 inch deck these are just going
to deck the deck screw in the side laps
that's about it
we did do tech fives into the actual
steel and I put in about 140 on one
charge the batteries charging in the
amount of time that you're using it it's
there isn't a problem and it was</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
