outside profiles of metal roofing panels
or metal duct work and are beefy enough
to cut through seams and you can easily
disengage malko double cut blades from
the cutting path the blades can also be
quickly reengaged to continue cutting
both double-cut turbo share models use
the same long lasting blades which are
also easily replaced on the job for a
double cut share performance in a
versatile one and only turbo share
