while providing smart features and crisp
HD video setting up your gyro Wi-Fi
system is simple this is a 3 pack which
is a great start for most homes we
recommend 1 euro per thousand square
feet
start with the arrow marked start you'll
connect it directly to your modem make
sure you've downloaded the free euro app
from the Apple App Store or Google Play
disconnect and unplug your modem and
existing router then connect your arrow
to your modem using the Ethernet cable
that came in the box and either Ethernet
port plug in your arrow with the power
cord finally plug your modem back into
power the Eero app will automatically
detect your arrow and help you set up
your Wi-Fi network now set a location to
help manage your era and create a
network name and password your network
should be up and running in no time the
magic comes from having multiple arrows
placed throughout your home so you're
always close to one and have strong
signal and the Eero app tap add another
era the app will guide you through
placement when you found the best spot
for your second hero plug it into power
the app will detect the arrow
automatically and help you set it up
repeat the same steps for any other
arrows you want to add to your network
if you place one of your arrows out of
range the app will tell you to move it
closer to another arrow
euros work best when they're within 40
feet of each other and out in the open
ideally on top of a counter TV stand or
shelf you want to minimize obstructions
like walls furniture and appliances
between them euros like to be able to
see each other
