Leatherman is proud to introduce the
revolutionary Raptor medical shears for
military and civilian emergency medical
responders the Raptor medical shears is
a high quality state-of-the-art
replacement for traditional disposable
shears and in true Leatherman fashion it
incorporates a number of other tools
specifically for first responders it
comes with the strap cutter it also has
a slot for open in the o2 tanks and has
an innovative easy to use ring cutter it
doesn't have to twist them all you have
to do is clip the end cuts right through
rings and it also has a glass breaker on
the team at Leatherman worked closely
with Special Operations medics
firefighters and EMT personnel to find
out what these professionals wanted in
Leatherman design shears with that
feedback the engineers designed a
high-performance tool built to withstand
the rigors of daily use when a medic is
on site the situation is already bad so
you don't want to make it worse by
having a cheap chair that's gonna fail
and break when you use it that's why
though they've been decided to make the
Raptor to give the quality of a product
that's gonna work every time for a
lifetime of use it's got a lot of meat
to it it feels durable I don't have any
worries about it breaking before
becoming dull it did work through a lot
of that we put it through the testing
out here
Swatt nice absolutely love this tool it
does the function of about five tools in
one and it does each one of those jobs
so well it's truly an amazing tool a lot
of my guys at the fire station we're
impressed with this tool size instead of
carrying many tools we just have to
carry this one tool built with the
superior 420hc stainless steel the
serrated raptor shears will make quick
work of various materials and medical
supplies and they can be taken apart
easily for thorough cleaning the lanyard
attachment gives you a third carry
option and the zytle handles not only
provide extra grip when wet but allow
for comfortable use in hot or cold
environments
another advantage to the Leatherman
Raptor is you can make it compact by
simply pushing the 2 button rotating the
handles down you can make it half the
size even with a wrapper close we still
have access to the strap cutter the
oxygen wrench the carbide glass break
and the lanyard attachment for more than
25 years Leatherman tools have been
helping everyday people deal with
expected and unexpected jobs and
situations but now there's a tool for
the men and women who face the
unexpected every day
it's here the Leatherman mutt created
for those who deal with the unexpected
on a very regular basis the CRKT tool is
a useful instrument with versatile
features designed to take on any job
with confidence a flathead and Phillips
screwdriver
easily engage at the touch of a button
screwdriver bits and a magnetic holder
fit onto the driver head the t-handle
configuration at superior torquing power
a convenient blade opens and closes
easily with one hand the saw blade opens
with a thumb stud and adds additional
utility holes on the side work together
with the utility blade to strip
different gauges of wire box wrench
sizes are inlaid into the sides of the
tool they also function as a bottle
opener at the end of a hard day a deep
carry pocket clip keeps the tools secure
in a work belt or jeans the tool also
includes a nylon belt sheath with a
storage area for screwdriver bits each
folding implement on the tool includes a
steel locking liner for your safety CRKT
knives and tools are fully backed by a
limited lifetime warranty
the CRKT tool take confidence with you
time for a reality check what's the
worst that could happen if this is your
answer
then this is your multi-tool but if you
do real work
probably one a multi-tool built for real
challenges gerber sinner drive is the
first multi-tool with a full-size
standard bit driver on the center axis
that means it drives screws just like
the real thing and you can interchange
your center drive bits with all the bits
you already own by finding another
multi-tool that can do that nope keep
looking but this is no one-trick pony
Gerber Center Drive delivers a full size
outboard Knight with reverse thumb
support
the blade is still be percent longer
than the competition it's okay little
buddy a lot of guys have that problem
since real life doesn't wait the center
Drive driver knife and pliers are all
instantly accessible with one hand
the same can't be said for this one you
also get all the other tools you need
you don't so you'll have everything to
fix just about anything
the multi-tool just got a reality check
at power practical we love high-voltage
shooting smarts and lighting up the
party after bringing this Tesla coil to
life we knew it was time to put one in
everyone's pockets introducing the
sparker a plasma lighter and flashlight
and one the flashlight is a 1 watt
dimmable LED that can run for four hours
on pole bright the removable lid doubles
as a diffuser transforming the light
into a lantern the plasma lighter uses
electricity to create a windproof
solution that requires no flame butane
or fuel
the sparker is great for any of your
outdoor adventures
lighting your barbecue around your house
or simply being prepared
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
