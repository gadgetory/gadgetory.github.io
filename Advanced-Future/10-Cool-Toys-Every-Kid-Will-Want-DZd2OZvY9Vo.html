get a grip on engineering with
mechanical engineering robotic arms
explore the principles of mechanical
engineering as you build six pneumatic
machines that use air pressure to move
pump up the air tank then flip the
switch the air pressure from the tank
pushes a piston in and out to activate
your models build a pivoting robotic arm
that can move items from one location to
another and a robotic grabber that can
pick up objects that are just out of
reach or a robotic cloth that uses three
vertical grippers to lift objects
straight up a thirty-six page full-color
manual provides step-by-step building
instructions explains the mechanics of
real-world robotic arms and legs and
provides an overview of pneumatic
systems and with 204 pieces you can
create your own robotic creations with
mechanical engineering robotic arms ages
