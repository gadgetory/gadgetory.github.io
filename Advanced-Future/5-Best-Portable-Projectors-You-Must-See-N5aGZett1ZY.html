hi everyone welcome back to the Asus
North America YouTube channel today
we're going to take a look at the Asus
s1 mobile LED projector so as you can
see right in front of me this is a tiny
projector that is LED based as the
backlight so you're going to get a great
battery life out of it it's very small
and mobile and portable and you're going
to get a good amount of brightness
compared to the other projectors in the
same class let's take a look at some of
the things that include in the box and
delve a little bit more into the specs
of this projector okay so taking a look
at all the contents of the box that we
have laid out here over on this side you
can see that we have a larger size
travel case so that will fit the
projector along with the AC power
adapter along with other technology or
other toys or USB sticks that you might
have that you want to bring along second
we do include include another case so
this is a smaller leather case that's
really only going to wrap around the
projector itself and that we see on the
top here we have a little cutout that's
going to line up with a USB port on the
back of the projector that we're going
to take a look at in a second and then
of course cable wise you're going to
have a straight up HDMI cable you're
going to have in USB to micro USB cable
and then in MHL cable so you're going to
have HDMI on one end and then you're
going to have micro USB on the other end
and it's going to support both charging
and displaying off phones and tablets ok
let's take a look at the projector
itself here so as you can see we do have
it setup on a little mini tripod it does
have the mounts on the bottom of the
projector itself at the front here we
have a focus as well as a shutter for
the lens so when you're not using it you
can go ahead and close the lens and
protect it from damage and I'm going to
spin this around here and we can see
that on the back of the unit itself we
have a headphone out for audio we have
the HDMI / MHL port and then we have a
USB output port so this will actually
charge your devices on the go the unit
itself is a 22 watt hour battery it
translates to 6,000 milliamp hours so
depending on your phone you're probably
going to get about 2 or 3 full charges
out of this if you're bringing it on the
go and the leather case that we took a
look at a little bit earlier that
matches up with this USB port
so you can use it inside the case and
still be charging your mobile device
whether it's a phone or a tablet or
something else that takes microUSB
charging and then finally on the far
side here we have the power in and then
the power button itself all right so now
we're going to take a look at the MHL
function or we can do a little demo some
of you may not be familiar with the
technology it is kind of new with this
whole kind of revolution of smart
devices with smartphones and tablets and
laptops here on this demo we have
connected an MHL compatible Android
phone so we're going from the micro USB
port of the phone over to the HDMI / MHL
port on the back of the projector itself
and you can see that we are projecting
the image from the phone directly to the
projector up onto the wall so the
projector itself resolution wise is
going to be 854 by 480 which is also
very good for this class of projectors
of course it's got a built-in scaler so
if you're connecting a tablet or a
laptop with a higher resolution you can
go ahead and set those higher
resolutions on the projector itself and
it will scale it up and project that
screen out for you okay so we can see
here I'm on our Asus North America
YouTube channel and as I am in portrait
mode on the phone the screen gets
projected in portrait mode as well let's
go ahead and pull it the video as an
example and play video and as soon as I
go back to landscape it'll go ahead and
change over to landscape as well so
audio wise the projector also has a 2
watt speaker sonic master audio so that
means that we have gone in and optimized
it for really good sound to come out of
the speaker so you can use that
separately and not have to worry about
connecting speakers
