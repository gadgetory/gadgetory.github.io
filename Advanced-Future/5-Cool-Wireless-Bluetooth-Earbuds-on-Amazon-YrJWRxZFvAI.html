I just got my job Rea lead sporty
now let's see what they like to run with
one of the really cool things about
these earbuds is that they have
absolutely no wires
they feel really secure I actually get a
click with the winged locks in and they
stay in no matter what I do
to track my run I've downloaded the
jabber sport life app I've selected
running as my activity so let's go
I've now been running for about 15
minutes as you can see from the app here
my pulse has had a 152 dropping a bit
now that I've stopped I've done just
over 2 kilometers while I run I get live
feedback on whether I run too slow or
too fast from the app into my ear and as
I have now stopped the app is telling me
to speed up so I gotta go
I'm now done with my run I did 29
minutes 34 seconds a distance of around
5 kilometers I put in a training effect
of 4.1 on a scale to 5 an average heart
rate of 158 and a max of 171 with a pace
of 5 minutes 49 seconds and it's giving
me a fitness level of 47 that is okay
but I can probably do a bit better next
time right guys that was it thank you
for watching happy training and see you
out there
you
you
you
I'll be right there
you
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
