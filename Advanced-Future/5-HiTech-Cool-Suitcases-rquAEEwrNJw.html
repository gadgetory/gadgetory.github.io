smart suitcase that follows its user
while avoiding any obstacles in its path
the code move system is the brains of
the r1 in charge of sensing the
environment planning reasonable paths
and avoiding obstacles all while
following its user the sensing ability
of the comu system is made possible by
multi sensor fusion technology which is
mainly based on a set of sonars a death
censored coai and cliff detect sensors
that allow our one to avoid stairs and
other dangerous drop-offs a customized
bracelet will be provided with each r1
the comu system ensures that r1 rolls
along within an arm's length distance to
the bracelet on the user at all times
a pair of active wheel units when they
retractable design similar to aircraft
landing gears propels the suitcase
forward when both wheel units deploy the
active wheel units will retract as soon
as you touch the handle switching our
one from autonomous mode into manual
mode r1 follows at a maximum speed of
four point five miles per hour
sufficient for most daily needs the
wheel units are powerful enough to
tackle any and all kinds of terrain
Co smart intelligent lock will
automatically lock itself to ensure your
valuables remain safe a simple double
tap on your bracelet will activate the
find me function and r1 will
intelligently plan around to make its
way back to you with the coast smart
intelligent lock proximity alarm and
embedded GPS your belongings are
guaranteed to be safe if the code smart
intelligent lock also integrates a TSA
lock and a traditional combination lock
which ensures that luggage lock is TSA
approved and can function properly even
without the power supply the proximity
alarm will notify you if your luggage
leaves your area if you accidentally
lose or misplace your luggage don't
worry with the onboard GPS you can
easily find its location on your app our
one uses the 96.5 one our portable power
bank as its power source you can easily
charge devices directly from the power
bank or with integrated USB ports for
on-the-go charging if the power bank is
plugged into the suitcase the power bank
is easily removable making airport
security checks a breeze
the front storage space allows for
one-click access to remove electronics
during airport security checkpoints
without having to repack your back while
the spacious main compartment is perfect
for the compact storage of other travel
necessities wherever you go whatever you
do our one will be with you every step
of the way co-wrote our one make travel
less of a drag
hi my name is Kevin O'Donnell I'm the
inventor of motor bag it all started a
few years back after I went this little
family of breakdancers
i sponsored the plow to New York trout
fall Abdul's with the dance as we're
going through the airport we loaded up
with backpacks and all the different
gear and the boys are taking turns as
I'm pulling like carry on riding on top
of it all of a sudden I got to a beer
you know what why not motor Rises what a
better way to get around well I was
gonna need some help and the first
person I thought of was my buddy boy we
just got back from Daytona to learn
everyone and Kevin came with this idea
about the motor back and I looked at it
and I thought wow this is a great idea
how could we make this a reality you
know we've had all these different
vehicles that we put motors to and I
said we could motorized this so
immediately we went out and started
getting some parts one of the biggest
hurdles was fitting all of this into a
carry-on size bag we wanted to retain at
least 85% of the interior and all of the
parts that we use having really small we
started with keyboard parts rollerblade
parts needed parts and we thought it's a
good start but we had to make it work
properly
we've got CNC machine steering column
telescoping aluminum bars put bags that
pop out we've got a lot of stuff that
isn't on anything that's currently on
the market
it's carry-on size got a five-mile range
up to eight miles now it's 20 to a night
where 14 does have a battery yeah it's
got batteries put they're both under 150
mAh which is TSA compliant and your ID
compliant proof-of-concept event over
100 people right off the response has
been unanimously positive no matter who
you put on the bag as soon as they get
their feet on the pegs and hit that
throttle just a smile not only is it
functional
that's an awful lot of fun so after a
year really hard work and selling a
great team people will back us all the
way we're filing at the point we're
ready to go to production with your help
we'll be able to do that and change the
way the world travels modern travelers
want products that add value to their
mobile lifestyles but luggage is yet to
evolve to make travel more convenient
that's why we set out to invent a smart
yet elegant suitcase for seamless travel
experience
meet transmen an entirely new class of
luggage featuring zipper 'less entry for
faster access integrated power for
charging on-the-go a built in scale to
avoid overweight G's a sturdy handle for
enhanced mobility and location tracking
for peace of mind we were tired of
accepting brittle zippers cumbersome
flops and flimsy handles as part of our
lives so we challenged ourselves to
conceptualize better more convenient
luggage a year later we're ready to
share an exceptionally functional and
uniquely minimalist luggage design
created specifically for the on-the-go
generation inspired by the roll-top
doors and airplanes we designed an
unprecedented method of luggage entry
that will let you quickly access your
belongings even in the most constricted
spaces in addition we pack trunks tour
with smart features that will make your
traveling stress-free leaving you to
wonder how you ever travelled with
regular luggage it's time to make travel
pleasant again ladies and gentlemen
flight 1427 to New York is now boarding
at gate 3 please hurry so you can find a
place to store your carry-on luggage
assuming you were even able to carry it
on and the airline didn't make you check
it because you pack too much hopefully
you all have a blue smart the world's
first smart carry-on suitcase
introducing blue smart the first
carry-on that connects to your
smartphone with revolutionary features
including a digital lock proximity
sensors location tracking trip tracking
information a built in digital scale and
if that wasn't enough a built in battery
that can charge your phone six times
over designed for today's sophisticated
traveler
and even guys like this
pull the handle and the app will tell
you the exact weight of your carry-on so
that you never have to check it because
you pack too much god knows what a
suitcase has to go through
forget about keys or combinations
control the lock from the app and if for
any reason you need to part ways with
your blue smart or not it will
automatically lock itself life's too
short to fight for an outlet blue smart
will recharge your electronic devices
with our super powerful built-in battery
so relax blue smart will alert you if
you ever leave it behind or if it finds
a new friend and if it's ever lost
you'll be able to track its location you
will breeze through airport security
thanks to easy access to your electronic
devices with blue smart anyone can
travel smart
even this guy wait a minute is this even
possible who invented this developing a
technology behind smart was a really fun
challenge we have to create new devices
combining sensors the two mechanical
devices are never seen connected to a
microcomputer we needed to come with the
software also to control form your phone
beyond the physical carry on were super
excited about the features we're
building into that imagine blue smart
singing to your calendar and to travel
services that you use so that you know
when and what to pack
imagine also being able to track all
your trips and see trends about your
travel habits all in one place the
suitcase becomes your personal travel
assistant and we think that's pretty
cool
if you think about it suitcases haven't
seen much innovation for several decades
so we set out to reimagine how a
suitcase for this century should be blue
smart is a quantum leap for today's
travel we created a product that is
beautiful and powerful and yet
remarkably simple to use
I am personally super excited about blue
smart because it's a product that I
would love to have myself I travelled in
the past and because of problems with my
luggage my trips got ruined and I know
that we do smart are going to be able to
travel with peace of mind so I'm super
excited on top of that my phone is never
gonna run out of battery anymore and
that's pretty cool thank you for
watching and thank you for a support
let's make this happen
