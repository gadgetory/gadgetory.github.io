generating power with sand and the Sun
capturing solar energy is the end result
of complex chemical and physical
processes as a first step
raw silicon is extracted from quartz and
the use in the photovoltaics industry
the semi metal must be 99.99% pure to
generate solar power the photovoltaics
industry utilizes the semiconducting
properties of silicon in special ovens
raw silicon is melted at temperatures of
over 1,400 degrees centigrade a thin mod
known as the seed crystal is then
submerged into the liquid raw silicon
and pulled back up very slowly at this
step in the process the liquid silicon
accumulates on the seed crystal and
solidifies over four days a silicon rod
of up to 2.8 meters length takes shape
this basic round crystal known as an
ingot is now cut into a rectangular
shape this is done for purely practical
reasons later on square shaped solar
cells can be installed much more
effectively on the surface of a solar
module the ingots are cut into
millimeter thin slices using a very fine
wire saw the individual slices are
called wafers and form the basis of each
solar cell once the wafers have been cut
they are sent through a wash tunnel this
is because even a smallest piece of dust
or dirt can compromise solar cell
production the wafer surface is now very
flat just like a mirror many rays of
light are reflected and can no longer be
used to generate power to prevent this
reflection the surface is etched and
roughened in a chemical bath if the
cells are put under a microscope one can
see the resulting pyramid structure with
this piling pyramid structure light is
refracted multiple times allowing
incoming light to be used far more
effectively the next step in solar cell
production is diffusion here are
negatively charged phosphorus layer is
added to each wafers positively charged
layer
in an oven heated to some 900 degrees
centigrade phosphorus atoms are injected
with the help of nitrogen the gaseous
phosphorus Nadja mix is deposited on the
wafer at the interface between positive
and negative charged layers the free
charge carriers created by the light are
released this generates an electric
current but how is the power that is
generated in the individual cells
transported a Stamper presses a silver
alloy onto the front of the cells this
creates the typical grid pattern this
silver coating ensures that the power
can be transported later on the solar
cells are now complete they can generate
and transfer power but each cell has a
different level of electrical
conductivity in a series of tests the
cell's conductivity is evaluated and
sorted following the test phase the
solar cells are assembled the cells are
soldered together in such a way that the
voltage accumulates in a process
referred to as lamination the cells were
assembled behind a pane of glass as a
result they are protected from the
elements for more than 25 years one
solar module contains 60 cells when a
number of modules are connected to one
another a solar power plant is created
and power is generated from the Sun and
the sand</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
