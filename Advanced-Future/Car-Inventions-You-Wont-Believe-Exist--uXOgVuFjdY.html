no matter who is using the car
from our tire close-up camera we can see
that the all-season tire has severe
trouble gripping the ice and spins
freely the vehicle's traction control
struggles to limit the excessive spin
this causes the vehicle to accelerate
very slowly taking an average of 14.5
seconds to cross the line The MITRE
chains chlorine to the ice for extra
traction allowing the vehicle to cross
the line in a comparable 7.3 seconds
around half the time of the regular tire
the emergency stop tests the test driver
traveled as a constant ten miles per
hour and applied heavy braking the
overall stopping distance was then
measured as the driver prized heavy
braking the vehicle wheels lock up
regardless of the vehicle's ABS system
this causes the vehicle to skid
uncontrollably until it finally comes to
arrest with the mighty change fitted the
wheels have a far greater stopping
traction this added traction allows the
vehicle's ABS system to work effectively
bringing the car to a controlled stop
inches 4.1 meters are the distance when
compared to regular tires the cornering
test the vehicle reaches 10 miles per
hour that attempts to negotiate the S
bend without striking any of the cones</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
