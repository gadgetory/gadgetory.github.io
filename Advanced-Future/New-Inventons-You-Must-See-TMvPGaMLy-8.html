well you can sit on an egg without
breaking it incredible you want me to
sit on this egg okay I can't believe I'm
doing this I don't even feel it didn't
even break oh I was wondering about that
now that's a good cushion did it break
no oh my that's crazy
where do I get one of these cushions so
say goodbye to a key muscles from
sitting all day or a stiff back from
long car rides now you can sit all day
on even the hardest chair and still feel
comfortable other cushions need a gap to
cradle the tailbone not egg-sitter
the honeycomb design is constructed of
elastic or that absorbs pressure points
by collapsing in on itself that's why
even this egg won't break under direct
pressure now long days at the office
will be more comfortable dinner more
enjoyable and painful car rides a thing
of the past
plus the egg sitters elastic core stays
cool to the touch and allows air to
circulate underneath while giving you
optimal lumbar support every time you

sunglasses you can bend them and twist
them because battle vision is built
atomic top the secrets the shape memory
polymer that delivers unmatched
flexibility and the frames snap back to
their original shape just like new we'll
watch this after being hit with rat shot
