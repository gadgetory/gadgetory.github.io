all time the feeling you get when you

these shots takes countless hours of
practice and with that comes the
inevitable chore of picking up hundreds
of tennis balls scattered all over the
courts players and coaches everywhere

that goes into collecting balls during a
practice session and this is why we
invented ten of odds 10 Avadh is the
world's first robotic ball collecting

vision and artificial intelligence to
detect tennis balls on the court and
collect them from players
