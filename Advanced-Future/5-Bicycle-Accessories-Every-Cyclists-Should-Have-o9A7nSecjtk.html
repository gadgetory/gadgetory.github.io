without releasing the air
two years ago we brought you the milk it
valve system which allows you to measure
and refill sealant in tubeless tires
without releasing the air and received
overwhelming support from our backers
tubeless tires are a great alternative
to regular tires for many reasons but we
know how difficult they can be to
inflate after talking to our supporters
we realized that there was one main
problem remaining with chourus tires
they don't have a compressor or high end
tubeless pump at home I want to avoid
having to go to the gas station or a
bike shop to inflate their tires we
decided it's time for our second product
and invented the milk it booster we
built many booster prototypes in the
past year and they worked very
effectively now we've turned these early
versions into an out-of-the-box solution
with a great design one of the main
advantages of the milk it booster is how
easy it is to use remove the valve core
inflate the booster press the booster on
the valve done with its lightweight and
small size the milky booster is an ideal
companion to bring along on your ride it
can be used with any kind of tubeless
tire or valve with or without the valve
core installed the booster works with
any tubeless valve but it works best
with the milk it valves which through
there you'll be among the first to
receive the milky tubers booster and
you'll experience how easy it can be to
inflate the tubers tire the milk it
booster is easier to handle more
efficient lighter and less expensive
than any product on the market and there
is one more thing the booster bottles
can be used as drinking bottles that you
carry in your backpack
or in your bottle cage si an is a
state-of-the-art rearview mirror created
with precise detail to fulfill all your
needs as a cyclist only a perfect
product can give you that second to
react and keep riding that's the only
way to ride safe on the street see hands

vibration giving you a sharp and clear
vision of what's happening behind you

Han does not vibrate at all we want you
to ride with confidence and the only way
to do so is with a clear and precise
image for that reason we carefully
choose all the materials the acrylic Mir

the street or to ride your skateboard

someone is about to try to steal my bike
how do I know because for the last five
years I've been developing a psychic
technique that lets me detect bike
thieves before they strike actually I
can detect bike thieves but it's not
because of my psychic powers because my
bike is secured at the smartest bike
security system ever 110 decibel and GPS
tracking unlimited range anti-theft
alerts encrypted keyless locking and a
hardened steel locking element I'm
Michael city cyclist and member of the
deeper lock team and this is the
smartest toughest bike security ever for
a long time spike crime has been one of
those things that city cyclist has just
had to put up with and whether it's in
busy city center streets or in quiet
suburbs bike thieves are used to working
without being interrupted so what's the
solution
apart from developing psychic powers the
answer is empowering cyclists through
smart technology and all you need is
beep a lock
you see deep a lock case with your
smartphone to keep you in the note if
someone tampers with your bike you get a
direct alert sent to your smartphone and
this isn't no Bluetooth 400 foot range
alert system deeper lock uses GSM
technology which means even if I'm in
another country I still get instant
alerts if my bikes in trouble hi can you
check my bike deeper lock is also fitted
with an inbuilt GPS tracker if someone
does try to do one with your bike you'll
know where it is and be able to track it
anywhere it goes but in fact your bikes
won't be going anywhere that's because
deeper lock is also fitted with a 110
decibel alarm system try ignoring that
Joe public it charges itself through
built-in solar panels and you can share
access with anyone through the deeper
lock app
and of course deeper lock is also a lock
the hardened steel locking element can
withstand five tons of force and the
whole lock is steel reinforced and
ruggedized it mounts to your rear seat
stays and once it's locked it has all
the tech and all the toughness to secure
your bike whatever the thieves track if
someone touches your bike a chain
reaction of anti-fur features kicks in
first 110 decibel alarmed sounds enough
to put off most bike feeds then you
receive an anti-theft alert direct to
your smartphone now the clock is ticking
for the bike thief plus you can monitor
your bikes location using the GPS
tracking on the app so there's nowhere
for the thief to hide
what if all cars had a single light in
the center strange then why do we only
have one light in front of our bicycle
introducing luma a 360 degrees light
system that shows your true width while
cycling it combines all the lights
needed on your bike front lights rear
lights and side lights all integrated
into the bicycles grips three different
lights at each end of your handlebar
never worry again about leaving your
lights home or having them stolen the
grips feature a solid core for easy
installation and lock-on rings for
secure fastening luma meets all the
legal requirements even in countries
with strict regulations such as Denmark
or Norway though it makes you visible
luma itself is almost invisible it has a
compact elegant design that does not
interfere with the looks of your bike
the body is made of aircraft-grade
aluminum the same alloy used for
helicopters and airplanes it's tough
almost indestructible we've paid special
attention to the surface finish anodized
ultrasonic cleaned and hand brushed for
a premium look finally each set comes
with built-in lithium batteries that are
easily charged through a standard
microUSB port
we love bicycles and we love to cycle we
want to have a product that is not just
good but one that advances the frontiers
of visibility and traffic safety
