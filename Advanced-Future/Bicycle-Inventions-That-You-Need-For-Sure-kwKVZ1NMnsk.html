cycling is soaring but road rage is
rocketing cyclists blame drivers and
drivers blame cyclists glove is a high
quality cycling product with a mission
we want to ease these tensions with
actions not words
let's make Raven more meaningful and
grow a culture goodwill on our roads
just like a smile waving shows mutual
respects and sometimes a small change
can have a huge impact to whoever you're
waving at we've spent a year testing and
developing with one of the world's
leading glove manufacturers waving at
every stage of the journey from cycling
to work
- waving at commuters during rush hour
the reactions speak for themselves
glove combines a visible friendly form
with technical performance it's not just
a pretty face it's jam-packed with good
stuff like brights reflective signaling
that glows when you turn corners smiley
cushioning in areas of constant contact
touch screen fabrics on all fingers for
recording routes and getting places
highly durable double layer acts Wade
palm for the most relentless cycles and
a micro fleece bump are sweaty faces and
runny noses we've chosen fabrics that
perfect for multi season cycling they
are water repellent warm wind proof and
breathable
bikes are stolen like a lot too every
minute over a million every year and
that's just what's reported that's why
we're so excited to bring you linka the
world's first Auto unlocking smart bike
lock link it can do a lot of cool things
but at its core it's a powerful lock
that's hard mounted to your frame so
you're always ready when you're ready to
lock up just tap the button and a
hardened steel ring slides into place
making it impossible to ride away so now
that your bikes locked if someone tries
picking it up linka has a built-in
accelerometer that automatically
triggers a siren
stopping the thief in their tracks while
simultaneously sending a tamper alert
directly to your phone so you know
what's up now what makes lenka a smart
lock is its ability to recognize who you
are and automatically unlock as you
approach of course you can always unlock
it with your smartphone or for phoneless
access you can press your four-digit
passcode so if you want to lock your
bike to something add on a link a chain
and just lock up to an existing bike
rack if you already have a chain or you
lock then you're all set inside linka is
a really powerful battery you can get up
to one whole year before your next
charge and the link app notifies you
when your battery's low so you never
really have to think about it so about
the app not only does it auto unlock
linka send tamper alerts and track
battery usage we're really excited to
introduce our theft indicator map the
app tracks reported stolen bikes in your
area and warns you of dangerous
locations we'll even recommend a safer
place to park so we packed linka with a
bunch of awesome features but equally as
important to us was creating a design
and form factor that you'd be excited to
put on your bike
so why are we doing this the more I kept
riding my bike the more I realized how
difficult it was to keep it safe after
doing some research I found out I wasn't
the only one having this problem and
that's when linka was born</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
