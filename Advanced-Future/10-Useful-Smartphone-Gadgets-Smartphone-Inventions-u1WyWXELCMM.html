this the smallest keyring cable ever
seen in a world where smartphones have
become such an important part of our day
battery life remains the toughest
challenge this is the problem we set to
solve when we first came up with in
charge in charge is a compact cable
meant to be kept in your keys at all
times we all hate having our phone die
when we most need it
luckily nowadays USB ports are
everywhere so all we need is the right
cable to top off our battery after
gathering feedback from thousands of
backers during our first two campaigns
and working hard to find new aesthetic
and technical solutions we are now
excited to finally present you our next
product in charge dual thanks to a brand
new multi-directional connector that
unifies iPhone and micro USB plugs you
can now have a unique product that
charges both Apple and Android
smartphones as well as Bluetooth
speakers headphones power banks ecigs
air pods and much more we have developed
new materials for the cable such as
premium eco leather which look great and
increase the durability and it's also
weatherproof but we didn't stop there
since most smartphones are now moving to
USB see we designed an adapter that fits
perfectly with in charge dual keeping
the same sleek design while expanding
its functionality introducing in charge
all-in-one the effortless solution for
having all the cables you need in one
single product that fits under keychain
after spending the past months
prototyping and finding the right
components we are now ready for mass
production
the iFixit my key driver kit was made
with a purpose and mission in mind
sometimes you're met with bigger devices
and those devices often have bigger bits
the Mikey driver kit will allow you to
attack those repairs without hassle
the Mikey driver kit includes I fix its
quarter inch ionized aluminum driver
with magnetic bit socket knurled grip
and swivel top plus 48 beefy bits all
our next gen bit kits have been
re-engineered for maximum utility so we
included spanners squares and splines in
addition to standard phillips and flat
hood this bit kit includes all the
quarter inch form factor bits you'll
need to handle the toughest and
tortillas fasteners in any home or shop
project other toolkits might leave you
with a broken hinge or clasp but the
maquis lid is held in place with magnets
and mounts to the back of the case to
keep it out of the way while you do your
work if you need help keeping your
screws and parts organized the lid also
serves as a sorting tray never worry
about tackling a big fix with the maquis
kit as always your iFixit tools are
backed by a lifetime warranty
meet air selfie to the first HD
pocket-sized flying camera ever created
so thin alive you can use it everywhere
you go
enhance your phone with the ultimate
photo and video accessory taking selfies
becomes easier and even funnier so
revolutionary that adapts to every
lifestyle share images on your social
media has never been so quickly through
the easy-to-use app advanced
technologies and high quality components
embedded into a ultra durable case
create amazing memories of your best
moments big air selfie to its
anti-vibration and in flight stability
systems always guarantee great video and
photos available in four different
colors to suit your personality
err selfie too small is the new big
measurement is an essential part of home
improvement however the measuring tools
have not got any radical innovation for
decades the measuring tape has a limited
range and you have to worry about
sagging and miss reading when the
distance gets long you have to use a
marking flag or need an extra hand
the laser measuring tool is limited for
single purpose use it is not even able
to measure a table because there is no
target to reflect off the laser Arum one
is the first AR multifunctional
measuring device that actually works it
is way better than any other measuring
tools available in the market and it is
super easy to use let's start with
measuring a straight line
simply attach Arum one to your
smartphone it generates a precise laser
beam use it to point at the start of the
line tap the button then point at the
end and tap the button again that's it
the line and the dimension are shown on
the screen as we use the augmented
reality technology you can walk around
while the line and dimension are still
displayed in the original place next
let's measure a circle use the laser
beam to specify any three points on the
circle now we get the diameter radius
circumference and the Centers location
Arum one can be used to measure angles
use the laser beam to determine the
sides and the endpoint now we have the
degree arrow one is also a leveling and
marking tool for example if you plan to
hang two pictures on the wall and want
them to be centered horizontally you can
easily get it done with Arum one specify
a line along the wall it will ask you
how many equal segments you want in this
case we choose three now we have two
vertical reference lines passing through
the Tri section points switch to
leveling function create a horizontal
reference line on the wall now you can
hang the pictures based on these
reference lines
precision is our top priority
Arum one has the precision of plus minus
1.5 millimeters within 20 meters range
to achieve this level of accuracy Aaron
one uses a series of sophisticated
technologies there are a few a are
measuring apps on the market however if
you have ever tried them you would find
out that they are just a concept mo as
they all depend on the software hit test
results the precision is not reliable at
all
arrow 1 uses fda-approved laser module
with 40 meters measure range built-in
lithium ion battery provides enough
power for one thousand times measurement
with a single charge using air m1 is so
simple and intuitive the idea of
measuring in this way is what we are all
familiar with we have waited for a long
time until the technology gets here and
it's real now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
