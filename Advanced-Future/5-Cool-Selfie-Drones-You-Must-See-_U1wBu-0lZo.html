hi I'm JD co-founder of
x-craft and inventor of phone drill last
year we launched a successful
Kickstarter campaign for the X plus one
a next-generation UAV platform that
combines vertical takeoff and landing
capabilities with high speed flight
innovation is key at x-craft
we've been working tirelessly at it out
of this effort another breakthrough was
born introducing phone drone
you may have seen other drones that are
controlled by a smartphone and phone
drone has that capability but there is
one key innovative difference your
smartphone actually flies with the drone
inside a universal protective case
we've designed phone drone to be
operated by anyone with a smartphone no
drone experience necessary it works with
all popular ios and android smartphones
and utilizes many features already built
into the phone which allows it to be
affordable
you can either fly phone drone
autonomously with a single phone or pair
it with another device for real-time
control and follow-me functions
we have a functioning prototype and
wireframe of the app but we need your
support to make phones on a reality if
we're able to meet our goal we can
complete the app and start the
manufacturing process we really believe
that phone drone can redefine the
personal drill and allow anyone with a
smartphone to enjoy this extraordinary
technology
so join us back from drone today and
experience your new personal drug you
see amazing isn't it this is the air
selfie the only portable flying camera
integrated into your mobile phone cover
micro and ultralight it comes with it's
very own device for storage and charging
with an easy one-hand control from its
own where did the idea come from well
I'll show you look at this what an epic
day out a bonafide selfie time as they
say just need to squeeze a teeny bit no
oh never mind
ah more manageable group just two guys
actually they want to take a selfie to
remember this wonderful place well I
guess they can just describe the view to
their friends back home right okay one
more try this time a good old barbecue
outside on a sunny day with lots of
friends let's try the selfie stick
strategy still can't fit everybody in
annoying situations am i right we've all
been there buddy
that's how air selfie was born a perfect
team gathered together working in London
Milan and Shanghai to combine micro
flying technologies ultralight HD
cameras within flight stability systems
our selfie can travel in a 20 meter
radius and hovers for up to three
minutes it's easily controllable from
both iOS or Android smartphone apps it's
only 52 grams and it slots into its
phone cover and recharges so what if the
guys had an air selfie with them they
make it hover find the perfect angle and
leave the controls finally snap an
amazing photo with the selfie delay
timer mode while it is autonomously
flying and keeping its position in the
air awesome
what about the two explorers they select
the classic flying mode from the three
options available control layer selfie
through the app by holding the phone
horizontally and take both memorable
photos and videos and what would have
happened at the barbecue enough with the
squeezing just select the selfie mode
use only two buttons to find the right
distance to shoot and take a great
picture
what about an indoor location whatever
it may be a party at somebody's house or
a night out in a club there are no
issues there selfie fly's easily it's
simpler control and very safe
and once you shoot a great picture don't
keep it to yourself
it's so easy to share it right from your
phone as easy as grabbing the air selfie
safely while it's still hovering in the
air so this is air selfie the only
portable flying camera integrated into
your mobile phone cover ready to explore
new perspectives let's take a look at
its technical features power bank inside
its own custom phone cover a battery
that charges itself in only 30 minutes 5
megapixel HD video camera to shoot
social media optimized images
sophisticated sensors and its own Wi-Fi
control unit in flight stability systems
to hover autonomously the smallest and
most powerful brushless motors it's safe
to grab while it's still hovering and of
course its own 4 gigabyte microSD memory

case compact and easy to carry with you
