through earlier bit what's out there
right now still waiting on the big one
look it's something else
it's the biggest bad Jackie you still
talking about the deer no man I'm
talking about the supercedes the
brightest thing you've ever seen it
hangs it floats it's white it's red it's
signals for help it's eleven hundred
lumens man it's not only rechargeable
it'll charge all your devices the super
seats from Streamlight
the seeds family just got brighter
earlier this year we introduced the
Voyager Lantern which was a combination
of a handheld and a lantern all-in-one
super compact package we took that same
technology and applied it to our most
popular compact orbit Lantern the orbit
is perfect for any activity we're
shaving grams is crucial
it runs on four triple-a batteries it's
super compact and it gives you lantern
mode which has dimming so you can adjust
the brightness and it also has a
flashlight mode the real advantage of
the handheld is obviously when you're
walking around camp and you need to hit
the restroom in the middle of the night
you've got a handy little handheld but
also the beauty of the flashlight mode
is when you're hanging it in a tent it
has beautiful light for reading the
orbit is a really clever design the
globe actually collapses over the switch
which is a mechanical lock mode so it
protects the switch from being turned on
inadvertently the orbits it's super
versatile light for all night campsite
activities
so the light of life was one of the
first projects we ever did even before
the name gold zero happened actually we
realized one of the biggest needs in
particular in Africa was light once the
Sun went down pretty much everything
stopped that's how the Lal was born and
it's great product we've been using it
for years and people love it
using it so much and having so many
people out in the field using it helped
us see that wow this can be made even
better so the first thing we talked
about was size we came up with a plan of
making something as compact as possible
but could still be expanded to give you
the same shade that the diffused light
so it's not blinding you when it's when
it's hanging and this serves a lot of
purposes it lets you store this compact
you can store a lot more in the same
space we always ask what else can we do
so we decided well let's use the product
itself to be cord management and we use
this the shape here as a as a spindle so
now you can wrap this cord around there
to the exact length that you need the
cord runs up through this gap comes
around to hook and now you have cord
management we actually went to a single
LED module but it does spread pretty
much 180 degrees in this mode just out
everywhere we poured over every detail
of this surface since the light is going
to be spread out of this surface right
here we want to make it absolutely
perfect that makes a difference so that
when you're seeing the actual beam of
light you don't see these little flaws
or imperfections in the spot that comes
down on low you're gonna get about 120
hours off of the yetee 150 and on high
you're gonna get about 50 hours of light
one of the things we noticed on our
first version Lal was guys were taking
this things up you know Everest didn't
into these pretty extreme environments
so even down to the level of the jacket
on the cord we looked at what material
will be able to handle the hot and the
cold and still say stay pliable and not
crack all those little details you just
have to work through every one of them
to get it right I think where this
really thrives is at the campsite
whether your car camping or your
backpacking it's small enough to toss in
a backpack it's rugged enough to handle
that kind of trip it's rugged enough to
be tossed in the back of your of your
SUV and drive out to the middle of
nowhere and hang them up there there's
so many ways to attach it it's so
versatile in that way
when it comes to shedding light on a
situation we've got you covered
