years now in the Catholic for the past
four and sadly have attended calls where
we've had fire deaths and almost always
it's related to smoke or toxic gases we
fight fires but it's smoke that killed
saver is an emergency breath system that
has the power to save many lives most of
us have smoke alarms but what happens
after they go off how do we protect the
ones we love we've created this product
with one purpose to save lives saver is
the first personal home safety device
designed to prevent the inhalation of
smoke and toxic gases during a fire
allowing you and your family the time
you need to escape safely seven people
die every day from home fires 80% of all
fire fatalities are due to smoke
inhalation for every minute you were
trapped in the fire your survival rate
decreases seven to ten percent and after
the first five minutes your chances of
survival are less than 25 percent
unfortunately people have a false sense
of security when it comes to dealing
with a house fire people don't realize
it as little as two minutes to escape a
burning home before it's too late
also people don't realize the long-term
health implications from a house fire
inhaling smoke and toxic gases can cause
cancer and other respiratory diseases
the saver emergency breath system has
the power to change all of that
saver is easy to use and can be
activated within 5 seconds simply remove
the plastic cover apply the nose grip
remove the orange cap bite into the
mouthpiece and breathe normally for
children we recommend they hold their
nose with one hand and breathe with the
mouthpiece
savors triple filter technology removes
smoke and dust carbon monoxide
secondhand smoke and toxic gases with
every breath you take saver includes a
powerful LED flashlight with a built-in
alarm the flashlight is designed to
penetrate heavy smoke while the alarm
notifies others on seeing to your
location saver is the only household
product of its kind in North America we
believe that saver will become as common
as smoke detectors and just as important
to the safety of your family lives are
depending on this product getting out
there and we need your help
every saver is a life join us and let's
create a safer home for the people we
love do you wear sunglasses outdoors for
cycling fishing boating or other
activities regardless of the sunglasses
there's nothing worse than distracting
smudge right in the middle of the lenses
like skin oil sweat and water spray just
makes you want to grab your t-shirt and
start rubbing but that won't get rid of
the smudge entirely instead it can
scratch the lenses leaving permanent
marks that's the worst thing to do so
stop it we need to find a better way to
clean lenses that's why we have invented
the revolutionary patented self clean
sunglasses yes self clean everything
needed to clean the lens is integrated
I'm going to show you how to use it so
first I spray some water droplets on the
way
so we can see the result now take hold
of the sunglasses forearm while using
your thumbs and forefingers to push the
lens up and down few times that's it
the lens is squeezed and the water drops
are gone you can clean it anywhere but
you don't need anything else
that's so much clearer seeing through
the lens map only takes a few seconds to
clean so how does it work these
sunglasses have cleaning pads built
inside the frame on both sides of the
lens so as you shift the lens the
cleaning pads can swipe the surface
clean these pads are made from high-end
microfiber the most suitable material
for lens between so is your cycling
board running you can clear away the
dripping sweat and grease without the
hassle of course to wipe off the spray
from water sport boating and fishing
we even have young athletes chosen to
wear their sunglasses for World
Championship the sunglasses also feature
the ability to swap lenses from gray to
brown to yellow to clear in seconds
there are five fashionable frame colors
to choose from together with the
sunglasses you can also upgrade to the
package deal which includes multiple
lenses and decay
