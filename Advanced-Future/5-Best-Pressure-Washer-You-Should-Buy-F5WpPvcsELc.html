pressure washer powered by Honda is the
first introduced in the one watch in
generations the first and only power
washer that features very impressed
wrestler control for a variety of
cleaning tasks all at the turn of a dial
just match what you're cleaning with the
icons on the power dial and the one
watch will automatically adjust the
intensity of the spray to suit the head
so you can take care of delicate jobs
that need low pressure likes cleaning
the car
the cleaning aluminum and vinyl siding
to cleaning decks and fences and even
take care of the tough jobs like
cleaning brick and concrete the one wash
is powered by an engine that is the
largest in its class giving you top
power and performance to go with all of
that convenience if the oil or water
runs low the system alert is activated
and the one wash automatically cuts
power to the unit to protect it from
damage the detergent tank features a
drain which allows for very easy
cleaning and of course it's easy to move
around thanks to these 11 inch
all-terrain wheels so if you're ready to
bring home the cleaning power and
convenience of variable pressure control
at the turn of a dial pick up the one
wash from generator I'm Tom I'm
president of works tools and they talk
about probably one of my favorite
products which is the works hydro shock
you know if I had to say within works
you know most of our innovations start
from personal experience I mean we're
all homeowners we're all
do-it-yourselfers and so we're always
kind of using our own experiences before
to help us develop products so the idea
for the Hydra shot really came about
during a brainstorming session that we
were having about what's the best way to
clean your outdoor areas and of course
the whole topic of power washers came up
and everybody in the group had a
different story about a painful
experience they had with pressure
washers and so we kind of said hey well
there's got to be a better way and that
was when the idea for the Hydra shot
really came about I think one of the
challenges when we were developing the
hydro shot was how to pack all the
functionality of a pressure washer into
a very small handheld product and I
think our our engineers did a phenomenal
job in really getting that functionality
into what is basically a handheld
cordless product one of the really cool
things about the hydro shot is we
designed it so it doesn't have to be
used with a garden hose you can use it
with any fresh water source it's got its
own hose included you can drop it into a
pool or a lake or just a bucket of water
and what really that does is it changes
the game as far as where you can use a
pressure washer I mean if you're outdoor
enthusiast if you're out mountain biking
on weekends or boating or taking your
ATVs out out for trail rides I mean this
is the perfect product because there's
no other product you could use where you
can just clean it up right after you use
it rinse it out rinse it down and so
when you get back home they're all clean
as much fun as we had
developing this product and testing it
ourselves I really think at the end of
the day
we we created an amazingly innovative
tool that's really gonna revolutionize
the way people clean their outdoor areas
and really clean all kinds of things
wherever they may be pressure washing a
surface from cars to boats to patios
from dirty to sparkling clean

garden maintenance tasks Rio beach new
