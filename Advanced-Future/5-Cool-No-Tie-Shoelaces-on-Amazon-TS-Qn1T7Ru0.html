we are excited to present to you
clip-ins you'll never have to tie
shoelaces again sounds good right
Clippers are designed to keep your laces
in their place whatever the activity may
be you're working out at the gym you
don't want your laces to come loose clip
it's unique design is lightweight and
strong holding up to any activity why
tie when you can clip it clip it's range
of 10 colors will help you to match your
shoes or make them stand out into
skating why not clip it each set of clip
it comes with a matching pair of laces
use your existing laces or clip it laces

easy off love to run clip it's won't let

more relaxing and casual footwear clip

why tie when you can clip it clip it's
in this video we're going to walk you
through the installation of your lock
laces when you open your package you
should find the following 248 inch
elastic shoe laces to lock devices and
to cord tip Clips after removing your
old shoelaces you will begin by lacing
up your shoes with your new elastic lock
laces it is important to remember that
you should install the laces with your
foot in the shoe to ensure a proper fit
next you will need to thread each end of
the laces through the passages of the
lock device simply press down on the top
of a lock device to open the passages
slide the lock to the tongue of the shoe
and release to secure the lock device
into place then use a pair of scissors
to trim off the excess lace
we recommend cutting 2 to 3 inches below
the lock device finally attach the cord
clip onto the ends of the laces and
align the trimmed ends of the laces with
the teeth inside the cord clip it is
very important that you align the ends
of the laces with the teeth inside the
cord clip to ensure the
stay securely attached then simply snap
the cord clip together to secure your
lock laces are now installed and
guaranteed for the life of the shoe
hi I'm Ryan I'm Valerie thanks for
checking out Lubitz we all of our shoes
but don't the laces present some
challenges there's the time the
squeezing the floppy bows becoming
undone
the double nodding
and the untying to get them off
well with your support weaving zubich
can help zooids
our small yet powerful magnetic fits
that you attach to your own shoelaces
making your shoes very easy to put on so
how do you really want to put your shoes
on would it be great if there were no
laces at all I mean nothing to get in
the way
well this is what zubats are like when
separated zu bits eliminate three rows
of laces so there's a huge mouth opening
to easily slide in
then just connect the magnets
and that's it
now go for a run
go to the playground
go to the gym
play some basketball
Zubaz hold securely for most
recreational activities
the two bits are not just for athletic
sneakers they're for your everyday
casual shoes with stupids you have a
clean looking shoe no ugly bows and
they'll never come undone
how do you really want to take your
shoes off let's face it most of us do
what we are not supposed to do we step
on our heel and squeeze out of our shoes
this wears down the yield and leaves you
with a knot to untie later but with
zoomix
stepping out of your shoes becomes the
right way to do it the magnets will
split as you step out and now your shoe
is open and ready for the next time you
want to slip in xue bits are not
ordinary magnets they've been specially
engineered to concentrate the magnetic
forces toward the face of the magnets
this gives them incredible holding
forces in a small size this also means
there's almost no magnetism on the
outside of the zu bits where you don't
want it the average person will tie over
100,000 BOE knots by the time they reach
the end of their life here to expand we
think that's bull
haha
haha
my name is Charles Harris and I'm the
creator of the expand shoe lacing system
it all started with the help of the
pillow product design team our system
had to be easy enough to be used by
five-year-olds and strong enough for
triathletes we wanted a minimal design
with a wide range of use and a gift
