are back on Kickstarter we've been
working for a year on a new slim wallet
and we are excited to share it with our
Kickstarter friends we wanted a wallet
that would be super tiny fit in the palm
of our hands and carry a lot of cards
and cash in 2014 thanks to our
Kickstarter friends we launched the
Jimmy case iPhone wallets we really
cracked the code on the best way to
carry your cash and cards on the back
here - this premium elastic band we have
custom woven for us here in Los Angeles
that stretches out just enough to hold
six cards in cash but always pop back in
then that's really the magic sauce with
Jimmy case there are times when we want
to carry more than our Jimmy case tin
handle including a stack of cash but it
had to be super compact this is slim
Jimmy it features the magic elastic
pocket just like our Jimmy K's iPhone
cases
it's designed to mold two credit cards
pull them tight and never stretch out
this front performance pocket can hold
up to six cards and the side pocket is
RFID protected to keep other cards from
prying eyes and this side pocket can
hold up to 15 bills the front pocket has
no RFID blocking so it's great for your
Metro pass or work pass size perfectly
to hold bills fold it in half three
inches by four inches and super thin
kind of perfect for me because I'm
always skateboarding and I'm always out
being active and on the go it's really
slim it's not super bold II in my pocket
but all my cards can fit in here I can
put a good amount of cash in you too
it's really convenient small fits in my
pocket looks slick and it works for
everyday life through slim Jimmy is
simple and easy to use and slim Jimmy is
hand assembled and sewn right here in
Los Angeles with super soft and strong
vechicle tan leather which feels great
in your hand and that's where goomar
sendou comes in kumar sendou is a master
leather work expertly skilled in the
detailed sewing it takes to make a great
wallet
each Slim Jimmy will be made right here
in goomar sendou shop with each corner
sewn by hand by goomar sendou for a
perfect fit here's the real magic in
slim jim
here in South Los Angeles a massive
webbing factory dozens of looms making
custom fabrics together with their
engineering team we designed the magic
elastic stretchy fabric filled with
high-tech expanding pants these looms
are set up by hand one strand at a time
about a thousand strands to build the
perfect card grabbing pockets just for
Jimmy case and now slim jim hi I'm Aaron
I run marketing and operations and Jimmy
case when you choose a slim Jimmy wallet
you can expect a great experience
detailed updates prompt chipping
responsive support just like every Jimmy
case fan since our first Kickstarter
purpose design to be the perfect carrier
two simple powerful pockets for the
cards and cash you need most thank you
so much for your support this is our
second Kickstarter over 20,000 people
around the world love their Jimmy case
and we are excited to share the slim
Jimmy with you
paying what your mobile phone sucks cuz
your phone rings just about when you're
ready to pay because your phone should
be wall to conserve because you know
your phone dies on so in the end you can
never get rid of your wallet
this is spanned wallet
and this can totally replace your wallet
wow we are tired of the inconvenient
truth of our outdated wallet and we're
sick of phones
pretending to replace our wallet so we
replace your wallet in a smart way
introducing spending
you
hey guys my wife and I Hey
we're packing for our trip to Savannah
we've got this new fused smart card
that's gonna help us with our purchases
throughout the trip
this card can store information from
almost any card in my wallet debit cards
credit cards reward cards gift cards gym
membership anything with a barcode and
EMV chip a magnetic strip or NFC tech
few stores it you just swipe or take a
picture of a card through your
smartphone and it appears on fuse now
you may be wondering about security the
fuse card runs on Bluetooth and connects
directly to your phone if necessary you
can delete all the information on the
card with the push of a button I've got
my key I've got my phone I've got my
wallet fuse allows you to select any
card to use when you need it for
instance when you pay for gas you might
rather use debit and credit you can also
add your gas pay membership info you can
even use multi pay mode to combine the
two cards for a simpler transaction fuse
makes it all easy
I've got like
four cards all at once oh it's got my
debit cards credit cards gift cards
membership cards oh that's awesome see
if it works all right it worked
fuse has the capability for NFC
technology NFC means you can tap the
card to make contactless payment
using its buttons you can create a six
tap password to lock and unlock the card
so if it ends up in the wrong hands they
won't be able to access your information
by pressing the hold button for three
seconds you can freeze the fuse card so
that your preferred payment method
doesn't accidentally change the card
stays locked inactive for ten minutes
unless it's told otherwise
it's cool too because if you forget your
card your phone will send you an alert
before you get too far away plus its
battery lasts an average of 30 days that
means you have about a month before you
have to worry about recharging it but
when you do have to charge it fuses
portable charging cradle has a built-in
battery
allowing you to charge the card on the
go
in Savannah we had the chance to use the
fuse it's pretty awesome that you can
put all this tech into a card as thin as
this
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
