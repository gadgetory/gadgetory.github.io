differently matters including hey guys
i'm here to talk to you today about the
new Air Hogs remote control Thunder
tracks this is an awesome one it's an
outdoor all-terrain RC vehicle that
drives over any surface
snow mud and with the push of a button
even water
alright let's quickly go through the
contents of each box so you know exactly
what you're going to get your package
should contain a one Thunder track one
remote control one charging cable and
one set of instruction let's dive in a
little deeper so I can show you why I
love the new Air Hogs RC Thunder tracks
okay the first reason I love the Thunder
tracks is that it can drive over any
surface
this really is an all-terrain vehicle
not is because of the tread these things
are large they're durable the shape to
provide traction over any surface even
in water yep push that button in the
Thunder tracks transforms into aquatic
mode and just keeps on going
let me give you a few quick tips that
have helped me get the most out of my
journey first keep in mind that your
Thunder tracks can only transform into
an out of aquatic mode while it's in the
water so what you're going to want to do
is pick up a bit of momentum on land so
you can launch out into the water and
then transform and wait until you're
back on solid ground to transform back
another thing you'll want to keep in
mind is that the Thunder tracks has a
shorter RC range while it's in the water
so don't get too far from shore the last
thing I'll say is this that even though
the Thunder tracks can easily handle any
terrain make sure you check those treads
after driving over surfaces like gravel
or rocks the smaller objects can get
caught in there and that's going to slow
down your performance thanks for tuning
in today guys I am really excited about
the Thunder tracks and this is a vehicle
that will really take you anywhere
Algy overdrive what does driving the
future look like it looks like a
state-of-the-art optical sensor scanning
invisible code 500 times each second it
looks like artificial intelligence
equipped with advanced web brain
designed specifically to stop you and it
looks like your rad dad with his iPad
taking you out once again on people who
drive and drive the future so let me
explain to those of you that don't
understand what Midori is and what we've
created exactly what we do have so this
is the Midori car it's our muscle car
it's our painted yourself car so you can
take this and paint it any color you
want and make it custom to you now what
you do is you take off this fender
and as you can see our screws they don't
fall out so your kids won't lose the
screws and then you have the hood and
this piece right here now that's about
half the car what you have left are the
four wheels on the two suspension pieces
and then the actual chassis and the seat
now it's cool about this car is you can
see how it has the suspension and you
can also see how you actually can drive
this car with your fingers and so it
definitely brings something to market
that's different in addition to every
license plate is custom so you can
actually go on to Midori comm register
your personalized car maybe want to be
painted yourself and all then you join
this community that of course is safe
for kids and so it's been really
exciting to see people make these cars
their own
