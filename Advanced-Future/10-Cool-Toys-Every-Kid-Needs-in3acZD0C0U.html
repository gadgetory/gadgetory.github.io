vehicles ages six to ten whose America's
top robots and their own vevo streaming
video keeps us in on the action
and it's safe to say we have a clear
winner introducing ANFO a $59 robot
anyone can adopt an PO is an affordable
educational and easy to assemble robot
it takes less than an hour to assemble
and we'll teach you about robotics ant
Bo has six legs and walks just like an
ant plus it is also a robot
ant+ robot equals and both designed for
anyone within an inquisitive mind ant bo
is a great starting point for young
inventors and for people interested in
steam education even if you are not a
maker it is still a cool robot companion
and you will have fun with once
assembled you can control ant Bo by
remote by your own voice or even by
drawing lines with more than one ant Bo
you can even make them fight each other
n po enhances problem-solving abilities
when you are familiar with how it works
tweak its code and make it do different
things you can also upgrade your robot
with dozens of different sensor modules
and program it via arduino scratch or
when do ANFO is connected it collects
user data and uploads it to the cloud
users will be able to check metrics like
distance skill levels and
accomplishments and share with friends
an PO is intelligent it has 30 neurons
that enable it to learn to adapt just
like a real creature as time goes it
becomes smarter faster and more capable

hi I'm Sarah and this is my little one
Ethan he's always curious about
everything and asked hundreds of
questions each day we want to encourage
his curiosity so we can explore and
learn more about the world so we invited
this cuddly little fuzzball into our
lives
meet Lu Bo an incredibly smart robot
powered by the most advanced interactive
technology
Ruvo is both playful and goofy and pinks
Ethan laughs all the time a small team
of graduates from MIT and Harvard
curates exciting things about the world
and shares them with Lu Bo so Lou bo is
like a knowledgeable and kid-friendly
search engine who not only answers
questions it also inspires Ethan to
explore more Bluebell creates an
imaginary space to experience different
possibilities so Ethan can be anyone and
work on anything
no wonder Ethan asked me so much about
being a dragon trainer lately Lu Bo
always knows how to spend an independent
and creative afternoon so Ethan never
runs out of fun activities to choose
from
sometimes where Bo helps take Ethan's
fun ideas one step further and brings
his imagination to life
