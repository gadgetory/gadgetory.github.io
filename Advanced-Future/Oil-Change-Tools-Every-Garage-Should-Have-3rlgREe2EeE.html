what's up everybody this is dave with
quick Jack and welcome to another video
we're gonna be changing oil today is if
you probably couldn't tell with a the
stuff we've got on the table oil changes
are one of those things that we're
always doing right it's probably the
most common thing we're doing in our
home garages with that said one of the
big questions we get asked a lot is how
much room do I have to work underneath
my car when it's raised done quick jack
and an oil change is a perfect time to
show you exactly that now I'm a pretty
big dude
sothey odds are if I have enough space
to work you're gonna have plenty of room
to work to do this job today we're gonna
be using the quick Jack BL 5000 SLX
with the tall blocks now these are the
tall set of blocks that come standard
when you buy your quick Jack kit his car
is gonna be a 2017 Ford Fusion Energi
plug-in hybrid which is actually a first
for me because I've never done anything
on a hybrid so without any further ado
let's get to work
introducing the Lyle 17 to 82 fluid
extractor and transfer pump the pump
assembles and disassembles for easy
cleaning enabling use with multiple
fluids its high quality seal stands up
to caustic fluids it works great for
transferring or siphoning all types of
automotive fluids but is not recommended
for use with flammable liquids it can
quickly remove transmission oil from
automatic transmissions that are
overfilled it also works great for
adding oil to differentials be sure to
close the valve before removing too
the kit includes two vows a shutoff
valve for transferring fluids and a
siphon valve with intake and discharge
hoses ideal for removing antifreeze when
the desired volume of fluid has been
extracted
no valves are needed to be turned the
tool automatically switches to discharge
the fluid when the handle is pushed down
this is the aleko oil extractor it comes
with the device itself two tubes for
extraction and two clamps to secure a
ship to the device in order to get
powered to the device there's two clamps
that connect to your car battery on each
side there's places to put the tubes but
they have black plastic covers over them
and you can remove those covers and
connect the tubes that way at the top of
the device is your power switch as you
can see the two tubes are connected but
they don't have clamps on for
demonstration purposes the direction of
flow is to the right so it goes from the
left tube into the right tube so your
output would come out from the bigger
tube</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
