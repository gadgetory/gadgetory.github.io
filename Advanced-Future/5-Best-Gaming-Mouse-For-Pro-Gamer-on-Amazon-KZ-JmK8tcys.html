performance wireless gaming mouse to
give gamers complete freedom of movement
today we bring in the next generation of
wireless gaming introducing a new razor
lion's head with state of the art
proprietary adaptive frequency
technology the adaptive frequency
technology scans frequencies in the 2.4
gigahertz bandwidth hundreds of times a
second compares to the clearest
strongest channel so whether you have
Wi-Fi or other wireless devices on the
same frequency the wage-earner lancehead
maintains a solid connection and
eliminates lags or spikes during
gameplay we put the razor Lancet against
another wireless gaming mouse in a wave
of tests here he simulated an office
environment where multiple Wi-Fi
networks exist on the same bandwidth
introduced other wireless gaming devices
such as a wireless headset
stuff on the test and high-performance
given context
finally can you created a land
environment where multiple wireless
gaming mice are computing for similar
frequencies
despite all of this there is no drop-off
in the signal unlike the other wireless
gaming mouse
the waves are land that clearly
dominates with industry-leading
transmission stability this is the new
Razer lancehead engineering for wireless
supremacy with ten out of three we're
making small improvements on one of the
best - ever design the G 900 so we've
updated the design of the original G 900
by adding 50 million clip buttons to the
mechanical pivot button design which is
an awesome new innovative design of the
switch not only that but now with the
addition of the module system we have
two different modules it supports our
power play system
we've also added in a weight module that
allows you to add 10 grams to the weight
of the mouse with g9o 3 we wanted to
make sure that we solved all of the
problems of people perceive with
wireless gaming so they're concerned
about latency they're concerned about
weight and they're concerned about
battery life we solved the problem of
latency with our lives being Wireless we
do a ton of testing both in real world
and in simulated environments some
gamers were finding that the incredible
weight reduction we did with the
original G 900 actually made the product
slightly too light for them so we wanted
to add a 10 gram weight to allow people
to have the option to increase the way
that they wanted to and finally talking
about battery life we now not only have
our incredibly efficient sensor and
battery design but we've also introduced
power play which is a new solution that
allows you to never have to worry about
charging your mouse again c903 comes
with the following us first G 903 mouse
the combination data and USB cable for
both charging and data it has an
accessory case in which you'll see both
replaceable buttons and extra button
blanks a Lightspeed receiver USB adapter
and an optional pin granblade so a few G
9:03 plug your USB cable into your PC
and then take the USB adapter we'll get
to the end of the USB cable and you're
ready to go jinan o3 features our
dual-mode hyper fast scroll wheel for
quick quick or free spinning scrolling
the hyper fast wheel has a new spoke
design which is allows to remove a lot
of the weight we have five dpi levels it
features our pmw 3366 sensor which is
heinessen sensor new to the G 903 is the
ability to add an optional 10 gram
weight just push open the weight door
put the weight inside of it and use the
magnets to put it back in G 903 can be
set up either left or right-handed
thanks to the removable button panels
and buttons you can pop them off they
stick on with magnets and you can set it
up so it's either left side right side
or both sides of the same time when you
make something great how can you make it
greater well you can make it last a lot
longer and you can also introduce new
technologies like powerful a we're able
to consistently outperform the
competition in terms of signal strength
and fidelity and we were able to get a
ton of functionality and without
exceeding on it and 10 grams combine all
these things together and you get an
incredibly powerful wireless gaming
mouse that's simple and straightforward
to use and incredibly comfortable
up until now Corsair has taken a bit of
an early 1900s approach to the ergonomic
shape of their performance gaming mice
anyway you like it as long as it's more
or less discs give or take some
aluminium and lighting effects but with
the saver optical and Sabre laser all of
that changes they've got the usual
high-end features so high-end sensors
supporting up to 6400 and 8200 dpi for
the optical and laser versions
respectively eight buttons that are
fully programmable using the Corsair
Utility engine software on the fly dpi
switching that RGB indicator LEDs or for
that matter RGB lighting in four
separate zones all over the mouse and
finally high performance all Imran left
and right mouse click switches that are
highly responsive and rated at 20
million clicks each but all that does
comes with a very different feel first
up is the weight difference out of mere
hundred grams for either model the sabre
is perfect for low sensitivity players
who are physically moving their mouths a
significant distance with each motion
and they need to lift it quite
frequently or really anyone who prefers
a light not as I suppose and the next
major change is ergonomic s' the favors
contoured shape lends itself well to
being used as a pawn grip Mouse by
gamers with smaller jams and a hybrid
grip Mouse for many others so that's the
sabre in a nutshell the same great
Corsair technology in a new lightweight
curvy package thanks for watching guys
this has been a
ootek wiki on Linus and I'll see you
again next time
throughout my career I've been playing
with a lot of different mice I got
introduced of Logitech and I was a
little bit skeptical the size was a
little bit smaller and the shape was
also a little bit different so I was
thinking hmmm is this something I kind
of could get used to but after some time
I actually realized it was a really good
Mouse for my pretty small hand it
actually fit really well with a small
Mouse so I was really impressed by the
how it was working with me one of the
good things about the logic G through
your threes that the precision of the
sensor is really good and it's something
I really need when I play counter-strike
the smoothness of the sensor is
impressive and every time I play I just
feel like I have complete control of
what I'm doing the 303 is really easily
configurable and it has a great shape
it's those really great on the mousepad
really using it really easy to control
and it's really light so whenever you
see an enemy it's really easy to just
click there hit me my team is
participating in a lot tournaments and
this is where it's really important to
us to have a reliable Mouse and this is
where the Logitech G 303 is really
important for us it has an infill for
memory so every time you set up your
mouse on you lose your it just have two
things they all time and it's just so
easy for us we started winning
tournaments when we started using the C
feel free and that's okay
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
