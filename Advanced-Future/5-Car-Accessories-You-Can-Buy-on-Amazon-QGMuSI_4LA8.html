road and set your own with Beltronics
gt7 radar detector the best-in-class
18 7 provides extreme radar and laser
detection protections in a sleek design
with supercharged accuracy to block
annoying false alerts from radar laser
guns to red-light cameras to pull the
weight on and air patrol there are more
ways than ever to get a ticket but
Beltronics cutting-edge technology as
you cover the gc7 powerful digital
signal processing finds far-reaching
french exceedingly fast while providing
instantly clear voice alert if you can
way ahead of what feel far down the road
the average speeding ticket costs $150
and given one ticket means you're likely
to pay $900 in increased insurance costs
over the next three years time I own a
place with radar/laser detector is legal
in every state except Virginia and
Washington DC the Beltronics gt7 pays
for itself when saving you from a single

hello Adam
hello again empty not this roud sound -
early bird cafe you and me we're busy
people and being busy means checking
your phone even when you're not supposed
to even when you're on the road but now
there's nephew hold on I gotta get this
okay talk to me hey Adam quick reminder
first thing today is that coffee with
Connie and Greg got the early bird early
on my way
he was brilliant about nap T is this
after routes au automatically rerouting
to save ten minute perfect never been
this way before
let's switch to Navi - see what's so
brilliant about Navi is its display is
focused in the distance so your eyes are
never off the road it's also 40 times
brighter than your smartphone I think
Tim's automatically to a TV the speed
day or night in fact it works re going
to take person to Greg and I actually
want to do both Cafe add-on 62 smiley
face Oh awesome
luckily roids is one of my favorites
Navi uses Google Maps and built-in
offline map you'll never get lost like
out here in the desert and it's
connected to your car which means that
on gas rerouting to nearest gas station
sex gonna be there in two feet
yo bye guys
hi Stephy see you soon
waste
we're engulfed by mass production
accelerating consumption and rampant
materialism products are designed to
become obsolete then discarded for the
next big thing for the pleating of
natural resources at astonishing rate or
public pollutants and trash into the
Arab developments and sustainability are
promising but they're not happening fast
enough and the solutions are still too
expensive and inaccessible what if we
can make a machines last longer run more
efficiently and self-improve instead of
supporting the high turnover consumerism
that we see today what if we had
solution here and now that's our mission
at try rotex
we're tackling the problem of waste by
creating the first of its kind
nanoparticles that actually repair
machines of increasing performance and
efficiency harnessing the power of
nanotechnology we came up with a small
solution to this big problem turbotech
nanoparticles has two faces one
deadlines are one less like the sticky
side reinforces and strengthens or the
slippery side reduces friction just like
carbon selling the diamonds in the
mantle of the earth TurboTax
self-aligned through a diamond like
lattice structure under the heat and
pressure the energy unlike other
protective proteins this process
actually reverses engine where the
particle by particle resources were
better than new condition for initial
focus was to make lubricants safer
come on many nanomaterials we worked on
one unique outlier reduce friction
dramatically down to super lubricity
level with the help of national labs and
research agencies we understood the
mechanism and developed proprietary
production products after years of
research and rigorous testing who are
proud to introduce car boss a safe and
green additive for your car by improves
gas mileage boost horsepower and extend
the life of your engine car boss comes
in a small recyclable applicator that
you inject it into the oil fill of your
car
as you drive turbo text nanoparticles
are forged into a diamond like armor
around engine components rejuvenating
our daily driver to become more
efficient than when it was new a third
of the gas that you put in your car is
wasted on ancient physician with 612
million cars on the road that waste adds
up running on car boss will use less
fuel reduce pollution and leave a
smaller carbon footprint
