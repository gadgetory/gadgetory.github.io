sentence the nouveau is a unique fun and
simple conversation starter the nouveau
is a modern interpretation of the
classic 19th century penny farthing
design with 21st century technology its
what would have been if the multi speed
hub was invented before the chain and
derailleur it's what happens when we
remember that riding a bike can be about
having fun and standing out from the
crowd it's not an attempt to rent a
traditional bikes obsolete
we love bikes all of them it's something
altogether different
I'm Josh and I'm Gabe and together we're
the brains and butts that make up by
simple
we designed the nouveau because we feel
there is so much room to explore bicycle
design by applying modern technology to
classic forms we wanted to tip our caps
to early bicycle designs and inventors
while using modern bike components like
an innovative two-speed direct drive hub
with no chain cogs chain ring or even
shifter cables this hub is exactly what
those moustache waxing top-hat wearing
bike designers dreamed about
with that two-speed hub we were able to
reduce the wheel size from the huge
traditional front wheel to a much more
manageable 36 inch wheel making the
nouveau safer and so much more practical
it gives for low gear capable of
climbing hills and a high gear fast
enough to keep up with your friends on
more traditional bikes it's late
Victorian meets contemporary petticoat
meets yoga pants Nouveau meets Nouveau
wax mustache meets well wax mustache

light enough to carry in a backpack the
