from Bell &amp;amp; slim James here a lot of
people online have been asking me about
I want to been doing what for the last
couple of weeks I'm really been posting
very much the reason for that is because
I've been working on a brand new wallet
design well what have I been designing
this I call this at the moment I'm not
sure if it's a nice name I call it the
mini wallet it's a bit smaller than the
the original Burlinson wallet here you
can see his comparison main differences
being that this smaller wallet doesn't
have the happy the identification ID
card window and also it only has
slightly has only has two slots here
still has a little it's a little section
for putting your mini banknotes in and
this one can fit a nice wallet he
squeezed six card so three anything it's
also what I think is quite handy is this
little this little hole here for putting
the cards out makes it very easy to get
you have cards in and out these wallets
come in the same colours as our other
ones we've got the brown light brown
gray and we've lost a little white one
I'd really like to hear what you guys
think of these things I'm taking them to
no corner stuff this weekend to see why
they are let's say the general public
thinks to them I think they're great
they're very nice and small bit really
nicely in your pocket in fact you barely
notice them some people who complained
that they're a bit too thin I don't
think that's a problem at all
yeah if you'd like to get your hands on
one I'm not selling them online yet but
I am selling them at the Nikon a flea
market in Berlin so get them down and
come and take a look and I'd love to
hear what you think that's all for me
thanks a lot for watching don't forget
to hit the like button down here or
share with your friends down here
villains live at we've improved our new
line in every way from the materials to
the function to the construction we're
using a great new whether it's
sustainably sourced from a tannery
that's a member of the leather working
group it's a fantastic leather because
it utilizes this hybrid tanning process
that gives us the best properties about
mineral and vegetable tanning so you've
got this really strong top grain leather
which is beautifully wearing hand filled
that you find from a edgy tan leather
instead of painting the edges on our
wallets we're enrolling them so it holds
up longer it takes a bit more effort and
material to do it but it's definitely
worth it in the long run and then
there's there's the flex lock which
we're super excited about because it
really changes sort of leather sleeve
style wallets there's no more stretching
out in the pocket
we can hold you know two cards or six
cards equally as well go from six cards
down to two and have no problem with
with loose pockets now so I fold has
been updated with this our euro our
sleeve has been redesigned it's a little
larger format but includes PE the flex
lock with an external pocket our micro
has been updated with that the rolled
edges for durability and also
we've updated the elastic our Rolly
junior features the new leather as well
as a tougher stronger thinner backing so
it doesn't add as much thickness to your
film
so our newest wallet the agent bifold is
when we're really excited about because
it bridges sort of a traditional wall
and with our Wally buy fold so it
utilizes the slim construction there's
got two interior pull tab pockets along
with two quick access slots it's it's a
great wallet for for traveling because
they don't carry us or international
bills I've been I've been carrying it as
my exclusive wallet for three or four
months now and I love it it's still
small enough to fit in in your front
pocket so we're excited about getting
that one out there
the fun but ever by
oh hey I'm Derek
the waltz been around for ages something
we use every day some waltz our bigs
hey buddy what do you got there
wallet there you go
some are little
hey we got the time yeah thanks some or
leather
and some are elastic
technology is making it so we can pay
for things with our smart phones but not
our replaces up to speed
and not every place accepts cards
don't get me wrong technology is
important but it's still a good idea to
carry a wall with you with the important
things you'll need to use every day this
is the infinity wallet it's super simple
it's got two pockets to hold the cards
that you use every day and a two pocket
to carry cash
you can keep it I used to carry all
sorts of rewards cards gift cards
coupons and restaurant punch cards in my
wallet I found I wasn't using these very
often they were just taking up too much
space making my wallet thick so now I
keep them in my car and only carry the
cards I actually use every day in this
the infinity wallet cards are easy to
remove and put back I keep the cards I
use most frequently in the front pocket
and the others in the back pocket since
I rarely use cash I keep a 10 and a 20
in the through pocket you'll find what
works for you and there's no need to
worry about cards or cash falling out
they sit snugly inside the wallet and
are quick and easy to access
when you need them so get rid of your
bulky wallet and switch to the Infinity
wallet it's a difference you're going to
feel or you won't feel anymore
pledge today and you'll feel the
difference - thanks
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
