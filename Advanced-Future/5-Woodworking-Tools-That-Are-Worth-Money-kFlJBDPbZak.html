connect modular clamp system from
Crescent redefines expectations of what
a clamp can do 500 pounds of holding
power secures your work with almost 60
percent more force than comparable
clamps that's strong enough to hold
heavy objects upright with confidence
but the real power of the connect clamp
is its integrated connection system that
lets you join and rotate multiple clamps
to achieve almost any position odd
angles and difficult corners like those
on cabinets and furniture are securely
held in position Crescent twin locks
allow you to easily add additional
clamps expanding your connection options
simply attach a twin lock on the end of
the rail and slide another connect clamp
into place connect clamps are equally
useful as a spreader lift the bar lock
slide and reverse the position of the
head the trigger action now applies
force in the opposite direction large
pads provide maximum surface contact and
protect delicate surfaces pads can be
removed to gain additional clearance
when working in tight spaces or around
overhanging edges an integrated pipe
grip is molded into each connect clamp
round objects are locked down tight
preventing twisting when cutting and or
drilling durable rubber grips at comfort
and prevent slips and connect clamps are
built to last with the rugged quality
that has made the Crescent brand famous
connect clamps are available in six and
twelve inch sets and the twin lock
accessory Crescent
the Hercules professional 12-inch double
bevel sliding miter saw was designed to
be as good as the industry's leading
professional miter saw but at a fraction
of the price
Dewalt is the benchmark for professional
miter saws they're terrific saws but
they're expensive let's see how Hercules
holds its own against the best both
Hercules and Dewalt can cut seven and a
half inch crown molding vertically
nested both can cut six and
three-quarter inch baseboard against the
fence both have a fourteen inch
horizontal crosscut capacity and both
saws can miter 50 degrees left and sixty
degrees right the Hercules miter saw
features an LED precision blade guide
system just like the DeWalt the Hercules
miter saw features an adjustable
stainless steel miter detent plate with
10 positive stops just like the DeWalt
both saws have a miter detent override
and both have a double bevel design with
positive stops at the most common bevel
angles just like the DeWalt the Hercules
saw comes with a 12 inch blade with a
thin curve for maximum cutting
efficiency both have a 15 amp motor the
Hercules motor has an output of 4100 rpm
while the DeWalt is at 3800 just like
the DeWalt the Hercules has an industry
proven dual horizontal stainless steel
rail system both saws are 56 pounds the
Hercules was built to last and is
ergonomically designed so it's easy to
handle and convenient to transport the
corner clamp by wolf craft opens up new
possibilities when screwing or gluing
boards together at 90-degree angles for
example picture frames simple one-handed
operation leaves the other hand free for
work the Corner clamp achieves a strong
clamping force and provides a flat
surface it is suitable for boards with a
thickness of 10 to 22 millimeters and
automatically adjust to different board
thicknesses when building a shelf for
example drilling and screw driving can
be carried out in one operation the
corner clamp is non-slip padded jaw
grips to hold the material firmly in
place without marking years ago the
combination plane was created to replace
shelves of wooden planes Veritas has
released their own version of that shop
where a course that uses both our
existing
plane blades as well as the new ones
that are specific to the combination
plane the Veritas combination plane has
three key components the body the
sliding section and the fence assembly
the body holds the blade the blade
adjustment knob one of the scoring Spurs
the depth stop and the handle the
sliding section travels on two rods
that's secured to the body it also
carries a second depth stop in scoring
spur this component provides support for
wider blades the fence also slides on
the two rods and carries to fence knobs
the sub fence the sub fence adjustment
knob and the two sub fence locking knobs
the combination plane comes with a set
of five inch and 8 inch rods that can be
installed for either left or
right-handed use to deploy the scoring
spur loosen the retention screw and
slide the cutter down no deeper than
1/32 of an inch then tighten the screw
to lock it into place a convenient
feature is the through hole that allows
access to the scoring spur adjustment
screws without dismantling the plane the
depth stops are set by loosening the
depth stop lock knob rotating the depth
stop adjusting knob then tightening the
lock knob again you can set the fence by
sliding it on the rods then locking it
close to its final position using the
fence knobs then loosen the sub fence
knobs and gradually bring the fence into
final position this is the rockwell
vibrafree random orbital sander let's
get one out of the box and into the shop
the tool is a 3.3 amp random orbital
sander called the vibrafree it weighs
3.3 pounds
the cord is 10 feet long that's helpful
you also get a dust extraction adapter
this is if you have a shop vac or if
your shop is clipped with the dust
extraction system the dust collection
system ruck we'll calls the cyclonic
dust air separator I know with my old
sander the cloth bag dust would still
fill the air I did not see that happen
on this sander the kit comes with some
60 grit 120 grit and 180 grit sandpaper
five each these are easy to install with
a hook and a loop system that holds them
tightly you get this great little
carrying bag the tool has variable speed
the claim here is that the five-inch
vibrafree not only dampens vibrations
but cancels it out I must say it did not
leave my hand
feeling weary the grip was very
comfortable the tool easy to manage the
fiber free has a three year warranty the
warranty card is in the man</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
