Terrace or sidewalk made of natural
stone but moving those heavy stones and
concrete slabs is a problem for you not
to mention aligning the slabs while you
are constantly bent over that's a
prescription for strong back and hip
pain
you don't need that professional help is
now available the Lange fit paving slab
lifter with the extra long handle
protects against back strain it's a real
relief to be able to move and align
slabs without bending down deeply and it
doesn't matter if the slabs are being
transported upright or on their sides
the Lange fit paving slab lifter picks
them up and doesn't let them go with
standard paving slab lifters the larger
the slabs the further away from your
body the paving slab lifter has to be
held in order to avoid constantly
banging your shins it's much easier with
the Lange fit paving slab lifter it's
perfect for transporting slabs over
longer distances just grab the slab in
an upright position lift it slightly and
start your journey the slab will not
bump against your legs and your back
stays straight and relaxed the specially
shaped extremely stable holding clamps
make it easy to grab and lift the slabs
even when they are standing upright
if the slab is too heavy for one person
then the two-person support arm will
assist you just insert the paving slab
lifter in the holder of the support arm
the rubber agronomically shaped handles
provide a secure and slip free grip
under all conditions which means that
moving extremely heavy slabs is no
longer a problem the Langford paving
slab lifter comes in two sizes from
twenty to fifty centimeters for normal
slabs and from twenty to sixty two
centimeters for extra-large slabs
the holding clamps can be adjusted very
simply with two wingnuts the adjustments
are made in one centimeter intervals
that means the land fit paving slab
lifter can be used with almost any sized
slab from twenty to fifty or sixty two
centimetres in addition the handle can
be turned 90 degrees when laying pavers
up against a wall or step the use of a
soldier course is not required to
prevent the small pieces from falling
out the next paver that would for
instance go in this position goes in
this direction but we can't overhang the
paver so in most cases you guys will
take a pair of tape measures and measure
the distance at the halfway point and
measure the distance at the edge of the
paver then using those the measure out
onto the paver and try and get their
line problem is from one paper to the
next the cuts move in and out it's not
very clean it's not very accurate the
paper scribe gives you the same it gives
you an accurate angle very quickly we're
able to set it right into the joint and
into the opening push the head up until
it's flat against the wall that this
head pivots you want to get full surface
contact
it's a locking thumb lever he'll then
remove it from the opening put it up
against the corner of the back of the
paver you want to mark with the head in
place
yeah now I have the exact angle to make
that cut we'll do the next one and roll
this time I'll go to the left edge just
ahead up until it makes full surface
contact and lining up with the left
corner one thing I should note is we're
able to work off the corners on these
smaller unit pavers because of the the
four inch dimension I'm working with say
a six by nine 12 by 12 larger unit
pavers instead of working from one edge
of the other it's best to pick your
points so that you're the center of the
paver is what you're basing your pivot
off of the wall take these two
extracting pavers is not a test you're
gonna find too many volunteers to take
on but what we've done to help with this
situation is we've created a tool we
call it the quickie paper popper this is
for extracting your pavers out of an
existing patio driveway or walkway
scenario and obviously it is a daunting
task it is not something that it's very
easily accomplished we recommend to put
your paper popper
we also recommend a sim 60 hammer and in
the demonstration you'll see how the
hammers quite a useful tool also in this
process
but we're gonna do is we're gonna drive
these teeth down between the joints of
the paver that we wish to extract and
again with this adjustable we can open
all 24 inch and we can close it up all
the way down the four inch and again we
have additional adjustment here to move
this rear plate in closer to common
eight those those smaller pavers
normally what I would do is set the
tooth at the front also first I can lift
up on this handle
allow me to move this the second rear
plate no you always want this handle
down and what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
take my sim 60 hammer I'm gonna hit
these plates these heavy plates and drag
those teeth down into the seams of the
pavers I'll do that now so now I have
these teeth down into the seams of the
pavers what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
pick up steady pressure you're gonna see
how these teeth will lock in so now I
have a full locking system there
I'll pick up steady pressure I'm gonna
hammer on the outskirts of the paper
that we're wishing to take up and that's
gonna loosen up these pavers so I'll do
that wall keep me steady pressure same
time they hold me in here keep steady
pressure now I can just do a little
Rocking and again you can take
here's nzp be safe

installing larger pavers normally
requires both hands it's slow and hard
on the hands the paper paw was created
with both these issues in mind favor paw
works as a natural extension of the hand
using two paper paws simultaneously
speeds installation up to 300% you'll
get more consistent setting with less
fatigue and it's quick adjust feature
gives you fast easy adjustment for
pavers of different sizes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
