man that was a great run
and the crowd goes wild
hey Dad
KY borrow your car that's all now it's
done okay
time to watch a pro
kakaw it's arguably the most powerful
language on the planet and as the
industry leaders in connected play it's
a critical part of our DNA
a few years ago Spiro began an
experiment to prove that play could be a
powerful teacher educators caring when
students begin programming our basic
lessons doesn't surprises for what
follows certainly did powered by an
online community made up of
forward-thinking teachers and curious
students spirit edu took on a life of
its own
what started an after-school coding
clubs quickly spread to the entire
curriculum from art to science and from
math the language parts we are still own
a inspired and humbled by the social
media photos and user generated lessons
showcasing brilliant minds using our
robots and unexpected and innovative
ways and even though code is at the core
of everything we do at Spiro the Wolves
teachers taught us something through
eating youth isn't just about the code
it's beyond code
order us a pizza your house did but I
got the last one
sure you did buddy I'll tell you what
you beat me I'll get you beat me you
beat me
you
my turn
power up fpv the first ever paper
airplane drone with a live streaming
camera using state-of-the-art technology
how a pesky be lets you see what your
plane put it in different words you feel
as if you are flying through the air
riding a paper airplane yes
power up fpv makes your regular paper
plane look like a kitty next to a light
riding up will be ready just take a
piece of paper fold it into a plane and
attach the module put your phone in the
cardboard viewer and you're ready to fly
the camera screams live video through an
app on your very own smartphone sitting
in the head mounted goggles you control
your plane just tells your head light
and there's also a gamepad mode for when
you feel like handle control powerup
FTB's camera can swivel around that's
how you also get winged view and back
view so you can see this defining moment
in your life look if you flying a
power-up fpv this is john while his
neighbor is yelling about how his dog
ate his paper this is John in the same
situation using brick so what is brick
so it's an awesome version of building
blocks that makes your designs come to
life with electricity sensors and
Bluetooth let's see some prototypes from
our testing lab closing a circuit this
is bluetooth
sound sensor life sensor proximity
sensor how amazing is using brick so
this is Kate making her morning coffee
while discovering Roy used all the milk
for his cereal this is Kate same
situation with brick cell brick so has
three types of blocks connectors action
blocks and trigger vlogs use the
connectors to make a circuit then embed
the action box to give your design light
or movement now you can use trigger
blocks to control your design with sound
proximity and light Rick so can also be
controlled remotely which means you can
connect your design to your phone and
even to the Internet and automate stuff
if you're into that sort of thing but
who likes to automate stop right oh and
there's a battery block which will is
the battery here's Mike while his
coworker turns off the air conditioner
even though it is 90 degrees outside
this is Mike same situation with brick
so you can use brick so to operate
designs made with regular building
blocks which will make them like a
hundred times cooler no wires need it
all bricks or block components are built
in brick so is also an amazing
educational tool for your kids but know
that they'll forever mock regular
building blocks buzz and Amir have been
working on brick so for a long time
they're both physicists so they know a
thing or two about electricity so if you
like building stuff and don't mind
getting addicted support them and get
your own brick so it'll change your life
or just make you happy
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
