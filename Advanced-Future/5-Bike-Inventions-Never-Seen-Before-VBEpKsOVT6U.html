helps people have their bike comfortably
fit in their lifestyle
it's a detachable handlebar system to
install it you just simply push it in
and twist and to remove it you move the
color back rotate and remove it by
removing the handlebars you actually
save over 14 inches the idea of Billy
bars was to take that bike that you
loved and just make it a little bit
better but I've able to make it fit and
where you live we're starting off with
three main handlebars we have the
straights got the bullhorn we have the
drop down we do have a fourth style
which would be up on the cruiser bikes
along with your handlebars you have the
stem so this will be easily mounted to
your bike all the handlebars are
completely interchangeable with this
stem and then we also have a wall mount
which will allow you to convert your
handlebars into a mount to hold your
bicycle the real goal with Billy bars is
to help people love bikes more I think a
lot of good can come from more biking
when I see somebody biking and have a
little bit more hope for Humanity
hi this is Harry my name is Paul we are
the founders of Macbeth and we would
like to introduce you today our magnetic
pedal innovation
well it's a real new innovative panel
which was designed to give you solid
performance a Suicide Club with
supporting force without fear
hassle-free by key this is one of our
first prototypes we have to do a lot of
innovations to come to this product
exactly and what's really good on this
panel we can equip with different magnet
sizes so what you see here is our
standard panel this gives you a pulling
force of about 15 kilograms
click on solidly and you pull up
straight but as soon as you start to
shift your foot a little bit even in
case of critical situation you will get
up very easily in fact you will almost
not feel the magnet
on the show we have metallic plate it
fits on every SPD comfortable shoe one
of the big advantages of this setup is
that it is totally insensitive 2/3 you
will not stretch any floors because this
is all inside the sole without any
elevations it's a much lighter panel and
we have a strong neodymium magnet which
is the strongest magnet that is
available in the market
we have a solar damper unit on it which
gives us the ability to adjust the
magnet height to fit the shoe and also
to give you that solid feel when you
come back onto your shoe and when you
right
all the best for a safe ride really hope
to see you out there
hopefully view from Macbeth on your bike
introducing flag a new tool flares the
first app integrated smart from high
school that allows you to easily mount
the danger hot spots on the roads we run
their operates just like a regular life
except if you come across issues on the
road you can press one of their easy to
reach buttons to map them simply attach
flare to your handlebars within easy
reach of your tongue much like a bear
and then turn it on and ride designed
for everyday use day and night groaning
change flower works by linking by
bluetooth the flare app on a smartphone
every button press plus a GPS location
on the RAM out there it's designed to
map three main issues you come across
broken road surfaces or potholes
Paul wrote everyone if you experience a
close pass or near miss that's the road
danger button and if you come across a
confusing hard to navigate cross road
press the junction danger by
when you finish a ride any flares you've
dropped need to be perfect
open the app add further comments or
images and then view the flare map of
passports
when you get home you can recharge your
fed device by a microUSB and visit the
flair site for more analysis this map is
available from local authorities and
other riders in order to focus council
resources versus flower hotspots of
pressure on decision-makers and warn
current and future riders from areas to
take caution the light itself is 300
lumens fits all handle bar types is
water-resistant USB rechargeable has a
runtime of seven point five hours of
black for by feedback from councils and
wider groups across the UK flair can be
your go to front light once you play an
active role in helping to improve
conditions for all road users
one of my favorite things to do is to
get out and ride my bike but the
combination of rough roads and stiff
bike frames means riding can be really
tough on your body in 2016 we launched
the shock stop suspension step-dad
cushioning to the front end of the bike
the stem changed the way people thought
about suspension but the front of the
bike is only half the equation that's
why we're so excited to introduce the
shock stop seat post a revolutionary
short travel suspension seatpost
that will completely change your riding
experience no matter what kind of bike
you ride maybe you're out for an epic
gravel adventure or just dealing with
potholes on your daily commute you're
gonna find rough roads wherever you ride
modern bikes are designed for speed and
efficiency not for comfort this means
bumps and impacts pass straight into
your body which leads to fatigue pain or
even injury
we designed the shock stop seat post to
suspend your body and isolate you from
the shocks and vibrations of the road we
optimize the travel and suspension
kinematics to provide a super plush
bottomless suspension feel we designed
the seat post to integrate seamlessly
with the styling of modern bikes you can
change the spring rate and preload to
match your specific riding style
and it's compatible with all types of
writing gravel ie bike commuter Road and
mountain
studies show fatigue reduces riding
efficiency by up to 20%
typically adding comfort to your bike
meant sacrificing performance the shocks
top seat post lets you ride faster and
more efficiently because instead of
bracing yourself against impacts you can
stay seated and keep pedaling over rough
surfaces it reduces the accumulated
effects of bumps and vibrations allowing
you to ride further faster and more
comfortable the shocks top seat post is
the rare product that increases comfort
and performance riding the shocks top
seat post is truly transformative
technology in cycling has come a long
way but with all the advancements was
seen one thing remains the same we'd
like to introduce to you a new way to
carry your water bottle in fact any
accessory so let us present the freedom
cycle system at all starts with our
camera this pin allows us to think
differently our bottle or accessory sits
on not in eliminating the cage we can
mount anything on our pen
the freedom ease is our traditional
round bottle the freedom fast
is our state-of-the-art aerodynamic
bottle wind tunnel designed this arrow
bottle matches modern frame geometry and
it's fast the freedom fix is a
revolutionary toolbox simple to use yet
aerodynamic and versatile the freedom
system is simple one pin that secures
many applications the freedom cycling
system</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
