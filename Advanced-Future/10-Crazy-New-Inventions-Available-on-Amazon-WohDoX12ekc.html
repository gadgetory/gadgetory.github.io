we're demos and we've made the best
shove 11 other shovels cracked bend and
break demos beats them all literally
last year we launched our kicker tool
the stealth shovel on Kickstarter people
loved it but they all agreed on one
thing they wanted something bigger
badder and made for everyone so we
listened and gathered our team to make
the bestest toughest damn this shovel
ever and we did introducing the alpha
shovel
mother nature meet daddy you wanted big
oh it's big over 20 inches long and 12
inches deep of glorious aircraft grade
aluminum means you can shovel away the
Ice Age for your driveway
it's got serrated teeth to cut ice and
shovel gliders to protect your deck
beneath so when we say it's cutting edge
we mean it
the Alpha shovel is durable and tough
rain or shine dirt or snow he built it
to weather through a lifetime of storms
in a storm through any weather our
collapsible shaft makes it easy to pack
and the built-in strap holders makes it
easy to carry and we added a saw for
good luck use it to cut anything that
might get in the way
choose between a D handle for better
grip or a T handle for better
compatibility best of all everything in
the Alpha shovel is interchangeable with
the rest of the demos family allowing
you to build a collection of
multi-purpose tools for life every job
every day for everyone the Alpha shovel
conditions be damned
champions are built not boomer set by
set lap by lap rep by Rep
each one of these reps makes us stronger
faster more skilled they provide an edge
they deliver results

athletes it activates the brains motor
cortex during training leading to
stronger and more coordinated signals
