and never miss another of
I'm jolly acordes a founder of making
bull sports and I'm really excited to
show you about our new product so this
is the make a slingshot basically it's a
powered surfboard it's got an engine
tucked right in the hardware everything
is designed from scratch to specifically
be like the ultimate personal watercraft
something you can sling under your arm
run down to the sea jump in and go
surfing it doesn't matter what the
weather is and that's what we're so
excited about this because litchi you
can go in any conditions and this thing
is still ridiculously good fun if you
take this right back to the beginning
back in the year 2000 I kind of was
thinking about this idea of making a
pasture and then discovered so actually
the concept was quite an old concept the
being around like Jeb resistance in the
1930s we didn't think about available so
we sat around with all our machines and
skills and the team involved actually
come up with it before that was really
just kind of ticked all the boxes maybe
something was really special light was
powerful it was quiet it looked cool it
had all the kind of features to make it
really user-friendly and that's what we
kind of feel like we've created here and
I really want to show you around you
know all the different cool features we
can't with and and basically you can
just take this thing straight down
you're doing it on a river you can take
it out into the surf if you can take it
out on the flat lake you can kind of
take it anywhere where there's water and
just have an insane amount of fun so
hand control you've got a rich wrist
Bank here if that comes out of the out
of the key switch then the report oughta
make the switch is off press the button
yeah and the more switches back on again
you also got a light and LED light here
which flashes up to tell you whether the
keys in or not but he's not in or
flashing antennas that I put the team so
we kind of thought of all these little
features to make it easy to use we've
got these handles here so that when
you're either in the water either
carrying it down to the beach wherever
you always got a really easy handle on
the board which is so useful and also
when you're starting up some shallow
waters it's really useful you lie on the
back of the board hold onto these two
handles and accelerate away
this is so chilly it's cool really cool
super was jammed Canyon as the chilly
island is at home until Superman tissues
when destined have a ton to offer
my boyfriend Emil and I have finished on
watersports and especially pedaling for
quite some years now but I'm always
worried to take our kids with us because
fast changing weather conditions can
make a fast return to shore quite
difficult so I started searching for an
electric motor to use with our equipment
such as then a pedal or a canoe but it
was impossible for me to find a small
light and flexible solution for this
reason I asked army if you could build
such a gadget and the idea of scuba jet
was born
for the past two years Allen and
despotic death who has excellent
know-how in software and technical
engineering developed this quartet and
also tested it extensively
during the development we have used
scuba chat regularly and had so much fun
together with the kids we have met many
people on our trips who were very
excited about scuba chat too often we've
been asked where a motor can be bought
last year we have decided to make the
scuba chat ready for mass production and
extended the adapter system different
adapters this is a possibility to use
the scuba jet for almost any water sport
equipment scuba tread terms your aquatic
equipment into fast comfortable and
reliable devices
you
you
you
you
you
on a placid canvas of water relaxation
innovation imagine hammock meets
paddleboard and it's called hambo craft
sculptor and installation artist bland
Hoke and his friend Brian Carpenter are
the guys behind the brand hammer craft
in a nutshell is a transportable frame
that you can bring anywhere to go
hammock in interesting situations
I wanted to hammock in an interesting
situation myself so I flew to Jackson
Wyoming to meet bland what are the
ingredients to make a hammock raft the
corner pieces are made out of stainless
steel and the rest of the frame the
pipes are all aluminum aluminum is
lightweight and stainless steel is just
incredibly strong the steel and aluminum
frames are strong and flexible and can
hold between two and four hammocks at a
time pretty much they're always like oh
my gosh you've got the best job on earth
did you have any idea when you made that
first sketch that it would turn out like
this as a job no definitely not the
hammock raft is a beautiful intr
twinkling of hammocks and paddle boards
injure twinkling yes yeah wait that's a
neologism yeah my favorite knowledge
isn't so what is your vision in life
what's your goal I think I mean
spreading amazement around the world
amazement through hammock aid yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
