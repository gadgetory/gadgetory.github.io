different ways to use the ultimately
versatile dual cam jam one inch webbing
tensioner to lock down your equipment
and gear in this video we'll cover the
types of webbing that you can use with
this buckle and how to rig the dual cam
Jam in both a fixed and and loose
configuration the dual cam Jam 1 inch
webbing tensioner features two cam
locking mechanisms and can work with
almost any 1 inch tubular or flat
webbing that is less than 1/10 of an
inch thick let's start by rigging the
system in the fixed end configuration
when using this unique fixed end setup
you'll use almost half the amount of
webbing as you'd normally use in a
traditional loop configuration to start
secure one end of the webbing to your
first anchor point by tying it not
directly around your anchor or by tying
a loop on one end and cinching the
webbing around the anchor by passing the
free end of the webbing through the loop
if you're wondering what type of knot
you should use we recommend using the
water knot next wrap the strap around
your load now we need to put the
tensioner on the webbing starting with a
tail end all the arrows on the dual cam
jam to feed the webbing correctly
through cam 1 you should end up with
something like this the magic of a dual
cam gym is that you can adjust the
buckle to any point along your webbing
by pressing cam 1 to slide the dual cam
jam up and down the length of the
webbing so don't worry where the dual
cam jam is located along the webbing as
it can be easily adjusted at any point
during the setup now you'll want to
bring the webbing through your second
anchor point again the errors are here
to show you the way to feed the end of
the webbing from underneath cam 2 now
it's time to lock down the load by
pulling the slack out of the webbing
next up let's look at using the dual cam
jam in a traditional loop configuration
start by feeding one end of the webbing
in the cam 1 make sure you have a couple
inches of tail coming through the buckle
like this this will help cushion the
buckle against your load now wrap the
strap around your first anchor over your
load and then around your second anchor
bring the webbing tail back to the dual
cam jam again following the arrows to
feed the webbing from underneath and
through cam 2 pull tight and you're
ready to go according to government
research under inflated tire is three
times more likely to cause it cracks
so let's do some damage 38 psi a good
tire deflating it to 27 huh 25% lower
now it's three times more dangerous now
this one and this one
okay owner it's come here I way to guess
which front tire it's under inflated
this one lifts up a little different
cell is the same yes they do and this is
the real danger you can't tell by just
looking that's how we developed a device
to help keep you safe
introducing the Zeus smart tire safety
monitor the next-generation technology
that puts you in control of your driving
safety safety has never looked so sexy
using the most advanced German sensors
Zeus monitors both tire pressure and
temperature in real-time and sends this
data to the app Zeus is the first ever
tire monitor to be able to detect slow
leaks with its advanced data mining
technology this proprietary algorithm
called accurate temp analyzes pressure
and temperature data over time and
alerts you to any slow leaks that other
tire monitoring systems would have
missed the app report clearly pinpoints
the exact tire and the rate of leakage
to make it even more versatile we've
designed it as a device that anyone can
self install take it with you on your
next trip and easily install in just
three steps on your rental car
when it comes to protecting your family
everywhere you go choose the next
generation and safety technology rescue
