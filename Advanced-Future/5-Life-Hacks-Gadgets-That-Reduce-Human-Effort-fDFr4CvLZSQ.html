more than any other object or person for
most of us it's the first thing we wake
up to and the last thing we look at so
why not make your day that little bit
easier
that's the inspiration for creating the
original ASIC connect cable to improve
your relationship with your phone the
positive reaction to a sub connect gave
us a strong following of backers with
hundreds of suggestions for improvements
these backers are at the forefront of
our innovation and through listening to
each and every one of them we've been
able to create a new and improved cable
the biggest request we received by far
is for a cable that is cross device
compatible meaning one cable for all
your phones and tablets
this will prevent all that fighting in
the home and car and who gets to keep
their cables plugged in and reduces
cable clutter the other major request is
a cable that is compatible with the USBC
with USBC quickly becoming the standard
for all USB devices this is a crucial
innovation we've designed a sub s
connect to be backwards compatible with
the USB see tip that were currently
developing we've also increased the
strength of the magnet over 33% to now
call it over 400 grams it's strong
enough now to even call it an iPad air
we get a lot of people who want to see a
sub X connect in an item editor to real
life setting so we've made this video
just to show you its simplicity it is
very easy to plug this tip into an s7
very secure and it's also very easy to
unplug the tip and now we're going to do
the same
iPhone which is also very secure and
it's also very easy
unplug now once we plug it back in we're
going to show you the magnetic strength
e'er of this cable it can hold an iPhone
absolutely no problem
and now we're going to show you the same
cable they're showing you the cross
compatibility there or being able to
connect the same cable over to an s7 and
now for the finale we are going to
connect it onto an iPad very nice and
easily there and these magnetic cables
are designed to hold 400 grams an iPad
air version one is actually about 437
grams but he can just hold it and even
give it a bit of a swing using the a sub
X connect cable every day has been an
absolute life changer for me it seems so
silly that something so seemingly
insignificant like a magnetic cable can
change your life but when you think of
the countless times you interact with
your phone on a day-to-day basis it
makes sense how crucial your
relationship with your mobile phone
affects not only your productivity but
your happiness we've put so much thought
into the latest design and I think
backers will really appreciate how
life-changing it is when they get their
hands on it we're excited to finally
create a cable that improves your
relationship with your phone and USB
devices
