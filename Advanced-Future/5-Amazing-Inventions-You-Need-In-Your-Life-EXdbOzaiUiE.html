and never miss another of
they're looking at the TV right now
craziness with your block
hi I'm Ivan founder of IRL and I'm Scott
had a product a lot of my work revolves
around technology and humanity and
specifically encouraging people to
disconnect to reconnect what role do we
want technology to play do we want it to
always consume us and my good friend
Scott and I over the last year noticed
how much screens are really impacting us
on a day to day basis and how
distracting they are and how powerless
all of these screens make us feel yeah
we started wondering if there's a way to
actually block all these screens I
discovered that when you actually
flatten and when you rotate a regular
polarized lens you can block out LCD and
LED screens and those make up most of
the displays for TVs and computers so we
had our screen blocking glasses and so
he spent the pack
meet the first helmet designed by former
SpaceX engineers and a super collapsible
form factor the helmet implements
next-generation materials and looks like
a baseball hat
my sister is riding her bike through the
intersection of Park and Diamond when
she was hit by a car
she spent the next four months in a coma
as two engineers we knew that if we put
our heads together we could do something
about this problem
how much aren't worn because they're
uncomfortable and inconvenient people
don't want to carry around huge chunks
of foam it became more important now
than ever that helmet that's comfortable
attractive portable and safe to make
sure the helmet is as safe as possible
we've done thousands of impact tests in
our lap and not only does our helmet
meet all of the federal regulations it
surpasses them like share programs are
growing at over 25% year over year more
Americans are taking a bike to work than
they ever have before there's millions
of people out there that need a product
like ours the portability of being able
to roll up the helmet allows you to
easily carry it with you and best of all
provide the same or better protection as
any traditional helmet there's a really
broad future for Park and Diamond the
styles and options are limitless we're
positioned to protect as many people as
possible
position the go touch camera sensor to
face the TV screen the go touch sensor
scans the area it is facing and
communicates with the go touch pen now
the ordinary TV is a touchscreen TV with
an ordinary projector and go touch you
can write on any type of surface like a
wall using the go touch app on a mobile
device you can share your notes of
people in real time
in the app you can write notes on a wide
range of file formats such as PDFs
images and even videos turn any surface
into a touchscreen with go touch from
any reactive the Hydra shredders are for
that upper level athlete who's very
strong and fit and really needs that
extra resistance in the water to give
them that high level workout you don't
get that 0 to 400 pounds of pressure
from any other workout thing it doesn't
exist so the Hydra shredders they come
in pairs you can use them like anything
else that you're used to in a dryland
environment you can do the same thing in
the water we did actually open up and
really amplify that inner cavity to
allow you to use it one in each hand or
use both hands on one of the products if
I pull it really slowly through the
water I'm only gonna put 10 pounds at
most of pressure on my body if I'm more
physically able the faster I pull it the
more it pushes back
so it's an accessible object and then
you can get into just a full hardcore
crazy workout anyone who thinks that
aquatic fitness isn't challenging enough
I would give them the Hydra shredders
and say try these because they'll work
you
the proliferation of cheap and easy to
fly drones has triggered a rise in the
number of incidents where the safety and
security of individuals and facilities
has been compromised drones have
infiltrated the security of heads of
state delivered contraband into prisons
photographed private film sets and the
property of celebrities attempts to
protect using conventional weapons have
failed sky wall 100 has the ability to
quickly and easily neutralize a drone
threat by physically capturing a drone
in a net and controlling its descent to
the ground it combines a compressed gas
powered launcher with an intelligent
projectile this portable system provides
a highly mobile and cost-effective
method of dealing with drone threats the
launcher is equipped with a smart scope
to assist in precise targeting the
operator acquires a target while
receiving constant feedback from the
smart scope the on-board computer tracks
the targets flight path and calculates
the required projectile trajectory to
intercept a hovering or moving drone the
smart scope responds forcing the
operator to adjust their aim vertical
adjustments account for range while
lateral adjustments allow the operator
to accurately lead a moving target when
the smart scope is locked on to the
target a solid tone indicates the system
is ready to launch
the only way to completely neutralize a
drone whether it's being flown manually
or autonomously is to physically
intercept it the system can be rapidly
reloaded allowing multiple drone threats
to be quickly engaged by a single
operator sky wall projectiles can carry
a range of countermeasures the sv40
includes a parachute which controls the
descent of a captured drone this
minimizes the risk of any collateral
damage and keeps the drone intact
allowing for forensic investigation and
identification of the perpetrator if the
operator misses the parachute will still
deploy and safely return the tethered
components for reuse other features can
also be included such as audible and
visual alarms and tamper proof marking
systems the system is de-energized when
not in use so it is safe to handle and
transport sky wall captures drones
every day around the world over 12
million people travel by plane
sleep deprivation as the number one
complaint amongst travelers resulting in
over 3 million errors of war sleep here

as an engineer I've always been obsessed
with solving problems and there's an
avid traveler I hated spending so much
my time catching up on sleep when I
should have been busy in stating I knew
there had to be a better solution to the
traditional u-shaped
pillows on the market and after
thousands of hours of prototyping and
testing we came up with the total travel
pillow watch we launched in 2014 thanks
to scientifically proven patented
technology it's helped transform the
travel experience of over 800,000
travelers from around the water we've
been overwhelmed by the response and I'm
lesson closely to all of your feedback
and how we can continue to innovate and
the result as the turtle pebble flies
