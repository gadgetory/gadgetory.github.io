Auto Show 2019 we're here at the
mercedes-benz booth and what we see here
is the world premiere of the new
Mercedes GL as the s-class under the SUV
and now we're gonna have a short look
around here at the booth of Mercia what
else they deliver and after that we walk
around the whole show to see all the
highlights of the other manufacturers
the GLS is celebrating its world
premiere here in New York with the v8
engine on board this is the so-called
GLS 584 Matic and that car delivers 489
horsepower 700 Newton meters of maximum
talk and thanks to its 48 volt system
that car also supplies another 22
horsepower via its so-called EQ boost
system but there will be another six of
diesel engine available in two different
power levels for Europe as well and of
course the GL has always featured and 9
speed automatic gearbox and all-wheel
drive the new GLS has grown by 77
millimeters in length and 22 millimeters
in width on top it offers 60 millimeters
more wheel space which causes a lot more
space for passengers on the rear seats
as standard all GLS now feature a
leather interior on top there are two
12.3 inch screens combined to one
widescreen monitor and the GLS now also
features the numerous series
infotainment system mbx with all its
modern functions fog bank presents here
in New York the concept car of the tarik
as a pickup and what I really like with
a car something unusual if you fold down
the rear bench you can load your stuff
into the car and into the cabin as well
I think this is quite unique first time
in the u.s. is the new Range Rover Villa
SV autobiography this is the top version
of this Range Rover and under the hood
you find a v8 5 liter supercharged
engine 550 horsepower and this
accelerates in only 4.5 seconds from 0
to 100 km/h so now I found a gun here
chief designer of mercy this girl have a
question you brought the new GL as
New York and I can I think and I really
like the color what is new regarding to
the exterior designer car yes you say
it's a perfect fit presenting on ETLs
last year in New York I mean this is
like the s-class of the SUV's a huge car
you can see the height we have a lot of
presents a lot of status very both car
on the other hand it's still along our
central beauty philosophy you can see
it's a central car it's a beautiful car
so we we combine both aspects of these
and I think with that that makes this
car like you say it true icon and we
talk about this side in the rear of the
car what happens in detail while we're
changing tonight proportion we put it on
bigger wheels and also the car has an
incredible stance we still get that
typical rugged SUV silhouette and
proportion but by rounding it off and we
make it very appealing and with the
front I just see new lloyd's yeah this
new headlamps of course like everything
else new you can see these three bars
are like a symbol for the s-class
segment like we do it at the limousine
too so that clearly indicates here comes
the s-class of the SUV's so I just ran
into the so-called calm and King as you
see that is not a stealth fighter this
is not the new Batmobile this is the
most expensive SUV of the world about
two million each but important with the
car is look at the interior you do find
fine leather a big screen and loads of
gold as well and the car is based on the
Ford f-550 and it features a v10 four
engine with about 400 horsepower more
important money comes from China but
it's built in Italy and would have just
heard is you can also drive it wrote
legal now in Europe as well the length
of about five meter 20 of course
benefits the boot as well if you fall
down all the seats that dual size
increases up to 2,400 liters of maximum
capacity and you can have the car as a
seven-seater if you want but if you
order this single seats like here you
can fold down each and any of them
easily
electric every GLS now comes with a new
air suspension as standard
thanks to the new 48 volt technology you
can also order a system called road
surface
with this the GLS will scan the road in
front of the car to depth the dampers
for perfect comfort a premier here the
Porsche stand is the new 911 speedster
this is a limited edition only 1948 cars
will be available so you better be quick
and that car delivers more than 500
horsepower I think more important is
that car comes without any kind of roof
so if you want to drive it you need this
one Subaru is celebrating the world
premiere of the 6th generation of the
mid-sized SUV outback the car features a
2.5 liter engine with 182 horsepower but
I think more important is Subaru says
the car should be more quiet more
comfortable and more safe as well listen
is celebrating 50 years Zak's here in
New York because that's the model which
was presented 50 years ago at that time
as the so called a tune 240 but because
of this celebration here anniversary
they present an extra special edition of
the 370 and this is it the original data
tuned to forties at and a side of it
this is the anniversary model this is
the 370 that you can have that in two
different colors unfortunately have no
idea about how powerful it really is
another world premiere here at the
mercedes-benz booth is the new GLC coupe
very important that car is just a
facelift but now it features AM bx
completely new engines and more driver
system and safety systems that was it
from the New York Auto Show 2019 and I
really do like the show a lot because
it's quite tiny you don't have to walk
that much to explore all these beautiful
cars but my absolute favorite is here at
the musci disbands booth with it which
is the new mercy this GLS the s-class of
the suvs I really do like this car a lot
I'm really looking forward to drive that
one in Utah quite soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
