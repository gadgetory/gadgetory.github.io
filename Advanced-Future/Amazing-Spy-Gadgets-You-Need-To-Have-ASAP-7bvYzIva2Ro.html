hello today we're gonna be going over
the db2 water bottle I'm gonna be doing
a quick review of the bottle what you
get when you purchase the bottle and how
to use some of the basic functions of
the unit okay when you first receive
your water bottle it's gonna come
included with the following items some
of these items will be optional
depending on if you purchase it with
your unit or not the first thing we're
gonna you're gonna notice when you
receive your BB to water bottle it's the
water bottle itself the water bottle is
you'll notice depending on how you
purchase your unit it'll have two
stickers on it one will contain the
information on the battery of the unit
such as this bottle happens to be a 10
hour and the second sticker that will
you'll find on your bottle will either
be audio or non audio if it has audio
the sticker will be placed over where
the microphone port is on the water
bottle and then the same thing goes for
the battery indicator sticker that one
shows you where your camera lens is so
you can go ahead and peel those off to
get started next thing you're gonna want
to deal with your water bottle let's go
ahead and open the top which these
bottles come in two different styles no
either be a twist top like this one or
it'll be a simple switch turn to the
right and lift up all right on the
inside of your bottle you're gonna
notice that you have your DVR camera
board and a battery the design of this
will vary depending on the type of
bottle that you have since these do come
in different types of bottles but
overall they'll have the same concept on
the inside you'll notice that the board
is color-coded with this type of
protectant to let you know that that is
the camera board if you look at the top
of the board you're gonna find a micro
SD card slot one USB port and one on/off
toggle switch the there is no writing
for the toggle switch so the thing to
remember the on position is always
switched this handheld covert camera

1080 resolution the built-in
rechargeable battery has a runtime of
about 65 minutes and the onboard Wi-Fi
interface lets you connect your smart

you a breakdown of the operation of this
camera and at the end of this video
you'll see real-world examples of what
kind of video you can expect here's how
the keychain camera comes out of the box

for audio enabled versions this is a
simple three button operation the top
button is power and record and stop the

you'll want to charge this up and insert
the SD memory card simply pull apart and
here you have your USB charging port and
your micro SD card slot put your card in
with the copper looking contacts facing
up and then use a thumbnail or a tinted
of a pencil or pin to push that in there
get a push in and lock in place and to
remove it simply press again and you'll
feel a click and it will eject to turn
the system on momentarily press the top
button it will vibrate and light up blue
to start recording press again it will
vibrate and will turn purple to activate
the Wi-Fi press the bottom button that
will disable your recording turn the
Wi-Fi on and reenable your recording now
