of these items will be optional
depending on if you purchase it with
your unit or not the first thing we're

stickers on it one will contain the
information on the battery of the unit
such as this bottle happens to be a 10
hour and the second sticker that will
you'll find on your bottle will either
be audio or non audio if it has audio
the sticker will be placed over where
the microphone port is on the water

notice that you have your DVR camera
board and a battery the design of this
will vary depending on the type of
bottle that you have since these do come
in different types of bottles but

protectant to let you know that that is
the camera board if you look at the top
