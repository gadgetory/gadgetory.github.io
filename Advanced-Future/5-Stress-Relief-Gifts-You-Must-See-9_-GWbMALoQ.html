real thing it puts you in control by
allowing you to pinpoint the muscle area
to be treated and apply as much or as
little pressure as you need to feel
great you won't believe how great you'll
feel after a session with your personal
masseuse so I'm thinking the Institut
Plus out to the speech in our own
kinetic mobile massage unit I'm going to

feel

anyways hopefully enjoy the video again
all these s'mores I get more of these
things if you guys are interested so let
me know but be kind
I was very anti hand spinner hand top
type things until I picked these up so
yeah just bear with me alright so a
couple different examples here these are
essentially things to fidget with while
you're driving or while you're at work
or while you're sitting somewhere in
waiting
so this is what they do you get them in
your hand and you spin them and it's
really that simple so you can sit there
and just kind of spin it as you're
working or driving or whatnot now
versions with caps such as this can be
spun on a table and I do have three here
from the same company
this is restless hands toys on Etsy and
so I'll put a link obviously to this
page when I shared on instagram the

fashio healthy by circulating fresh
oxygenated blood through it the
healthier the facia the better you move

diminish aches and pains increase
flexibility increase range of motion
enhance performance accelerate recovery
whether you are weekend warrior and
endurance athlete or simply looking to
alleviate the wear and tear of everyday
living you will benefit from foam
rolling
how do I roll foam rolling does not need
to be complicated or elaborate in fact
it can be as easy as 1 2 3 1 1 minute is
better than none
simply taking the time to address one
area for one minute will improve your
movement and is better than not rolling
at all to 2 zones when selecting a
muscle to roll divide the area into two
zones apply techniques to each zone
slowly while remembering to breathe
three-three motions for quick results
the three general techniques are rolling
spans and stretch it rolling roll back
and forth a few inches at a time while
working across the two zones spans when
you hit a tender area wave-wave the area
side to side until you feel relief i'd
like to introduce the mile balls the
mile balls are the most advanced pain
relief self massage device ever created
long gone are the days of rolling on the
floor with a foam rolling device or
using your own strength to dig into a
trigger point or a muscle not what sets
the mile balls apart from all others
self massage devices is the 360 degrees
of pressure that the massaging balls
provide this is done by the tubing
that's woven through the pressure point
balls in order to squeeze the muscles
and apply the pressure the Myo ball
simply slide over any limb that you
would like to massage and you can
immediately feel the 5 to 15 pounds of
pressure per ball ready to massage your
extremity mile balls are excellent for
treating plantar fasciitis patellar
tendonitis achilles tendonitis golfer's
elbow tennis elbow carpal tunnel
syndrome sore shoulders tight IT bands
tight hamstrings tight quads tight hips
and more
the mile ball five is ideal for using on
the feet
calves shins and arms the mile ball 7 is
ideal for treating the thighs and
shoulders choose between the Myo ball
original and the Myo ball Pro which
provides twice as much pressure as the
original experience 360 degrees of pain
relief today with the Myo balls
