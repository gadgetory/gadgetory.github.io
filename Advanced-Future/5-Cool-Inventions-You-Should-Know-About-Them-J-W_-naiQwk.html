gift for the man who has everything
introducing the brush hero powered by
pure torque and generated by your garden
hose alone the brush hero is perfect for
your car guy grill master weekend
cyclist or backyard gardener the brush
hero never corrodes requires no
batteries or electricity and provides
strong water powered cleaning and
detailing for cars motorcycles bikes
boats golf clubs yard tools barbecues
window screens pets and more simply push
on a brush flip the Handy on/off switch
and start cleaning don't get him another
boring tied by dad the brush hero today
he'll have fun blasting the grime away
this is tap the keyboard of the future
tap creates text each time you tap your
fingers on any surface
tap does not use the QWERTY keyboard
layout or any keyboard at all instead
you create letters by tapping one or
more fingers on any surface
for instance when you tap your thumb the
letter A is sent to the Bluetooth device
you have peered with your tap the tap
genius game makes learning the tap
alphabet fast fun and easy you can learn
it in an hour or two using tap might
feel a bit like magic
most people are amazed at how quickly
they learn the tap combinations then
just like typing the more you do it the
faster you will become tap also has a
built-in mouse which moves your cursor
when you glide your thumb on a surface
tap can also control apps or play games
and tappers are coming up with new
customizations and uses every day
show us what you can do teeth have a
funny way of getting knocked out when
they do you end up in the dentist's
office with a funny smile and a deflated
ego lucky for you and me then just use
the best tools to get you fixed up
one essential instrument all dentists
rely on is a special kind of glue that
uses UV light to dry quickly so that
they can repair teeth please don't touch
that
yeah hi i'm chris from fibre fix we
started fiber fix when we realize that
you can take the technology used in
medical casting tape and create the
strongest repair tape on the planet well
we're back and this time we've created a
product that uses the same technology
dentists rely on every day to solve all
your frustrations with glue have you
ever used a superglue that wasn't so
super it claims a 30 second cure time
but somehow 30 seconds becomes 30
minutes the only time it cures fast is
when you accidentally get it on your
fingers or when you accidentally leave
the lid off and somehow it gets on
everything you don't want it to get on
no and if it's so super why do you need
epoxies and sealants and wood glue and
metal glue and plastic glue and glue for
every other material under the Sun can
you imagine if dentists use the
adhesives that had all the problems of
super glue all right we're gonna clamp
this here for 24 hours
we knew there had to be a better way
introducing total glue the only glue
you'll ever need oh hey hey they're like
sharing technology to create a glue that
had the same strength as a high quality
super glue but without all the annoying
problems that make it the opposite of
super after years of research and
refinement we are the first to give you
a light curing glue that actually does
it all others have tried to use the
technology but failed to create
something that was easy to use and as
strong as possible with total gloom
shining the light will seal the bond in
just 5 seconds making it over ten times
faster than super glue it also gives you
a clean precise mess free bond that
actually works on the surfaces you need
it to
whether on small precise areas or large
industrial settings need to fill a gap
total blue does it seal a leak or crack
yep does that - what about rebuilding a
structure do you even need to ask what
if you're trying to glue with a light
don't show total ooh still works it just
takes a minute to cure without the light
so as you can see we call it total glue
for a reason it does it all so stop
wasting time with not so super glue and
simplify your toolbox with total glue
here at fiberfix
we are making a product so innovative
and groundbreaking that we wanted to
bring it directly to our fearless
Kickstarter family you and we've shipped
tens of thousands of our products to
happy customers all over the world so
you know word a lot
so there you have it it's the dual tech
by Fisher works in drywall works in
concrete super strong super fast super
easy to use</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
