never miss another update
why choose one decor when you can turn
your wall into an interactive canvas
meets gribbit the world's first write
and erase robot that creates a different
image whenever you want to nails and a
plug is all you need to install scribble
and thanks to the app it's always
connected create an image or source it
from the web then upload it to the app
and scribble will reproduce it on your
wall within minutes and if you get tired
of the design no worries
scribble will just erase it and you can
start over again
you can connect script to your favorite
apps and show you the latest news and
weather forecasts or even your Twitter
updates any surfaces gain whiteboard
glass or standard plaster
and with four color options the
possibilities are endless the only limit
is your imagination
inflatable shirt a 50 plus UV Sun shirt
that when activated becomes a buoyancy a
the shirt is comfortable to wear and
ideal for all water sports wear
protection or buoyancy may be required
if it involves water you need a hero
there are two ways that your hero can be
inflated automatic inflation using the
co2 cartridge by pulling on the red
handle or manual inflation by blowing
into the inflation tube to automatically
inflate take hold of the red handle and
pull down quickly the hero should
inflate immediately and will ensure you
remain buoyant another way to inflate
your hero is to breathe into the
inflation tube you may decide to use
this method if the co2 cartridge failed
to deploy or if you feel you need some
added buoyancy it may take four to five
breaths to fully inflate to deflate the
planner press down the valve at the top
of the tube until you hear air escaping
gently press against the hero to
completely deflate hero water safety
wear is designed to be reusable the co2
cartridge is easy to replace after an
automatic inflation
hero inflatable wetsuits the first of
its kind in the world with a
patent-pending design inflation chambers
are located in the front and rear of the
suit that help ensure the users face
remains well out of the water the web
sleep design allows you to dive under
threatening surf conditions and when
it's time to resurface the inflation
chamber ensures an assistance steady
rise to the top of it
deflation of the bladder and rearming
can be completed in less than 2 minutes
without removing the wetsuit
what does it mean to redefine an
industry built on tradition it means
pressing on through endless design
challenges sleepless nights and
engineering the impossible so we went
back way back
picked up a pencil sharpened it and hit
the drawing board to create something
groundbreaking
introducing the maxim 9
the world's first integrally suppressed
9-millimeter handgun that is horrible
and hearing safe with all 9-millimeter
ammunition in its factory configuration
no more choosing between keeping your
pistol as short as possible and adding a
silencer now you can have the best of
all worlds
the maxim nine represents great strides
in pistol design and suppressor
technology shipped in its full length
configuration the user can shorten the
Maxim nine by over one inch in the short
configuration the Maxim nine remains
hearing safe with subsonic ammunition
left or right-handed that doesn't matter
the maxim nines ambidextrous design
allows you to shoot how he would
the maxim mine is purpose-built enabling
you to shoot in the most adverse
conditions as firearm enthusiasts
ourselves we know you the manifest

less than perfection this is Rob at
first glance he is just a regular man
but that's only at first glance in
reality he has super abilities because
he has filter man at first glance bolter
man is just the regular wallet but
that's only at first glance in reality

with super abilities the smart wallet
helps rob in a variety of situations

Rob left his wallet in the cab but both
men notifies when it's been left behind

important moments your battery dies

happens way too often we can't have just
one scene in the video for this folks
