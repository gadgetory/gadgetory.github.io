bin the scanner bin is an affordable
solution that makes it easy to scan
documents with your smartphone using any
number of free scanning apps that are
available it might be that little thing
you need to really get organized when
it's not in use it doesn't just take up
space you turn it on its side and it
acts as a bin to collect the papers that
you want to scan later the scanner bin
is built as a collapsible rigid box it's
going to be this color that you see on
the screen here and it will have an
embossed logo it also comes with a flat
sheet which is used to hold paper flat
like a receipt or a letter that would
typically be impossible to scan with
your smartphone
I created the scanner bin because I
needed it see I had been scanning
documents with my smartphone business
cards and other things for a long time I
was using it to other checks remotely
and that type of thing and what I was
running into is all kinds of problems
with shadows and trying to scan folded
paper issues with misalignment and
blurry images because I was sitting
there trying to hold the phone
straight with my hand while I was
scanning these documents and it just
wasn't working very well so the scanner
Ben fixes all of those problems it
bridges the gap between a flatbed
scanner and a smartphone scanning
application and it's a very affordable
simple - this is the whole button the
world's smallest phone grip the whole
button is the simplest way to stop
dropping your phone
it improves grip so much you'll
magically be able to type tap and swipe
with just one hand
selfie better shot better everything
better
you can even hook your phone on your
laptop we get three whole buttons and
every pack to share or save so stop
dropping your phone and make your phone
easy to use one-handed get the hold
