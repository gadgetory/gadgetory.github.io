never miss another update this is the
new 11 o 61 self-adjusting wire stripper
this is a great tool for HVAC
applications specifically because it
allows you to strip the outer jacket of
the thermostat wire and then also allows
you to strip all the individual wires
associated with that whether you have a
5 4 3 or even a 7 conductor because of
the automatic self-adjusting heads
you have the won some wheel here that
allows you to adjust the tension that
comes down on top of the wire and then
you also have another adjustment here
that will adjust the wire stop so
depending on the length that you're
looking at cutting or stripping this
allows you to do that again with this it
allows you to put the outer jacket in to
the stripping head here and self adjust
do you take that out and then all of a
sudden you have all the different
connectors conductors there to where you
can then place it in there make a slight
adjustment on the wheel and self adjust
again this feature this tool also
features a wire cutting mechanism here
which you can cut to whatever wire
length you need the new client 11:06 t1
how do you maximize the return on your
scrap cable bright copper wire can be
worth as much as three and a half times
copper wire with its insulation still in
place
there are several ways to remove the
insulation you could use an industrial
stripper however these are not portable
and very expensive
you could use a regular utility knife
and try to do it by hand this doesn't
work for most cables it's very
time-consuming and not very practical
there are also other pitfalls of using a
utility knife
some people even burn the insulation off
their cable this is not only illegal in
some areas and terrible for the
environment but the reclamation value is
less than a third of that of bright
copper wire if you don't remove the
insulation from your scrap cable you may
as well burn your money
introducing cable knife the world's best
handheld cable stripper for the purpose
of maximizing scrap value cable knife
uses regular utility knife blades to cut
through the insulation leaving the user
with a bright copper wire which can be
worth up to three and a half times the
value of unstriped cable so how does it
work the cable is placed into the rear
of the tool the hand gripper is squeezed
to locate the cable in the guide the
knife blade is pressed into the
insulation using the thumb finally the
cable is pulled through the tool to
complete the cut and the insulation
peels off like a banana skin
Kable knife will remove the insulation
from flat cables up to 19 millimeter
squared the unique cable guide keeping
the cable sensor during the cutting
process round cables from 1 millimeter
up to 20 millimeters in diameter can be
stripped using cable knife cable knife
will remove the insulation from solid
core cable braided cable even coaxial
cable the unique cable guide ensures the
cables of all sizes and shapes are kept
centered in the cutting chamber for the
knife blade to make a clean surgical cut
in the installation with the minimum of
effort perfect for electricians plumbers
di wires and anybody else who's looking
to maximize their return on scrapping
copper cable this is the tool that metal
recyclers don't want you to know about
they profit removing the insulation from
the cables that you bring to them and
they make thousands of pounds more for
the bright copper wire than they paid
you put that money back in your wallets
dry bright copper wire is currently
worth approximately two thousand six
hundred and fifty pounds per ton PVC
wire is approximately eight hundred
pounds per ton cable knife will pay for
itself very quickly strip a little each
day or save it up and do it once a year
maximize your scrap value finds
heavy-duty steel wire strippers post the
heritage and durability of climb pliers
with the sharpness and precision of a
wire stripper like Klein's iconic pliers
these wire strippers are hot forged
making them four times stronger than
traditional climb wire strippers
heat-treating optimizes the strength of
the steel at the microscopic level to
ensure that the tool is sturdy the
handles are soft and the cutting edges
are hard two models strips solid and
stranded wire each feature the two most
common sizes for screw sheering the hot
riveted joint prevents wobble and
separation of the blades over time
induction hardened cutting knives easily
pinch cut hard wire perform better and
last longer than the stamp tools knives
neural jaws produce a strong grip when
you're grabbing or twisting wire the
wide heads let you twist up to three
wires at a time
Klein curved handles with the journeyman
grip provide added comfort made with the
same exacting standards as klein pliers
these heavy-duty wire strippers will be
in your tool bag for the next generation
klein tools for the professional
tradesperson since 1857 tired of
constantly switching back and forth
between wire strippers and pliers
client-side cutting pliers come with
stripping holes to save you time on the
job and space in your tool belt the
9-inch journeyman high leverage side
cutters with wire stripper and crimper
cuts and strips 10 to 12 gauge solid and
12 to 14 gauge stranded wire the
built-in crimper works for non-insulated
connectors lugs and terminals clients
forge design combined with induction
hardened cutting knives cut hard wire
perform better and lasts longer than
other cutters dual material journeyman
handles provide better grip and added
comfort
the tempered handles absorb the snap
when cutting wire to reduce hand and
wrist fatigue the hot riveted joint on
Klein's all-purpose pliers ensures
smooth action with no handle wobble the
heavier forged steel construction makes
these pliers extremely durable start
saving time and get more done with the
high leverage side cutting pliers with
wire strippers Klein tools for the
professional tradesperson since 1857</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
