hi I'm Dave Hoshi and for over a decade
the pet bathing stores that I found it
have bathed over 75 thousand dogs using
the very same technique that inspired
the Bissell bark bath so I'm going to
share some tips and tricks with you that
I hope get the best possible experience
for both you and your dog
let's start by placing the bark bath on
the floor in the room where you plan to
use it and then let your dog get
familiar with the unit without turning
the bark bath on brush your dog with the
spray nozzle for a couple of minutes
follow up with a treat and praise to
create a good association for your dog
with the bark battle when your dog is
out of the room turn the bark bath on
while it's running reward your dog with
a treat after you turn the unit off
brush your dog again with the spray
nozzle then praise your dog and give
another treat with the bark bath on call
your dog into the room and reward with a
tree boy like before brush your dog with
the spray nozzle but don't pull the
trigger to release water just yet then
turn the bark bath off and give your dog
a treat with the bark bath primed
turn it on and call your dog back into
the room starting with a small section
brush your dog's fur while pulling the
trigger and quick short bursts to
release the water solution
then letting go of the trigger use dry
strokes to suction the moisture from
your dog's coat continue this process
section by section and once you've
extracted all of the water your dog's
bath is complete imagine how we interact
with the world but today we just mostly
poke at the screen fingers and hands are
incredible
why are we so limited introducing vela
an innovative device that instantly
turns any surface into a smart interface
the world at your fingertips once
connected you will be able to control
different hardware devices or software
applications by using simple gestures
Vela will make your life more convenient
use it to control music light
temperature or any other application you
have in your mind you are only limited
by your imagination and you only need
one valid device to control multiple
devices or applications you can use our
presets like letter Surat your own
gestures according to your preference
simply assign gestures for different
scenarios and switch between them just
by moving your hands our human hand is
fantastic they can not only feel but
also manipulate things in a versatile
way the current smartphone technologies
are just putting everything into small
tiny screen which highly limits and
constraint the interactive areas of our
hands Vela works on any surface so you
can clip it anywhere you like or even
design your own control pad
unlike other devices Vela gives you
tracking and multiple text to action
features so you are not limited to just
one action but if different patterns to
assign for different actions it is super
easy to use and really works for
everyone
if you are a developer you can try new
ideas and figure out different
customized applications with our
well-designed API to track the human
gestures Vella uses a special sonar
technology that is nowadays widely used
in military cars and drones it transmits
signal police's collects the reflective
energy from your finger and then
translates it into the performed action
our team has been focused on sensing
techniques for a couple of years we are
passionate about making tools which are
just human needs by amplifying human
capabilities turning any surface around
you into a remote control enables many
potential possibilities in our daily
lives we have been seeing lots of
products in the market but we have not
found any of them capable to track and
to recognize with high probability with
weller attracts your finger with the
finest precision and transform it into
customized action
Weller where is magic to your daily life
yeah picked up the we play keep you got
