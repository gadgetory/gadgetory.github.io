capacity when saturated aqua bags can
waive between 30 to 40 pounds providing
an outstanding flood and water barrier
for heavy leaks floods and oil spills

you know we've always been using our
hands and fingers for counting taking
notes and various other stuff technology
expanded then we started using gadgets
people always say that everything is at
our fingertips but it was never so not
until now not until Finn hi everyone I
am Dylan and the attribution you see for
the past few months we've been working
on this amazing product coffin the first
of its kind gesture-based control for
all your devices out there unlike other
gesture based devices which are tiring
and boring to use Finn helps you to
control any smart device just by moving
your thumb over other fingers isn't that
super simple and super fast after a year
of research and numerous experiments we
made this perfectly working prototype we
don't want Finn to be just another geeky
device we want people to wear it as a
fashion accessory
Finn is a bluetooth-enabled device which
can control a variety of smart devices
for switching the device to another all
you need to do is tap on your finger fin
leaks live simpler now everything is at
your fingertips
and it feels like having magical powers
its possibilities are endless
for playing games the changing lives for
many
for taking business presentations
Phin also comes in handy while you drop
you can answer calls control the a/c and
music system without even moving your
hands from the wheels VIN is really
amazing when it comes to taking photos
or sharing files and Finn works well
with head mounted devices hi it's me I
hope this tiny device can make your life
easier and better but we have just
developed the prototype so far we need
your help to find you and get into mass
production we are launching scene on
IndieGoGo to crowdfund this initiative
so please support us we give a valuable
contribution fee we are the world you've
probably heard the saying before that
necessity is the mother of invention and
it turns out the invention of sit tight
really wasn't any different than that I
had taken a desk job years ago found
that after sitting in front of a desk
for hours upon hours day after day my
health was starting to diminish I was
putting on weight I realized I was gonna
have to find a way to utilize the time
that I spent sitting as a way to improve
my health and not damage it the real
magic was sit tight lies in its
simplicity the ability to simply balance
on your center of gravity have your body
engaged muscles working to keep your
posture stray burning calories your mind
be involved as its controlling all those
muscles is really what allows people to
turn sitting into an activity that
improves their health sit tight is a
chair that combines physical activity
and mental focus we call it balanced
active sitting this stabilizes your
spine as it strengthens your core which
improves posture
and makes you burn calories simply by
City resulting in an overall healthier
lifestyle plus balancing requires you to
stay mentally engaged which allows you
to be more alert and productive we want
to introduce the world to balanced
active sitting and help
we'll get fit while they sit
