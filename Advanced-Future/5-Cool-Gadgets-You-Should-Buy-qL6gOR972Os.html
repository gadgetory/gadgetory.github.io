but you you've been trying for two hours
I'm sure you've tried every trick in the
book like trying to stop thinking stop
thinking stop thinking stop crap I
thought or trying to relax
oh it's not that these techniques are
useless in fact they're actually pretty
good unfortunately you probably had more
important things to learn at school this
here is his room relaxing fast is his
thing just look he focuses on his
breathing and he progressively slows it
down and by slowing his breathing all
the way down to about six breaths a
minute
he stimulates the barrel flicks a
physiological mechanism that allows him
to become completely calm in just a few
minutes and when it comes to not
thinking he's pretty good at that too he
can concentrate on his breathing for a
really long time and remain undistracted
by buzzing thoughts but you are not his
room even in bed you struggle to focus
on your breath for more than twenty
seconds at a time
actually your attention span is probably
more like Bob's than his runs that's why
we've designed dota it helps you fall
asleep by making you almost as chill as
his room I'll have one of those
you synchronize your breathing with the
light projected on the ceiling by
focusing on something outside your own
head you'll pay less attention to the
thoughts that are keeping you awake at
the same time just like a metronome doto
helps slow down your breathing from 11
to 6 breaths a minute which helps
relieve your anxiety and so in less than
eight minutes you'll find yourself ready
to doze off dota won't turn you into a
Buddhist monk but it will help you fall
asleep faster and that's probably all
you need rocky Chavez my name is
Patricia cha Amelia and I'm the founder
of kubacheck
my boyfriend Armand and I have been
enjoying watersports and especially
pedaling for quite some years now but
I'm always worried to take our kids with
us because fast changing weather
conditions can make a fast return to
shore quite difficult so I started
searching for an electric motor to use
with our equipment such a stand a pedal
or a canoe but it was impossible for me
to find a small light and flexible
solution for this reason I asked I mean
if he could build such a gadget and the
idea of scuba jet first bro
over the past two years Alan and
dysphoric gap who have excellent
know-how in software and technical
engineering developed this quartet and
also tested it extensively
do the development we have used Qbert at
regularly and had so much fun together
with the kids we have met many people on
our trips we were very excited about
projects too often we've been asked
where a motor can be bought last year we
have decided to make the scuba jet ready
for mass production and extended their
adapter system different adapters this
is a possibility to use the scuba Jets
are almost anybody's proper treatment
scuba tread terms are aquatic equipment
into fast comfortable and reliable
devices
the zap blast knuckles offer a powerful
950 thousand volts of personal
protection in a small concealable size
and feature a comfortable rubber coating
that provides a secure non-slip grip the
zap blast knuckles are powered by two
lithium ion batteries that can last for
up to two years and are included with
your purchase also included is a
convenient nylon carrying case with a
belt clip to install your batteries turn
the on/off switch located on the handle
to the off position open the battery
cover on the bottom of the knuckles
remove the cellophane from the included
batteries and insert batteries into the
knuckles as shown and then simply close
the cover please note when the electric
arc of your knuckles gets weak it's time
to replace the batteries to use your zap
blast knuckles turn the on/off switch to
the up on position a red light will
indicate the knuckles are ready to use
to fire the stun gun press and hold the
black button in the top or index finger
loop a loud popping noise will let you
know your knuckles are working and
please note all sap products must come
into contact with the other person to
deliver a shock and the shock will
penetrate clothing
worried about finding clean water on
your next adventure check out the grill
the ultra light is a water purification
system that you can pack with you
anywhere
simply fill press and drink sixteen
ounces of clean h2o when you press the
bottle water is forced through the
purification and filtration system at
the bottom of the tube water filtration
is chemical free antimicrobial and BPA
free looking for a simple solution for
clean water use the Grail ultra lite
