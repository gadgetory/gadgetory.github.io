sound of the new Cayenne coupie he hit a
sports exhaust pipe this is how a true
Porsche is supposed to say
the copay looks much more progressive
and athletic than the Cayenne although
the Cayenne can stand up for itself of
course it's development is based on the
third generation of the Cayenne
which already looks very progressive the
copay is longer flatter and almost 2
centimeters wider at the rear these
minimal changes have a big effect the
copay simply looks more dynamic it wants
to leap forward you can really feel that
it just really really looks fast even at
first glance it's obvious that this is a
real Porsche the lines are classic
traditional but at the same time
forward-thinking roofline cooks off very
quickly to the rear control cloud
dynamism power and speed this emotional
appearance positions the coupe is the
sportiest model in this segment this
effect is underlined by the fixed roof
spoiler which strengthens the coupe a
likes silhouette even more the roof edge
is 2 centimeters lower than the Cayenne
which reduces the angle of the a-pillar
allowing for a flatter windscreen the
rear fenders and doors are wider making
the coupe a look more sturdy and more
muscular to keep the rear end so sexy
and to give the car great handling the
development department came up with an
extra spoiler so above 90 kilometers an
hour the adaptive rear spoiler extends
and provides even more downforce on the
rear axle exactly
of course a Porsches performance has to
be excellent and in this department the
Cayenne copay has a whole lot to offer
two powerful engines are available at
market launch a three liter 6-cylinder
turbo engine with 340 horsepower and a
maximum torque of 450 Newton meters and
the top model the turbo Kupe has a 4
liter v8 twin turbo charger 550
horsepower 770 Newton meters in goes
from 0 to 100 and 3.9 seconds with a top
speed of a staggering 286 kilometers an
hour awesome as soon as I get into the
car I immediately feel at home
the carbon fiber elements are really
cool the Alcantara accent give it a
unique and and and classy feel the
seating position is perfect exactly as I
wanted the Cayenne Kupe offers 4 people
plenty of space in the back the
passengers sits 3 centimeters lower than
in the Cayenne and this is a plus 4
Headroom the rear seating with two
individual seats can be replaced by a
comfort format
I love the panoramic fixed glass sunroof
which by the way is standard 2.16 square
meters with an integrated roll of line
this carbon fiber roof similar to the
one of the gt3 RS is available as an
option enhancing the sportscar look the
carbon fiber roof is one of three
lightweight sport packages not just as
I'm used to from Porsche all the
functions are right where I need them it
all works together I am connected to the
car and the car of course is connected
to the Internet top quality driver
oriented and all designed from a drivers
point of view a real sports car an SUV
and an exclusive copy and all this in
one car for all those who require
something special
