hi everyone I'm Chadwick I'm Joe and
together we're a big idea of design in
2016 we launched our first titanium
pocket tool and today we're excited to
show you our newest version of the
titanium pocket tool Joe and I strive to
take our previous designs to the next
level so we focused on four areas to
make TPT slide even better than the
original first a one-handed sliding
operation with to secure lockout points
that's user-friendly for both left and
right-handed users second we designed a
unique removable pocket clip that
doesn't use any screws to preserve the
minimum look next we adjusted the
jimping to improve the strength of the
universal wrench and lastly the TPT
slide is now machined from thicker
titanium plates to make the entire tool
our strongest version yet in addition to
all these improvements the new version
still maintains all of the useful
features of the original titanium pocket
tool making it deceivingly versatile for
its ultra low pocket profile
thanks for checking out the project
we're excited have you joined us to
bring this new version to life lost your
