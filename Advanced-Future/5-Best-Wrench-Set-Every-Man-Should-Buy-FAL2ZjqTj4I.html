swing arc the ultimate and access
it's reducing the craftsman hybrid
ratcheting wrench set it combines the
power of a box in wrench with the speed
of a ratchet that means no more having
to remove and reposition the ridge
between terms because of this design you
can get to those hard-to-reach places
that are too tight for a ratchet but use
the sockets on one end of the wrench is
a box in which makes it easy to break
loose fasteners that are giving you
trouble without having to worry about
slippage on the open end of the wrench
there's a ratcheting mechanism the
spring-loaded pin grip locks on around
the bolt and then moves out of the way
when it's time to ratchet this is all
metal too so don't worry about having
some kind of small plastic part breaking
on you plus these wrenches are covered
by the craftsman lifetime warranty if
your tightening a bolt you just put the
open end of the wrench on the bolt head
with the arrow pointing in the direction
you're tightening tighten the bolt using
the ratcheting feature if you need it
extra tight finish it off by using the
box into the wrench here's another
little secret whether you're tightening
or loosening you should always pull a
wrench toward you that way if you
accidentally slip off the fastener you
don't bust your knuckles on the
equipment you need to have a wrench set
for most projects and the hybrid
ratcheting wrench set is a wise choice
the easiest to use most time-saving best
gift ever just squeeze and turn 14
wrenches in one made-in-america
the wrench has evolved now you know it's
a gripping experience
we're putting the future of ratcheting
wrenches in your hands with the
best-in-class skx frame a revolutionary
ratcheting wrench that gives you more
power with the lower Starck swing in the
industry giving you more precision and
torque even in the tightest spaces where
traditional ratcheting wrenches use a
one fall system with teeth cut into the
wheel the skx frame uses six paws with
teeth ford's directly into the body to
give you more power they work in pairs
engaging two opposing calls at the same
time making it powerful enough to break
free even the most stubborn bolts
traditional wrenches require the
mechanism to advance one full tooth in
order to engage or click the skx frame
wrench has staged Falls so every time
you advance one third of the tooth the
next pair engages to give you more
precision at any given time a pair of
Paul's are fully locked in with the
teeth at that same time the next set of
Paul's are almost engaged and ready to
secure the last pair of Paul's are
unengaged but as the mechanism continues
to advance these Paul's will be ready to
lock in having a new set of Paul's lock
each time the wrench turns just one
third of a tooth gives you finer
engagement than any other wrench this
engagement system gives a total of 216
positions for the lowest dark swing in
the industry this stronger mechanism
needed a stronger handle our patented X
range split beam design maximizes
strength power and comfort like never
before the new sk x frame ratcheting
wrench from sk professional tool forged

garages oil rigs construction sites
farms factories hangars everywhere
there's a tough job there's a right tool
getting it done that's because right

decades that we could make more money by
shipping production to a foreign country
we just tell the bean counters to go
count beans and let the $2 billion to us
so even though these may look silver

a slow boat from China they are probably
being used to make it go faster

made in America because that still means
something to us right to perfecting
performance
