biggest prize the best driver overall
fastest total time and all three
challenges will take home of three Lexus
for years we've got three driving
challenges for the team competition a
win in your matchup is worth ten points
for your team we've got the teams we've
got the ride
it's time for our two teams to face off
in the first driving challenge we're not
starting small the corkscrew at Laguna
Seca is one of the most famous stretches
of track in Motorsports a killer
left-right combination with the drop in
the middle of five-story drop
they'll be starting on turn six and
seven coming out on turn nine flying
finish best time wins it's got it's
gonna break down the best technique for
dealing with the corkscrew and for this
challenge they'll be rolling out in the
Lexus RCF track edition we'll take it
when you talk about those iconic turns
in Motorsports
the course through is top of the chart
and now we're doing it with the RC F
track edition zero to 60 in less than
four seconds on these cars or a beast
these guys and get behind the wheel and
remember it's all about time and
precision they're gonna have to get the
job done
that's how you win before the drivers
take the official run on the corkscrew
their coaches will tell them the best
way to attack the challenge and they'll
each get two practice runs with the
track instructor riding shotgun you turn
in one time enough to get jury
make sense yeah yeah all the way to the
inside nice how you can accompany
between
how was the car okay the car is Hoss you
gotta had a confidence do you got to
believe in the car like no relationship
starts between you and the car she's led
me some low on the third laugh but now
she's like I gotta be home I love what
he just said I've never heard that this
is the amazing RC F track edition I got
Scott I got Jack I need to know what
makes this different than the regular RC
F and why is it the perfect car for this
challenge well see here let's break it
down first thing you see up here massive
brakes these are new carbon ceramic you
all wrapped around BBS wheels special
Michelin tires developed especially for
this car carbon fiber roof you get to
the back you look at this great rear
wing it's not just for looks I mean it
looks nice it looks great but this isn't
just for looks it's for function more
downforce more stability you're talking
176 pounds lighter total at least as
close you can get to buying an ICF gt3
there's a lot of the stuff we do with
the gt3 a lot of development and that's
directly transferred on for this car
massive weight savings splitter on the
bottom side skirts and all kinds of
fancy aerodynamic pieces on the car
which is going to improve the handling
improve the brake instability and
improve the amount downforce you've got
well they'll be less than a hundred of
these May so if you want one you better
hurry up and go get to work
team Sally and team cheddar about to
take on the corkscrew with back-to-back
turns and a 5-story drop and they're
doing it in the Lexus RCF track edition
I expect Omar oh really
- here we go
hey I'm good
Hey
do you think you'll have a faster time
overall period
let's go
three is more to the race than just the
first quarter hey God for the second
third I like to win do you think you're
being humble they decided oh yeah no
question she's gonna get like 30 31
twenty-eight point four eight the winner
of this competition is team cheddar pick
up ten points and Curtis is currently in
first place
oh we're cursed team J we don't find out
who really wants to die I don't got no
words well you've got some words doll
for the second half I am excited about
this next challenge
it's the slalom the drivers have started
off slaloming through the cones and
sprinting to the finish where they need
to stop beside this box right here okay
this challenge you're going to be
driving the Lexus LC 500 new luxury
sports coupe with a naturally aspirated
v8 it's got a lot of power so no excuses
you got it so well y'all ready
well let's go before our drivers take
their official run in the slalom their
coaches will demo the best technique for
the course and the drivers will each get
practice runs so feel if you end up
offline he'll hurt you through every
single caught you on the news
stay as close to the white
thank you doing really well really but
we'll just bring it back one notch you
first wrong who's better new second and
on the way back you'll almost feel you
were too fast at the end here knowing
you too slow around that last bar
we got out
yep so then get it
okay but I mean you want it when you're
under break yeah push your foot through
the floor
it's wanted to let you know how great of
a leader I am motivated on my only
change to credit their responsiveness
okay it's you know I think a lot of
people associate race car driving with a
lot of herky-jerky and yanking on the
wheel right and know this is a smooth
experience so not too many car makers
genuinely mesh luxury and sport and
they've done that with this
it looks real sleek right the way it
handles you know the interior right you
know how to design the interior and real
comfortable right I mean Lexus might get
my money anyways nice things pretty sexy
that I fit Joe Lexus that a six six
300-pound man drive a sexy car
team Sally and team Jetta are gonna put
their skill to the test in the smaller
challenge next on zero to 60 this is
zero to 60 at the Laguna Seca Raceway
we're heading into the next challenge
the slalom each driver will have a
standing start slopping through the
cones and sprint to the finish with
they'll need to stop inside the box
hitting a cone is a 1 second penalty
missing the box is also a 1 second
penalty
one false move could make the difference
the standings are tight heading into the
second challenge team cheddar has a
slight edge of the team Sally and Kurtis
Hamilton is currently the individual
leader ahead by only a few fractions of
a second now it's time to slop
all right that's what I'm talking about
you have the light and until you didn't
stop in the clock
yeah man I knew I had at the hotel
yes
we are physically tie and team our new
it is who the leader is
Carmelita Jetta Oh leader but next time
we'll find out which team will be
crowned king grudge match stop on
zero-to-sixty I am big chicken I'm here
Laguna Seca Raceway it all comes down to
this final challenge the team relay 30
points on the line but we got a time so
whoever wins this relay wins the team
crown we'll also add your individual
relay times to your first to challenge
times to determine who is taking home
this Lexus for a year here the rules
each driver looks successfully navigate
the course and then stop in the box in
the box
you go outside the box they might back
you up until you're in the box stop
short of the box they'll eat you up -
you're in the box got to be in the box
there are penalties two seconds for each
code that you hit on this book I think
we're gonna see some cones fly we're
riding into GSF please God tell me a
little bit about this amazing today 400
plus horsepower when they get out there
on this little track it's the agility is
it's absolutely fantastic right at the
end of your fingertips but it's all
about the finesse of it it's all about
the balance of getting through these
turns and not taking out the cones two
seconds you can never make that Cup all
right team Sally up first Omar you're in
the first car it's going down team relay
somebody's going with Alexis before the
teams take on the relay challenge
they'll receive final instruction from
their coaches and take a practice lap
these white cones of your apex is doing
it close to them let the car go out a
little bit here
then get close again to that white wall
accelerate around that here you just
gonna be touching the brake I'm at all
of it you're gonna be like modulated
into kind of all out of it
just like yes it is follow to try and
keep it close to the white walls to the
white walls in a way that bring the car
out so you got a nice little run down
until so what I'm doing is I'm just kind
of rolling the roll on the throttle so I
used didn't use any brake there you got
to use brake at the other end you stand
on through the middle but you don't have
to let off a little bit final showdown
the teams get to experience a few hot
laps with their coaches so
I really really believe in my coach
that man is special conduit he was on
this the drivers are lit and ready to go
the relay is up next
who a witness relaxes for a year it all
comes down to this
we've had a great year and a killer
competition featuring some serious
driving by our team we've had a little
fun a lot of trash talk show us your

way Susan this is zero to 60 the gut

her shoulders man like smoke it seems
like she just sucked on some helium she
