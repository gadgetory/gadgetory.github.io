never miss another of
outdoor activities have been a part of
my life however there is one thing
troubled me for so long ere product is
suitable for outdoor activities use but
the air inflation has always been a big
problem until we spent two years to
created this mat pump
- max pump - is the tiniest outdoor air
pump ever the weight is only 150 grams
which can be easily put into your
package or backpack now we have
induction switch when you touch it
you'll get the flow rate of 300 liters
per minute the product has three
different kinds of adapter can use it on
different types of your equipment
3600 MH a long battery life you can even
use it as emergency charging device and
it will shift three hits according to
your electric quantity while you're
charging it
now when I was out there with max bump -
I feel peace and free I can really enjoy
all those moments when I was there I
think I'm ready ready to embrace all of
this

the water in no time to use the
inflatable version start by removing the
floater paddle from its packaging and
unfolding the device to inflate the
floater paddle gently squeeze the base
of the air valve between your thumb and
forefinger and raise it to your lips
take a deep breath and blow into the air
valve you'll feel the flow to paddle
expanding in your hands as you blow when
the device feels like it's fully
inflated stop blowing and use your thumb
to press the lid of the air valve into
the chamber to form a tight seal once
the floater paddle is inflated you can
give it to your child to try on all they
have to do is slide their arm through
the hole in the device and wrap their
fingers around the handle if the
inflatable floater paddle is too tight
and doesn't fit your child you can
remove it and gently release some of the
air but always make sure the device is
fully inflated before swimming once your
child has secured both floater paddles
to their arms they're ready to go in the
water it really is as simple as one two
three and if you're an adult it's even
easier to use the floater paddle because
the foam version is ready to go the
moment you take it out of the box now
all you have to do is slide the device
onto your arm wrap your fingers around
the handle and hit the water once you're
in the ocean pool or lake all you have
to do is float paddle or Killick using
