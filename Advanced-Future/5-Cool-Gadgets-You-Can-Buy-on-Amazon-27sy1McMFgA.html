being with the people we love most
it's a closeness that defies distance
there's magic in this technology and
what we create together the daring and
the sentimental wrapped into one we're
here for new experiences and new ways to
say hello we're here to connect people
and communities to make the corners of
the world feel closer
we didn't invent connection but our
purpose is in service of it
you are the artists redefining human
connection you create things that
inspire people to stand at the shore of
infinite possibility hi what can I do
for you today hi professor
Okoye I could really use some help with
this week's assignment I can't get my
compiler to work let's take a look and
see what you've been working on this
week this is the one I've been working
on do you remember this slide from our
class so this will be directly applied
to this section right here where you
guys did the sequencing that's awesome I
think I get it now it makes a lot more
sense great it looks like we have a
comment from Wayne does anyone have any
questions about this particular
assignment
how many times have you been there just
seconds before the blackout when you
knew you'd be disconnected and how many
times have you thought why my
unprepared again being a test pilot for
fighter jets taught me you can never be
too ready that's why I invented this the
Calley back I used Kelly back when the
grid shuts down at home or in disaster
scenarios when I'm on duty as part of a
civil rescue team I also use it to
escape the grid and upgrade my outdoor
experience the callee packs energy lasts
for days you can charge the Cal effect
from the wall or car but my favorite is
grid free charging from the Sun in using
a smart phone for effective charging and
energy monitoring the cally pack also
comes with an optional weatherproof
raincoat for easy carrying
with the Kalibak I'm ready to beat any
of its in are you are you ready
may the power be with you
hey he double-dipped no I didn't he
missed
Oh
Kickstarter thank you for checking out
our page we are excited to bring you
spring thing a compact affordable device
that will improve the quality of your
everyday life by relieving chronic
tension and sore muscles in seconds tell
me about it what does it do
sprinting is a biofeedback
self-regulating massage device so what
the heck does that mean it means that
anybody can use it and benefit from it
whether you're a businessman whether
you're a mom whether you're a weekend
warrior and athlete the over workout at
the gym you know anybody that does that
everyone's wrong everybody has tension
and if you have tension and you use this
you're gonna benefit from it and you're
gonna get relief the most important part
of this is the spring that's what makes
this different than any other device
that's on the market today the spring
allows you to put force on those muscles
the ones that are causing you all the
pain and as you push on you can regulate
how much pressure you're applying and
that pressure once you started pushing
into it will just relieve all that
tension that's the most important piece
and it makes you feel so much better
it does hi I'm Kelly Walters I'm a
marathon runner and a triathlete I'm
currently training for an Ironman race
and you can imagine with all this
training I get very sore muscles and
tight joints with the spring thing I can
get quick relief my name is dr. Pam
Bowers I've been a chiropractor for 28
years and I am passionate about helping
people enjoy a higher quality of life
this project is special for me because
it evolved as a quest to solve a
personal need I love high adventure
recreational activities and I've
sustained some substantial injuries over
the years from enjoying what I love as a
result I have a chronic shoulder that is
stiff and sore and a hip that is tight
and
came from most of the time these areas
are difficult for me to stretch and
relax and current devices in the market
have been ineffective in helping me with
the evolution of spring thing I can
quickly gently and comfortably relax
those areas increase my mobility and
memin my pain so many people suffer with
muscle pain joint stiffness tension and
all sorts of daily things and pains how
would you feel if you could eliminate
these or drastically reduce them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
