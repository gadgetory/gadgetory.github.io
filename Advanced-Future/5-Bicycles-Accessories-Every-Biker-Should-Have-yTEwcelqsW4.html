it radius f1 it's a front bicycle light
and actually it's a smart front bicycle
light one interesting and cool feature
is the magnet charger we did enter the
system it is really easy to attach and
detach the magnet clip from the lamp
besides this it's really 100% water and
dust proof
yesterday's aina when I started the
project you know I look at the needs of
the product and what heat the product
has to fulfill it's so true I think that
the form usually follows the function
another feature is our click turn lock
system with a simple 90 degree turn you
can attach or detach the lamp from your
bike what we think a big enhancement is
a smart light output function I think
that's the biggest feature because it's
a safety feature by constantly measuring
the writing speed through and good and
gyroscope sensor we are capable to
adjust the light output according to
your riding speed if you drive faster
you got more light on the street and if
you drive slower you have less light on
the street when you take a curve the LEM
starts flashing to warn income traffic
if you come to a red light and have to
stop the LEM also starts flashing to
warn other people on the street when it
comes to battery life we did another
smart feature into our product it's a
stop function means you stop riding your
bike the lens they turn off and you prep
your bike to continue riding the light
blue on again
maybe you'll get the piece of extra
energy out of your every light you need
to get home safely you did put some
other cool and unique features in our
product one of it is Bluetooth remote
control which is mounted on the handle
bar right next to your hand and you can
change your light mode of the lamp
without using your hand from the handle
bar which we think really adds to the
safety of public traffic with the radius
of one we are at the stage now we are
beyond the final process for designing
and tooling so in this stage we decided
to start crowdfunding to get as much as
possible feedback from our potential
customer and probably to add their
valuable idea and suggestions into our
product before we really kick off the
product to the market that's where we
are now so we are international team and
creating beautiful and smart and
emotional products for the great
outdoors this is the topic smart gauge
d2 a second-generation digital pressure
gauge and part of tow Peaks team issue
accessory collection this gauge is the
latest in standalone digital pressure
gauges from toe peak the precision
digital gauge reads up to 250 psi and
can be used with tires suspension forks
and rear shock units it uses topic smart
head system to work seamlessly with both
Presta and Schrader valves without
having to change any parts the head
rotates 180 degrees for maximum
positioning the LCD display can be
changed to read in psi bar or kilogram
per square centimetre a Clear button
allows multiple quick readings the smart
gauge d2 also has an air release button
for accurate pressure adjustments the
topic smart gauge d2 is a precision
digital pressure gauge to keep your
tires shock and for perfectly dialed in
moving is a challenge between time and
space the will always been the best
companion in transporting people and
live unique journeys but never before is
being changing shape and function
revolve is been designed and invented
with him to be the first modular wheel
which will open new frontiers for the
present a future of disposable vehicles
the space is getting less and more
busier in the speed of life quicker by
constructing the mobility started from
the wheel is a new challenge that can
bring new and more efficient vehicles
for everyday life
large wheels are requiring human power
transportation for performance and
efficiency the wheel folded renew each
space up to 60%
with rebels you will be able to travel
everywhere and easily carry the wheel
between trains aeroplanes and cars with
a simple action you can open and close
the wheel it's unique excellent
structures allowed to have a solid and
an iconic design in both open and closed
configurations the ILS tire allow the
unique compactness and modularity
patented mechanism is being rich after
years of several unread 3d models and
those enough physical prototypes in
order to get the most efficient and
accurate folding mechanism the
wheelchair can benefit from large wheel
easy to store everywhere at anytime
compact and solid revolve allow the user
to safely use the wheelchair in every
condition with a modularity never seen
before potentially designed for bicycle
and wheelchair revolt as the flexibility
to be integrated to future foldable
vehicles
