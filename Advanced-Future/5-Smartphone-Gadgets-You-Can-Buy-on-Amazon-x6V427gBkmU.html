food is a Danish company that provides
high-resolution personalized weather
information to make this possible we
invented our wind meters for smartphones
we have won several awards for both
design and innovation and we believe
that users knowing both the wind speed
and direction will give them the
opportunity to get the full experience
of their outdoor activities designed
with two cups jnana is a really easy
wind meter to use as it provides highly
accurate wind speed measurements with
its minimalistic design and the use of
highly durable materials we have made
the mjolnir extremely robust and that's
why it's called the world's toughest
wind meter for more technical
information the Moroni does not contain
electronics wind speed measurements are
conducted by 4 small magnets mounted
inside the wind meter designed with
blades slept near is a really easy wind
meter to use as well it provides highly
accurate wind measurement and this is
the first handheld a nano meter that
also measures wind direction and that's
why it's called the world's smartest
wind meter for more technical
information the slip near is made with
optic sensors that generate more than
40,000 readings per second in order to
use both wind meters you need to get the
valued app which is available for free
on the App Store and Google Play just
search for food the first screen is
where you can run your own measurements
when completed you'll get a summary of
your wind speed measurement with
additional information such as the
temperature and pressure in the second
screen you can see the Vavra community's
measurement globally which is handy if
you want to know the wind for your next
location and in the final screen you can
see all your previous measurements so
now you don't have to write them down
anymore for the Mjolnir you just need to
download the app and plug the device in
your phone for the slip name is the same
procedure but you need to do a little
indoor calibration before you use it
just follow the instructions written on
your screen and when it reaches a
hundred percent you're ready to go you
