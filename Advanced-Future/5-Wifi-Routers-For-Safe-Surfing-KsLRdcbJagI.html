important utilities in our lives that we
usually take for granted but many
routers are really difficult to set up
configure and maintain security for our
Wi-Fi shouldn't be taken lightly but we
usually don't want a password that's too
complicated and hard to remember we've
sacrificed security so the combination
is but even with the strong password
it's scary how easy it can be for
someone to hack into our personal photos
and information typical home routers are
optimized for just a few devices but
nowadays each of us owns multiple
devices cheap components equal a weak
signal which means we're sometimes left
to do some signal strength yoga we're
gonna say it a good Wi-Fi router is
something that's worth investing I'm
going to show you the greatest thing
your eyes have ever beheld
and that's why I've built a router
that's easy to set up and use has
innovative new way to authenticate your
devices and has strong powerful
enterprise-grade hardware and software
key Wi-Fi is designed to be simple
sophisticated and secure to set up key
Wi-Fi just plug it in
and you're done we've simplified it all
to connect we've patented a unique
authentication procedure that is simple
and secure just go to the Wi-Fi
selection page tap qi5 and you're
authenticated now you're able to connect
devices that aren't authenticated simply
can't join the key provides and press
level hardware and the software for
kokum chip that is with allopathy
intelligent have been forming those
where devices and targets a stronger
clearer faster signal to your device
bashira spectacled might warrant a
moment consideration everyone notices
when the internet slows down there are
thousands of possible problems that
might have nothing to do with your
internet connection but something to do
with the connection between your modem
and your router or your router and your
devices we've designed something that's
so much more than a simple reset button
the Zen button it runs a self-diagnosis
the most common connectivity issues and
attempts to resolve them automatically
ultimate power uncompromising speeds
unmatched flexibility the wrt 3200 ACM
is performance perfected with double the
bandwidth to 160 megahertz on all
spatial streams the wrt has the fastest
5 gigahertz band on the market by using
DFS open channels and dedicated Wi-Fi
background scanning the wrt can access
clearer Wi-Fi airspace for less
interference and better performance
Linksys is a leader in multi-user MIMO
technology the wrt provides a powerful
simultaneous streaming experience to
multiple devices for blazing fast
uninterrupted Wi-Fi the wrt is also open
source ready giving you complete
flexibility to customize to your
specific applications unmatched the one
and only wrt 3200 ACM performance
perfected this is filter it may not look
like much but this small device solves
some very large problems we live in a
time where everything you do online is
monitored tracked or censored just
because you don't have anything to hide
doesn't mean you don't deserve privacy
finding a way to stay private and secure
is not such an easy task services are
fragmented and none provide coverage on
multiple devices making it a hassle to
stay protected we created filter in
order to make privacy and security more
accessible and easier to use Filton
provides VPN support ad blocking
capability and Tor anonymity and all the
devices in your home this is especially
important for devices that don't
normally support these applications like
gaming consoles Smart TVs and media
players those who not only protects you
from unwanted ad targeting but it
prevents companies governments and
internet providers from seeing more
personal information like your web
activity searches and even physical
location in VPN mode filter uses
enterprise grade encryption to protect
all the devices in your home
simultaneously this level of security
keeps all incoming and outgoing web
traffic private VPN mode also allows
access to geo restricted content or
censorship simply by switching regions
within the app filters app is incredibly
easy to
select the VPN setting the region you'd
like to connect to or automatic for the
speediest connection you can switch
between VPN mode and tour or configure
more advanced settings filter also does
the job of blocking advertisements
dangerous websites trackers and malware
infected advertising is a huge threat
annoyance with filter you'll never have
to see my let's just add again to stay
ahead of threats all security features
and lists are kept up to date
automatically you can choose what you
want to have updated or turn this off at
any time filter has a lot of
capabilities but setup couldn't be
easier
run all of your network traffic through
filters simply by connecting it between
any modem and router filter will start
working automatically and can be
configured within the app filter can be
used as a regular router which you can
connect your devices to via Wi-Fi or
Ethernet filter is ultra portable and
can even be powered off an external
battery even if you're in a public area
you don't have to worry about saying
secure and finding power we have a great
idea and an industrious team working to
make filter the best it can be but we
need your help we need to meet
manufacturing requirements and volume in
order to make filter affordable for
everyone we hope you'll support us and
