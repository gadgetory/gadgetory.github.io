gun you must always be prepared have to
be trained
you are your gun see when it's not on
you you want to know it's secure and
accessible safes are not always
accessible or easy to open especially in
the dark and locks are a nuisance to
operate as for smart guns while smart
guns are a dangerous concept taking an
unreliable technology and embedding it
into your gun is not a smart decision
our mission is to bring you the perfect
solution introducing sorex
the new generation of gun storage Zhou
Rex's caliber specific it has two modes
the first mode is awareness if someone
tries to tamper with your gun you're
immediately alerted and when you need
your gun charging it will eject syrettes
and chamber a fresh round the second
mode is when your gun is locked when
Zoar is locked
no one can charge your gun if someone
tries to charge your gun the locking
mechanism will immediately expand
preventing the gun from being loaded
special polymers in the locking
mechanism prevent any damage to the
barrel
soraa's developed a revolutionary
unlocking mechanism rapid dial rapid
dial is a simple mechanism which counts
clicks while you turn it you don't need
to start from a specific point even the
direction that you turn the lock doesn't
matter these two factors allow you to
unlock your weapon without looking at it
even in the dark you can choose a simple
code or any length code you wish you
won't believe how fast and simple it is
until you try it you can also open zorax
from your phone but you can only lock it
by physically pressing the lock button
zorax normally communicates with your
phone directly through bluetooth it also
comes with a zorb bridge a Bluetooth 2
Wi-Fi router when plugged into the wall
near your gun you'll be made aware from
anywhere in the world if your gun is
being tampered with now if your home is
your safe and you don't lock your gun
but you still want alerts we have a
solution the zone watchdog the door
watchdog is not a lock but rather a
notification device its sole purpose is
to notify you if your weapon is tampered
with
sar X was invented by veterans of elite
IDF technological and in combat units we
worked on it for two years bringing it
to perfection czar X allows you to be
ready aware and safe more than ever
before
join the zuhr revolution own your gun
salt is a gun but it's not like any gun
that you've ever seen it was designed
around the belief that a firearm
shouldn't have to take a life in order
to protect a life from that simple idea
we started by completely rethinking the
bullet instead of LED salt was designed
to shoot a specialized round filled with
a powerful toxin so instead of killing
the target salt opens up on impact in a
cloud that instantly causes respiratory
and visual distress so while an intruder
or a curious child will be incapacitated
encounter wouldn't be fatal
this rethink also lets salt be used not
only offensively but defensively as well
so if an intruder is kicking down your
door solve allows you to shoot the area
around it before the danger is on top of
you this creates a protective cloud of
toxin between you and the intruder
before he's ever a threat to you or your
family our last big idea was to make
salt easy to use for everyone so we
replaced the violent bang of black
powder with the silent power of
compressed air the result is a fear free
user experience so the only person that
should have anything to be scared of is
an intruder and that's all a safe gun
for a safe home so now all we need is
you the testing the Rd the prototyping
is all done and we're ready to begin
production but salt can't be made
without you without all of us really
wanting a better way to keep the people
we love safe so if you're is intrigued
by the ideas as we are we'd love to make
you one just click our support button
and together we can make the world just
a little bit safer at the end of the
last century a revolutionary pulse
energy weapon called the advanced taser
m26 was created to take away your
control its impulses can infiltrate your
goal net
I hit anywhere on the body stopping even
subjects under the influence of hyper
stimulants PCP cocaine or meth
amphetamines the m26 has been used to
safely subdue emotionally disturbed
persons saved suicidal subjects control
and combative intoxicated drivers
incapacitate dangerous subjects safely
end armed standoffs
and even rescue hostages the special MX
taser can even stop aggressive large
animals without injury the most powerful
less lethal weapon ever developed the
m26 is now deployed by over 2,500 police
agencies the m26 has reduced injuries to
officers by up to 80% the m26 has saved
millions of dollars in litigation and it
has saved over a thousand lives
the salvo 12 contains a system of rods
and baffles to contain the blast of a
shotgun
the rods allow gas to escape into the
baffles while preserving the function of
the wad after it exits the barrel
the modular system of Rods baffles and
caps allows for the customization of the
salvo 12 depending on your desired
weight and noise reduction specs this
also allows for easy cleaning of the
suppressor
we have seen significant reduction in
decibel levels making the blast of a
shotgun quieter than an unsuppressed 22
rifle the salvo 12 also significantly
improves the perceived recoil of a
shotgun making shooting a more enjoyable
experience for all the salvo 12 attaches
to your shotgun through a removable
choke system a variety of chokes are
available to fit your specific weapon
here's a standard weapon the alternative
within seconds is easily mounted to the
top of the weapon there is no
obstruction to the sight picture for the
operator and there's no obstruction to
the functionality of the weapon or the
rail system it still allows an officer
the ability to attach a flashlight on
their weapon once the weapon is fired
the bullet travels down the barrel
embedding itself inside the alloy
projectile with no chance of escaping
instantly becoming one solid unit the
projectile immediately separates from
the weapon as the docking unit is
instantly ejected then a new bullet is
cycled in for follow-up shots if
necessary the alternative is as accurate
as the operator using it once the
projectile impacts the threat it will
send a shock wave of pain to the suspect
without the internal damage that a
penetrating bullet would cause and now
here's a simulation of police training
and when to utilize the alternative
drop it drop it less lethal less lethal
hi folks Aaron Boyd here wanted to do a
quick video showing how the lifeguard
operates there's a latch here on the
upper part in the frame this is the
barrel latch slide that back you can
tilt the barrel up I'm going to just put
a snap cap in there slide the latch back
close the barrel and it will lock closed
there's a similar latch on the bottom on
the handle just slide that forward and
split the two halves go all the way till
it locks open from there it's gonna
operate like a normal gun do you just
cock the bolt pull the trigger reset the
bolt to the half cocked flush with the
rear of the frame that's the position
that you're going to use to fold it
closed there you go
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
