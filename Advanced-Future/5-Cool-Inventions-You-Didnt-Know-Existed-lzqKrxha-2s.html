thanks for your purchase of the no key
padlock to help you get the most out of
your lock I'd like to highlight some of
its key features it's the smartest
padlock out there and just like the name
implies it requires no key to open it
instead of using traditional keys or
combinations this lock opens using a
Bluetooth enabled device such as your
smartphone tablet or even an Apple watch
the no key works in conjunction with our
no key app which is found on Apple
Android and Windows devices the app not
only allows access to the lock via
bluetooth but also lets the user in by
guests to have shared access to the lock
by sending them virtual keys in addition
to that the app will keep a history of
the lock so the user can monitor who
accessed their lock and even see where
and when that access took place being
able to track what's going on with your
lock and then make adjustments remotely
not only brings convenience to security
but it also adds a new level of control
which is what makes the no key the
perfect choice for locking your
possessions
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
