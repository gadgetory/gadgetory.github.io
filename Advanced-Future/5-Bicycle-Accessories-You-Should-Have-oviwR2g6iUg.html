get out and ride my bike but the
combination of rough roads and stiff
bike frames means riding can be really
tough on your body in 2016 we launched
the shock stop suspension stem to add
cushioning to the front end of the bike
the stem changed the way people thought
about suspension but the front of the
bike is only half the equation that's
why we're so excited to introduce the
shock stop seat post a revolutionary
short travel suspension seatpost that
will completely change your riding
experience no matter what kind of bike
you ride maybe you're out for an epic
gravel adventure or just dealing with
potholes on your daily commute you're
gonna find rough roads wherever you ride
modern bikes are designed for speed and
efficiency not for comfort this means
bumps and impacts passed straight into
your body which leads to fatigue pain or
even injury
we designed the shock stop seat post to
suspend your body and isolate you from
the shocks and vibrations of the road we
optimize the travel and suspension
kinematics to provide a super plush
bottomless suspension feel we designed
the seat post to integrate seamlessly
with the styling of modern bikes you can
change the spring rate and preload to
match your specific riding style
and it's compatible with all types of
writing gravel me bike commuter road and
mountain studies show fatigue reduces
riding efficiency by up to 20%
typically adding comfort to bike meant
sacrificing performance the shocks Topsy
post lets you ride faster and more
efficiently because instead of bracing
yourself against impacts you can say
seated and keep pedaling over rough
surfaces it reduces the accumulated
effects of bumps and vibrations allowing
you to ride further faster and more
comfortable the shock stop seat post is
the rare product that increases comfort
and performance riding the shocks Topsy
post is truly transformative
hi it's mike with f3 and I'm here in
Chicago on a brisk spring day to
demonstrate our stem cat phone mount
it's magnet interfaced snaps on and off
very easily you can write in portrait or
landscape mode installs about a minute
it's got angling adjustability to your
preference let's go for a ride
I hate gym
yeah I'm kind of middle of something
our guiding principle at f3 is form
follows function using that idea we knew
that we needed to create the proper
shapes and make it look beautiful
when you have very strong magnets then
you have a problem with the phone not
coming off of the amount so we had to
come up with a way that we could make
the phone remove from the mount the way
we did that was with our twist lift
system you put your phone into the mount
it securely held you twist it it creates
an air gap and it lifts right off our
phone mount uses a very high quality
minimalistic case plate with a very
strong adhesive that gives your phone
and this plate and a breakable bond
every year around 50,000 by Kasbah
injured and approximately 800 are killed
on us roads the majority of these
accidents happen to due to weak
visibility and mistakes in traffic we
thought a lot about how we can avoid
that people making mistakes to be honest
we can't but we can make them more
visible

hi I'm Christiane my name is evilness
hello i'm doyoung I'm the CEO and
developer at revoluci√≥n and the past 15
years I founded and supported six
different startups with this experience
I'm absolutely confident to bring back
lightning the very Luxio to new level
the common passion of the three of us is
cycling and we are doing a lot of trips
around Germany with our bikes we always
try to stay on bike trails and avoid
cycling in the darkness but sometimes we
have to use the streets and are not back
until sunset throughout the development
was very important for us to offer the
light possible solution that would not
hinder you the biker during our bike
trips be observed again and again the
bikers are not noticed by others and
dangerous situations can arise from that
you want this for your bike then
consider to support us right now the
next step is to start with the
production and we need your help to
cover the initial costs they say from
the roads
after our award-winning flector zero and
360 market launches we're back with a
brand new product reflector vortex the
world's first crank reflector the
smallest accessory ever for your bike
with the largest possible impact on your
safety is specially designed for
bicycles with clipless pedals that do
not provide space for reflectors with a
set weight of 2.2 grams
vortex does not create any air drag or
dynamic imbalance just a stylish look
for your bike by day and safety for your
rides in the dark flector vortexes
design features a unique 3d formable
film which perfectly fits the shape of
almost every crank set on the market due
to its sealed surface flector vortex is
nearly indestructible and keeps its good
properties for a long time it can even
withstand a high pressure cleaner
flector vortex is discreet by day but
vibrantly reflecting at night and help
secure your space on the road its micro
prismatic technology reflects a
vortexing and strong beam of light back
to its source and attracts every car
drivers attention in comparison to
old-fashioned peddle reflectors flector
vortex increases your visibility through
its 360 degree beam angle and helps even
if your bike already has pedal
reflectors reflector vortex helps you
master every dangerous situation in the
dark reflecting the light back to its
source making you visible with a
stunning glow all around
