built for filming observing and
exploring it is a portable and
user-friendly device that is able to
dive up to a depth of 100 meters all
while filming in Full HD
whether you are diving fishing island
hopping or exploring the Gladius is an
excellent tool for you it can fly like
an airplane while in water with a super
fast speed of up to four knots or 2
meters per second the unique Quatro
thrusters design makes it able to nimbly
move in all directions the Gladius comes
with two built-in batteries which can
last up to three to four hours on one
charge weighing only 6.6 pounds and
small size make it very portable as it
can easily fit into a backpack or
suitcase the built in full HD camera and
LED lighting have been optimized for use
in water which enables users to take
high-quality 16 megapixel photos and 4k
videos without any Distortion a remote
controller and the app interface is
quite simple and intuitive which is
compatible for Android or iOS devices
you can take pictures and videos and
quickly share on different social media
platforms the mobile Wi-Fi boy which
floats on the surface is equipped with a
500 meters range wireless communication
module which sends live image and data
to your device this gives Gladius a
significant operating range we have
already produced multiple prototypes of
the Gladius in order to perfect its
design the internal sealed cabin of
glabius uses aluminium alloy materials
with oxidation treatment to ensure it is
waterproof and corrosion-resistant
within 100 metres depth
our goal is open our ovie has always
been to make an exploration tool that
everyone can use the new version of open
ROV
is the best one we've ever built it's
more maneuverable in the water it's
easier to build you can build it more
quickly and it's a lot more durable we
want this to be a serious exploration
tool here's how it works
onboard the ROV are six batteries which
supply voltage to it and allow it to run
for about two hours it has a USB web
camera which sends video up to the
surface via a tether once this signal
gets up to the surface there's a little
adapter box which you can plug an
Ethernet cable into and it allows your
computer's web browser to connect to the
ROV it's that simple the extreme
portability allows people to go to
places that have never been explored
because it's too hard to fall scuba gear
there or much larger arteries so what
we've created is something that it's not
only low cost and easy to build but also
something that can really get into the
places that we've never seen before
building a small compact durable capable
ROV is an incredible challenge and
there's really no way that we could have
done it ourselves without this big
community of people to help us build and
the cool side effect is that we've
developed this whole global network of
like-minded searchers so when you plug
in your ROV you're not just plugging it
into a computer you're actually plugging
into this big community of like-minded
explorers I am so excited to see what
people use the open ROV for there's so
much exploration to be had out there all
you need is a laptop the ROV and a place
to explore
what if filming took care of itself if
you were able to swim explore and dive
while your camera follow
hi I'm Ben and this is Kevin
well divers going to explore marveling
at the beauty of the ocean and bringing
back memories of our underwater
adventures if you're like us you know
how cool it is to share your diving
experiences with people on land you also
know how filming gets in the way of
simply enjoying the moments which is why
we dive in the first place that's why a
year ago we had a dream with imagine an
autonomous underwater drone that follows
you during your dials lets you capture
beautiful footage hands-free so you can
focus on the diving now above always in
path of becoming a reality
this camera is completely autonomous
autonomous means that you don't have to
do anything at all
we've created and patented an underwater
localization technology it enables
ibubble
to know where you are and to keep you or
your surroundings in the frame now you
can record your diving adventures with
no camera handling whatsoever ibubble
comes loaded with a built-in library of
carefully designed camera movements all
you have to do is choose your shot from
the control bracelet and I bubble
execute the results are incredible
beautiful underwater footage from
completely new perspectives you might
wonder how I bubble performs when you
have let's say a specific close-up to
shoot good question you just call I
bubble back with your bracelet grab it
and film as you want when you're done
let ibubble go and it goes right back to
follow mode we've all dreamed of
following a turtle or month away while
it swim fast and far away
so we've enabled eye beable to do just
that all by itself press the target
locking button for a few seconds and
ibubble will recognize the shape it
needs to follow release it and watch as
it glides by turtles and sharks
capturing what's out of your reach we've
designed all the features in close
collaboration with the diving community
and professionals from the underwater
world unification on fuji bubbles if
netted una - the vomit on cam please
GCE Domini
oh yeah leepu's ooh-la-la Coon hunts
redundant community it was at the same
time she a meanie booyah in a competence
but when is a talk too much spine can be
able to know keep it on longer you
immediate is anymore you know every CEO
it's just expands usually the type of
things that I can create so how does a
future prison one Porsche in the
revolution policy on recidivism
I can't wait to have my own today with
the work we've done and the team we've
built we know we can make above all a
reality the last thing we need is your
help if we reach our goal will access
the whistles is needed to deliver a
bubble next year with more fans will
have even more features so by I beable
today thank you from the entire eye
bubble team humans exploration to ocean
never ends but oceans are still full of
mysteries to explore the yet unknown
underwater world
we created high quality ROV the CC ROV
it equipped with four horizontal and two
vertical thrusters allowing a high
precision control it can rotate on five
axes or stay still to offer the best
underwater experience
with his 4k camera CC ROV allows a
premium video footage and a lower cost
he's also ready to dive right out of her
backpack you can connect it to your
phone using the CC ROV app and then you
can see a live stream from under the
water it can even go up to 100 meters
deep and I think gives a lot of fun for
young people
CC ROV oso serves unluck we live on a
planet that's 71% water yet we've only
explored 10% of it we're about to change
that the fathom one is an easy-to-use
underwater drone that you control with
your smartphone or tablet we designed it
to be the most affordable most versatile
underwater drone ever made and after two
full years of prototyping and
development were finally ready to bring
underwater exploration and education to
the masses
I'm John I'm Matt I'm Danny and we're a
team of outdoor enthusiasts scuba divers
engineers and travelers they had an idea
for an underwater drone that we could
take anywhere and use in any environment
I grew up spending summers on Lake
Louise in northern Michigan where a lot
of large logging operations took place
in the 1800s
jump forward 200 years and now every
cottage has artifacts and pieces of
history on their walls that washed up on
the beach but there are still legends of
horse-drawn sleds that fell through the
ice and got stuck at the bottom just
waiting to be explored I thought if I
could control an aerial drone from a
mobile app to explore from above why
couldn't I do the same thing from
underwater
that's when Patton was born
underwater remotely operated vehicles or
ROV s have been around for a while but
they're mainly large expensive
industrial devices tethered to big ships
and early consumer RVs inspired by their
Big Brother's cost well over a thousand
dollars with no mobile app for piloting
and you may be a pretty good hacker to
put them together we knew we wanted an
underwater drone that anyone could drop
into any body of water and pilot easily
using an app on their smart device and
it had to be small and light enough to
carry around meaning a completely new
compact design it had to come fully
assembled out of the box including an
onboard 1080p HD camera and built in
high intensity LED headlights for clear
viewing and it had to be as affordable
as lower cost flying drones with
comparable equipment so that every
modern day Explorer could have one we
built the fathom one with all of those
features and thanks to custom components
in a streamlined design now you can have
it for under six hundred dollars that's
less than half the price of the closest
competition
above all we made the fathom one super
easy to use but that doesn't mean it's
limited this thing is fully modular our
patent-pending thruster attachment
system allows you to easily remove all
three thrusters for packing but it also
enables customization and upgrades to
specialized thrusters such as these ones
with larger fins for stabilization and
we're hoping our backer community will
create and share their own ideas for
customization if either one also
features an integrated rail system that
makes adding accessories like action
cameras and additional lights or other
sensors a breeze just slide it on click
it in and you're ready to go we put
everything that we have into making
underwater exploration and education
more accessible to the masses we built
the prototypes validated our designs and
now ready to go on a full-scale
manufacturing all that's left is for you
the kickstart community to show us that
you want an underwater drone that's
affordable portable modular and
completely easy to use right out of the
box fathom is your chance to go deep and
see the world in an entirely new way the
possibilities are truly endless
what can you fathom
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
