never miss another of
you
first I create the flyball to get the
high G of the fireball in 2003 ly 2011
and then Thursday I put my feet on it I
just dreamed to remove the hose and the
Jets because to be able to fly all
around the world and be free and see
like a real super super human
you
what is it like to feel like a superhero
it was our dream to bring this filling
to you through the design and
development of the arc aboard our
creativity in the past few months was
pushed like never before making it
possible for the first time in history
for you to fly whenever you want
wherever you want there are no limits no
restrictions no boundaries only you and
the arc aboard feel the power of flight
like you never thought possible we are
all leaving a mark upon the world we are
engineering the future we feel like
superheroes and now you can experience
it too I visited a super-secret garage
in Los Angeles to meet Tim Desroches of
air effects the company that created
this a vehicle they call the Aero X just
don't call it a hover bike the Aero X is
a surface effect vehicle a lot of people
call it a hover bike technically it's
not a hover bike a hovercraft is
something that operates only in two
dimensions on the ground and the Aero X
is a vehicle that gets up to 15 feet off
the ground and operates in three
dimensions so it has pitch and has yaw
the Aero X is the brainchild of Tim's
cousin Mark Desroches an aerospace
engineer seeing the prototype up close
was pretty cool I feel like I've stepped
into a dream in the future this vehicle
design is actually not entirely new it
was a design that came out of the
military decades ago but in that case it
was more like a helicopter and the guy
was just riding it operating it like a
helicopter sitting on top and the Aero X
the rider rides it like a
so you're sitting atop it and you're
flying it intuitively and the vehicles
following your emotions so what is the
key innovation here the key Novation is
the control system is flaps
they're called ejectors that run around
the perimeter of each fan and they
control the airflow on the perimeter and
closing or opening them will allow you
to control the pitch of the vehicle and
the yaw of the vehicle pitch is the up
and down movement of an object in air or
water yo is it side-to-side movement so
how far up off the ground can this get
so we are aiming to operate the vehicle
5 to 15 feet off the ground we want to
be flying over fences over cars we want
it to fly over a field of corn for
example the applications that we're most
excited about our agriculture and
search-and-rescue and recreation I think
the vehicle is gonna be a lot of fun Tim
let me climb on the aero-x which is made
out of carbon fiber to get a feel for
the controls there you go how does it
feel very cool as I do this as you go
forward and back you're controlling the
air flow and that's gonna control your
altitude okay so this is controlling the
up and down yep okay and then as you
manipulate it's your wrists then you are
controlling the pitch okay and the yaw
of the vehicle okay and the way you're
doing that is opening and closing these
flaps these ejectors along the perimeter
so how much training does this require
to take out so you're gonna need about
two hours of training to fly this
vehicle pretty effectively because the
Aero X flies below 15 feet off the
ground you don't need a pilot's license
to write it but you're going to have to
wait the first production model isn't
expected to be ready until 2017 this is
the biggest T's ever you get me on this
you let me control it and you're not
gonna let me go outside right I know
maybe if I just refused to leave and
keep sitting here
change their mind
