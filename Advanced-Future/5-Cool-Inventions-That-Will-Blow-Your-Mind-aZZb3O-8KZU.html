a cord free answer to your every floor
cleaning need 75 million vibrating
microfibers that work like nothing
you've tried before
say hello to Pogo the ingenious all
surface cleaning breakthrough Pogo is
uniquely engineered cordless and
lightweight allowing you to clean
everywhere dirt goes imagine finally
being able to clean every floor in your
home with one amazing invention Pogo
makes cleaning so fast and easy giving
you beautiful spotless floors that not
only look clean they're proven more
clean after a few passes with a sponge
mop you thought your floor was clean but
this blacklight demo reveals the mess
your sponge mop leaves behind now look
how with just one pass of Pogo your
floor's Pogo clean the rechargeable
batteries give you 45 minutes of cord
free Pogo power while the lightweight
low-profile design allows you to clean
everywhere dirt goes unlike superficial
scrubbers that just skim across your
wood or tile surface leaving dirt and
bacteria behind Poco delivers an amazing
66 oscillations per second of high speed
harmonic vibration activating 75-million
dirt grabbing micro fibers to get deep
into the cracks lifting away and
trapping the dirt within the fibers so
nothing is left behind come on let's go
we took Pogo door-to-door to conduct a
real-life hygiene test and the result
will amaze you house after house we put
Pogo to the before and after cleaning
test 1749 okay at least we know 1749 Mya
quickly pogo'd her bathroom tile
forty-two self-proclaimed clean freak
Julie was shocked by the reading in her
RV 1576 but her dirty bathroom floor
with no match for Pogo for a four is
like brand-new
it's like we're super sanitary like you
bought a new RV yes
so try Pogo today remember your home is
not clean unless it's Pogo clean hi I'm
Molly hi I'm Joseph and we're the
founders of united so any parents fight
with their children at that time but
really we all want to have fun and enjoy
special moments with our families before
everybody gets a good night's sleep at
unite inspired kids and parents and
screaming colors dream big and to follow
easy that's all we do and we're thrilled
to share our dream with you and your
family we create a unites
you
distracting background noise neutralized
the speech you want to focus on is sent
directly to your inner ear can you hear
me now
yeah good it uses directional
microphones to capture audio input the
past
in sports post match analysis is often
used as a tool to enhance pace
idols audio can allow you to engage in
personalized live music performances
letting you focus your hearing at will
we should never be afraid
not only a sight and hearing are most
important senses they are also our least
stable declining earlier in life and
touch taste or smell we see applications
of idols in strengthening the signals
weakened by aging and disability for
example being able to hear more
selectively would have benefits for
children with ADHD by helping them to
concentrate in busy or distracting
environments
we are surrounded by technology it's
entering our homes and helping us
automate daily tasks but I find myself
thinking there has to be a more natural
and accessible way to control the
devices around us if the goal of
automation is to simplify our lives why
does it feel so complicated our goal as
a company is to solve this
say hello to knocky knocky is a small
elegant device that instantly transforms
ordinary surfaces in your environment
and turbo controls using naki couldn't
be easier simply take it out of the box
pick a place to put it select a surface
to attach it to and then define all the
things you'd like Nike to do
Nike can control a wide variety of
devices around us but the true beauty of
our technology is that what it can do is
only limited by your imagination put one
in your living room or the kitchen or
even your bedroom I mean imagine rolling
over in the morning and tapping a simple
pattern anywhere on your nightstand to
snooze your alarm and start the
coffeemaker without even opening your
eyes you just bought ten more minutes in
bed and don't definitely want to put one
in your kids bedroom it's exciting to
think of how naki will spark their
imagination as they figure out all kinds
of ways to use it using Wi-Fi which is
proven to be far more reliable and with
better reach than Bluetooth you can
enjoy using naki from anywhere the
number of devices and software that naki
interact with is rapidly growing every
day it currently includes nest Phillips
you lifx smartthings IFTTT and more but
even if you're new to the smart
technology world you can still use naki
for simple functions around your home
are you a light sleeper night owl or
frequent traveler are you just working
too darn hard to get enough rest sleep
masks are a great way to instantly
upgrade your sleep but most are
uncomfortable or don't fully block out
the light so as industrial designers
with over 10 years of experience we
created something better the Manta sleep
mask the key is in the adjustable
eyepieces simply lift adjust secure and
you have a personalized fit that's
comfortable with 100% blackout the
hollow eye contours prevent pressure on
your eyes which encourage REM sleep the
type of sleep that makes you feel well
rested we also did sweat the details
adding anti slip gel for better grip
integrating elastic stretch bands for
comfort and using micro velcro that
won't stick to your hair so whether
you're embarking on the most epic and
memorable adventure of the season and
need to catch a bit of sleep whenever
and wherever you can or you just need to
recharge yourself with a 30 minute power
nap in the middle of a busy day or maybe
you just want to sleep in on a lazy
Sunday morning and have breakfast in bed
with the one you love Manta sleep mask
will be there for you
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
