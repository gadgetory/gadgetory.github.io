hello my name is Brent Jacobs to lock
right safety back up what we are going
to show today is the preferred method of
using lock right on applications special
multiple bolts what are we going to do
is show hands flash method this method
is to allow the other operator your
partner and torquing this operation to
know when your hands are safe and out of
the way of the application since our
magnetic wrenches will hold the riches
in place by themselves we were going to
take this one and five-eighths inch nut

hold itself in place we're going to take
this one swing on this one let it hold
itself in place and now my hands flashed
