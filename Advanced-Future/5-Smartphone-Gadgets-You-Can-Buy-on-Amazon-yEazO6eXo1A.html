important parts of our daily lives we
use it for personal communication
finishing tasks for work checking social
media posts or even playing your
favorite game during lunch break it
almost feels like an extension of
ourselves with traditional charging
options
we can't satisfy the battery needs for
heavy usage of our smartphones making us
frustrated every time when the phone
pops up and low battery notification hi
Kickstarter my name is Tomas and I'm
here to say that the traditional ways of
charging mobile phones are inconvenient
today we need a better simpler and more
convenient way to charge our phones we
have researched and tested many
different ways of charging including
wireless solutions and we decided to use
magnetic adapters for our charging packs
as a proper solution with corresponding
magnetic adapters you can charge any
kind of smartphone the charging pack is
only 15 grams weight which is extremely
portable for everyday carry in 30
minutes this tiny little pack can give
an iPhone 8 a 25 percent battery boost
so that with four of these places in
total your phone will maintain fully
charged for charging packs can provide
an iPhone eight about nine hours of
battery usage also the charging station
is a portable battery with 5000 milli
amperes this is our magnetic charging
cable which supports fast charging due
to maximum 2 amp currents now let's see
how finger pal can help
meet the Polaroid pop it's almost the
same but now it automatically prints
full-color photos in the classic three
by four format with the border
don't you like that border yep yeah you
do the pop lets you write captions
directly on the photo and print
instantly just connect to a mobile
device and your pop becomes an instant
photo printer even share on Facebook and
Instagram see look how easy that was now
time to tackle rush hour and no more
flapping the photo waiting for it to
appear it's instant like that bowl of
noodles you're eating the pop captures
20 megapixel details now you can record
Full HD video or a fun gift deer cups of
coffee or your wedding day it never
looks better oh wait the screen has
changed too so now just use the four
inch touch LCD to frame and navigate and
add emojis and share and yep prints
there you got this because some things
don't get old they just get better
speed happens in the blink of an eye
speed is better speed is confidence
performance speed is control speed is
essential when he the difference
speed is domination speed is perfect
speed is the goal
speed is everything speed is the reason
I do it again and again until I did it
right
