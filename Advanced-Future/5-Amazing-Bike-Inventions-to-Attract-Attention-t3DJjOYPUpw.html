dangerous sometimes deadly with our
phones always in reach distracted
driving is more common than ever with a
Lane sight system you can focus on the
road ahead
because we've got your back as you ride
Lane sights patented rear camera system
scans the road behind you detecting
approaching cars once the vehicle is
detected the system sends a flashing
alert to the driver behind you as the
vehicle approaches the system tracks and
the alerts increase in frequency more
frequent alerts help draw the drivers
attention you have time to move over if
a vehicle gets too close the rear camera
will capture video the lane sight system
improves safety for all cyclists whether
you're training for a competition or out
for a fun family ride with Lane site you
can enjoy the ride because we got your
back
Oh
here you can see how the loot flex with
the weight or the shock is put on them
and how the hub moves with this Springs
that the rim remains rigid a luke wheel
has 360 degrees of shock absorption
which we call tangential suspension so
the loop system reacts to the shock from
any direction you can even ride up some
more curbs and of course you get
fantastic comfort from the shock
absorbing loops when you come off a
curve one of the obstacle it will
perform well on cobbled streets as the
loops absorb the shock no matter which
direction they come from this gives a
smoother ride even on the bumpiest of
roads the luke wheel system allows for
plenty of control even when cycling
slowly on a tight turn hi Kickstarter
I'm ed and my company vaguely has
designed the commuter export I've been a
commuter in London now for six years
in 2013 I was hit from behind and thrown
into the road left there lying on my
back and cars driving past me in a busy
junction it was a big wake-up call just
made me realize just how vulnerable I
was and how vulnerable cyclists are my
answer is the commuter X for the
community expose is an extremely
adaptable rear bicycle light it can be
worn over your shoulders it's got a
small and compact central projected
light it fits onto backpacks up to 35
litres and adjust tightly to fit any bag
it allows drivers to determine a unique
shape on the roads in heavy rush hour
traffic and the commute x4 brings all
lights into cycling we have an extremely
experienced design team here in the UK
with a proven track record of taking
products from concept through to
development in January 2014 the commuter
x4 was in order the place that the
British inventors project during The
Gadget Show line
this is parked massive interest from the
public in the media and on the back of
this I've decided to take it to market
with your help let's see if we can
increase urban cycle safety across the
globe thank you very much for watching
you
you
