if your arms just aren't long enough of
a selfie stick just doesn't do it for
you how about a drone designed
specifically for grabbing snapshots of
you and anyone you are with this is the
air selfie a mini drone that sits inside
a mobile phone case that you can take
out on a moment's notice pilot it to
anywhere within about 60 feet then have
it hover and grab a selfie for you sans
your arm and shoulder taking up half the
shot we currently write to the picture
to be taken and be uploaded on it can be
any social media like Facebook within
one minute from start to the end of the
operation and developers say the camera
in here is a 5 megapixel camera about
the same type of camera you'd find in an
iPhone 6
that's the iPhone 6s lower-quality
inward facing camera which developers
insist is plenty for what the drone is
designed to do when you upload the
pictures on Facebook they are formatted
again so I think maybe 10 megapixel
camera wouldn't do any anything better
the air selfie which is actually one of
a few selfie drones about to hit the
market is getting set to launch on
Kickstarter for about $200 it'll ship
