about iCloud Dropbox Google Drive
onedrive pretty cool right to have all
your files in one place easily
accessible but are you sure about that I
am NOT I have to say I never know what's
where I take pictures with my smartphone
make presentations on my laptop but when
I want to move content from one device
to another it's a mess
also where are my files the cloud stores
them on some unknown server somewhere so
am I still the owner I don't know about
you but this makes me very uncomfortable
and then I discovered Mima much similar
it's like the cloud but a personal cloud
what does that mean it means my files
stay completely mine I install the
device in my home above one end into the
router and the other end into my hard
drive that's my cloud I can access the
files from anywhere what I own they come
directly from my own I don't have to pay
every month and I don't have to send my
files over to some companies of servers
totally private and it's much easier the
Lima Drive appears as if you have a hard
drive connected to replicate your
computer put your files in the image
just like you would any other folders
the files are instantly sent to your
name and device and available on all on
my mobile the file transfer is automatic
any time I take a picture here it's
automatically here here and backed up
here all my devices talk to each other
directly so wherever I am in the world
vemma gets me access to all my files and
whenever I
one really cool feature Lila is that it
makes my devices bigger than they really
are
if I plug a 3 terabyte hard drive into
my Lena device that means I have three
terabytes I can access for my laptop for
my smart phone or my tablet even if they
don't come with that capacity only
offline files take up storage the rest
are automatically streamed by a limo
without tech now local storage need to
keep these files offline it's just a
swipe away I can access my files without
an internet connection worried about
backups well this is cool whether it's
Lena original or Nima ultra I install a
second limit advise the to Lima devices
back each other up automatically does it
work with any device yes you're no
longer tied to a brand Lima works with
Mac Windows Linux Android and iOS so
that's it it's as simple as it looks a
private cloud that's easy no monthly
fees Lena this is what I was looking to
you Ellie lets you communicate across
languages without an internet connection

processor this allows for speech to text
conversion while simultaneously
capturing audio data Ely is designed to
optimize translation from an extensive
in device database it's streaming engine

orientation of the stylus so our palm

stylus flip knows since we know the
exact location of the stylus we can
perfectly reject any other object

functionality and we can even detect the
stylus while it is still in the air
