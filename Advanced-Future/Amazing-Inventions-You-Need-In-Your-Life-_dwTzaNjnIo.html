and never miss another of
here in Bremen at the PIPA Institute we
had the idea for this elevator while
watching a robot football match we
thought why not take these robots put
them upside down and use the wheels to
move parcels around you can combine the
cells to any shape or size that fits
your needs and save up to 80% footprint
thus elevator recognizes this layout
automatically you can change the
direction of the parcel by the press of
a button and if you want to change the
functionality of the complete system you
can do it with a single software update
if a cell breaks down it can be replaced
within minutes
thus elevator recognizes this new cell
and is again ready to go I have never
seen a robot like this it has to be the
first time what is this thing my first
reaction when I saw the robot I said
what what I'm gonna do okay

stay nearby to the cafeteria our

outside and enjoying a snack with
colleagues our robots can help so what

the Civil War we've designed a pain free
alternative to the typical crutch that
you're used to seeing so the main body
is designed to cradle the elbow and
support the users weight while absorbing
the impact of each step the arm and leg
are adjustable for someone that's 4 foot
7 all the way up to 6 foot 8 and height
the flexible arms Japs make it easy to
get in and out quickly the cradle
unlocks so that the user may reach up or
down while still wearing the crutches
the handle rotates out of the way for
hands-free walking the feet are
interchangeable and with a push of a
button you can easily replace the
standard foot with feet designed for
snow and ice sand or even in fretted use
this crutch was originally inspired out
of the needs of permanent crutch users
but it also works just as well for a
temporary crutches or like a sprained
ankle no I was a sergeant at the time
with and I had a tremendous amount of
responsibility the mission had to go on
but I wasn't as capable as fulfilling
the mission you know what my Marines do
to the injury particularly with the
crutches that I was given it actually
slowed me down the hope we have for our
company and this product is to really
have an impact on people's everyday
lives and allow them to live the kind of
life that they want to live</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
