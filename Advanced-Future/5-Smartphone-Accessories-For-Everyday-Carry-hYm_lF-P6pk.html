world every single one of them gets a
cold eight times a year on average as
many as 13% of colds can turn into
pneumonia which is extremely dangerous
the youngest allergic in asthmatic
children are the most at risk the main
instrument used for detecting
respiratory system disorders is the
stethoscope unfortunately at present it
can only be used by doctors and the lack
of the possibility of remote
auscultation results in telemedicine
being practically unavailable to
children this is what led to the
creation of the Stephanie a truly
revolutionary medical device the
non-contact thermometer measures the
temperature quickly precisely and
silently even when your child is asleep
the electronic stethoscope enables the
independent and precise auscultation of
children at home it is enough to apply
the device as indicated on a smartphone
screen if any alarming signals occur the
smart STEMI will immediately show it it
is as if your child was being auscultate
admire best pulmonologists the medical
history of your child recorded in sound
waves and at any moment be sent to a
doctor of your choice no more
unnecessary trips exposing your child to
stress and contact with hazardous germs
at a clinic now parents are able to
control the condition of their child's
health in their own home to observe the
progress of treatment and to monitor
with precision chronic diseases such as
asthma
steth oh me a smart way to keep your
child's health in check your examine
Stephanie analyzes the doctor makes the
call okay
so all of us on a few phone accessories
right and some of them can actually do
some really impressive things but right
now if I asked you to get one you
probably say I don't have it with me so
most of the time you end up leaning your
phone against some random object instead
of actually using that expensive tripod
that you left at home
so because there weren't any real
solutions we made our own and back in
2013 we launched our first Kickstarter
campaign for the pocket tripod a fully
adjustable stand for your iPhone that
holds your device in both portrait and
landscape without covering the school
best part is that it transforms into the
size of a couple of credit cards and
hides away in any wallet or purse until
you need it again people loved it we
raised more than our funding goal by
almost double and even Apple co-founder
Steve Wozniak the was said why didn't
someone do this before what a great idea
that I wish I thought I put one of them
in my backpack which is always with but
then a few of our very clever backers
realized something that we missed told
us I've got a case on my phone I'm not
gonna take it off every time that's just
too much work and someone else said so
what you guys some kind of Apple fanboys
you know some people Rock Angela right
back got us thinking can't make a pocket
tripod for every phone and case model
out there there's at least a million
different combinations who knows so as
soon as we ship all rewards to our two
and a half thousand backers we started
working on a universal pocket tripod
instead of limiting it to only bear
iPhones for months we studied case
designs got feedback from our backers
and tested ideas once we had a universal
opening shape we made it in a range of
sizes so that it fits as many case and
phone combinations as possible
this is the new universal pocket tripod
does it work with the Apple silicone
case perfectly how about the Galaxy Note
yep works fantastic in landscape and
halfway in portrait does it work with
every case almost unless it's gigantic
we've also created this guide that lets
you know exactly what pocket tripod you
need just by knowing what case and
device combination you have okay but
what if I like it bare but also
sometimes with protection do any two
pocket tripods nope because whenever you
swap your case or your phone you can
also get the adapters to match their new
size good to go the pocket tripods been
used and tested for the past two years
by thousands of people worldwide they
use it as their primary tripod every day
to take amazing time lapses for making
video calls do you use only camera
function with waterproof housing with
diver right mini everything is possible
diver riod mini makes your smartphone
not only shoot photos and videos but
also function as a dive computer and
compass logbook is created automatically
after diving
and you can share it with your friends
it is very simple to use first download
the diver Reuter
second pair your smartphone with mini
third assemble mini the way that suits
your waterproof housing now shall we
start diving with diver roid mini diver
roid mini offers three modes in the
water dive computer mode allows you to
see important information such as depth
NDL and compass mode can easily be
changed with the button that fits your
waterproof housing try taking some
selfies and video nothing is more
important than safety a safety warning
including safe stop will pop up on any
mode with vibration it's not as
beautiful as the underwater scenery that
you've seen bring back life to the scene
with automatic calibration it's small
but everything is possible with diver
roid mini say goodbye to all your
remotes and batteries that you
constantly need to replace QE plug the
connected device that turns your
Smartphone into a universal remote
compatible with all types of infrared
appliances TV DVD air conditioner
speakers video projector camera whatever
the make cue plug offers the possibility
to control all your daily electronic
devices in a simple manner
we thought of this innovation to make
your lives easier compatible with
Android and iOS download the Kiwi plug
app from the Play Store or the App Store
connect Kiwi plugs to your audio jack
sync appliances in one click according
to each room in your home or office then
the smartphone gathers and saves all
your remotes
once branded bearing a logo or colors of
a company QE plug becomes a promotional
tool or an innovative and original
business gift
since before the first time during the
CES at Las Vegas back in January 2016
and into the leading telecom
professionals through the Mobile World
Congress in Barcelona last February
Huey plug is going to change your
everyday life at home and at the office</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
