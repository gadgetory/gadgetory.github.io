Francisco since turn-of-the-century talk
in 1890 and I think the the modern story
of bicycle design in cities is just
starting it's tough to be a bicycle in
the city and it's tough to be a commuter
and here at mission bicycle we're
working to make clean and elegant
solutions so what we're doing now is
adding two new big features integrated
lighting and GPS tracking so the main
goal is to have this just seamlessly
integrate into the lives of the people
riding them so we are urban commuters we
ride our bikes in cities so they're
designed by urban commuters for urban
commuters we've been told by
manufacturers and engineers that some of
these things aren't possible and that's
usually an indicator that we're headed
in the right direction but we decided
we're going to do it we put our minds to
it and we just don't get by you know
when we take something on like
electronics we do it right and we do it
in an integrated way that doesn't you
know doesn't have extra flourishes or
gimmicks or anything like that it's
there to serve a purpose we've taken the
best bicycle and we're making it better
how many GPS integrated into your bike
to me it's just peace of mind this
device has one function in mind let's
say the unthinkable happens I go to
where I last saw my bike and it's not
there panic sets in I pull out my phone
I launch the app and then a half a
second I can see exactly where my bike
is so we've always considered safety and
security to be an unsolved problem and
exciting for us to be the ones that
finally integrate you know lighting
security into the best commuter bike
available LED lighting and that's low
power and very bright and looks amazing
and can be integrated into the frame of
a bicycle and recharged that's a new
thing the way that our four lights are
crossing each other they throw is spread
outwards so you're visible from the side
and it gives you more of a presence on
the road mission bicycle our whole
philosophy is it has to be easy as to
work every time
you don't have to think about it so one
kuch turns on all the lights front and
rear we've made a highly customized
battery that you don't have to think
about you're commuting back and forth to
work you don't want to carry another
charger another thing to worry about
something to lose so we and it created a
charger into the battery itself so your
battery's low you just remove it from
the head tube charge it up using a USB
cable pop it back in we may seem like a
large bicycle manufacturing company with
you know an online division and retail
division and in our D Department really
it's a small operation and we just have
a group of people they're really
passionate about designing bikes for our
Kickstarter backers this is a very
humbling thing to have that level of
support and this is now our fourth
Kickstarter campaign every single time
we have either delivered on time or
early and so we've hopefully earned your
trust so we have a prototype built we
have ridden it all over the city we've
lost it and found it this campaign will
help us pay for the certifications
needed to get the product to the market
and with the help of Kickstarter backers
we will be able to start delivering
bikes illuminated trackable traceable
GPS brilliant bikes this summer I want
people to say that's beautiful that
makes sense
what really good design does is it
blends in over time to the world around
it and then affects the world around it
we want to carry that forward and these
things are built to last a lifetime
what if all cars had a single light in
the center strange then why do we only
have one light in front of our bicycles
introducing luma a 360 degrees light
system that shows your true width while
cycling it combines all the lights
needed on your bikes front lights rear
lights and side lights all integrated
into the bicycles wrist three different
lights at each end of your handlebars
never worry again about leaving your
lights home or having them stolen the
grips feature a solid core for easy
installation and lock-on rings for
secure fastening luma meets all the
legal requirements even in countries
with strict regulations such as Denmark
or Norway though it makes you visible
luma itself is almost invisible it has a
compact elegant design that does not
interfere with the looks of your bike
the body is made of aircraft-grade
aluminum the same alloy used for
helicopters and airplanes
it's tough almost indestructible we paid
special attention to the surface finish
anodized ultra sonic cleaned and hand
brushed for a premium look finally each
set comes with built-in lithium
batteries that are easily charged
through a standard microUSB board
we love bicycles and we love to cycle we
want to have a product that is not just
good but one that advances the frontiers
of visibility and traffic safety top us
spread the word and save the world
get a luma for someone you care for
it's not just the light it's all you
need to see and be seen
we psychics are the most vulnerable
users of the rope to wheels to balance
loads ashes to protectors and we still
need to use our hands to communicate
with cars blinkers is the one thing that
was missing for cyclists will be safer
and to be a natural tire control it
starts with a regular bike light that
you know but blinkers actually packed
everything you need to be seen on the
stoop as respected by everyone else in
the world with blinkers cars will always
know when you are turning and when you
are braking
a laser projection makes it even more
visible and allows cars to understand
better what is your space and what is
their space blinkers were designed to
fit in your life it has no buttons turns
on as soon as you plug it in blinkers
also has a powerful battery and it's
very easy to recharge blinkers is the
ultimate safety solution for science
