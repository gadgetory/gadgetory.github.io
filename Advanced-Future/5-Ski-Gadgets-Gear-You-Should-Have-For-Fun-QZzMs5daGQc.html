and never miss another update we are all
fascinated by the beauty of snowy
mountain peaks however getting to enjoy
that view can be quite tricky and even
dangerous every step should be
considered snowshoes have been used for
centuries to get us around in areas with
deep snow however they aren't widely
used today as winter equipment since
they are inconvenient to carry and take
up a lot of space nevertheless they are
extremely useful in various situations
in this is how the idea of small foot
was born provide the cousins a better
essences data litmus more food permit
another famous neighborhood small foot a
Adaro denote news data as a report on a
test Ronald Corazon de marchi sisters in
sport or four years ago while hiking
Peter got stuck in the deep snow and
could not get out
he wished she had something he could
take out of his backpack to save him but
he wasn't equipped well enough when
searching for gear to fit his needs he
was surprised to find that there is
nothing suitable on the market that's
when the concept of compact snow
sheeta's came to his mind the company's
sled dogs had come up with a whole new
mountain sport entirely give flexible
ski boots steel edges and you've got
yourself a pair of snow skates
especially for newcomers to alpine
sports they apparently guarantee
fantastic fun and freedom of movement in
the snow
the first product we're developing is a
skiing device to help people ski longer
ski stronger and stay connected to the
snow for many people skiing is more than
a pastime it's a passion and there's
people who are having their experiences
cut short because of what their bodies
will allow them to do that's where we
come in the device has two main parts
the first part is a backpack just like
any normal backpack and the second is a
part that goes on your legs
you connect it to your boot strap to
your thigh turn it on and you're ready
to go from there as you're skiing it
feels like skiing it's gonna sense what
you're doing is you're going down the
snow and respond accordingly it's
essentially like intelligent shock
absorbers for your legs it's gonna see
that you're turning or that you're going
straight down a hill and then attempt to
mimic what your quads are already doing
and take load off your legs so a great
thing about these devices is you turn
them on and you essentially forget it it
disappears on your leg you can pick the
lines that you want to take you can hit
turns harder you can catch that edge it
feels like you're doing what you want to
do and the device is just there to help
we're building a device to help you push
your barriers and for each person that's
different for a high-performance skier
that means one thing you may after
injury want to get back out on the
slopes sooner you might want to ski
longer for practice sessions for a
casual skier they would use a device
like this to be able to spend more time
out on the snow and not have the pain
associated with Armenia's or fatigue be
the thing that keeps them off for the
aging skiers or honestly ski the way
they did five years before not let
fatigue or knee pain
thing that pulls them off the slopes in
the end the goal is to keep you in
control and feeling like you're
connected with the smell and experience
skiing like you haven't reported at Rome
were a mobility company our goal is to
make people go more do more see more
skiing is awesome and the better you are
the more fun you have introducing carve
the world's first real time ski wearable
carve is your digital ski coach that
puts world-class ski instruction in your
ears
we've all had skiing lessons before and
they're great but you can't have a coach
with you every time you ski carve fits
into any ski boot and is always with you
analyzing your every move by seamlessly
integrating a thin pressure and motion
sensing insert powered by a tracker with
lessons you have to wait until the end
of the run to hear how you did carve
speaks to you as you ski to correct your
form in real time welcome to your
advanced ski training lesson 5
keep your weight forward
good job
skiing drills can be repetitive and
boring carve transforms drills into
exciting and rewarding games
Corp has trick recognition to track your
time in the park get detailed stuff from
your session with takeoff and landing
analysis to check if you're balanced
when you should be and aren't lending
too hard
if you're a racing scare you can get a
complete data record to take the
guesswork out of training know what
makes you faster and set targets to
improve
and for all levels of skier carved
tracks your staffs over time so you'll
really be able to see the difference
carve is made to your skiing it then
lets you share your progress of friends
and see how you compare
