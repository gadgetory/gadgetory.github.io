they're too heavy too cumbersome too
bulky and not designed for those people
who really want to ride their bikes Auto
lock is an all-new cinch lock for both
cyclists and outdoor enthusiasts who
value their gear and need a small safe
and lightweight solution their lifestyle
it's far more secure than a cable lock
and much lighter than a you lock in your
saddlebag in your pocket or anywhere on
your bike Auto lock is so lightweight
you won't even know you were carrying it
Auto lock is very secure because of an
engineered design that uses multiple
layers of high temper 18 millimeter wide
stainless steel bands coated and scratch
resistant santoprene and reinforced with
kevlar making it extremely cut resistant
conventional theft tools like wire or
bolt cutters alone are just not enough
to cut the auto lock auto lock also has
more uses beyond bicycles but for
example ski and snow tools and sheds
camping gear water sports and more the
possibilities with Auto lock are
limitless
the auto lock weighs under 115 grams and
coils to under three inches in diameter
making it easy to pack and store on the
bike in pockets backpacks purses or
jerseys in comparison you locks or
chains are 10 to 20 times heavier than
auto lock and much more difficult to
carry the cinching function keeps your
gear locked tight we've designed auto
lock with three resettable combination
wheels and a durable aluminum head the
auto lock comes in multiple colors and
is available in different lengths
starting with the all-around 30 inch
version which offers the most
versatility auto lock also comes in a
super compact 18 inch pro ride version
and a 60 inch extended version the 18
inch pro ride version is intended for
cyclists on the go offering the fastest
coil times the lightest weight the most
bike storage options and just enough
length to cinch your bike up to any
polar post up to 5 inches in diameter in
seconds the auto lock is both designed
and manufactured in the USA now there is
simply no reason not to carry a lock
what if all cars had a single light in
the center strange then why do we only
have one light in front of our bicycle
introducing luma a 360 degrees light
system that shows your true width while
cycling it combines all the lights
needed on your bike front lights rear
lights and side lights all integrated
into the bicycles grips three different
lights at each end of your handlebar
never worry again about leaving your
lights home or having them stolen the
grips feature a solid core for easy
installation and lock-on rings for
secure fastening luma meets all the
legal requirements even in countries
with strict regulations such as Denmark
or Norway
though it makes you visible luma itself
is almost invisible it has a compact
elegant design that does not interfere
with the looks of your bike the body is
made of aircraft-grade aluminum the same
alloy used for helicopters and airplanes
it's tough almost indestructible we've
paid special attention to the surface
finish anodized ultra sonic cleaned and
hand brushed for a premium look finally
each set comes with built-in lithium
batteries that are easily charged
through a standard microUSB port
we love bicycles and we love to cycle we
want to have a product that is not just
good but one that advances the frontiers
of visibility and traffic safety help us
spread the word and save the world
get a luma for someone you care for it's
not just the light it's all you need to
see and be
when we created the world's most
powerful indoor trainer the industry
called it disruptive we just called it
long overdue
you see no one had taken advantage of
the awesome power of the smartphone to
make indoor trainers better so we did
and now we're doing the same thing with
the GPS bike computer
meet element let's face it setting up
most by computers sucks it's like trying
to send a text from an old flip phone
there's a better way we all know and the
good news is you already own element
uses the power of your smart phone to
pick the pain out of the typical set up
process so all you have to do is
download an app scan a code and you're
off and running set up different workout
pages connect to your favorite cycling
platforms pair other devices go nuts if
you use apps you already know how to do
this thing so let's move on to the ride
element is all about simplicity you'll
notice this the minute you powered up
what's with the grayscale display right
we admit color looks cool but not when
it's bright out and high clear
conditions you need contracts contrast
elements large 2.7 inch display can
deliver and any lighting conditions now
let's talk about how the data is
presented whether you're navigating
through traffic or mocking down an open
road your eyes should be focused on
what's ahead
not on trying to read your display so we
designed some really cool ways to make
it easy for element that provides you
with the info you need and just a glance
like the ability to zoom in and out of
data fields want to focus on power boom
power and cadence boom boom the whole
enchilada boom boom and boom or what
about an entirely new way to communicate
with your by computer like programmable
LED indicators that let you know when
your heart rate speed and power are
above or below your averages element can
even alert you when someone's trying to
reach you or give you a heads up what
you need to turn which brings us to
navigation and the whole GPS thing
because element is Wireless it's always
syncing acquiring and pushing data
around and a lot of this data happens to
be routes local routes distant routes
virtual routes all of which you can load
and share without ever needing to plug
in
people want to relive a route pull it
from your ride history what about that
kom you posted on strong element can tap
pass rides and post new ones back to
straw but when you crush them yeah you
can even take outdoor rides indoors when
it gets too nasty out oh you know we
were going there
of course element gives you full control
over kicker when you need to bring the
suffering inside with the ability to
control resistance with levels ERG mode
or simulated routes you can make life as
miserable as your lactic threshold can
handle look we could go on and talk
about other features like the ability to
find friends with live tracking or
compatibility with Wahoo's complete
cycling ecosystem but we know that you
know that this is a product video of
course we're gonna hide belly but we
also know some chain gang arisen his
basement right now unboxing this thing
he's going to post something YouTube
there will be lights there will be hates
what there won't be though is a
feature-rich GPS by computer on the
market that is as powerfully simple as
element bicycles are having a great
comeback that seems to excite everyone
consumers and seefs alike last year more
than 3 million bikes were stolen all
across Europe and the numbers of thefts
are rising by about 8 percent each year
but the success rate in solving these
cases is only between 2 and 6 percent I
am one of the founders of Troya life
tracking systems in the modern world we
are surrounded by technology everywhere
and we found a way to use this
technology to make this world a safer
place but how to protect the bicycle our
state of the art tracking device which
was developed for government agencies is
the base of our draw a bike production
device a product can be tracked in over
44 countries by its owner
it's simple unrecoverable indestructible
directly wired to the authorities in the
case of emergency and offers several
amazing extras the tracker is more or
less the same as a mobile phone without
the screen which fits into a bike frame
we use a high-performance energy
management system so the battery only
needs to be charged once a season sim
and chip technology offers worldwide
coverage and improves the overall
traceability the devices water and
shockproof covers multi satellite
support for highest reliability 1,024
big transmission ensures a high security
level all these features can be
controlled in one simple and mobile
optimized user interface throw a bike is
incredibly simple to use you buy the
device you download to throw a bike and
snap a picture of the QR code to pair
your device with the app remove the seat
put to throw a bike tracker in your bike
frame and lock the device with your app
TRAI bike even allows you to track your
children on the way to school but gives
you the possibility to see where your
loved ones currently are you can also
manage several bikes with one app in
order to use detroy a bike device with
another bike just unlock it put it into
the new bike and lock it again

the your serial number give it a name

bike unattended only for a moment simply
activate the motion sensor and you will
get an alert whenever your bike is being
moved trail bike is the only real
