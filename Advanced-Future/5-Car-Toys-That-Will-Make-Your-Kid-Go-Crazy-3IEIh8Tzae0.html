brace yourself for a new category of
large-scale RC vehicle
because the line between RC and
motorsport is about to be blurred
introducing the world's first motorsport
fifth scale RC
the all-new vector 5 from Kraken RC
experience class 1500 unlimited bunky
like never before
the world of large-scale RC has been
redefined forever
hey guys I'm here to talk to you today
about the new Air Hogs or remote-control
thunder tracks this is an awesome one
it's an outdoor all-terrain RC vehicle
that drives over any surface
snow mud and with the push of a button
even water
alright let's quickly go through the
contents of each box so you know exactly
what you're gonna get your package
should contain a 1 Thunder Trax
one remote control one charging cable
and one set of instructions let's dive
in a little deeper so I can show you why
I love the new Air Hogs RC Thunder
tracks ok the first reason I love the
Thunder tracks is that it can drive over
any surface
this really is an all-terrain vehicle
that is because of the treads these
things are large they're durable and of
shape to provide traction over any
surface even in water yep push that
button and the Thunder tracks transforms
into aquatic mode and just keeps on
going
let me give you a few quick tips that
have helped me get the most out of my
journeys first keep in mind that your
Thunder tracks can only transform into
an out of aquatic mode while it's in the
water so what you're going to want to do
is pick up a bit of momentum on land so
you can launch out into the water and
then transform and wait until you're
back on solid ground to transform back
another thing you'll want to keep in
mind is that the Thunder tracks has a
shorter RC range while it's in the water
so don't get too far from shore the last
thing I'll say is this that even though
the Thunder tracks can easily handle any
terrain make sure you check those treads
after driving over surfaces like gravel
or rocks the smaller objects can get
caught in there and that's gonna slow
down your performance thanks for tuning
in today guys I am really excited about
the Thunder tracks and this is a vehicle
that will really take you anywhere we
challenged these kids to see who could
build the Meccano ten-in-one model the
fastest through metal real tools oh they
have to say is challenge accepted ok
good
Wow that has to be a record you can
build 10 vehicles all different vehicles
in one packet is fun Makana building is
just the beginning
