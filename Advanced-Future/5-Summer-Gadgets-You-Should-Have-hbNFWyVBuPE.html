don't remember exactly what it was but I
know it was actually my father mark who
introduced it to me I was playing
volleyball up in Santa Barbara one day
and a bunch of kids from Westmont
College about four and a half five years
ago came down and had a spike ball deck
I was watching and playing like that
looks really fun and I like volleyball
he loves any type of you know
competitive game with it and I'm
watching the people that have lost the
last round having a great rally right
here it looks fun and they're having a
great time
my first tournament was actually in
Fresno then I ended up getting third
beat a guy and a girl to get into that
third place game and locked the veteran
the end result is the ruffle puffy and
it's the world's most advanced portable
heated blanket the puppy is a
battery-powered heated blankets that you
don't plug into an outlet a one that you
can actually plug in to it warms you in
seconds charges your devices and can be
used as a lantern or flashlight in three
different lighting modes it's also the
first Kickstarter project that combines
three different technologies that were
all complete through crowdfunding
it's the perfect companion for travel
comfort and powering your life on-the-go
the blanket warms up in low medium and
high heat settings with a series of
clicks so you can adjust to a
temperature that suits your needs the
battery can be fully recharged in 90
minutes and can charge your mobile
device up to four times he can run for
10 straight hours on a low heat setting
six hours on medium heat and four hours
on high heat if you just want to use it
as a lantern and elapsed for over 15
hours if you're at home and don't want
to run the battery the blanket can also
be plugged directly into an outlet and
stay on forever the puppy features a
water-resistant shell and is available
in both synthetic and natural downes
bill both versions pack down into a
travel ready sub stacks that are
completely machine washable

or fit lightweight portable refillable
by a hand pump and gives you up to ten
minutes underwater the Scorpius a TV and
for ever
however if you are not a training scuba
diver there are restrictions on use and
risks to be aware of in this news of the
skorca can be dangerous whilst
decompression sickness more commonly
known as the bank is as much of their
risk because of the depth and time
restrictions of such a small cylinder
pulmonary damage chant pension injury is
nevertheless the risk if the user holds
their breath during the fender then too
quickly the score could only intended
for shallow water use we recommend that
scuba train users not use the skorca
below 10 metres and the nonce view
betraying users stay above 3 metres and
deaths as mentioned above and above
