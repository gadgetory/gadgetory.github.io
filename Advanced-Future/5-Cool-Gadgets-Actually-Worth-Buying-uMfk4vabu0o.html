of innovation here at Bissell if this
will we know pets and the message they
make around the home and when it's time
to bathe them the messes they get even
bigger we focus on cleaning up the
messes that Life brings including the
pet messes now we're bringing these
insights to the dog bathing process the
Bissell bark that truly is the next
generation of bathing your dog a faster
easier and less messy way this will
strengths are really around
understanding the consumer in the needs
of the consumer especially the pet
parent when we know pets we know how
pets interact with the household and the
message that they make in a home we
realized that people are very frustrated
with the bathing process and we took a
look at that and we thought well if
we're cleaning up after the dogs when
they come into the house and they leave
spots and stains in the carpet and
upholstery and we're never really
addressing the animal itself that is
dirty we started taking a look at the
technology and the knowledge we had of
both pets and cleaning and we found this
great new idea and its new concept about
saving your animals anywhere in your
home so marrying the insights that we
have around the consumer experience and
around the consumer with the engineering
now it is the perfect match as we know
pet you know pet parents we know message
we know dirt bark bath is really
important because it gives the consumer
a new way outside of their traditional
way of bathing to actually bathe their
dog anywhere in the home that they want
whenever they want what it also allows
people to do is clean more frequently in
ten minutes I can have all three dogs
just just a slight of cleaning and the
smell goes away and everything I mean it
works great because you could actually
bathe your dog every other day if you
wanted to and it wouldn't be a chore or
wear before it was a charge of a three
dogs you can use it in your kitchen and
just within less than 10 minutes you can
wash your dog this is different because
we're actually changing the way that you
wash the animal normally you would wash
from the fur down and what we're doing
is we're feeding from the skin up that's
how we can actually use less water
because in the traditional bathtub
method of washing your dog you use about
19 gallons
water to washing 80 pound dog we use
less than 48 ounces of water because
we're much more efficient at the process
so our no burning shampoo is really
unique because it doesn't have a lot of
the harsh chemicals that other shampoos
- and it's really safe and effective on
the animal are you going to give
yourself a box it was perfect
there was no mess and that was about an
hour shorter than what it would have
taken me to give him a normal bath it
was great and he dried a lot faster yes
when I first saw the product I thought
if there was no way that this was
actually going to work on Oreo she just
got too much care it really really
worked good it's better for the
homeowner because they'll use a lot less
water better for the homeowner because
they won't have to wrestle the dog to
get them in and out of the bathtub and
really delivers on the promises supposed
to give to the pet parent which is we're
going to take care of your dog in a way
that's never been done it's easier for
you and easier for your dog please join

hi I'm dr. Jason Wirthlin founder and
head of performance development at the
Aragon the Theron is for chiropractors
physical therapists trainers and
athletes and anyone that's active
the benefits of the fair gun is it
increases blood flow decreases lactic
acid and interrupts the pain cycle in
the brain I've seen the most success
with both Aragon in athletes within
minutes loosen up their muscles and go
out and perform the way they need to
we all have our own routines what we
like to eat to how we work out and the
best addition to my routine it's been
Paragon g1 whether it's a pre-workout or
after a long trip on the road and I'm
just unwinding at home the g1 is
unmatched when it comes to recovery its
aggressive but it's not painful and I
still as soon as when I use it or dr.
Jason used it on me I mean it's it's
immediate results and it's easy to use
it's not heavy it's lightweight you can
travel with it so I like that they're
going a lot better
the g1 is absolutely the real did I used
on my quads Cass hip flexor I use it
everywhere it helps create blood flow
where you have knots or scar tissue the
ther gun is better than anything
currently in the market because it's
lightweight easy to use battery-operated
handheld mobile and go anywhere with you
with a really strong amplitude which is
the distance the head travels the
feedback on this Aragon has been
unanimously positive period spray
nozzles are leaky and plastic spray guns
need replacing season after season
introducing turbo shot the last nozzle
you'll ever need to buy it's a little
player that's big on features this ultra
durable solid brass spray nozzle is
small but that's an incredibly powerful
punch it can blasts a stream of water
more than 40 feet using 40% less water
than other sprayers
the compact turbo shot is designed with
precision ball bearings for infinite
adjustment that's fast and easy to
control use the power stream for
blasting away dirt grime and brake dust
from your tires and rims and look it can
topple this line of heavy bricks from a
distance of 10 feet then even knock over
this giant brick give it a twist and
turbo shot produces a misting spray that
gently soaks your delicate flowers and
Trump's twist again for a pinpoint
stream so accurate it shoots right
through the center of this ring while
other nozzles spray water everywhere now
what are these potted plants without
wasting a single drop the secret is the
no leak ask if it fills the entire
nozzle Plus amazing try baring control
for maximum power and precision now
second floor windows are quick and easy
to clean or blast dirt out of your
concrete faster than ever before
effortlessly clean out your pickup bed
or get the gunk out of gutters in second
this is so easy to adjust it works great
on my patio furniture and makes any
cleanup a breeze and look at this the
old brass construction is so tough you
can run over it with a truck and it
still works perfectly
other sprayers waste water and robbed
you of the power you need but you can
get turbo shot today for only $10 and
it's guaranteed to be the most durable
leak free sprayer you'll ever own or get
your money back I came up with
different design way different than the
traditional gas can it's called a sure
can't so instead of having to pour the
gasoline like all the other cans do the
sure can dispense this fuel out of the
bottom of the camp so you rotate a spout
down to push down on a thumb trigger
which opens the vent and a valve at the
same time and dispenses fuel out of the
bottom of the can so you don't have to
stand on your head any longer you can
see what your filling up
there's no plugging and it just
eliminates all the spillage that's
normally associated with the traditional
gasket now Sir Ken also has a six layer
design so in the middle of the Macan
there's a barrier layer that that keeps
the vapors from permeating through the
sidewall of the camp so it keeps the
emissions from going into the
environment and we call it the greenest
red cam I think there's three main
things that we're trying to accomplish
with this sure can want it to be safer
number one we want it to be greener so
it's better for the environment and we
want it to be the easiest can use sure
can is safe and easy to use virtually
eliminating the risk of spillage it
sticks layer design keeps vapors from
escaping and polluting the air in fact
sure cam meets and exceeds strict EPA
guidelines making it the greenest red
can on the market here at sure can we
offer three different kinds of
containers gas diesel and kerosene when
we design to develop this can we did an
amount of motive technology so it has
six different layers to meet the EPA and
carb testing some of the testing that we
do include drop testing and burst
testing also -40 testing so freezer
freezer testing putting in the
conditions of the gas cannon in the
worst possible conditions and making
sure that it's durable no matter what
kind of conditions that it sees anybody
who has any kind of power equipment it
uses fuel of any type gas be full of
kerosene should be using a shuriken it
puts the control of whatever fuel type
you're using in your hands you save
money because you're not still in that
precious fuel you purchase there's no
leakage there's no spillage there's no
overfilling anymore
you're not harming the environment you
have complete control with the trigger
mechanism and the spout down at the
bottom of the can this these can be used
by far
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
