the freedom of knowledge the freedom
share freedom to dream freedom of
movement now it fits with linky
mobility is freedom with linking strong
patented folding mechanism its freedom
in your bag
it's a last mile mobility solution that
means no more traffic no more bus
timetables no more foolish
linkie is the first foldable electric
skateboard the team behind Winky wants
to improve the way we experience cities
wherever we were in the world we found
ourselves wanting a mode of
transportation that is eco sustainable
easy to carry around and really fun to
ride we've applied our technical
engineering and sales backgrounds to
fill a gap in the market nothing out
there is truly portable is that's why we
made Winky to fit in a bag
we are ready to go into production but
we need a minimum number of orders to
make this possible your support right
now we let's keep costs down so we can
guarantee a great level of service and a
truly exciting electric longer
so marble is a dedicated team of
engineers and designers who are really
passionate about the project and
passionate about the idea of short-range
transportation and sustainable
transportation whether it's community to
work getting into the subway or bus
stops running errands or try to just get
across the Tod campus short trips and
urban travel have always been trusted in
a car we have to deal with traffic
parking and of course rising fuel car on
a bicycle we worked up a sweat
and then have to find safe place to lock
it up we felt there had to be a better
way to handle these short trips our goal
at Marvel was to create the lightest
electric vehicle in the world but also
with an amazing user experience we have
spent the last two years dedicated to
crafting and refining our marble
electric skateboard the lightest
electric skateboard in the world with an
amazing team modern technology and
support from our community we built a
marble board to be simple to use
efficient and of course exhilarating to
ride the marble electro skateboard is
the lightest electric skateboard in the
world it weighs only nine point nine
pounds with one full charge the board
goes ten mile
that's not ten testing the lab mile it's
real-world conditions most of our test
riders are actually getting over ten
miles per charge the question we get
most is how fast does it go well it is
one of the fastest electric skateboard
it has over 2,000 watts of power and
will hit speeds of up to 20 miles an
hour it can actually hit 20 miles an
hour even going uphill we realize that
20 miles an hour is pretty quick so we
have designed the board settings the
completely customizable through a
smartphone app our app that we call the
dashboard lets you set exactly what you
want your top speed to be and determine
the level of acceleration the best suits
your right side this allows you to
perfectly tuned the board to your needs
if you want you can even directly
control the throttle of the board from
our dashboard app which will allow you
to leave the wireless handheld
controller at home we were able to
achieve all of this by using
state-of-the-art carbon fiber and Kevlar
composite
the deck design that completely encases
and protects every bit of the
electronics as well as the battery cells
on top of that we're using incredibly
efficient three-phase AC motors battery
technology very similar to what you
would find in Tesla Model S our custom
electronics are being manufactured for
us right here in the United States and
finally everything is assembled tested
fully controlled and shipped from our
facility here in Tampa Florida so why
are we on Kickstarter it's because we
need one more thing and that's your help
for trying to raise ninety thousand
dollars in fundraising and that money
goes towards the first production run of
the marble board as well as executing
our contracts with our suppliers and our
component manufacturers and producing
the molds and tooling we need for the
composite deck but we can't do it alone
so please help and back marble today
hello let me go go my name is peter
Treadway and I am CTO and co-founder at
Acton accident is a company that designs
and manufactures personal transportation
we are introducing a longboard the likes
of which the world has never seen
carbon fiber pressure cast aluminum
extruded aluminum fancy cuts we're using
four hot motors all wheel drive people
all wheel drive the one that will get
you up most of the steepest hills in
America and around the world
but wait there's more if you're looking
for something a little more affordable
we got you we have two more models what
we call the blink s and the blink s -
it's a different construction than the
Quattro it's made of wood but it has an
aluminum extrusion along the bottom and
aluminum plate on top to kind of
sandwich the batteries inside of the
deck so there's actually a hole that
goes clear through it the S 2 version of
this board is a little bit longer than
the end and that's because it has the
extra motor it goes a little faster and
just needs to be a little longer for
stability
so you get to choose from three boards
you get the cuatro or the blink guess or
the blink X here
now we're releasing three products at
the same time here so of course this is
why we're on IndieGoGo but we have
finished the development on these and we
have of course factory minimums that we
need to meet and that's why we're here
and that's why we need your help help us
out and get yourself onto an action
board and glide uphill into the future
of personal transportation thank you hi
my name is Jason Potter I'm based in
South Australia I'm the founder of a
nourishing boards comm I'm also the
owner of one of the largest online
forums for electric skateboard builders
just recently I released the Raptor 2
this will be the most powerful
direct-drive electric skateboard
available on the market we were blown
away by the success of the Raptor to
launch within the first hour all of the
hottest deals were gone this was an
amazing result and we're very thankful
to all the people who've baptists so let
me tell you a little bit more about a
product the Raptor 2 has a very large
replaceable battery it's triple the size
of most of our competitors
it also comes standard with two powerful
direct drive motors we also have a
patent-pending technology that keeps
them cool when you want to push the
limits the deck is a carbon fiber and
maple composite for a natural but
responsive ride at high speeds it also
has dual cnc'd grab handles so what I
there after to the Raptor 2 is the most
powerful direct-drive electric
skateboard on the market more torque at
the wheels than any of the competition
with direct driver motors there are no
longer any bells to create a bottleneck
you get the power to the ground where
you need it and when you need it the
Raptor 2 comes with 90 millimeter wheels
as standard they are made from premium
urethane made in America we have
developed an innovative patent-pending
technology called static or completely
modular architecture so you can do easy
repairs and upgrade as simple as that
the entire battery compartment can be
removed and easily install
other day will be releasing different
decks shape next year can easily take
your system across and get the ride you
like if you don't like our shake just
make your own deck our battery is
removable and upgradable will also
release the schematics so you can easily
build your own battery at home when the
latest technology comes out you can make
it compatible with your aptitude all of
the electronics are modular and easy to
replace so you can upgrade parts without
any knowledge the Raptor 2 uses a very
compact handpiece the Nano X handpiece
has a simple switch choice from beginner
to advanced you've got kids or
experienced riders you just flick that
and there's no worries so now you know
the details it's time to pledge your
support and lay down your cash we thank
you in advance we couldn't do this
without you an ocean is built on the
community spirit and we're happy to
answer all your questions so lay them
down in the comments below and we look
forward to building the most amazing
electric skateboard and delivering it to
you in May 2017 see you later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
