commercial truck tires the worn-out tire
is called a casing this is a
cross-section that steel reinforcement
rod called the bead won't be replaced
but most of the rubber around it will be
along with most of the tread area the
steel belts underneath the treads those
dots will remain they begin the removing
process by thoroughly inspecting the
casing to determine whether it's indeed
salvageable they consider its age
whether it's had repairs they examined
the steel components to make sure they
haven't rusted

actuated suction pads keep a firm hold
of the panel and there are three sizes
supplied with the puller 75r elevator
100 and 125 millimeter it also has a 90
millimeter hook attachment - all of this
is supplied in a tough molded case the
sealy re 101 air suction dent puller
quick clean and simple

reconfigurable wheel track wheels that
reconfigure two triangular tracks to
instantly optimize mobility over
different types of terrain our WTS can
change from wheel to track and back
again within two seconds while the
vehicle is in motion
wheels permit fast travel on hard
surfaces while tracks perform better on
soft surfaces for instant improvements
to tactical mobility and maneuverability
on diverse terrains Pratt and Millers
multimode extreme travel suspension
system aims to enable high speed travel
over rough terrain while keeping the
vehicle upright and minimising occupant
discomfort the vehicle demonstrator
incorporates standard military 20-inch
wheels advanced short travel suspension
of four to six inches and a novel high
travel suspension that extends up to six
feet 42 inches upward and 30 inches
downward the demonstration showed off
its ability to tackle steep slopes and
grades by actively and independently
adjusting the hydraulic suspension on
each wheel of the vehicle
the bush winch will transform your
outback driving experience it's simple
effective and cost-efficient the
innovative Bush winch can be fitted to
most vehicles both four-wheel drive
two-wheel drive old and new it's light
powerful and easy to use there's no need
for expensive bull bars batteries cables
or tow hitches it's much safer because
there are no heavy dangerous cables it
comes in a small kit with everything you
need ready for just when you need so
there's no need to fear ever being
caught in an impassable bog the bush
winch relies on the vehicles own power
to get it out of trouble the winch
attaches to the vehicle's rim by
specially designed wheel nuts they come
with the kit and permanently replace the
manufacturers wheel nuts the winch
simply slots on and off and no tools or
fastening are required they come as a
pair one for each side of the vehicle
they use lightweight high-tech
custom-designed rope which runs from the
winch to the anchor points dual anchor
points often many advantages to points
spread the load provide more options in
tricky situations making the winch
extremely versatile in almost any
conditions once the winch is attached
you just hop back in the vehicle put it
in gear and drive out if you know you
are heading into a tricky situation
you can attach the winches beforehand
and save yourself putting the winches on
in a bog it is also highly effective on
slippery surfaces like snow ice and
loose gravel the front wheels can be
used just as easily as the back the
system is the same attach the winches
run out the ropes to the anchor points
and off you go
the choice is yours it's better more
powerful cheaper and more effective than
any existing winch system on the market
it's so revolutionary and so simple
you'll wonder why it was never available
before
