Porter cabled 20 volt max finishing
tools the power you need and the price
you want my name is Benny product
developer and founder of the EB Tool
Company we use tools to make tools me
and my father spent seven years
developing a quick gripper uses patented
technology to convert pulling force into
gripping force anytime you get a nail or
a staple that needs to come out it's
always a paint hammer uses a
conventional cloth a lot of nail much
like the cat's paw it's on the back of
the quick Ripper basically coming around
the head and then pulling the nail out
that way the quick Ripper it's got that
cat's paw but it's also got these jaws
it'll pull just about anything you can
get in those be it screws staples nails
whatever you actually get a lot more
leverage with a quick Ripper more force
up top
more of it is translated into pulling
force because of the way it's designed
so as you're pulling it out it's
gripping harder and harder and harder
the harder you pull the harder it grips
and it makes just about anything come
out staples are pain to get out with a
conventional hammer because it can only
grab one side at a time the quick
rippers wide jaws can grab both sides of
the staple at once pulling the whole
thing out and one smooth
no matter where it's at nothing else
pulls the nail in the corner out but the
quick Ripper does the jaws will pull out
what conventional forks won't ever come
close to because it can actually get
right into a corner and hold those nails
screws and staples out things like long
nails right now conventional hammer
can't get a nail past a certain point
the quick Ripper allows you to take a
second bite at that nail and pull it all
the way through pretty much no matter
how long the nail is you can get it out
with the quick Ripper
it doesn't matter if the nail is mangled
if it's headless in fact it's got enough
gripping force that it can actually grab
the pointed end of the nail pull it
right through a board it doesn't matter
if the head is there or not the quick
rubber helps save you money in several
different ways it replaces a lot of
tools that you wouldn't normally have to
carry around because like locking pliers
a large crowbar a hammer it replaces
several tools at once so you don't have
to hunt for another tool when the one
you have won't do the job because the
quicker if it does Amal it can actually
help you repurpose wood you can take old
boards off of a deck pull all the nails
out no matter how embedded that head is
you just grab the whole thing pull it
through in one fluid motion reuse all
those boards and works great for trim
because trim always uses those little
tiny Brad's that are pain to get out
because you can't pound them through
where they bend but we can just grab
them from the back side pull them right
through and you can reuse that trim it
saves everybody time and money no matter
what their project the quick Ripper was
designed to be used by everybody from
professionals down to your home hobbyist
who's just got a small project that they
need to do the quick Ripper is great for
everyone from the professional
construction worker down to your home
hobbyist who just has a project here and
there makes a great gift and it'll make
every job that much easier
