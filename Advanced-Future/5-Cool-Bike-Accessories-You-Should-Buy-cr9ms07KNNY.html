friends and I get down to work and
develop mosquito mosquito as a precision
watch for bike lovers that combines the
best of all worlds a classic design
chronograph speedometer and much more
smart functions and all of that packed
into a beautiful watch Swiss made of
course
after three years of development and
planning the prototype of mosquito is
finally finished with a simple push of a
button you can switch from the time mode
which displays the current time to the
speed mode in the speed mode the second
hand indicates the current speed in real
time
the minute hand shows the total distance
covered in kilometers or miles the hour
hand maintains its function and displays
the current time and there's actually
one more nice thing in the speed mode
the small indicator that shows the date
in the time mode now displays the
average speed
apart from the time and speed mode the
mosquito watch has a third mode the
chrono mode like the other modes the
chrono mode can easily be activated by
the push of a button in the chrono mode
the hands of the watch indicate the
travel time in hours minutes and seconds

your smartphone you can choose if you
want to receive notifications for texts
