alright guys as you can see there's
something in my bottom bracket here that
isn't usually there so I thought I'd do
a quick video showing you a multi-tool
that's from Italy that turned up on my
door that I thought you guys should
check out that feels pretty cool and I
think a lot of riders are gonna dig so
let's check this thing out
so this is the all-in multi-tool I'm
gonna go ahead and take it out of the
frame here to show you what it is there
you go so you can kind of see it there
so that is the all-in multi-tool out of
the bike hiding on you thought it was
just a black cap II put it back gone so
in the tool we have a three four five
and six ml allen key as well as a t25
torx and a Phillips screwdriver all of
which are magnetized into the body of it
so they can't fall out they can't go
anywhere and you all you do is take it
out turn that sideways put it in and
you're good to go if we take a look at
the top of the tool here there's four
holes these are designed for putting in
replacement chain links on the trail or
at least that's what their website
claims I don't actually have one to try
out but I would assume based on how
magnetic everything else is on the tool
that they would hold on for dear life
quite well the company makes a couple
bold claims as to why you should buy
their tool you know the main one to me
that sticks out versus Italian
craftsmanship and yada yada yada you're
never gonna forget your multi-tool it's
always going to be attached to your bike
via that magnet so you're not you know
if you're just going out with a water
bottle on the on the bike and you go oh

I need to do something and you just
wanted to go for a quick half hour or an
hour or whatever well this is going to
be in your bottom bracket taking up dead
space to be honest with you and having
the spot to put those quick links pretty
cool
as well just a you know kind of give
yourself that SWAT like level of
advantage out on the trail you know
that a lot of people are talking about
with this tool is how come it doesn't
have a chain break on it
well to me if I want to use this tool
it's gonna be something where it's gonna
be a quick repair on the trail you know
tighten up the stem tighten up a seat
post whatever that is and it's gonna get
you going nice and fast if I bust a
chain I think that you know I'm gonna
have the time to go into my pack dig out
whatever I need to to make that change
on the trail so this isn't designed for
those heavy level repairs it's just
designed for those quick easy on-the-go
repairs so you don't even have to dig
into your pack or conversely carry one
so like I said it's stored in the bottom
bracket so it fits a lot of the race
face Shimano and scram cranks you
literally once you put away your used
tool you literally just put it in into
the hole that's what she said I know but
look at the level of magnetism it has
here boom
and that's hard to get out to that's
that's in there real good
so yeah exciting to try this out and
check them out online
all-in-one multi-tool we are introducing
here we call it radius f1 it's a front
bicycle light and actually it's a smart
front bicycle light one interesting and
cool feature is the magnet charger we
did add to the system it is really easy
to attach and detach the magnet clip
from the lamb besides this it's really
100% water and dust proof
yes it is I know when I start with the
project you know I look at the needs of
the product and what heat the product
has to fulfill it's so true I think that
the form usually follows the function
another feature is our click turn lock
system with a simple 90 degree turn you
can attach or detach the lamp from your
bike
but we think a big enhancement is a
smart light output function I think
that's the biggest feature because it's
a safety feature by constantly measuring
the writing speed through and good and
gyroscopes Center we are capable to
adjust the light output according to
your writing speed if you drive faster
you got more light on the street and if
you drive slower you have less light on
the street when you take a curve the LEM
starts flashing to warn income traffic
if you come to a red light and have to
stop the LEM also starts flashing to
warn other people on the street when it
comes to battery life we did another
smart feature into our product the stop
function means you stop riding your bike
the lens they turn off and you prep your
bike to continue riding the light live
on again maybe you get the piece of
extra energy out of your every light you
need to get home safely
it had put some other cool and unique
features in our product one of it is
Bluetooth remote control which is
mounted on the handlebar right next to
your hand and you can change the light
mode of the lamp without releasing your
hand from the handlebar which we think
really adds to the safety of public
traffic with the radius f1 we are at the
stage now where we are in the final
process for designing and tooling so in
this stage we decided to start
crowdfunding to get as much as possible
feedback from our potential customer and
probably to add their valuable idea and
suggestions into our product before we
really kickoff the product to the market</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
