for we developed the smart changing pad
to make it easy to track your baby's
weight feedings diaper changes all the
information syncs to your phone so you
can see how your baby is growing tell
how much your baby nurses during a
feeding and keep track of how much your
baby's sleeping I was really anxious
about whether I was making enough milk
but after using the smart changing pad
it showed me that I was actually
producing more milk nursing than I was
pumping I was so relieved
checking my baby's weight as part of our
regular routine gives me comfort that my
baby's okay since my babies were born I
tracked pretty much everything diaper
changes how long they slept how much
they ate and what's great about the
hatch baby app is it keeps it all in one
place I just went back to work and I was
really worried about the transition but
then when I got a notification at work
it made me feel connected to him again
you'll know your baby's growing you'll
know your baby's healthy
and that means more time for the good
stuff the smart changing pad from hatch
