cable it's the only wireless charger for
the iPhone 7 and 7 plus and it also
functions as a magnetic car mount yeah
it sounds great but I don't see why I
need one I already used my phone in the
car all the time and I never have any
problems
well almost never
I mean I could always just plug it in
okay yeah the cables a pain but once you
get it set up it's no big deal I'm
buying a no cable be right back
all right so I've got my new cable here
it's made up of three simple parts it's
slimmer than I thought it would be it
looks good
here goes the no cable is made of a
flexible TPU
so you can put it on and take it off as
many times as you need to and it will
still fit perfectly it charges 99% as
fast as using a cable way faster than
other wireless chargers it's magnetic
hold and auto positioning mean that your
phone is always safe and ready to use
and you can use no cable with one hand
for safe driving
you
you
smartphone cameras have become more
advanced and accessible than ever before
although everyone has the ability to
create high-quality pictures and videos
dim lighting can make this a challenge
with dim lights it's possible to take
decent photos but with videos the
technology hasn't existed until now
without proper lighting your videos will
come out grainy blurry and underexposed
that's why you need the fire pack from
surefire it's a smartphone video
illumination tool that will help you
capture high-quality pictures and videos
in low-light situations it's the most
advanced smartphone illumination tool on
the market offering a perfect beam of
light that fully fills up your camera's
frame while there are other products on
the market there's nothing quite like
the fire pack it's the only smartphone
accessory that is reliable and gives you
stunning results each and every time up
to 50 feet and slow motion it's
lightweight portable rechargeable and
attaches to the back of your phone when
used with a surefire phone case the fire
pack is so much more you can use it to
recharge your phone and use it as a
personal safety light when needed here's
some examples with and without the fire
pack and challenging lighting conditions
look at the amazing difference the fire
pack makes as you can see in these
examples you can barely see what's going
on in the dark but as soon as you turn
on the fire pack wow your entire frame
comes to life with its wide range and
powerful light output it truly can't be
matched by anything else on the market
the Sun no longer dictates when you can
film we've all been there and we know
what it's like to try filming at night
although smartphones are equipped with
lights these aren't powerful enough to
capture truly amazing content the fire
pack has multiple levels of illumination
with an output of up to 1500 lumen
that's just as powerful as a 100 watt
light bulb the light levels can be
adjusted manually with its slide switch
or remotely with a free Bluetooth app
finally you can capture the perfect
moment anytime anywhere and share with
friends immediately and although it
works remarkably at night it's also
great for indoors even when your subject
is lit from behind the high quality
images you're seeing are the direct
result of the fire pax refined
distribution of light which has been
precisely matched for what works best
with a smartphone camera sure fires
technological advancements have allowed
them to make professional quality video
lighting easily accessible to anyone and
everyone
this is motus the world's first sparked
robot cameraman that uses your phone you
wear this lightweight tag motors locator
that aims the camera adjust zoom of
focus and intelligently decide whether
to record this all happens lightning
fast at 50 times a second the tag is
loaded with smart sensors that generate
performance metrics these metrics are
fed back to the phone live where they
can be burned into the video or used as
triggers for recording or of course you
could just use these metrics that prove
definitively that you're better faster
and stronger than your mate motus uses
silent brushless motors and has a beefy
battery that doubles as a power bank and
charging is quick with type-c USB
hey I'm John Horvath and I'm the founder
of modis ever since I can remember me of
my friends I've been into action sports
and filming them
however I've recently come to the
realization that my friends make
terrible camera operators about ten
years ago action cams like the GoPro
came on the scene and this made shooting
action sports much easier
however the GoPros wide-angle lens is
optimized for shooting a point of view
99.9% a professional content is shot
from a third-person perspective when you
turn the GoPro around to film your
friend it really doesn't cut it not only
is motus the world's most advanced robot
cameraman motors also functions as your
personal coach whether you're an amateur
tennis player working on your serve or
an aspiring Pro BMX rider perfecting a
trick being able to see yourself up
close and in slow motion is the fastest
route to improvement
sweet let's see what we got oh man
definitely not enough extension I can go
higher than that too already
well let's try that one more time
sweet I think that one was it let's
check it out

wanted the footage is stored on your
phone's camera roll so editing and
sharing is a snap introducing XO juice

your phone

hard surface or solid phone case it can
be reused over and over again and
occasionally using a strip of clear tape
to remove the desk till juice card has a
twenty eight hundred million battery and
it's six millimeters thin the power

on/off switch to activate the juice card
charge the juice card and your phone
simultaneously with the included micro
USB cable the extra juice card is
