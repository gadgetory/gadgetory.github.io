require multiple watering cycles every
day with water resources becoming more

today but I know when I love to the
place where I've still living in a
middle of nowhere in the forest I've got
to piste with the normal axis because
they were so dangerous and and hard hard
to work so I started to think how to
make a better axe
years and years went by and and the
picture came into my head but it must
look like and and then I started to
think how to make more of these axes how
to make no more people happy with
distance and I have to find find a
manufacturer at the lowest you see this
far I have done this total by myself and
my wife and because I'm just a pensioner
my funds are limited and because this
has proven to be such a special in the
world but it's it's a little bit
expensive and this this is what you need
the money we must simply size the
production to make it cheaper
that is the Kickstarter for lyrics is a
smart boot splitting device it is simply
clever compared to traditional axe it
requires far less force to split the
wood and yes it's safer to use lever ax
is based on the lever mechanism and
rotational action the head is attached
from the side not the center which
alters its center of gravity we have
been testing prototypes with the people
all around the world and feedback has
been amazing people really like it and
it really works like promised our
original models already got a lot of
publicity and people made our videos
viral and even started to share their
own
the moment we are developing even better
and smarter version of lever-action our
goal is to get this product available
for everyone in anywhere but we cannot
make this happen without your help in
order to get our latest version of lever
X production ready we need to make an
investment in production tools tools
used to manufacture the new version of
lever ax head and handles are extremely
expensive but can reduce the product
cost significantly to reward you for
helping kick-start our project we offer
you lever axe with a very special price
please help us by funding and sharing
our project and be part of this
historical adventure of reinventing the
oldest tool known to mankind and let's
make it happen together the Wagner flex

the Hammerhead 4 volt rechargeable
screwdriver is kind of like the Swiss
Army knife of screwdrivers sure you can
zip in or remove a screw with ease but
you can also light an area strip and
Bend wire and detect a live circuit all
in the palm of your hand the Hammerhead
4 volt rechargeable screwdriver as a
forward reverse ring that activates with
a simple twist once activated the LED
lights turn on illuminating your work
when not in use the spindle locks and
can be used like a manual screwdriver a
circuit sensor is located at the front
of the tool press the voltage detection
button and place the sensor within one
inch of a switch outlet cord or fixture
to see if it is live a light and a
buzzer will let you know if electricity
is present an integrated wire stripper
makes short work of taking off an
insulation sleeve and wires can be bent
using the bending slot on top take the
guesswork out of any electrical project
and use a rechargeable screwdriver that
just does more
the Hammerhead 4 volt rechargeable
screwdriver
hammerhead works smarter</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
