you
hi I'm Nick founder of Luna tech and
creator of Aquabot
it was on a backpacking trip a few years
ago with some family that it came up the
idea for aqua plot we were just tired of
boiling water all the time and one of
our water bottles worked more
efficiently in the end we created a
really cool piece of gear it's got tons
of functionality it's fun to use and
it's simple just twist it on pump it up
with the cap all the way on
we've got mist and you twist the cap get
a jet this is over 25 feet take the cap
all the way off your power shower
we've got attachment points for lanyards
and carabiners it's got a variable flow
control trigger so use just the right
amount of water it works upside down or
in any direction
it's even got a stealth mode which you
figure out to use that it's also made
from bpa-free materials that are food
safe meaning we just can your water
bottle actually easy to drink from
because you don't take your lid off or
tip your head back watch the windows why
do your plants water your dog why do you
gather plant in your grill crazy camera
guy
hey the kids clean your house wash your
car wash your neighbor's car out of your
lawn
thanks for watching our kickstarter
video we've taken Aquabot as far as we
can financially we're currently building
the injection molds and have paid for
those but we don't have enough money for
inventory so please help us break in
some extra cash dig deep and back us up
a cake status we developed a minimalist
high-tech footwork designed to product
your feet during any sport you do or
could do barefoot I do kite surfing and
I have cut my feet so many times and I
had the almost destroyed holidays by
having cuts in my feet that I decided I
must do something against get ready to
take your first few steps back into your
sport while freeing your feet
my passion is kite boarding that's where
the idea originated even me the most
beautiful beaches there is always danger
lurking hidden among stand and stones
that just had to be a decent solution
without padding thick neoprene shoes on
your feet and desert warm conditions
there are many sports where you would
like to be barefoot but the risk to get
injured is too high so you don't do it
for example at both sports and martial
arts balance and equilibrium is very
important and for beach volleyball it's
important to get protected against
objects which can be hidden in the scent
but fives are for any sports you do
running ball sports water sports like
surfing trail running climbing and even
daily routines with the socks I'm not
anxious anymore of getting cut or
injured because I have confidence that
I'm protected the initial development
was made with the kevlar yarn because
that was at the time the most known
around to be resistant against abrasion
and cut as a scientist I'm always
interested in evolution n't go further
and I was searching for even more stable
young you know so we went to the
Netherlands to talk to Giovanni Hansen
who will further explain their
continuous innovation behind the world's
strongest fiber Dyneema Dyneema is 15
times stronger than steel the fiber is
also very cut resistant it has a high
very high abrasion resistance despite
all these tough properties of ghanima it
feels like a microfiber like silk on
your skin
now if you're interested in a pair of
pipes let me just show you exactly what
you're going to get each pair of fives
comes in this water-resistant pouch
which is great if your pipes are still
wet from a day at the beach and you want
to take them off want to take them with
you in a backpack without making a mess
there are many sports we would like to
be barefoot for example to have a better
balance but until now you did not take
the risk because there was too much
chance of getting injured for example by
deep cuts and now with the protection
sock you can do many sports really
barefoot regaining that natural barefoot
feeling you treat your performance with
a new sense of security and take care of
your feet more than three hundred
seventy two thousand people can be saved
from drowning this year that's why it's
our mission at Kinji to provide water
safety
hi i'm tom i got be honest i came up
with the idea of kingi after i lost a
very good friend of mine three years ago
he drowned in the lake similar to this
one and it could have been prevented
when you drive a car you put your
seatbelt on when you ride a bike you put
on your helmet but how do you protect
yourself in water you set out to make
the smallest inflatable in the world and
we came up with a convenient
non-intrusive way to provide safety to
all of those in and around water this is
Kinji affordable floatation device that
comfortably secures onto your wrist it's
fast to deploy durable and contained
within a compact design kenji helps in
case of exhaustion or heavy currents or
when this for circulation or cramps any
time you're on the water even if you're
just relaxing you'll want a Kinji for
you and a friend
we like kenji because it's small it
doesn't get your way when you're trying
to paddle out a lot of times when you're
surfing there's not a lifeguard anywhere
near so
this gives you a little bit more sense
of security Kinji can stay inflated for
over 48 hours it includes a compass as
well as a whistle for signaling help in
case of emergency having knowledge and
good judgment the first steps and water
safety but kimchi can be an important
aid when you're need it's easy and fast
deploy and it's already been great
Island residents kimchi is durable and
the co2 cartridge is replaceable so you
can reuse kimchi as many times as needed
we need your help to stop production and
fight the dangers of drowning with your
support you become an integral part of
our team of ambassadors and you'll be
the first to receive a kimchi
do it for yourself do it for your
friends surf mates fishing bodies and
your family together we can
revolutionize water safety on a global
scale
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
