conference they announce new versions of
iOS and this year was no difference and
every year when they announce it they
have this thing that they call the word
wall which is all of the features that
they couldn't include
in their big keynote announcement let's
watch that did you blink because if you
did you missed it there are so many
features in iOS 11 that there was no
time for Apple to go through them all
and there's no time for us to go through
them all right now but we are going to
go through my favorite features in iOS
11 on both the iPhone and the iPad which
is a much bigger deal let's take a look
so here's is 11 it is a standard grid of
apps like you expect but if you swipe up
the control center you see it looks
totally different you can directly
adjust things you can force touch things
to get more information and more control
what you can't do unfortunately is
directly access Wi-Fi networks by
long-pressing on that which is a real
bummer but the Apple TV remote widget is
great you can get right to it from the
lockscreen
it's way more convenient than digging
through for the app now if you swipe
down you get the new notification area
which has basically been combined with
the lockscreen you've got your widgets
over here you've got your camera over
there and if you swipe up a little bit
you'll get your earlier notifications
that you've already seen so that's all
great
but what I find annoying is you can't
swipe away notifications anymore you
have to individually force touch each
one and dismiss it or reply to it or act
on it it's pretty annoying to have to
deal with them like that so Siri is
actually gotten way better in iOS 11 and
the first thing you're going to notice
is that it sounds way more natural when
you ask it a question
what's the weather okay here's the
weather for today that sounds like a
human being actually which is pretty
impressive Siri can also translate to a
few different languages
so for example translate help my screen
is cracked how do I get it fixed into
Spanish I do that give me is better yeah
that's really useful so there's new
camera options there's new filters that
are a little bit more natural than what
we had before but my favorite thing is
when you have live photos there's new
stuff you can do here so here on this
photo of Tyler I can switch to a bounce
mode which has them swinging back and
forth which is amazing you can also set
a key photo to any moment in the live
photo if you didn't
your exact shot last but not least and
maybe most importantly the iPhone now
stores photos and videos in a new file
format that takes up less space so if
you have an iPhone without a ton of
storage this is going to be a big win
for you but don't worry when you share
them out they still get shared as
standard JPEGs and movie files so that's
most of the big stuff on the iPhone but
the really big changes are coming for
the iPad where the user interface is
completely different so I really want to
take a look at that
but you should know that some of the
things I'm going to show you in the iPad
also apply on the iPhone now the way
that you interact with apps on iOS 11 is
very very different than what you did in
iOS 10 there's all kinds of new modes
for split view and multitasking and
slide over it's kind of crazy
so let's get into it so the first thing
you'll notice on the iPad home screen is
I have this massive dock on the bottom
with almost as many apps as you could
possibly want and you can open up apps
as normal but what's new is you can
swipe up from the bottom a little bit
and get the dock back and open up
another app or if you want you can swipe
up and then drag an app out into a slide
over mode that hovers over the window or
you can do a traditional split screen
mode and what's great is you can
actually resize it on both sides and if
you really want you can even bring a
third app just hover it over the middle
here and you get a third app in a slide
over mode and you can even dismiss it
and bring it back whenever you want so
you've got a bunch of options for
getting multiple windows up on your iPad
screen now if instead of swiping a
little you swipe all the way up you get
an app switcher which is really
interesting you've got your grid of apps
over here you've got your control center
on the right but if you look closely
you'll notice that the apps are grouped
together in the split views that we set
up so here is music and tweet bot I can
swipe over and go back to this other
split view that I had saved before
basically you've got a million different
ways that you can organize all of your
app windows on the iPad and it's super
fun to play around now I have to admit I
don't think that this is quite as
intuitive as a standard window system
where you've got a mouse and a keyboard
and you move stuff around but that
wouldn't work on an iPad and I have to
get Apple credit for putting a lot of
thought into this multitasking system
because once you get used to it it
really works
now I haven't even gotten to the part
about iOS 11 that has nerds like me the
most excited it's drag and drop and
especially on the iPad it's bonkers so
let's show you some drag-and-drop stuff
now
you can do the stuff you'd expect so if
you're in a split view you can take a
link drag it over into the Notes app and
have the link populate there but where
things get really interesting is when
you want to drag multiple things so for
example in the Photos app here I can
start dragging this photo but then use
my other hand to add more photos to the
things that I'm dragging and now I've
got this object and I want to put it
somewhere and I can swipe up the dock I
can go to the home screen I can open up
a text messaging app or whatever but
where I want to put this stuff is the
all new files app which I am incredibly
excited about so I can just throw this
on my desktop and now we're just going
to show up on my Mac's desktop when they
sync over now this files app is also
awesome because in addition to the
iCloud Drive stuff which is what you'd
expect they're also going to be adding
support for Google Drive and Dropbox
that's all coming there's also recent
files and the reason all of this matters
is you're going to be able to have apps
and have them have access to photos
files and all sorts of other stuff
without having to deal with the usual
hoops you used to have to jump through
with the share sheet in iOS that is not
a thing we've been able to easily do on
iPad before and it means that making
this thing your main device is going to
be a lot easier now iOS 11 also makes
way better use of the Apple pencil
there's a lot of stuff you can do now
that you couldn't do before now if you
have an Apple pencil you can double tap
the lock screen and you can immediately
start taking a note without unlocking
your device this will get saved and if I
want to search for a later Apple does
OCR on the screen and that word will get
recognized but you know honestly one of
my favorite features in iOS 11 is the
new screenshot so on both the iPad and
the iPhone you take a screenshot it puts
this little dude down in the corner you
can swipe it away or you can open it and
immediately start annotating it so you
can crop it down to just the section
that you want and you can draw a little
arrow draw your little smiley face and
then share it out save it do whatever
you want with it
this works for screen shots you can do
it with webpages saving them as PDFs and
noting them up and you can also do it
with emails there's one new feature in
the notes app that I'm really impressed
with it's document scanning so in the
note-taking app if I've got a document
that I need to fill out I can just scan
the document I've got it here at a crazy
angle it uses a our kit which is this
new feature to figure out exactly how it
should be straight so I'll just save it
look at my scan it's nice and straight
and then I can immediately start
annotating it and filling it out before
I send it off to get my subscription to
this magazine it's really impressive
we've been going for a while now but
there's a bunch of other little features
on iOS 11 that I really want to mention
so on the iPad there's a new feature on
the keyboard where you can flick down on
letters to get their alternate keys
which makes typing passwords way easier
on the iPhone the trick with the
keyboard is you can hold your finger
down on the globe and shift the keyboard
over to the right so it's easier to type
with one hand if you're using a big
phone like an iPhone 7 plus and I got to
tell you I barely scratched the surface
on all the new stuff that's in here so
for example if we look at settings you
may have noticed in other apps but it's
here - there are big bold headers at the
top of all the apps which makes it
easier to see where you are I guess but
I just think it looks nice and inside
Safari we can open the settings here
there's a new option to prevent
cross-site tracking which means that
those ads are can be able to set a
cookie to follow you around the web
everywhere you go Apple's actually using
machine learning to do it there's other
stuff too I really like the updates to
Apple music it has those big bold
headers but apples trying again to do a
little social thing here you can see
what your friends are listening to the
NFC chip on the back is no longer locked
and just to Apple pay other apps can use
it to read stuff you can read QR codes
with the camera iMessage iMessage has a
ton of new stuff you can get easier
access to all the little apps so you
start sliding over and they get really
big so they're easier to find later on
you're going to be able to use Apple pay
to send money to your friends directly
right inside iMessage there's a new
feature called iCloud sync that syncs
your iMessage is better across multiple
devices so you don't have to wait for
them to update that same iCloud sync
also works in photos so when you
identify a face on your iPhone that same
face shows up on your iPad if you don't
have to do it twice and all that stuff
is encrypted
and in the cloud so that if the
government asks Apple for it Apple won't
be able to do it because all the keys
are local to your device so you know
it's safe and encrypted it's just it's a
lot all right so i OS 11 is coming out
in the fall and obviously you're going
to upgrade everybody always upgrades but
the question is should you install the
beta that's available
the public right now and the answer is I
would wait if you have an iPad it's
pretty solid there and if it's not your
main device it's probably worth
installing actually it's a lot of fun to
play around on the new multitasking
features I really like it but on your
main iPhone it's not quite ready yet
I've had some battery drain issues I've
had the phone get really hot and there's
a bunch of features that just aren't
here yet like Apple pay so it's okay to
hold off on your phone install it on a
secondary iPhone if you happen to have
one so there are just a ton of new
features in iOS 11 I think that it does
a better job than any version of iOS has
ever done at making the case that the
iPad can be your main computer and I
think that's really interesting and on
the iPhone there's just a bunch of stuff
that we've been asking for and even some
stuff we didn't even know he wanted it's
really great this is by far the most
ambitious update iOS 11 that I've seen
in a very long time because it's nerdy
but it's super weird now start over now
I haven't even gotten to the part about
iOS or now or still good yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
