the Galaxy S 10 and the S 10 plus and
also an S 10 II and probably a 5g phone
and they're probably gonna show off a
foldable phone - and maybe some
smartwatches yeah it's a lot and I'm
sure they're all gonna have beautiful
hardware and be fast and have good
cameras but here's a question what about
the software can Samsung make a good
user interface you know the story with
samsung phones right absolutely
amazing hardware this right here is the
Galaxy S 9 and even a year after it's
been released I think you could still
say it's the nicest looking and feeling
Android phone that you can get but ever
since well forever we've always just
made fun of Samsung's software and it
was easy to do right it just felt less
elegant than so-called pure Android and
literally every time we review a samsung
phone we say hey you know what the
software is a little bit better but it's
still you know Samsung now though
Samsung is finally releasing Android 9pi
on the Galaxy S 9 and it has this new
interface called one UI and I gotta tell
you it's it's pretty good
the core idea in one UI is that we all
have big phones now and so it's hard to
reach the top of the phone so Samsung
took an idea from Apple and iterated on
it and started putting these big headers
here at the top of the app when you
first open them like you're in messages
it makes it easier to reach the stuff at
the bottom of the screen but then when
you start scrolling the header moves up
and your content takes up the entire
screen you can actually see the whole
progression just through the clock app
it starts with this try heart attempt to
clean up Android then they dial it back
then they go super neon trihard here
then they dial it back again and then
finally with one UI
they have an original idea and they
execute it well see to me there's a
difference between a gimmick and a
feature when you see this big header
thing at first it definitely feels like
a gimmick but then you use it and it
feels natural and normal you barely even
notice it and that's the difference a
gimmick says hey look at me look at me
and the big new thing but a feature just
makes your phone better without you
having to think about it or even
surely notice it it wasn't always this
way with Samsung software in fact it was
almost always bad and gimmicky which
means that friends it's time to talk
about TouchWiz so TouchWiz you know it
as an Android skin it takes so-called
pure Android and it muddies it up with
all this other crap on it that you don't
really need or like or even want but did
you know it didn't actually start on an
Android it started as a Windows Mobile
skin yeah it's that old and so here's
the thing I can't believe I'm doing this
but I'm gonna kind of defend TouchWiz
Windows Mobile and the early iterations
of Android they were just not that great
the interfaces were kind of bad and you
had to be a kind of computer dork to
understand how they work so Samsung just
needed to try to clean them up and make
them a little bit easier to use and
maybe prettier in the bargain but well
it all went wrong in a hurry for one
thing
Samsung didn't really come up with its
own ideas it just sort of made bad
Android versions of what it thought
people wanted which was iPhones so
TouchWiz made Samsung phones into this
weird Franken not quite iPhone mess also
and I'm just gonna say it the design of
TouchWiz lacked taste it was just kind
of ugly it's not very elegant and on the
galaxy s3 guess what it did by default
it made this bloop knows every time you
touched it boop boop come on bloop oh
and Samsung had heard that you like
features so put features on top of other
features it felt like it had to
differentiate its phone so it just kept
on cramming stuff in eye tracking that
didn't really work and bloatware and
weird photo sharing features that only
worked with other Samsung phones it was
just a confusing mess yeah this isn't
much of a defense is it the point though
is that Samsung did have the right idea
I just did a horrible job of executing
on it and what was trying to fix all
that it attached a whole lot of other
bad ideas on top of the first bad ideas
until it all became a bloated mess
TouchWiz was bad enough that Samsung
finally realized that people hated it
and stopped even calling it TouchWiz
they changed it to the Samsung
experience a little while ago which by
the way it sounds like the worst fan
name ever but
now they have this new thing which
they're calling 1ui let's talk about
skins 1ui isn't really a skin because
there's no such thing as pure Android
anymore not in the phone that you buy
the basics of AOSP Android they're
really well basic so everybody has to
customize on top of it to make a good
phone these days yes even pixel phones
they have the Google Experience on top
of them
so one UI is now Samsung experience and
you know what I kind of dig it there's
still a million weird settings and
features everywhere there's slide over
here which I thought I'd hate but I
don't and Samsung lets you change the
main buttons to swipe up gestures so you
can reclaim a little bit of screen real
estate also dark mode and Samsung Apps
they beat Google to it and it's really
nice
I think the s10 software is gonna be a
lot like the one you I experienced on
this s9 here and again I'm kind of into
it but there's still a problem software
updates
it took Samsung four or five months to
get Android 9pi on the s9 and that's bad
like really bad supposedly Google's new
project treble system was supposed to
modularize the OS to make updates come
faster but Samsung just isn't doing that
also Bixby how Bixby you if Samsung can
fix that update problem I could really
get behind the one UI for one its
aesthetic just looks better it doesn't
look cheap and like crap anymore and
that goes a long way second I think
Samsung is starting to figure out how to
include a million features without
having them all be super annoying like
here in the camera but kind of
progressively shows you the new features
as you need them instead of confusing
you with all of them right away although
I do have to say it's Samsung you do got
to chill out with a Samsung health app I
don't want it quit showing it to me
anyway most importantly Samsung seems to
have its own ideas instead of just
trying to copy everybody else's or paper
over the problems in Android it has an
identity that's all its own in its
software the software here it feels like
a Samsung phone and that is surprisingly
better than you might assume but I just
can't get over the fact that part of
Samsung's identity is apparently
making us all wait way too long to get
software updates everybody thanks for
watching have you checked out one UI and
let me don't you think down in the
comments also stay tuned to the verge
we're gonna have hands-on zand live
blogs and everything for Samsung's
unpacked event on February 20th</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
