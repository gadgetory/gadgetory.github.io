and we're here having a look at an early
version of windows 8 consumer preview
that's obviously on the desktop here
you'll notice in the bottom left there's
no start or start button orb anymore and
but you can get to the usual start
button from here she's literally to
swipe and you'll get the charms bar here
and this will take us straight into the
Metro interface now I've seen a
developer preview that we didn't have
the semantic zoom so now we can
demonstrate that it literally pinch to
get that and you can drag down on the on
the tiles here and name them so go in
change that to test so this is a good
way to sort like group applications and
what you will notice as we're
demonstrating this is that there's
obviously a purple sort of background
with some sort of different elements
there now if we go into settings and
we're going into the control panel you
can see some of the new sort of
personalization options so got color
dragger here it's not too many colors to
pick here but much has given you a few
here so it's just going to the blue one
will choose some bubbles here we go back
to start now you can obviously change to
change the bubbles there it's a look at
some of the other sayings
see what some other other colors can go
all the way up to grey but I like gray
and orange theme ok so we've also got
the presence of Windows Media Center in
this build and if we launch that up you
can see that that it's pretty much the
same as Windows 7 Matt everything might
has done a lot of work to media center
in windows 8 so it's largely untouched
let's take a look at some of the other
apps and going built the actual this
isn't the actual consumer preview bill
but the consumer preview build will
obviously come with a lot of these sort
of Metro storm applications but we can
still have a look at like Metro desktop
remote desktop here so you can connect
to a Windows PC from there see what else
we've gone yeah we got the store nearby
lymph you can access at the moment we're
not online so one of the one of the new
gestures in windows 8 consumer preview
is if we open up like I metro-style
application like remote desktop we
dragged down from the bottom now you can
either snap this to the left Oh or you
can literally take it down to the bottom
and it will disappear select it closes
the application but mark sourcils you've
done a lot of work for background
applications so it just runs in a
suspended state in the background now if
you switch to the desktop we can
actually do the same for the actual
desktop so it's almost like the desktop
is running in an application and it will
switch straight back into the Metro
Start screen and we obviously got
Windows Explorer you can you can sweat
down on the ribbon there to get some
sort of touch friendly navigation and a
lot of the sort of file navigation will
probably be done
in the actual Metro interface where you
beg to sort share we can't we can't
shake so not in a nap stratification
it's just yeah be aware to share data
with other applications using the
windows 8 contracts obviously the normal
gestures of swiping applications
interview still work so we can swipe
Metro apps onto the main window there or
into the left here so that's replacing
the desktop you can continue swiping
through and this is obviously you can
resize this and you can also obviously
dragged away and then get back to the
start screen okay so we're going to have
a look at the windows explorer in the
Metro interface so one way to surface
this is in the control panel metro-style
version so if we browse here we can get
into the different so we go into
computer and we can browse the various
folders there so obviously that's a bit
more touch running friendly and using
the actual Windows Explorer which are
much less as long as obviously supplied
for legacy reasons we can obviously
change the desktop backgrounds here it's
a few inbuilt ones i think the consumer
preview the full consumer preview will
have like the beta fish from windows 7
and a few other sort for pictures okay
so we're just going to have a look at
the actual keyboard on Windows 8 it
seems like it's largely untouched from
me actual Developer Preview and we will
see got pennsport we don't have a pen
here but it does seem to pick up and was
quite well so it should translate that
and and you've obviously got a split
keyboard as well so you can use that
and you also go to start a keyboard
the numbers and the smiley faces it's
quite a few of those longer okay so
there's an interesting option on the
sort pending space here we can have a
correct interface and we'll just try
that now
see if it cracks under me hey guys and
let's try joining
so sorry joining those those letters
into a word and let's try splitting
something special
so that works quite like I don't see
deleting you can just swipe to delete ok
so that was a quick look an early
version of the windows 8 consumer
preview build</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
