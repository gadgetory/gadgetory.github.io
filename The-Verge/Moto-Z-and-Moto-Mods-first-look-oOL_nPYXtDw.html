we're here with the new Moto Z so the
Moto G comes in two different flavors
there's the standard slim Moto Z and
then there is the Moto Z Force I'm what
as he forces a little bit thicker but
mostly they kind of look identical
wouldn't be able to tell too much of a
difference by looking straight at them
here there are some key differences
under the hood though that you should be
made aware of so they both have a 5.5
inch AMOLED display Qualcomm Snapdragon
820 processor they both have four gigs
of RAM but the difference is in the
camera the battery life and the
durability the standard moto Z just has
your kind of run-of-the-mill Gorilla
Glass has a 13 megapixel rear facing
camera and a 5 megapixel front facing
camera it gets about 30 hours of battery
life
now the Moto G force on the other hand
this has a 21 megapixel rear facing
camera same 5 megapixel front facing
camera it's about 40 hours of battery
life and it's got a Moto's shatter
shield technology that means it's
shatter and a crack resistant if you
were to drop it on the ground although
there's some difference in the
megapixels between the standard moto Z
and the Moto z-force they both have
optical image stabilization and laser
autofocus in terms of storage both
phones come in at 32 gigabyte and a 64
gigabyte model microSD card supports you
can add up to 2 terabytes of extra
storage there so both devices have turbo
power charging now that moto technology
means that I'm a standard mode of Z
you'll get about 8 hours of use off with
15 minutes of charge now with the bigger
battery on the Moto Z force you'll get
about 15 hours of use in just 15 minutes
of charging one really interesting thing
to notice and this you know it's causing
a lot of contention in the tech industry
right is the removal of the the standard
3.5 millimeter headphone jack now a me
moto Z we have just one USB type-c port
down here that's for charging and for
headphones so even though you can't plug
in a standard 3.5 headphone jack right
into the phone itself this moto Z will
be coming with an adapter so that you
can use your standard headphones with
this new USB type-c port down here so
specs are only one half of the story
with the Moto Z the other half are what
are called moto mods so this is a big
trend with Android smartphones in 2016
you see it with something like the
gg5 basically consumers can augment
their Android smartphone with
attachments give them longer battery
life better camera things like that with
the moto Z in particular you don't have
to do anything crazy you don't to remove
something from the bottom of the phone
or kind of take anything out basically
the mods they act just like kind of
phone cases so if you turn the phone
over you take this out this power pack
here which gives you up to 22 hours and
extra battery life you just slip it
right on you'll hear a little sound
you'll get a little animation to confirm
that you've you put them out on and from
there just you can use the phone just as
just like normal another one you have is
the JBL sound boost now this similar to
the power pack just kind of slips over
the end and this gives the phone better
sounding music it's a glute louder
brighter sound just like a kind of
Bluetooth speaker would another really
cool moto mod is this moto made
projector this will give you a 70 inch
projector using just your phone so if
you're watching youtube videos we've got
a movie something like that you can just
take your phone project it right against
the wall here this thing has one hour of
internal battery but once that dies out
you can then use the phone's battery you
should be able to get up to about two
and a half hours on the slim standard
moto Z in about four hours on the Moto Z
force so the standard slim moto Z will
be available worldwide unlocked starting
in September but if you're here in the
US you can get it as early as this
summer from Verizon only as a droid
edition phone the same goes for the Moto
z-force actually the Moto Z force you
can't get anywhere but the US as a droid
edition Verizon exclusive we don't have
any pricing on either the force or the
standard motor Z just yet for more
hands-on videos like this just head over
to youtube.com slash the Virg
