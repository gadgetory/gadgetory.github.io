thing called manake I'm thinking of it
as the new-age clapper and basically
what it does is you can put it anywhere
in your home under any surface on a wall
wherever you want and you can knock a
certain number of times and make it do
things so for example I'm gonna knock
twice on this table and this light is
going to turn off like magic I'm going
to knock twice and then three times on
this table and it's going to turn this
light bulb red set the mood we're going
to turn it back now so I know what
you're thinking isn't this just a
new-age clapper and you're right
it basically is well what's cool about
it is it doesn't work off vocal sounds
like the clapper
it register this naki doesn't pick up on
that at all instead it relies in
accelerometers so basically what happens
is the naki listens for a certain
cadence a natural rhythm to the knocks
and it knows those are the ones it's
looking for right now we have the
knocking on the table but what you
really should know is that doesn't have
to be like that you can put the na key
underneath so it looks like a regular
table and just impress your guests or
your friends by knocking on the table
and doing magic stuff so one of the
cooler things you can do with the na key
is you can use it to call or text close
so I'm going to knock on this table
three times it's going to call this
phone it works if you're really into the
knocking unfortunately it's not
available just yet but they are
launching a Kickstarter today so you can
put a pre-order in it's going to retail
at $99 when it does come out but the
pre-orders will give you a significant
discount the app isn't ready just yet
but when the naki ships at the end of
this year at the latest it should be
good to go so that's the na key if you
want to see more of that and the Virg
staff playing around with random other
gadgets make sure you check out the Virg
calm and subscribe to our YouTube
channel
later knock-knock it's
naki and then I could do an intro from
that if you wanted it yeah I could just
like it snacky</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
