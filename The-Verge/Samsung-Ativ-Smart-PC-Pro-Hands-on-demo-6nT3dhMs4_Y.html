here at Samsung's presentation of the
temple drom and we take a look at it
windows 8 smart PC is called a TV smart
PC this is a core i5 based laptop /
tablet SBC has this keyboard dock it's
quite a bit chunkier than the 80 tab the
Snapdragon s4 based device but just like
that device it has a dark at the bottom
you hold down this button and it pops
out and you can see the new windows key
which which switches regimes between the
formerly Metro UI we don't always call
it anymore but it's windows 8 as
Microsoft wants it to be known nowadays
and it switches you back to familiar
windows 7 interface there's a little
sticker I'm going to get rid of and just
to give you the specs as a core i5 3317
you cpu running at 1.7 gigahertz 4
gigabytes of ram 64 bit operating system
pen and full windows such support with
10 touch points and notably over here on
the side there's a for an S Pen so
it has s plan compatibility the the same
way quack on base stylus or Samsung
heads with a Galaxy Note series however
that S Pen is not here with us I'm
fortunate today take a look around the
back you've got quite a big event
actually over here on the top it's
surrounded with a micro SD card slot and
another slot USB connection here power
button etc all the usuals it's quite
glossy it also seems to feature that
same brush look but again it's plastic
on the back at the bottom we have this
dock connector so I'm going to presume
released guess that this time dock
connector is also on the eighth of tab
so it should also be compatible with
this keyboard dock right here which
weighs just about as much as
this intel based tablet it's 11.6 inches
from what i understand and it's quite a
bit heavier actually than the windows
RT's have if you have to choose we go
for the windows RT eight of stab at the
moment it also seems to have a nice to
display with nicer viewing angles I'm
just going to put down here at the
battery and see you've got thirty six
percent remaining not telling me how
long that might be in tubs of time and
so it's going to be interesting and
curious how these tablets perform over
the long term and sends a better life we
have to find out later so just our first
look is Samsung's int'l based Windows 8
tablet here a deeper</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
