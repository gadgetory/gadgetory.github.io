phones a big one and a small one this is
the smaller Google phone the Nexus 5x
the Nexus 5x is not a successor to last
year's gargantuan Nexus 6 rather the
true sequel to the Nexus 5 from 2 long
years ago
it's got nearly everything that made the
Nexus 5 so loved by Nexus fans strong
performance compact size that you can
easily use in one hand and a sticker
price that doesn't break the bank this
phone was specifically built to make a
lot of people happy and for the vast
majority of them it should do just that
the Nexus 5 wasn't exactly the best
designed phone and the 5x follows along
right in its footsteps the best way they
describe this phone is generic it really
looks like a reference design for what a
smart phone should be not much more than
that
materials LG and Google use here back
that up it's all plastic and feels kind
of cheap I'm not too worried about it
breaking but it certainly doesn't evoke
any emotion when I pick it up there's
also a hollow echo anytime you tap the
phone which frequently reminds me that
I'm not holding a top to your premium
device if you want a nicer build and
better materials you're going to have to
pony up for Google's other new Nexus
phone the 6p materials aside a big
appeal of the 5x is that it's actually
possible to use in one hand without
issue in the past few days I've been
using it while carrying groceries
holding a kit pushing a shopping cart or
holding a cup of coffee and I've not
dropped at once nor had any issue using
it to its fullest the matte plastic
finish on my white review unit may be
boring to look at but it's not a
slippery bar soap like an iPhone or
galaxy s6 is the 5x is 5.2 inch 1080p
display is slightly larger than the
Nexus 5's but other than that it's very
similar sharp and crisp but a bit flat
and colors aren't as punchy as on other
phones it has been a problem for me but
it's undeniably noticeable when you put
the 5x next to a better display there
are other minor hardware tweaks like the
move of the speaker to the front of the
phone but the most significant one is
the new fingerprint sensor on the back
which wakes up and unlocks the phone all
in one gesture I was very skeptical of
this at first and I didn't expect it to
be as easy to use as phones with front
fingerprint scanners but it's super fast
and perfectly placed for my index finger
I quickly got used to never seeing the
lock screen because by the time I pulled
the 5x out of my pocket and lifted it up
I'd already scanned my fingerprint and
unlock the phone it's really a great
experience though of course the downside
to this is that you can't use your
finger to unlock your
phone when it's sitting on your desk the
other big hardware update is the new 12
megapixel camera which is paired with a
dual LED flash and IR sensor for
autofocus it's housed in a slight bump
on the back of the phone that's 100%
completely not a big deal it's the same
camera sensor that Google is using in
the higher-end 6p and it's easily the
best shooter a Nexus device has ever
seen in most conditions it takes really
great photos which can stand next to the
best of the smartphone world as lighting
it's trickier the 5x can stumble but
it's so much better than any Nexus phone
before it there's little room to
complain most of the time you'll get
great photos and no one will be the
wiser
but if there is something to complain
about here it's with Google's camera app
which is too bare-bones and slow
compared to virtually everything else
under the hood is where things start to
divert from the Nexus 5 the 5x is a
powerful and capable phone no doubt
about it but its Snapdragon 808
processor and 2 gigabytes of RAM aren't
up to pace with the top phones in 2015
and there are points where that shows
most of the time performance is great
it's got smooth scrolling and responsive
interactions but every once in a while
I'll open the camera or another app and
the phone will just hang for a few
seconds while it catches up with itself
that's led me to miss pictures or get
frustrated while I wait for the browser
to pop up and load after clicking a link
the 5x isn't Google's top tier Nexus
phone this year and it's clear that
performance is where corners were cut on
the bright side though the 5x has a much
better battery life than the 5 it easily
gets me through a day of heavy use
without needing to recharge Android
marshmallows new dos feature comes into
play here if I put the phone down it
barely sips power but it's also clearly
more efficient when I'm actually using
the device I won't get two days of
battery out of the 5x but I'm not
charging it up at 3 p.m. either speaking
of marshmallow the 5x unsurprisingly
ships with androids latest and it sports
all the headline features like goes and
now on tap you can also respond to voice
commands hands-free like the Moto X or
iPhone 6s and I've been getting a lot of
use out of that lately
more than anything else the 5x feels
like a phone for the fans the ones that
love the Nexus 5 and didn't get what
they wanted from last year's Nexus 6
it's compact cheap and performs well
even if it's not the best looking or
feeling phone you can get in fact among
phones under $450 I don't think there's
a better option and it's easily the one
I'd pick but the Nexus 5x is not
Google's best phone and there are
compromises in both performance and
design compared to the larger and
pricier 6p but if those compromises
don't matter to you and you've been
longing to upgrade your aging Nexus 5
well you're just going to love the 5x</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
