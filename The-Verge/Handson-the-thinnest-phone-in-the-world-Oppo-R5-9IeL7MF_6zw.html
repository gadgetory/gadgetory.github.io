to be how thin can it be I can't imagine
the answer is much thinner than this
though I've been wrong before this is
the Oppo r5 and it is the thinnest
smartphone in the world for the moment
anyway the r5 is four point eight five
millimeters thick not counting the bump
on the backside of the camera it's
almost exactly the size of five credit
cards stacked on top of one another it's
really really really thin just by way of
comparison the iPhone six is six point
nine millimeters thick which is fully
40% thicker than the r5 the original
Motorola Droid Razr the one that was
supposed to be so thin it could chop the
world in half with 7.1 millimeters thick
that's basically gigantic next to this
thing for the most part otherwise the r5
looks as if you took an iPhone 5s and
just stretched it out it's made of
really nice really sturdy chamfered
metal and despite being the slim doesn't
feel breakable at all it has white
stripes on the back for all the antennas
and a glass white panel on the front
it's almost uncomfortably thin but it's
also really impressively made the r5 is
so perfectly Oppo in a way
Oppo is one of China's fastest growing
phone manufacturers and it got there in
large part by taking one feature and
just blowing it out through the ceiling
when it launched the r5 at also debuted
the n3 which has a 16 megapixel camera
that swivels automatically so you can
take higher resolution selfies than you
will ever want to have in your life it's
clever it really is but it's also sort
of insane it's also insane that the r5
is so thin especially when it didn't
need to be and being this then even
causes a few problems like the fact that
there's literally no room for a
headphone jack so you have to plug in
headphones with the USB adapter Apple
made this phone to prove something not
necessarily to be the perfect phone for
everyone which it's not the r5 runs
Android 4.4 along with what Apple calls
color OS 2.0 basically it's a bunch of
customizations to Android some of which
are pointless and some of which are
actually really cool there's a drawing
menu that you get to by swiping up from
the home button which lets you scribble
a note or write symbols to open apps it
reminds me of my Palm Pilot from back in
the day and I'd love it a lot of the
changes though are just ugly
customizations of Android and there's a
theme store that tells you to enjoy your
individuality by theming your phone like
I'm not making any of these up fruits
candy or colorful line or
falls in love it's weird and I don't get
it but so it goes the best thing about
the themes is that one of them just
looks like Android beyond all that
there's really not much to say about the
r5 it's somewhere between mid-range and
really high end with a 5.2 inch 1080p
screen a 13 megapixel camera a
Snapdragon processor in 2 gigs of ram it
works pretty well from what I've tested
though the battery life doesn't seem to
be very good I guess that's not
surprising this phone is tiny it's the
thinnest smartphone in the world at
least until something else comes along
and somehow I don't think that'll take
very long</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
