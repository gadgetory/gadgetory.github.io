invested in them and met amazing people
using the internet to change the world
our generation has an opportunity unlike
any other we can create small empires
without anyone's permission the Internet
is disrupting so many creative
industries right there are startups now
helping filmmakers helping musicians but
what about artists who want to put stuff
on your wall
well article here in Flatiron is turning
the entire art establishment upside down
we are building technology to support
artists and to help you discover the
artists in your own backyard
get that down pat for the last three
years we have rented out our artwork
from the New York area what if you could
decorate your home with art not have to
worry if your investment was a big
mistake
Kimberly Richardson introduces us to a
program that lets you rent pieces of art
and if you like them you buy the art
sickle think of it as Netflix of the art
world the new goal is we really want to
organize the world's artists artists
have been toiling away in secrecy is
trying to create like the next big thing
to be discovered but really we need to
be able to find our artists in our own
backyard so that we can connect with
them and really enjoy them what they're
building their artists all over this
country all over this world and some of
them might happen to live in you know
Tulsa yeah like what is that gonna mean
for those communities I think the thing
that's really important about that for
me is that those artists in Tulsa are
afraid to call themselves artists in a
lot of cases there's this definition
that comes down kind of from up high
right now from from museums from
galleries from people that are
gatekeepers saying you know you have
from you of permission to be an artist
and we're saying you have permission to
be an artist if you want to be an artist
one of the really interesting things
about this company is that in sort of
startup parlance we always talk about
how finding the right co-founder is like
finding the right partner
yeah it's not usually literally your
partner as your
co-founder however you and Scott have
made that work what's one of the most
important takeaways from the fact that
you two are not only in relationship but
also like running a company together
it's not something we necessarily
recommend to everyone by any means but
articles started as a side project and
it really evolved from something we're
going to work on nights and weekends
while we had our day job and we got to
figure out our kind of personal dynamic
in advance of going out there and saying
like let's do this full-time let's hire
people let's go raise money and let's
make it a company so your daytime job
you were at Amex yes what what motivated
you to take on this kind of side hustle
this this side gig on the nights and
weekends right you you had a job that
I'm sure was stressing you out like like
most full-time jobs do right you come
home from work most people the last
thing they want to do is think about
starting a company but but yet you two
made it work what was what was the
motivation there so I actually had an
interesting situation at Amex and that I
had a great first two years and I got
myself promoted into a job at all hated
and I was getting to see what life was
going to look like in that type of large
comfort company structure as you moved
up the ranks and so it wasn't even kind
of being stressed in my day job it was
just realizing that I wasn't making
things anymore what already been I mean
one promotion I was already done making
things and so starting article was about
building stuff again
I'm gonna guess when you told your folks
that you know being a nuclear engineer
doing this stuff was nice but not as
cool as starting a start-up to help
empower artists all over the world they
were like awesome or for a while they're
like okay here on sabbatical so he was a
full-time nuclear engineers ing burns on
a he was working on a hardware project
with a friend on nights and weekend
right so he was like I'm working on a
sub today and then I don't know what
kind of a clan
good night it's like no no I don't have
enough going on I want to start a
hardware company run okay
yes there you've got personality type
already there um and that have failed
pretty miserably and it had kind of
gotten him excited about software yeah
because the hardware side he was like oh
got it there's a lot of roadblocks
I'm gonna build software so he was
teaching himself out of program realized
it wasn't that far from what he did a
nose day job I only took one programming
class in college a Voyager I was a 101
CS courser it was 101 Java and it was
like at the end of the class I knew what
a linked list was I was like wow this
pretty useless a bunch of a bunch of
Java developers right now are shaking
their fist yeah all six of them I was
moonlighting on a start-up for a couple
weeks before I got my job and just
working there like going home from
nuclear engineering guy strength this
startup there they're like you can work
for free I was like cool I will work kid
and I touched Ruby or these new dynamic
languages I was just like oh my god it's
like building Legos like it still
requires a lot of hours slamming my head
against the computer but I'm actually
building something and I can show
something show something on the screen
so quickly and then with the web I
realized I could show that to millions
of people like I'm just going to look at
it all I did was throw out an early idea
and say okay well if you're working on
something could you start building me an
e-commerce site because I want to help
support artists and then actually he
spent a ton of time on it because I was
not learning how to program I'd
recruited my ten artists and that he was
kind of on his own building out the tech
for a while and he got really into the
idea and took it to the next level of
what if it wasn't just an e-commerce
site for artists what if it did more so
you're like all right gotta learn rails
so I mean are you just going to Google
are using like rails for zombies was
that your tutorial of course like how I
said sadly no that existed those are the
very beginning like right now anyone
who's watching like rails tutorial comm
is amazing project Euler those two
resources now can get me started really
fast I didn't know about any of those
back then I don't think rails tutorial
existed then I had a mentor at the start
of I was moonlighting at he threw me
like the rails to book
from like Riley or something that didn't
really help once I put down the
tutorials just one thing's really
starting to work is once you start
slamming your head against trying to
solve a particular problem doesn't
matter what the problem is doesn't
matter how important it is but you were
going to learn something like doing it
the very first thing I had done kind of
in my adult life on the web is I had
customized my tumblr theme that was your
and over again I never liked it and then
I added you know then I added some
little add widget at one point and they
figured out that broke everything and
you learn how to fix it um and once
Scott kind of explained like what we
need to do for the site's gonna be
basically what you were doing on your
tumblr theme yeah on a different screen
okay well that's not that scary I also
know that there's a back button like I
can just delete it and it goes it's fun
it's kind of like you just gotta stick
to those hours and when you actually get
the fix it's totally a rush of I heard
once that there was a heroin addict that
started programming that's how he
thought of it it's like god I'll get
that fixed gonna get that fix finally
got it and it totally is like heroin
yeah much better for your career exactly
you guys have a little bit art here on
your walls yeah let's really call some
attention at your like favorite one my
absolute favorite is actually probably
the one above the couch that's the only
one here specifically for this space
so the rest of these have all recently
been printed by someone and it's been
returned to us we're hanging on the
mythical the artist picks them up which
luckily there's always a decent number
up but this piece I just love it feels
like the energy of New York all the
different scenes all right and so who is
the artist
this is Genevieve Reid and she was a
street artist for years and I'm tired of
getting the tickets wish I could work on
a different medium and started doing
really similar work except on wood and
on canvas very cool I mean I got a
ganache with the fridge Tina started
found as you guys had to be so just
innovative you just got a hack stuff
what's the story this fridge this was a
free fridge and we couldn't really turn
down a free fridge was it was it like a
street fridge it was not a street fridge
was coming out of someone's apartment
but it was a pretty nasty fridge it was
like a like 80s it had been through some
better days fridge and so we wanted the
free fridge but we wanted it to look a
little better and it got a layer of
chalkboard paint it's become kind of a
project for us we get to draw things on
it all the time
pretty dance
we're here in South Brooklyn not far
from Coney Island in a neighborhood
called Sheepshead Bay which is probably
best known for being home to scores of
immigrants from the former Soviet Union
probably not the first place you'd
expect to find one of the earliest
adopters of art school I'm Dan bina
I'm an artist of 29 living in Brooklyn
New York I grew up in the Midwest I
ended up going to the Kansas City Art
Institute on a scholarship there are
studied painting sculpture woodworking
and built furniture and built these two
chairs that were sitting in very
comfortable chairs thank you
you are not a full-time artist right
correct and so so what pays the bills to
let you you know have this wonderful
apartment as well as make your art well
I'm a full-time art handler at one of
the big auction firms in New York so you
know commute into Manhattan and I'm
immersed in art history on a daily basis
I work with furniture decorative art
InDesign paintings you name it and this
isn't just art this is high art right
this is this is the stuff at auctions
for tens of millions tens and hundreds
of millions hundreds of millions of
dollars okay not six is the great
Picasso nude green leaves and bust in
1932 Picasso of monitor is showing on my
left and fifty-eight million dollars to
stop us 74 million 75 million 81 million
86 million new bidder
87 million 90 million 93 million they're
warning now at 93 million dollars last
chance see you're stuck 94 million
yes 95 million coming back in red at 95
million dollars I'm selling it this time
fair warning you all done and selling at
95 million dollars Nick you're better at
95 million dollars but then your nights
and weekends you're making art of your
own from emerging artists we have all
this stuff sitting in our you know
closets in our flat files and that's
potential income you meet these artists
and they're just toiling away working so
hard and like really building out their
craft in secrecy
the artists are making work constantly
that's what we do the next question is
what does an artist do with all the work
that they have I mean New York is
notorious first base right it's it's one
of our precious commodities so art Sokol
has actually given me space to make more
work someone asked me once you know
what's what's your medium of choice is a
painter and like well could be wine
could be bourbon could be fear depends
on the night yeah but that seems to be
what I consume more than pain all right
let's drink some bourbon and make smart
oh sweet right if more people knew about
the process I'm saying I think there'd
be more artists maybe some people have
mistakenly identified me as an artist
because of the digital art that I make
right it's a lot easier to make a
straight line when you hold shift so
this could suck I mean it's it's just
like using a mouse except your hand in
the art world I think a lot of people
refer to the canvas or the paper is like
the white dragon you're always trying to
slay the white dragon it's like this
blank page might be staring at you and
you're really intimidated to make a mark
yeah and some people just said make a
mark and then you could change
afterwards what can I do to help your
your side of this composition this is a
collaboration after all um well if I was
being very diplomatic I could say well
how would you like to help oh well you
don't have to be diplomatic um I I guess
you could put the brush down oh man I
can already tell you got this kind of
like brush swag to what Bob would have
called it
who's Bob Oh we're also Bros we're on a
first-name basis once the images you
know to my satisfaction or to our
satisfaction thank you
well upload it to the article site hmm
and then it'll go live
I think it's 2013 why why New York this
is the art capital of the world this is
where all the artists are all artists
are flocking to New York to be
discovered kind of thing but also just
because of how multidisciplinary the
city is like walk across the street and
meet advertising guides or people like
to make a revolution happening and
Brooklyn Brooklyn and I it really is
just that it actually keeps you really
grounded I haven't spent a lot of time
in San Fran but the echo chamber is kind
of painful
we had an investor really early on tell
us that they would invest in less if we
moved to San Francisco so we actually
think about this question who is this
can we call out this investor for being
ridiculous it would actually sound Idaho
we have to go back and look because they
wanted in their mind they thought that
if we were closer to them they can
better help us which was kind I guess
yeah but and so we thought about it
because we didn't really have an answer
yet to why New York I mean at that time
we were just getting started
other than that we were here but we knew
there was more to it and for us why New
York is because there is the highest
concentration of artists here creating
really incredible stuff and it's also
the hardest audience I will ever have to
deal with because New York has such a
clear definition of what art is and what
art should be a lot of haters we kind of
said to ourselves we can if we can win
New York then we have we have this down
we can do our anywhere in the world we
can work with artists absolutely
anywhere if we can get New York artists
to not hate us yeah and we have 250 New
York artists who love us and work with
us every day and we're ready to go to
the rest of the world
when someone rents something you get a
email immediately updated saying you
know someone just rented this piece how
do you feel the instant you see the
photo of someone instagramming you know
one of your works of art in their living
room it's some Boyer is sick
you know it's it's funny there's there's
a great sense of honour that comes with
that you know when someone says I like
this it means something because you're
some message has gone through to them
and it's some you know in a sense one of
the highest rewards you can get as a
maker of things there was an instance
where one of their collectors bought a
painting of mine a pretty substantial
painting and it helped me
with a lot of issues financially no and
so it was just there's a real-life
economic impact yeah and this was it was
just like it was a Tuesday and all of a
sudden you get an email notification
exactly and what was that like as you're
reading through
I mean you sort you jump out of your
chair and you give a good holler and you
tell you tell my wife and then she gets
excited I realized you know we could pay
off this credit card yeah yeah you
taught yourself CSS HTML you're building
out the site you guys have the version
that you're just embarrassed enough to
launch what did it look like oh gosh was
it janky oh yeah it was a theme for us
theme we bought for like 20 bucks and
check-out didn't actually work we found
out the day we launched oh hold on a
plane Wanda this is this is so novel
there are so many smart people you do
that and then end up being offline for
sustained periods of time immediately
their app we launched the site and got
on a plane down to Art Basel down in
Miami because we wanted to know what
kind of the art elite would think about
this thing that we were doing the crowds
returning to Art Basel Miami Beach this
show is about a 400,000 square foot plus
show we basically ended up standing in
front of the Convention Center having
people ask us where the bathrooms were
because we look like we were helping out
with the event because and did not get
any publicity for the company at all and
yeah I did get a call halfway through
the first day from somebody because our
phone number was on the site so my check
out like I'm just having some problems
I'm sure it's something I'm doing wrong
at which point Scott is sprinting back
to the hotel and hoping that he has good
enough internet to deploy what's it like
the moment when you hear customer cannot
complete checkout you freaked out back
then because you're new to this it's
terrifying and that's really what you
need to start building that tolerance
for those situations where your heart
keeps falling to the floor because it's
not you know you're supposed to say you
are not your code but for those first
few months you really are your code so
the site went live
in December 2010 it was terrible January
spent completely rebuilding it and in
March we launched the first version of
the rental site and things started to
blow up on us yeah that was the first
time we talked about it really publicly
and the press just kind of snowballed
out of control we set up two or three
interviews and that turned into
something like 40 in the first two weeks
that the site was live at that point we
had been working in Dogpatch labs for
about three months and we could have
made some early connections with people
and I don't think we didn't really
understand PR we didn't really think
that there was much strategy beyond
there is no sir I do PR isn't you know
we talked to a couple people that made
this big deal and wanted to do this big
exclusive we're like I don't really know
how about we just do small stories with
three different organizations like okay
so you identified here's a journalist at
a publication that we dig um and you you
open up Gmail and and what what is that
silk remember that page look like we had
started working on article like the
previous summer on the side we started
going to meetups we'd started going to
events so we knew the reporters at all
three at that point personally we'd had
drinks with them we had never had
anything to ask them for right and so I
kind of just called them and said I
don't know if this is appropriate or not
would you cover this it was really that
simple and they said well maybe what
would it be so somebody just give us
right so you you worked really hard on
making something people wanted then you
were you treated journalists like human
beings and then you were just really
honest and asked if it really that
simple they're probably some members the
team here that we can distract I bet
there are let's let's ruin some
productivity like we should run Kevin
productivity Fuhrman because your puppy
is yeah that's your dog's foulness all
day long yeah so it looks like I've seen
some CSS here yeah as a friend in front
of designer um we kind of do everything
um just everyone here does the full stat
we do says add and stuff we do front end
we do all the rails so weird wearing a
lots of different ads did you have any
jobs before this that bass in the corner
over there is actually mine I spent a
year at Juilliard oh I was a candidate
for master's degree in jazz bass I hated
my job I mean I hate a bassist as a
bassist
when I was playing professionally in New
York for like four or five years did all
throughout college and when I got there
I realized really quickly that it was
not there's not thing I wanted to do for
the rest of my life so I quit Julliard
didn't get my degree just dropped out
and started learning to code and I gotta
ask what how did your parents react when
you told them you were leaving Julliard
my dad's a programmer so so he was like
it's about time yeah that's funny I'm
like we never really had much to talk
about so when time came like I'm
actually gonna start coding now and it's
like I told you you know it shows you
showed them this like a long time ago
you know as a developer you really can
take your pick of where to work right
now and probably for the near future
why article when I was looking at the
job listings and like all the
internships almost places that were
available arts really set up because we
were helping people that were like me
when I was working and like struggling
New York like playing gigs but at 2:00
a.m. for $50 like there we wish that
people were building things for us to
support us and to make time for us just
focus on being better musicians and
rather than like managing all like our
business contacts and all these
things just make us better creatives do
you feel like we're missing out on great
artists right now because of how
inefficient it is because of you know
showing in Chelsea because you got the
lucky pole from the right curator to get
there absolutely absolutely I think um
you know Darger was discovered years
after he died he was a famous Chicago
based folk artist and now his work has
really sought after and he built an
entire career almost completely
invisible to the rest of the world I
mean he was a recluse
and he might not have used article but
if somebody would have pointed him in
that direction had the technology
existed we might have seen an entire
different career for him
this is disrupting and appending
something that is been a very long
tradition of people who know about art
who know art deciding this is art yeah
and whatever about that other stuff what
do you think the repercussions of that I
mean recoup the absolute repercussions
will be huge like we are playing on put
the crater on top where the really
content is king that who the crater is
and what they're making it's what
matters not what brands or agent is no
they selling through or has chosen them
and anointed them as fine art you know
this isn't going to necessarily support
one group of artists versus another
artist it's not kind of only the
anti-establishment artists everybody
needs this everybody needs a way to keep
themselves organized and help their work
be found by the community and that can
happen across all levels of careers from
ten dollar pieces to two thousand dollar
pieces
article is not only helping existing
artists it's also helping would-be
artists come out of their shell art
should be as diverse as the world we
live in you don't have to make something
that would hang in the MoMA to make
something that could hang on someone's
wall
my little terrifying I just got a sale
or touchdown I don't know what happened
what are we celebrating
it depends sometimes we celebrate big
deploys sometimes we celebrate new
artists sometimes we celebrate big sales
I'm gonna celebrate article and a great
shoot of small</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
