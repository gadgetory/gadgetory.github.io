current head of the machine learning
department at Carnegie Mellon University
in the future I believe that there will
be these coexistence between humans and
these artificial intelligence systems
that will be hopefully of service to
humanity and these AI systems will
involve systems that only handle the
digital world but there will be also
systems that move around like drones and
robots and autonomous cars so you have
these intelligence in the physical world
too not only on your cell phone on on
your computer but also more present
around us in any environment so what I'm
very much we're working on is the fact
that I would like these machines to be
able to explain themselves so to be
accountable for the decisions they make
to be transparent when Kobalt my robot
arrives to my office slightly late you
can say why are you late or which route
did you take because this problem these
issues that the robot when it moves in
the building I cannot see the robot and
therefore when it appears in front of my
office I would like to know more about
what did it do what it's actually
encountered on its experience by itself
coming from my lab to my office that
makes us eventually the humans trust
more these robots
trust more these machines because is AI
systems they are able to explain what's
behind their decisions or what's behind
their inferences or what's behind their
suggestions but I do believe the same
way that humans have limitations I speak
with an accent I don't play squash as
well as someone else that we that these
robots will also have limitations Alexa
for example cannot scramble eggs which
is perfectly fine as it doesn't have the
ability to move from place to place so
there is this concept of AI systems they
have
to be in symbiosis with everything else
with other information on the web with
other AI systems with humans next to
them with humans remote and becomes now
not a problem of actually developing the
AI system to be self-contained and all
with all the knowledge there and all the
capabilities but now it's just an AI
system that can recognize and tell when
it does not know or it needs more
information or I think these with some
probability but it's not that it can
solve all the problems upfront but it
can rely on all these other sources
around it the general AI problem is
extremely challenging and extremely
exciting now because there is so much
data there's so much data there's so
many people using the digital devices we
have seen a great success on these
assistant the intelligent assistance but
eventually more and more as the time
goes we are doing a lot of research on
these AI systems having impact on
problems more broad in society the
deciding traffic in a big city or
deciding or making great predictions
about climate and making recommendations
about all sorts of like decisions and
supporting humans in great decisions
they have to make about complicated and
very complex systems I really think that
the autonomous systems the research we
do in autonomous systems autonomous cars
autonomous robot it's a call to humanity
to be responsible it was invented by us
by humans it didn't come from the sky
from aliens it's our own discovery it's
the human mind that conceived such
technology so it's up to the human mind
also and humanity to make good uses and
responsible users and beneficial uses of
this technology and I have a lot of
trust that this will happen
you
