we finally got to see a bit more of
blackberry 10 on the blackberry 10 dev
alpha device it's still very frustrating
lea little that we've seen but it's the
same operating system that we got our
first look at at blackberry world in
orlando last month it's the same for
widgets on the front page and you have
piqued so you can swipe in from the
right side and go into your previous use
that and go through email threads like
that we got our most in-depth look at
the keyboard in blackberry 10 it's still
just an alpha we're not sure how far
along the keyboard itself is but in case
you can catch a blackberry world it has
a predictive type system so for example
if you say I will be there you type in
the tea and there and it will know that
you want to say there or it will guess
that you want to say there and you just
do a quick swipe in from T up to the top
of the screen it'll pop that letter that
word in there it's a pretty intuitive
system all the gestures make sense you
swipe back on the backspace key to
delete the last word in order to do caps
lock you hold down the shift key and you
swipe up a little bit as a little toggle
and to choose between different symbols
there's a symbols key as we've seen on
most keyboards around and you have two
different options there for more symbols
if you want them overall I would say
that the predictive type system is its
supposed to learn the more you use the
system over time blackberry tells us or
rim tells us that it'll learn the
phrases that you typically use and you
should be able to type out text message
is much quicker it's a complicated
system in that it's two different ways
of thinking when you usually type you're
telling the device what you want to say
and you're typing in each letter to get
exactly what you want to say when using
this system it usually guess is
something that's close to what you want
to say and it's like a decision if you
want to use their words or do you want
to use your own words well obviously
need to take a closer look at all that
when we get more time with blackberry 10
but for now this is a quick preview of
the keyboard
