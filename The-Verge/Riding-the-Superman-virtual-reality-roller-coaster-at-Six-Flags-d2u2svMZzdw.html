sick rollercoasters make a lot of people
say today I'm going to put those two
things together and hopefully not get
sick I'm at Six Flags in Maryland to
ride the new Superman virtual reality
roller coaster it's a roller coaster
plus the Samsung Galaxy gear put over
your face and the whole thing has been
synced up so that the roller coaster
ride becomes a virtual experience if you
have a virtual reality simulation where
you are going very quickly through a
simulated world you tend to get nausea
because you don't feel the movement and
the rotation and everything but if you
have this motion in the real world and a
virtual reality simulation that is
precisely synced so this similar to this
real lotion then it's just it's still a
roller coaster but you don't get any
nausea don't get dizzy so the key is to
precisely synchronize the virtual
reality ride to the real ride how do you
make sure it's precisely synchronous but
we have a special we call it the black
box that's traveling with the Train it's
equipped with sensors these sensors are
tracking the rotation of the coaster
wheel of one wheel of the roller coaster
so we know exactly where we are in the
track with our train and this
information gets transmitted to the
headsets to the VR headsets 30 times a
second and they make out of that a
fluent virtual reality ride
so I just got off the Superman VR
coaster and it was terrifying in the
best way possible with virtual reality
you can exaggerate everything about the
coaster you can turn a 45 degree climb
into a 90 degree drought plus you can't
see when a drop return is going to come
so it really catches you by surprise the
technology really changes the experience
I think it's something you have to try
to really understand it's not a virtual
reality experience it's not a roller
coaster experience it's something
different it's something new so we're
already capable of doing this with just
an ordinary Samsung smartphone what do
you feel it's gonna happen in the next
few years is this technology gets more
advanced yes there's a lot coming
actually I think we will have things
like augmented reality so you're not
encapsulated in virtual reality which is
cool and immersive but we can copy
things into the real world so we might
have see-through so stereoscopic vision
through the hardware or maybe like
things like the microsoft hololens that
would allow to project some things into
the real world that you're actually
watching you don't even have a display I
think this will be the next step so you
think I'll be able to ride a coaster and
have augmented reality is the same you
see actually the normal coaster as it is
but you have a monster attacking the
Rays or whatever that would be possible
but I think these are two different
approaches and two different kinds of
attractions and what we have here is
already a totally new attraction yeah
hey it's been packed with the verge okay
