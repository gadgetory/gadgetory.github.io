us to its design labs
to check out the Honeycomb Glacier.
It's a dual-screen design
that Intel believes
could be the future of gaming laptops.
PC makers have been toying
with this idea for years,
stuffing screens into the touchpad
or grafting additional
monitors onto the main display,
like a set of unwieldy wings.
But in the real world,
secondary screens
haven't really caught on.
The only example I can think of
is Apple's MacBook Pro with Touch Bar,
and I rarely hear anyone admit
to using and appreciating
that narrow strip of
touchscreen above the keyboard.
The people I know who
bought one did 'cause
it's the only way to get the
most powerful processors.
So what makes Intel's
prototype any different?
For starts, it's got a genuinely usable amount
of screen real estate above that keyboard.
This isn't just a
context-sensitive button panel
like Apple's Touch Bar,
it's a bona fide 12.3-inch mini monitor
with enough space to drop your
Slack and Discord chat window
or your Twitch streaming setup.
It could be your entire timeline
when you're scrubbing through footage
or stitching clips in Adobe Premiere.
And unlike a screen
built into your touchpad
or keyboard deck, you don't
have to keep bobbing your head
and changing your focus
between your main monitor
and your secondary screen.
Intel designed a clever hinge
that uses a tiny one-way roller clutch
to let you effortlessly prop
up both screens at any angle
and just push a button when it's time
to fold them back down.
The hinge doesn't make
for the sleekest laptop,
but it makes more sense to me
than always having to look down.
Then there's my favorite feature,
a Tobii eye-tracking camera
that lets you dart your eyes
to any window on your secondary screen
to automatically focus on it.
So you can immediately chat
with friends and co-workers
without alt + tabbing out of your game
or having to swipe a
mouse all the way over
to your second monitor.
And because some pro gamers
use Tobii to literally track
where their head's at during a game,
Intel decided to stick a
heart rate sensor right here
to give those training
sessions another useful metric.
Mind you, not all of this
works brilliantly quite yet.
Intel built this as a prototype,
using off-the-shelf parts,
including a screen sourced
from the automotive world.
That's why the bezels
are so much bigger here.
It's why the cool Tobii eye-tracking
monitor switching idea
is currently confined to a simple demo.
It's why there's no damn
mouse buttons on this trackpad,
and it's probably why the PC stutters
when I try to play a basic game,
because there's actually a fair amount
of processing power under this hood.
A 9th Gen, 45W, eight-core Intel
CPU overclocked to 60W,
with Intel GeForce GTX 1060 graphics (Correction: This should say Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060.)
also overclocked to 95W.
Similar to the Asus Zephyrus,
with that fancy compartment
that opens to allow additional air inside,
Intel's Honeycomb Glacier has
a special cooling solution
that fits underneath
that dual hinge screen,
one with a fan that naturally draws air
through a compartment whose chips
have been expressly laid out
for maximum cooling efficiency.
So hey, you know Intel's a chipmaker,
not a laptop designer,
so there's a chance
this'll never come out.
You'll never be able to buy one,
at least in this shape and form.
Perhaps manufacturers will take
pieces of the design, though,
like the dual hinges and
the secondary screen,
and those could be part of
your future gaming laptops.
But unusually, Intel says
there's enough interest
in this exact design from PC makers
that you might actually see it come out.
Until then, it's a cool
idea to think about.
Hey, thanks for watching,
and I've got a question for you:
if you've got a dual-screen
setup right now,
say a couple desktop monitors,
a laptop and external monitor,
or even a laptop and a tablet,
does this seem like a more
effective solution to you?
