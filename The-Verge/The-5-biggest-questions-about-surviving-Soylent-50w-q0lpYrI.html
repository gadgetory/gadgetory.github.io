here to talk about my Solon review now
since that review went live I've got
many questions about what it's like to
live on a nutritional meal replacement
for almost a month I'm here to answer
those questions ok number one question
and this was by the way far away at the
most frequently asked question was your
bathroom experience like and the way I
would describe it is normal but lighter
in volume if you catch my drift
and by the way to everyone who asked
that question shame on you did you try
mixing it with anything so Soylent
actually says that you can mix the
product with a variety of different
things they recommend heading and peanut
butter or chocolate a few different
things I didn't I wanted to do pure
Soylent and I wanted to do it without
any additional calories now this is a
good one how did you make the lead photo
was that real Soylent flying through the
air and why did you waste it our photo
director Michael Shane his vision for
this lead photo was to have two of our
video guys literally throwing Soylent at
me while he captured it on a still
camera and yes to answer your question
that was actual Soylent I know it's very
hard to get right now but I like to
think that at the end of the day is for
a good cause
why were you drinking diet coke wasn't
that banned so these were my rules that
I was following during this this little
experiment for a month
Soylent actually doesn't recommend that
you replace a hundred percent year food
with Soylent I went for the whole thing
you can do one hundred percent but
basically I couldn't survive without
caffeine so I added in a couple forms of
that and one final question would I ever
drink soil and again the answer
surprisingly is yes now when I started
this little experiment I didn't expect
that I would ever want to see the stuff
again but as a meal replacement for say
breakfast you're in a hurry lunch if
you're in a hurry totally makes sense
would I do it full-time no and I don't
recommend you do it full-time either</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
