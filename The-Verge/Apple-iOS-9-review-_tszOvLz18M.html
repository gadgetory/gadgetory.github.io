that a new version of iOS is headed to
millions of iPhones iPads and iPod
Touches around the world this time its
iOS 9 and it brings a familiar look with
a handful of new features iOS 9 is not
radically different from iOS 8 or even
iOS 7 but it includes some
forward-looking things that can really
change the platform in the future let's
start with how iOS 9 looks frankly
there's not much different here there's
a new font it's apples homegrown San
Francisco which debuted on the Apple
watch and it's also coming to the Mac
and a new recent app switcher when you
double click the home button I don't
really love the font though it has grown
on me but the app switcher is slower and
more annoying to use than the one at
replace other visual changes include
notifications sorted by date instead of
app which makes it much easier to clear
in bulk and a back button that lets you
quickly bounce back to the app you were
just using it's great but I wish Apple
spent some more time actually designing
the button as it is now it covers up
your signal bars and it's just a tiny
line of text as opposed to an icon or
something more noticeable Apple says our
battery life and performance
improvements in iOS 9 but recent iPhones
haven't really ever felt slow and I
haven't noticed much of a difference on
my iPhone 6 same with battery life I
haven't noticed a significant increase
in my usage whether I utilize the new
power saver mode or not but it's a new
addition to Siri where we can really see
the future of the platform in iOS 9 Siri
is bestowed with a bunch of new
capabilities including better voice
recognition and smarter voice searches
it also for the first time attempts to
be a dynamic assistant that predicts the
information you'll need next before you
ask for it that might be providing an
alert for traffic information to your
next meeting or showing you your most
contacted friends or most used apps when
you swipe left from the home screen that
new series screen also provides quick
shortcuts to searches and maps and
headlines from the new news app to get
the most of any of these new features
you really have to use Apple's native
apps such as mail or calendar and you
also have to rethink how you're using
your iPhone instead of swiping through
pages of apps tapping to open a folder
or opening an app and then finding what
you're looking for within that app it
can be easier to rely on Siri and
Apple's predictions to find what you're
looking for much quicker serious
advances are nice but they don't feel
quite like the future yet the ways I've
been using the new platform I haven't
really changed how I use apps or in
get the device I still mostly use Siri
to set my alarm for the next morning and
since I prefer third-party apps such as
Microsoft Outlook to apples mail or
calendar I don't see the smart
predictions all that often but I can't
see where the next iteration on this
idea perhaps integration of series new
intelligence with third-party apps could
change how I use my iPhone over on the
iPad there are more significant changes
if you happen to have a fairly new iPad
at least the iPad is finally getting
true multitasking features in iOS 9
including running two apps side by side
in a split screen there's also a picture
and picture option for watching video
while doing something else and a feature
that lets you temporarily slide one app
over another to quickly check something
before getting back to the task at hand
only the iPad air 2 and newer can take
advantage of the split-screen features
while older iPads can you slide over a
picture and picture and new keyboard
controls to make it easier to input and
edit text right now only Apple's own
apps work with the new multitasking
features but I expect the third-party
apps will quickly be updated to support
them Apple is also updated and added a
bunch of apps in iOS 9 notes is more
powerful and maps finally has transit
directions for example both are actually
good but not as full featured as
competitors like Evernote or Google Maps
passbook dot renamed to wallet for
whatever that's worth and the biggest
new app is news news is customisable
fast and stable but it feels a little
like it's reinventing the RSS wheel
we'll have to see how much support both
Apple and publishers put behind it
before we can really judge how good it
is let's face it you're going to update
to iOS 9 it's a fine operating system
that's fast reliable and stable it's
iterative like most of Apple's software
updates when you look closely in the
corners of it you can see the groundwork
for apples vision of the future of
personal computing where computers know
what we want before we do it's not quite
there yet but eventually that groundwork
will become a skyscraper and iOS 9 is
that first brick</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
