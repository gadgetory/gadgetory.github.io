kind of sort of Google's answer to Apple
earpods they're wireless earbuds though
not truly Wireless and they cost about
the same amount of money 159 bucks on
one hand they're really good wireless
earbuds to do a lot of the basics well
while also teasing that seemingly
inevitable future of having super
computers in our ears on the other hand
there are a couple of tiny nitpicky
flaws that when added together kind of
Mar the experience up front though we
have to start with one of the features
that Google's hyping the most about the
pixel buds and that's real-time
translation can you tell me where the
train station is what's a time Davian
sort of wrong can you tell me where the
bathroom is yes turn it into liquid
sugar that's good to hear
there's a toilet not far from here can
you tell me how to get to the train
station so let's go fast go straight and
turn right okay hello and thanks for
helping out do you know how to get to
the train station what's wrong about it
it would just be a bit like you're kind
of like it's using the imperative so it
would be a bit like another light to
just stop something okay tell me where I
could get to the time to get to the
train station like you would say can you
tell so this is as if I was a rude
five-year-old yes
hey dummy thank you for helping us with
this
wait so am i speaking into the app where
am i speaking at the pixel box I'm also
weird you are speaking into the app but
it's reading it out and English to me
oh so you can hear it in English so what
it's showing up here it's reading to me
would you rather hear both though I mean
can you tell me how to get to the train
station Wow oh yeah yeah what did it get
wrong just like a lot of grammar and
you're speaking to me in a really
informal way this seems to be a problem
with it is that it's very real it's
translating I'm sensing a little
hostility from the one common thread we
saw across all the languages is that the
translation is pretty crude so you're
probably gonna come across as sounding a
little bit rude or maybe even kind of
like a five-year-old and that's not a
problem with the pixel buds themselves
it's really just a problem with where
translation apps are at this point in
time and that's really all this is it's
not like the pixel buds are doing magic
to translate conversations it's just
leaning on the Google Translate app that
already probably exists on your phone
the weirdest thing for me is that with
pixel buds you're adding a whole nother
device into what is already an awkward
situation when you're trying to speak
somebody else's language and it makes it
a bit more impersonal my co-workers
didn't really seem to have much of a
problem with it just testing it out but
I know for myself I would probably
rather just use the app on the phone as
opposed to adding a whole nother device
into this situation now there may very
well be a time one day where everybody
is wearing the pixel buds and using them
to talk to people across languages and
borders but that future is not here yet
this current version of the product is
only teasing and it's not delivering on
it
Google assistant however is much further
along and here's the best thing about it
on the pixel beds it is stupid fast you
just tap the right earbud and you're
already talking to the assistant you
don't have to wait for it to confirm
that it's heard you or anything you just
tap talk and it's off to the races it's
so fast that I found myself begging for
reasons to use it I usually only use the
assistant for things like weather or a
especially on headphones that said I
think Google's assistant is the best of
the ones out there and having it less
than a second away definitely feels like
a genuine step forward I found myself
using it in ways that I never had like
asking it to tell me how long it'll take
me to get home on the subway or asking
it to read me the news while I walk from
the subway back home
so let's set all these fantastical and
futuristic features aside now because
while they might be useful in a pinch
what you're gonna be using the pixel
buds for the most is listening to music
that's coming from your phone and in the
right setting they do that really well
they reproduce audio really clearly
there's a little bit of depth to it
more than I expected to find on earbuds
this size and they'll do that for a
while to Google advertises about five
hours of listening time and I found that
as long as you're not using the
assistant a ton you'll get at least four
hours of what they're claiming but the
open air design of these earbuds Google
calls it semi occluded is a totally
double-edged experience on the one hand
it's good for situations like running
where you want to have sound from the
outside world coming in but on the other
hand it means that sound can totally
drown out the music listening experience
especially if you're in a big city like
New York I found myself hearing buses
trains traffic people walking by me
instead of the music that I wanted to
listen to there was even one point where
I actually heard the music from someone
else's headphones instead of my own
music that's annoying that brings us to
the last part of the experience with the
pixel buds which is the case I really
want to like this thing and for the most
part I do it's got a nice soft touch
finish to it as a couple extra chargers
worth of battery in it and a levy quick
charge the pixel buds 10 minutes will
give you about an hour which is awesome
the problem comes from just how finicky
the process is of getting the buds back
in the case you have to put them in one
by one and then you have to wrap the
cord around just the right way or else
the case won't close and Google even had
to put a sticker on the inside of the
case to teach people how to do that now
the way that you get pixel buzz if it in
your ears also has a couple issues you
have to tug on this little loop of the
cable that connects the two ear buds
together which is a nice idea but that
cable tends to slip over time and so I
found that pulling them out of the case
the cable has slipped or even when I
have them in my ears the cable slips and
I have to constantly readjust them to
keep them fitting in my ears the right
way now the touchpad on the right is
really fast for Google assistant which
is great and you can tap to play and
pause music and you can even swipe to
control the volume but it's super
sensitive and so you have to be careful
I found myself getting lots of
accidental taps and swipes especially
when I took earbuds out of my ears and
went to put them back in the case that
was really frustrating because I would
hear music starting to play again or I
would lose my place in a podcast it just
seems like an easy problem that Google
could fix if the earbuds know that
they're out of your ears now these are
admittedly little frustrations but when
you add them all up together it makes
for a more problematic experience than I
was expecting with pixel bugs there are
a lot of good ideas in this product and
I'm excited to see what Google does with
that going forward it's just painfully
obvious right now that this is their
first attempt at making wireless earbuds
thank you and it missed it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
