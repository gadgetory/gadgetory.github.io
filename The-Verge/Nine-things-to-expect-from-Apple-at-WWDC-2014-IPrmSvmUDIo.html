best product pipeline that I've that
I've seen at Apple in my 25 years at
Apple well the best product pipeline
you've seen in 25 years
it's right Bannen could you tell you I
you tell us about them I get to see it
tomorrow Oh every year Apple gathers a
huge crowd of its developers and walks
them through the future the Worldwide
Developer Conference has been the place
where Apple has launched iPhones
redesigned software and shown glimpses
of its most exciting and important
upcoming products this year it all
starts June 2nd and the rumor mill has
been churning for months with what we
will and won't see in San Francisco
let's start with iOS which is a staple
of WWDC last year's update was a
sweeping change in the look of the
platform but I OS 8 will really begin to
polish some of the rough edges while
introducing a number of key new features
the most important one seems to be
helpful
according to 905 Mac the new app will
collect data on information like blood
pressure activity heart rate and sleep
and will place it into carts that look a
lot like the passbook app it'll pull
from the phone's many sensors but might
also work nicely with a few accessories
oh yes of those now what about smart
homes what if your phone could unlock
your door when you get home turn your
lights on and welcome you home with just
the right song playing through your
living room speakers the Financial Times
has said that Apple will unveil home
automation software WWDC which would
mark a huge step into a new industry for
Apple one that Google just got into with
its recent acquisition of nest
rounding out the iOS 8 rumors are new
apps like preview and TextEdit
enhancements to Syria including Shazam
like song identification and public
transportation for Apple Maps finally
again not a huge reimagining of the
platform just a Polish and a paint job
and I don't know an edition or something
next let's talk oh s 10.10 called Sarah
and yes that is apparently the numbering
scheme Apple's going with as 10.9 s
follow up the Mac's operating system is
apparently getting a big design overhaul
one that puts it more in line with iOS 7
s bright and simple looks it'll still
work like the OS 10 you already know but
will start to feel a lot more like a
real companion to iOS it's a logical
next step they have an increasing number
of apps in common and a similar style
would make the two platforms feel even
more like one so iOS and OS 10 are
basically a given and while Apple's use
WWDC in the past to announce major
hardware generally speaking we don't
expect to see much outside of iterative
there that said there are two bigger
iPhones said to be on their way for late
summer or early fall multiple outlets
have reported that Apple is working on
iPhone models with a 4.7 inch display
and a 5.5 inch display both far bigger
than the 4-inch iPhone 5s it's hard to
say when they'll appear especially given
what are apparently real production
problems but it's not impossible that
we'll see one of them WWE see then
they're wild cards like Apple TV the
company has been talking about Apple TV
a lot lately and this week Apple's
senior vice president Eddy Cue revealed
that it's sold 20 million set-top boxes
so far it's been more than a hobby for a
while now and if Apple did want to set
up something like a new app ecosystem as
it gets ready to build a television its
annual developer conference is just the
place to do it and it's not just about
TVs of course the really big Apple rumor
of late has been the so called eyewash
Apple has yet to enter the wearable
field which is quickly becoming crowded
by some of its biggest competitors
including Samsung and Google and even
pebble and the phrase new product
categories keeps being thrown around by
Tim Cook and other Apple executives
something is coming and soon but watches
are a fashion product so maybe Apple has
been waiting to solicit expertise from
Beats the style focused audio company
that Apple just bought for three billion
dollars we're not expecting to hear
anything from them next week but we
might see newly minted Apple executives
dr. Dre and Jimmy IV as for Dre is long
long long in production album detox well
some things not even Apple can make
happen</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
