like you know with every camera drone
that I test out for The Verge if you let
go of the sticks it just sits there with
this one if you let go the sticks it's
going to fall
basically out of the sky you always have
to be working the throttle and like I
don't know what's what's the difference
it's like taking the training wheels off
you just hit the ground oh everybody's
been topper here for CES 2017 I'm not
actually at CES I'm in the desert near
Boulder City just outside the restricted
airspace for Las Vegas that's because
we're here for the CES of drones place
where everybody can fly these aircraft
without having to worry about cutting
somebody's nose off and the exciting
thing today is we get to try out the
dracco in the past when you want it to
have a racing drone you had to build it
yourself you have know how to program
and how to solder this is the first race
and run you can just buy off the shelf
and go a hundred miles an hour what are
the pieces that make this a racing drone
and you know differentiate it from like
the DJI phantom that everybody knows
it's basically trying to compare like a
Ferrari to just like a general minivan
or something like that like it's the in
terms of like the general idea is the
same but everything is just more
powerful right they obviously got four
motors for props on this required to fly
you've also got a camera up the front
here so this is the HD version of the
dracco so this actually streams 720p was
almost zero latency so this system is
very fast and that's required for racing
so you have to be able to dodge gates
dodge whatever you're flying around so
you know I've flown a lot of drones
doing reviews but these are you know
camera quads for consumers I feel like I
would have no idea how to handle
something that goes 100 miles an hour I
mean is it safe to like put this on the
shelf at Best Buy where anybody can grab
it yeah I would say the nice thing about
them is that you can to tone them down
so that if you're just learning you can
go beginner settings and I kind of
lowers down so you won't be able to 100
miles per hour maybe you can go like 30
kind of around the backyard if you break
something or if something's wrong
everything is modular around this device
in some shape or form if you break a
motor arm pop that out
tronics internally well protected so but
it's still managed to break it
replaceable
I mean I've flown in many many drones
but not a drone that goes 100 miles an
hour and his full manual and it's
different when you had like the fpv on
cuz like you're you don't have that
situational awareness so many ways this
could go wrong for me or for the people
around me
okay so they brought me out here where
I'm far away and maybe can't hurt
anybody and I'm gonna do my best to fly
this restaurant not crash or kill myself
should be fun all right here we go you
ready
oh yeah oh well too far okay how's that
better am i coming down drop it
look you just hit the ground oh why
let's go see what's left of this drunk
never gonna break it down for parts
anyway I was just helping disassembler
oh man sorry about that little guy I'm
still in one piece
well I've flown a lot of drones I
thought I knew what I was doing but as
soon as I put those fpv goggles on it
was a whole different ballgame
still got a lot to learn CES claims
another victim fly safe kids</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
