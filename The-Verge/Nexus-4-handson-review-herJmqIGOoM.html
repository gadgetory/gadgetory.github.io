we're taking a look at the Nexus 4 the
new flagship Android phone made by LG
for Google which is being sold unlocked
in the Google Play Store there's an 8
gigabyte version for $2.99 and a 16
gigabyte version for 349 and it's also
being sold by t-mobile on contract a 16
gig version goes for $1.99 the new
device replaces the Galaxy Nexus which
was made by Samsung I have to say from a
hardware standpoint it seems like a much
nicer phone the device looks very
similar to the Galaxy Nexus but when you
get a little bit closer you can see the
differences the Nexus 4 is not curved
the way the Galaxy Nexus is and it also
is made from just nicer materials it's
got a glass front and a glass back both
Gorilla Glass and it's wrapped in a soft
touch slightly chamfered band and at a
glance it does seem like a nicer phone
it feels good in your hand it's very
sturdy it doesn't feel like a piece of
plastic the screen is a little bit wider
it's got a 4.7 inch display that is a
1280 by 768 resolution it's an IPS LCD
display and it looks a lot nicer than
the Galaxy Nexus display did it's crisp
and clear the only negative is that
colors seem a little bit washed out on
it not just compared to a Super AMOLED
but even compared to something like the
display of the One X which uses a
basically the same technology it's got
two cameras there's an 8 megapixel
shooter on the back and a 1.3 megapixel
camera on the front the camera on the
phone is a lot better than the Galaxy
Nexus it takes nicer photos and it takes
better photos in low light which is
really important it's not the best
camera on a phone that's for sure
but it definitely gets the job done much
better than the previous version inside
it's got a Snapdragon CPU the s4 pro
which is clocked a 1.5 gigahertz Google
reps that I spoke with said that it's
the fastest phone on the planet whatever
that means there's 2 gigs of RAM inside
and it also has NFC and Wi-Fi and
Bluetooth interestingly it has wireless
charging built into it there's a
accessory that Google is selling called
the wireless charging orb and the Nexus
4 can just be placed on it and
charge the battery inside is a 2100
milliamp lithium battery it can't be
removed but I have to say battery life
was definitely better on this device
than on the Galaxy Nexus as I said the
back of the phone is glass and of course
glass does tend to break and I
accidentally knocked the review device
that I was using off of my kitchen table
onto the floor beneath it and it did
crack the back of the phone there's a
small hairline crack from the camera out
to the edge of the device you can't
really feel it but it's there and I
think when I was at Google Andy Rubin
had a phone which had a cracked back as
well so that's definitely maybe
something we're hearing about with this
device and is kind of a negative it's a
nice looking phone the design is not a
big departure from the last Nexus device
but it definitely seems like a more
expensive product there's some nice
attention to detail here as well for
instance on the back of the phone
there's an almost holographic stipple
pattern that you can't see in most light
but once in a while it gets picked up
and it's kind of cool looking from a
specs standpoint however I think the
most notable thing about this device is
that there is no LTE version now that's
not a very big deal if you live outside
of America but if you're in the US where
LTE is quite widespread now it's kind of
shocking now in some areas HSPA+ is
actually quite fast there are some
t-mobile spots where you can get very
fast download speeds almost equivalent
to LTE but for me during most of my
testing I was actually testing on AT&amp;amp;T
the fastest I saw was about 5m bits down
on AT&amp;amp;T HSPA Network whereas on a galaxy
s3 on their LTE network I was getting 25
or 30 down which is quite staggering and
quite a staggering difference
the lack of LTE is a huge disappointment
making this not really competitive with
the iPhone 5 or the latest crop of
Windows Phone devices as far as software
is concerned this phone is running the
newest version of Android which is jelly
bean 4.2 it said dot upgrade from the
last version but there are a handful of
really interesting new features for
starters they've added quick settings to
the notification menu which means you
can access your most-used settings
pretty quickly you can also get to this
menu by using a two finger gesture swipe
down on the
window which is pretty handy Google is
also introducing gesture typing which is
basically their version of swipe but it
works in conjunction with regular tap
typing on the keyboard and in my testing
was pretty good I don't think the
prediction is quite as good to swipe but
it's about 95 percent as good which is
basically good enough for me the camera
software has been updated significantly
Google it has employed a really
ingenious gesture-based interface for
the camera it's meant to work with just
thumb input and it allows you to get to
pretty much all of the settings for the
camera with just a gesture of a single
finger in practice it works really well
I was able to switch between settings
quickly and it just makes sense it's
actually surprising that it's taken
someone this long to come up with an
interface like this there's some other
camera updates it now has HDR mode and
most interestingly google has introduced
photosphere which basically lets you
take Street View photos anywhere that
you are so you can do a 360-degree shot
of anything and it is pretty fascinating
Google says the files are standard JPEGs
with some additional metadata and that
at some point you'll be able to tag
Google Maps with your photos and include
those photos in Google Maps so coming
soon to Google Maps Street View of your
bedroom Google's updated Gmail as well
after four versions of the software they
finally given it
pinch to zoom or shrink to fit
functionality for emails the iPhones
been doing this for obviously years and
Windows Phone does it and now Gmail has
the functionality they've also added a
swipe to delete or swipe to archive
function which is quite handy the
company's updated Google now
significantly in this version of Android
there are new cards that can find
beacons in your email for hotel
reservations or flight details and
they'll show you those cards when the
time is right there's also a few other
new additions movie information photo
cards and a handful of enhancements to
the service Google's also improved its
search here and given it a little bit of
a different look kind of falling in line
with the card style and search is just
excellent voice search in particular
stands out here it was unflinchingly
good and fast when I was using it all in
all this is a really nice upgrade from
the galaxy
excess but it's got some pretty big
negatives working against it at least
for me the lack of LTE is obviously a
problem and will be a problem for a lot
of users in the US and the fact that
it's got a glass back doesn't fill me
with a great sense of excitement mine is
already broken and I assume a lot of
users are gonna be complaining about
their backs breaking and I don't know
what kind of plan LG or Google has in
place for getting those backs fixed I
was really excited about this device and
I was anticipating the next Nexus as the
phone that I would be using for the
foreseeable future
but the fact that doesn't have LTE has
kind of thrown a monkey wrench into my
plans if you live in the US and you're
happy with HSPA+ on t-mobile or AT&amp;amp;T
then this is a great phone and if you
want the best version of Android you can
get this is the phone you should get if
you live in Europe your situation may be
similar and again it's an excellent
phone to buy but if you're looking for
an LTE device here in America you're
gonna have to look elsewhere</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
