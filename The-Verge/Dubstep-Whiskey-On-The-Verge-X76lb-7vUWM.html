bottle of whiskey that thought looked
really interesting and it was really
good so I actually just googled it and I
discovered it was made here in upstate
New York a Tuttle Town spirits which is
the first whiskey distillery to run in
New York since Prohibition and because
they're so new they're doing some things
in very traditional ways and they're
doing some things that are really
shaking things up
so we're here in a very special room
this is the room where you age the
whiskey this one and you use a process
called sonic maturation well it's to
encourage the exchange between the
whiskey and the wood one day I suggested
off you know off the top of my head that
if we ran a heavy baseline through the
room then that would agitate the liquid
in the barrels so we wouldn't have to
touch the barrels and the next day Brian
showed up with some subwoofers and a
loop tape well we were playing a rap
loop now I think Brian as well a rap
song but I don't know the one that
didn't wake me up in the middle of the
night
those regen the patented sonic
maturation we're in the process of doing
that now is that that patent application
it's like a drawing whiskey and then
like a picture of a subwoofer and I
don't know I didn't fill out the
application this really this is where it
all happens and that one definitely
looks like a Victorian time machine and
that's it that's a 500 nominee 524
gallon still it's only when you hold a
wrench for this size when you think
about how truly unimportant your job
writing about Android cell phones is so
has Jules Verne ever come down from one
of these columns and actually tried to
take your whiskey back in time not
inversion
did you ever like put out barrels of
list unit like smooth jazz or like deep
dubstep note we were looking for the
heavy bass jolt yeah to the liquid can
we come at so this thing can we can we
see what it looks like and magnify some
tunes put some new tunes through it yeah
sure you ever heard me dubstep no you
are about to
we're gonna whisk anything like Skrillex
we make high energy was high energy
whiskey yeah that's some club in whiskey
Goodman whiskey yeah yeah I'm just
thinking about it I just uh it's a good
name
I think we gotta go like I'm gonna know
it's try it but
so I asked you have you ever just talked
to the whiskey I think right at a
bedtime story
no not yet cuz yeah we got this guy on a
team Shaun Hollister with just an
incredible voice voice of generation
would you mind if I if I had Shaun read
your whiskey story no not at all maybe
it'll help by far though the most
impressive part is that she be you baby
by giving the lion's share of space of
the case to the GPU and using a PCI
Express riser card to any without
parallel to the motherboard the only
words managed to fit a full-sized dual
slot graphics card at the nines is
amazing shot
that that was amazing Mila and Paul are
back yeah drink yours bleep the wall
this can I just say brought the whiskey
I brought this is whiskey that is
listening to dubstep can I just say
Felix specifically yeah I don't know
that we had the right that cool guy
we're gonna taste we're gonna actually
have some right now this is exciting so
exciting and I'm extremely thick can I
just say it's basically impossible to
follow dr. Tyson no a ride in the car
and drank some stuff like that doesn't
work let's - you - Skrillex just dr.
Tyson yeah yeah dr. Tyson Skrillex isn't
going that what we need is dr. Tyson's
breathalyzer</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
