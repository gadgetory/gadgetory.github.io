goals toward commercial space travel I
wonder what the in-flight movie will be
I'm Jake a stern a kiss and this is 90
seconds on the verge SpaceX launched his
third supply mission to the
International Space Station this
afternoon the Falcon 9 rocket and
accompanying Dragon capsule took off
from Cape Canaveral with the goal of
rendezvous in with the space station on
Sunday morning they'll launch give
SpaceX a chance to test the next step in
its plan for a reusable rocket once the
Dragon capsule detaches the rocket will
attempt to slow itself and make a
controlled return to Earth but we fished
out of the ocean they're used again to
give you an idea of how expensive space
exploration can be a NASA space shuttle
launch cost around 450 million dollars
per mission and a lot of that money goes
toward building rockets that just crash
into the ocean afterward and are damaged
beyond repair but SpaceX has a chance to
change that its launches cost about 56
million dollars and Elon Musk says that
Ari's will rocket even cut that in half
well the chance of today's rocket
landing successfully isn't great it's
put between about 30 and 40 percent
SpaceX and NASA will still be breaking
new ground on the International Space
Station's the Dragon capsule headed for
the space station is carrying red
romaine lettuce and radishes these are
being kept inside an experimental plant
growth chamber it's part of a test
project meant to give astronauts a
source of fresh food of course all this
is just phase one for spacex musts
ultimate goal is to make commercial
space travel not just reality but also
an affordable one from one SpaceX check
out the verge coming up you're never to
add more fibers to astronaut diet NASA
sends 40 tons of Metamucil to the
International Space Station</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
