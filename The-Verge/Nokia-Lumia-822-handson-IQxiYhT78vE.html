verge and we're looking at nokia's lumia
822 on a Verizon's 4G LTE network so you
can see something's got the live tiles
from Windows Phone 8 and there's a few
inbuilt knock your apps here so you go
to city lens and a drive and alpha I'm
not quite sure exactly how this will
come out of the box but you can
obviously get the standard knock knock
your apps available here down the bottom
we've got the USB connector and the
speakers towards the left of the device
and we've got no buttons that's kind of
a standard approach from a nokia on
their windows phone devices up top we've
got the headphone jack and in around the
side we've got the volume up and down
the power button and in the standard
camera button which triggers the 8
megapixel camera and then around the
front we've obviously got a forward
facing camera as well and which is
available for skype any of the video
calling software when you compare it to
the Lumia 820 which the 822 is a variant
of and you can really start to notice
how the two devices stack up so on the
left you got the 822 and you can see
it's a little bit more chunky but when
you actually compare them in your hand
the 820 does feel a little bit heavier
and then the a cheap at the 822 on the
left here it's certainly a lot a lot
lighter and looking at the back of the
82 sometimes you've got a removable
cover in the same way that the 820 does
this one's the wireless one and Nokia
tells us that it's going to be a white
and grey addition to other than that
that's pretty standard affair you've got
the the SIM slot here and a battery and
there's no micro SD slot at the moment
that was a quick look at the nokia lumia
822 which will be available on verizon
and is a 4.3 inch device
