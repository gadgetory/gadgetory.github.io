show it's a show about gadgets on
YouTube which is where you are I'm Neil
I that's Paul hello this is Ashley hey
it's Ashley a second we're here in the
chat with you if you're watching this
live a lot of your questions comments
concerns we basically react to this the
whole time so that's cool we have a huge
show for you our friend Sam scheffers
here it's back we're gonna make him talk
about not new technology but kick ass
old technology you want to talk about
some sidekicks with him we have some
great questions for a circuit breaker
and then Dan Seifert is gonna join us
when we talk about Android wear wear has
been rebranded to wear OS friendly
breakfast wearable but first let's start
with Ashley you're gonna talk to us
about avatars yeah like digital emoji
avatars right it's a thing Paul you know
video game avatars have been a big
forever yeah I could never get my me to
look like myself yeah you make a
character to play around and to
represent you in the world it wasn't
it's important because you're in a
digital world that's you visualization
it's also like a huge business in game
it's like people like the game company
saw like clothes and like let's change
accessories redo habit ours that's a big
that's changed valve as a company yeah
today was hat day at the verge and if
you were a hat you got cake and no one
told me about it anyway okay so video
game avatars are one thing but now we're
seeing kind of these emoji avatars
digital representation coming to more
messaging apps like the personal
exchanged you have a friend it's like
there's an emoji with the iPhone Samsung
just recently debuted their AR emoji and
then bitmoji which is now owned by Snap
is kind of like the originals that we're
trying to do this so I'm gonna just kind
of walk you guys through a little bit of
the market basically what we're seeing
now I feel like an important point to
make here I bet our audience knows this
but like boom og was first but Apple put
out an emoji and there's like a wave of
hype but there's been a lot of these for
a while right yeah like
multiple companies have tried to do this
so bitmoji does stickers and they
actually relaunch this new bitmoji
deluxe in January and this is mine it's
kind of hard to see here but these are
mine and they're very accurate
you've only made one face for this and
then they adapt and they put it in
different situations and then a company
called gab C came around and I think we
actually have video footage because
right now their app is not on the App
Store currently but just to show you
guys this came out over the summer and
it was kind of like the video version of
bitmoji so it came out the internet kind
of freaked out about it Casey Newton
wrote a piece about this and then
snapchat was like okay there we go so
you can see this is sort of like your
bitmoji but doing
stuff in a real world environment like
we are and so that came out at the time
bitmoji wasn't doing this and now the
fourth yeah
Samsung sorry snapchat has introduced a
way to do it with your bitmoji in
snapchat I can't say what I wanted to do
it's not masking my face or anything
like that but it's good till for this
there is still a company there's no
company there's still company and pulled
them they pulled it themselves cuz I got
eaten I can't say too much okay mmm okay
say they're still around okay yeah so
you don't have to make a new bitmoji for
this analogy this is just mine is
pulling bitmoji is on my snap it's
pulling from my bitmoji a snapchat and
now it's a good merging correct and so
that's me
in doing the AR Iron Man we you come on
and done a ton of AR demos with us but
this is the AR most people know about ya
stop line and that's like a more
theoretical question I have is like this
it's my face it's masked but it's not
mass like if I had a full mask on it
would be mask my face is this considered
a digital AR emoji I would say no yeah
like I'm curious where the distinction
is because so if we look at an emoji
[Laughter]
there's masks that cover your face
entirely or
that kind of change your face and then
there's avatars that are not your face
they are representation right that are
masked to your facial features so like
here with an emoji the Fox is my face
like it's talking to me if I go like
this as Neal I have points that loves to
point out you can't really well I can
wink with this eye and cannot wink so
this is a true story
why don't we did the iPhone 10 review I
was playing with this and I was on a
phone with Apple before a publisher of
you ask all my follow-up questions I was
like I can't blink and they're like we
are aware the blinking is not yet
supported by an emoji it's a huge thing
you do arguably the biggest linking it's
a it's a big thing tough
so it's interesting with this and we
were talking about emoji earlier and you
know when the iPhone 10 came out
everyone is doing an emoji karaoke
animal you don't see him anymore
like that wave came and went and my
theory is like twofold one the often
tense really expensive so like they sell
a lot of them but they're selling them
to people who are maybe not incentivized
to like make goofy internet memes right
like the main creators can't afford it
because the meme sales are poor and then
it's actually really hard to get him out
of here
yeah like you can send you can text one
to yourself a lot of people and that has
a 10 second limit and a lot of people we
actually have a how-to on our site it's
like just hit the screen recorder and
then like crop and export that file
hmm so I think this is actually a killer
creativity tool mmm that is just in sort
of classic Apple fashion just like
harder to use and harder to share than
it should be well and you can't even get
creative with the ones it's like
snapchat Paul could tomorrow make a lens
and submit it here in Apple you're
playing just with their specific version
of emoji thank you there's no bitmoji
equivalent so it's just they're curious
exactly this bunny looks angry and
stoned every I find myself wondering
like
tough it's a really angry rabbit yeah
it's true
so then this is a little bit similar to
bitmoji but this is going off we'll see
with Samsung you take a selfie Google
actually created a feature for ello
everyone's favorite message right now
you can take a selfie and it will turn
your it will use your face as
inspiration to create art so this is
based off of the selfie that I took I'll
send that this is a portal like that's
supposed to be and it's not too far you
can actually also customize it I think I
can do actually I want you know the chat
is thinking about setting my GoFundMe
yes you can actually add the day's like
you can customize if you feel like it
wasn't an accurate representation of you
so this is another way that Google is
trying to take inspiration like it's
looking through the camera at you taking
your photo and trying to create you as
an animation or as a character but you
can also use your own liberty too so
it's kind of cool yeah like iLike I
think it's neat they partner with
artists to do it and I think their
styles are all different and they're
nice a good service that we've done here
today on the circuit breaker show is
we've shown anyone what's the only
background for owl you can customise
your conversation background yeah when
did that change thank seems like it's
breaking down like three lines right
like how do you make them mm-hmm are
they totally fake or they like
representative of you in some way or
they just like a cartoon and then how do
you like share them right and the idea
that these are tied to a messaging app
seems interesting to me because that's
obviously one audience that you have
this is machinima like this is you
you're using computer animation to like
do stuff the nice thing about snapchat
is that has a messaging component and
like a broadcasting well am bitmoji is a
keyboard to the stickers not the AR part
of it but the keyboard is like meant to
be in any messaging app that you use I
went through a wild bitmoji keyboard
phase oh really
my family was like you
have to stop like my cousin who sat me
down and was like I am very annoyed with
you I just really not for me yeah
it is very extra and it's weird to me
because bitmoji is so tied with snap but
there's certain snap features like with
a maps right it's all bit modes he's
like I don't want to be represented like
that in the world they're so well these
are the Samsung AR emoji and someone in
the chat actually asked us to predict if
Samsung will ever talk about these again
after the s9 launch so yeah so Samsung
has found another way to do this which
is by you taking a selfie and then it
producing an animated version of you but
I think they just didn't get it right
looks like it's had a stroke yeah thanks
so much
she's at my face I don't know what are
you wearing the clothing options are
terrible which you'll see who can we do
you're gonna create one I'm going in a
workout suit okay I took this one with
my glasses on and what is interesting is
it did pick up on my birthmark so it's
really doing photo see that's like too
uncanny valley yeah I was a little oh
okay
this is without oh this is your other
outfit choice
okay that one looks good you look like a
mean librarian yeah that's totally my
aesthetic if I can there goes all right
okay there you go just in case you
missed it the first time great outfit
it's me I mean I think it's like very
photorealistic mm-hmm I don't know if
that's what you want and the mappings
really bad - I just want camera yeah
it's but still like snapchat on my
success does a better job what if this
works really well wouldn't it be cool if
it works well then just like take a
video so new guys gonna I can't be in it
okay take your selfie I just push button
yeah okay let's see what kind of old man
this thing makes me how do worry
it's creating his moji is my nightmare
these are not none of these are my
skintone I hate this Wow all right let's
just come y'all take a look at this
horrifying situation all of this is bad
what does that say
that's his figure no little bit of
lazing this is all bad this is all bad
that's this is bad terrible color
Samsung has read my coverage this is as
close as against everyone picks out
that's a dude that's like the one I
think it's acceptable what like what is
this time and that is just like another
it's like ankle length pants this is a
professor who doesn't know what he's
doing he's hit it doesn't look like you
and I will say this looks like Sam all
right and then so then it creates gifts
for you that you can use it any
messaging service does not look like me
so now you could film a video if you
wanted and send it wherever you want
I hate it so much this is why I'm an
emoji only okay fair after that right
seriously why I just draw pictures for
people and send them letters in the mail
I'm saying that it's horrible
I'm I'm supposed to be a fox okay all
right we've got a great circuit breaker
for you these are questions that come
from you in our chat in our comments we
try to answer them as deeply as we can
Jake and hi and have a couple for you
take it away
today we have a bunch of questions about
fortnight I've never actually played
four nights we have hi I'm here to
answer them I've played for tonight so
is I'm way ahead
all of the qualification you need we
have a whole bunch of questions from
YouTube but first I just want to get
started I hadn't heard that much about
fortnight until like two weeks ago now
it seems to be everywhere just quickly
what is fortnight and why is it blowing
up right now so for tonight is a game
that launched last year it's actually
very similar to pub G player unknowns
battlegrounds but the big thing with
fortnight is that fortnight is free
sounds great yeah cool all right so what
is our first question we've got one from
Lex is how do you think this changes the
landscape of mobile gaming which
franchise should follow suit so another
thing for tonight's actually changing
the landscape of mobile gaming that much
just to backtrack a bit fortnight is in
the news not only because it's one of
the most popular games in the world
right now but because they just launched
a mobile version on iOS that's in beta
at the beginning of this week pub G
actually then follow that up by
launching its mobile version which had
been out in China and other regions in
US and Canada just after fortnight so
now you have these big games on mobile
for the first time which is really
interesting but I don't think it's gonna
change the landscape that much these are
very specific very popular games like
riding this edge of popularity and at
the end of the day there's still console
and PC games that are really meant to be
played with a controller and a mouse and
keyboard and just porting them one to
one from console just doesn't seem like
a viable strategy that we're gonna see
other Studios necessarily doing it
what's the thinking behind bringing
these to console or to mobile because it
doesn't seem like that's the normal
place for them so part of the experience
of 49 pub gr you have these big hundred
person matches and the goal there then
is just get the biggest possible player
base as possible so you can have these
games and when you bring mobile into the
mix with all the ios and android phones
out there that's a huge player base and
one of the cool things is that they are
working on cross play so right now you
can't but in the future at least for
fortnight you'll be able to take
fortnight and play it on your phone
against someone on xbox and someone on a
PC you all in one match you will
immediately get destroyed because you're
using
touchscreen and everyone else has a
mouse and keyboard but it'll be possible
just kind of cool yeah that is a very
good segue because there next question
which have a two-parter that is
partially about cross play the first is
do you think for tonight will ever be
cross-platform across all consoles and
the second question is coming up well
fur it out we can dress this one yeah so
the answer in a word is probably not
that's two words but yeah here's the
thing cross play is in theory possible
we know it's possible with fortnight
fortnight accidentally turned it on last
year and you could play against ps4 and
Xbox for like a weekend it happened and
then they sent out an apology saying
that they'd made a mistake so it's
technically possible it's possible with
other games you have rocket League
enables cross play between switch Xbox
switch xbox pc minecraft is on a whole
bunch of things you admin out in all
these situations as Sony who doesn't
want enable cross play the reason for
this is very simple Sony sells more
consoles than anyone else and is leaving
the industry so it's not in their best
interests to make it you know more
convenient for you to not own a
Playstation it makes sense it sucks it's
probably not changing anytime soon so
that brings the second bonus question is
do you think having cross-platform
gaming is a gimmick I mean you kind of
got into whether it's difficult because
it seems to is just be Sony doesn't want
you so from a technical perspective I
don't think it's that difficult for them
to implement I swear that's a gimmick I
don't really think we're gonna see a lot
of yeah loss platform people doing this
what I would ask is I mean is that even
an enjoyable experience because you're
playing a shooter which is very
fast-paced needs a lot of precision on
mobile and you're playing it potentially
against people who are much better
suited to play those games because
they're on PC yeah so part of it is also
that like switch mentality that you can
played anywhere in the world and that's
kind of cool but in terms of like
practical play I don't think you're
gonna really see too much of it being
done just because you're gonna get
destroyed once that's turned on it is
optional like you don't need to play
cross play you can just play against
people on phones and that's like a much
more viable experience
okay our next question is from somebody
who is hoping to play for tonight it's
from Tommy I'm 11 and my dad disagrees
with all the shooting games as a point
but however I would love to be able to
play fortnight on my phone or ps4 does
anyone have any tips at Aggies Brits who
persuade my dad to let me to play I feel
free my heart goes out to Tommy the
biggest problem with Tommy is that his
dad is technically in the right
fortnight and pub G are both rated T for
T and by the ESRB which in theory means
that they recommend that therefore
people aged 13 and up and Tommy's 11
I'll have better luck in Europe they're
both rated Peggy 12 there I mean these
are just recommendations it's really
what parents and children on their own
decide to work out together so maybe you
offer to do more chores or see if your
dad will try the game and see pub G it's
not the fortnight especially is this
cartoony it's not that violent there's
no blood I'm not a parent so I'm not
qualified to give advice on this but I'm
on Tommy's team Tommy's dad if you're
watching give him a chance this was very
good like indie game scene too doesn't
it is that that is where I would be if I
was looking for some games to play all
right that's yes fair and our final
question week's got a tweet from Dancy
freezing me on the show later is for
tonight anything like dots damn
fortnight it is exactly like dots there
it's basically just a dots clone you
should dive right in
sounds great next up we have Sam
Scheffer with some retro phones is it is
it live so are we live I just totally
ruined that segue I think we can unplug
these now trying coming up yeah we've
seen we've known each other do you know
how long it's been
we are at Sam when he was 17 19 I
believe it was legal for you and then he
worked a bunch of other places and now
he's an independent mm-hmm Jake said
about you he was like he's a pioneer of
a
- dove social platforms Sam is living
something like that he's here to talk
about sidekicks so we want to bring on
our friends to talk about their favorite
old tech because we love ol tech on the
show I think it's so cool we did a whole
bunch of iPods a few weeks ago but you
we asked you what's your favorite old
tech and you told the sidekicks a
sidekick LX specifically I know X so
tell us what this is first of all this
is uh this was one of the oh yeah nice
we've got the overhead camera over here
this was I would I would argue the best
sidekick that ever came out this is the
sidekick LX it came in two or three
colors it was released at the end of
2007 and I got it then the original
iPhone had come out in June of 2007 and
I saw it and thought it was really
stupid frankly because I didn't
understand what you could do with a
touchscreen phone and you had the the
flip out screen the physical keyboard
there's the LED indicator also and this
to me was just spoke very highly of you
know kind of mobile development nothing
like this existed this kind of like
bubbly scrolling UI and we were on
singular as a family back then I jumped
into mobile I remember in high school a
couple of girls actually my friend
Ashley had like the sidekick - or
sidekick 3 in high school I was like
that is just the dopest phone and I was
the only one in my high school that had
the sidekick Alex there was one person
who had an iPhone original and I was
rocking this and I just remember just
like yeah I'm the coolest dude in school
no question about it and yeah nothing
like this existed back then you gotta
remember 2008 was so different like the
phone came with aim back then no one was
really on Facebook back then and the
mobile landscape was vastly different
sonic was an Andy Rubin project this is
one that you did Dan restarted Android
and then was fired from Android and now
he started essential yeah but this model
robots at some point but Andy Rubin is
like one of the godfathers of Nobel's
this so many of his ideas still to this
day I like embodied in this device so
can you walk me through how you actually
use the
totally so just for the viewers
information someone sent me these I
would always talk about on Twitter and
other social about how much I missed
this phone with the physical keyboard so
thanks whoever sent me these I had the
blue version this is the mocha version
so there's buttons on the face here
there's bonds on the edges here but the
most important thing is the flip out
screen and if you watch it really slowly
you don't even notice the animation of
when the screen actually goes upside
down very good tech 4-pack that physical
keyboard full QWERTY keyboard I just
messages are about to be in here right
now text message inbox empty how do you
I don't even know how to do this new
message alright so if we're gonna type
in here hey what's going on yeah this is
a great the show we I mean it takes some
getting used to right like I've been
smash away on glass for 10 years but I
remember having this thing back in high
school I got so fast I'm so not used to
this and then yeah this is the operating
system there were no apps there was a
there was a couple of games on here menu
shift L I think brings up a there's like
a secret game or something built into
here but yeah just I just want to
contextualize again 2008 was so much
different than 2004 this landscape but
then I tried an iPhone for the first
time and you know this was such a this
device acted in two orientations but the
iPhone was like a true portrait you know
three and a half inch device and I tried
it was Google Maps I remember like
looking looking at the blip I thought it
was crazy how you could track be tracked
in real time like we were on a bus
together me and my friend
Ramy who had the phone and then like a
month or two later I got to play with it
again and I saw the threaded text or
yeah the text messages were threaded in
iOS and if you remember back in the day
when you had a flip phone it was just
message message message there was no
threading so those two things kind of
sold me and then like so the iPhone 3G
redesign faster all that stuff so I
ditched this I sold the sidekick to pay
for the to pay for the iPhone 3G she was
like sidekick culture and you're in your
world
cuz I mean it was it was a phone but I
didn't have any like integrated services
there's only excite like you know
blackberry bbm yeah there was a reason
why people a big reason of why people
got this phone is because it had a
built-in yahoo messenger Amazon
messenger built-in phone address book it
had a browser to like really crappy
browser for back and then I guess we
could just do one more demo here let's
show off the camera how great it is what
were you upgrading from when you got
this I was on a if anyone remembers this
is a real throwback here this is it was
a t-mobile MDA so it was a touchscreen
what HTC device with a pen it was
running windows mobile 6.5 or something
with it was a capacitive touchscreen
you're giving up a lot of a lot of
functionality there yeah but for this OS
that's the camera here the framerate is
awfully slow now your good advice to you
this got two to three photos remaining
here but I just want to show like how
slow let's take a picture in Eli here I
keep wanting to touch the screen oh my
god it's a flash the my favorite things
about this device though the flip out
screen for sure a physical keyboard and
then I miss the LED indicator yeah wait
that was like you can just glance over
at your phone and within a second you
knew what kind of message you had to do
do any flagship does the this s9 have an
LED indicator on it does it does it does
in the top right yeah I know you can you
change it Dan by the Dan series in
expertise did can you set it to like new
text messages blue or
okay okay and then also the only text
message tone for this was new message it
said new message yeah what's interesting
to me is like the code like this thing
wasn't like a bunch of jay-z videos sooo
there was a Dwyane Wade sidekick it was
a Tony Hawk sidekick they got big
celebrity endorsements and I remember
the commercials were always so cool I
hate that oh yeah this was like there
was definitely culture behind this like
this is gonna sound really ridiculous
but like if you had a sidekick you were
cool like it was definitely associate
like the same way beats by dre when they
came out we're like the cool thing to
have I feel like this was very cool to
have I don't think was too hard to get
on contract I paid like 200 or 250 or
something like that I remember breaking
even on the sale but my dad had a friend
at a cell phone store so I definitely
odd hooked up Erik and Jared are saying
the pixel two has an LED indicator bran
is saying she's light flow for LED
control ooh
that's that's good and then Erik is also
saying he misses his LG MV touch like
there was a moment I think this is the
moment of like the last of the feature
phones yep and they got really crazy for
a while like remember the lg chocolate
yep those are the hottest phone on
Verizon for a minute and the sliding up
you know I think you're absolutely right
it was this was kind of the turning
point for all cell phones are gonna be
glass with touch screens and this was
yeah this was it but I I dearly miss it
I want to pour one out for Sony Ericsson
Ericsson w8i
we're gonna bring on the show and let's
pour one out for dieter and his palms
with the physical keyboards yeah rest of
you I don't buy this physically I've
never understood it every time one of
those new BlackBerry's comes out and I
pick it up like yeah I'm a businessman
now and then I it's just
I'm curious if the chat oh one plus has
an LED indicators you okay I know it's
weird we have these phones on the show
all the time and I never see their LED I
think they're like disabled I feel like
they're not like that the companies
aren't pushing that as a feature but
they're so underrated ly good just for
the kind of glancing capabilities I feel
like because if you look at your iPhone
it's just a black slate with the screen
people are just naming phones that were
supposed to be iPhone killers oh the
other thing people are pointing out Rev
Atlas is points out in the chat these
are manufactured Annie Rubin HTC he goes
he does Android who is he partner with
to build the first Android phone
HTC big chin this is a sharp that's
sharp this is a sharp phone yeah but the
first HTC was a g1 the first a t-mobile
g1 was HTC right Dan yeah it was yeah
but no this was this was sharp because
this was just a brand the t-mobile yeah
there's a lot was like the lastest ditch
effort for that right there was like a
sidekick slide and then they just got
really bad really once they took away
this it's like come on what are you
either doing yeah III think I want to I
want to put one of these on the shelf
donate one of these to the archives yeah
is that appropriate yeah yeah I'm just
gonna put it just like I'm just gonna
put it right here and then I'm gonna
come back to the table then you can
transition that on there and let that
die the battery will just die yeah it's
another show-within-a-show
it's called hot tips just wants it all
segment begins it's your friend Paul
Miller I'm great at a lot of things I
can program in multiple languages
I can throw and catch a frisbee I can
draw really good logos but the thing I
can't do is tell you how to live your
life and that's why I've asked my kind
in supportive colleagues here at the
verge to help me out with with something
I'm calling
tips d-verb oh hey I'm doing hot tips
this week yeah I don't want to know if
you had in hot tips my first hot tip is
if you have a weird name when you go to
Starbucks pick a different name Peter
with a D I just I tell people my name is
Peter at Starbucks because it's just way
easier fake name at Starbucks but you
have to use the same fake name every
time because if you don't you're gonna
forget what your fake name is so when
dieter gets his coffee Peter all right
we're about to get a hot tip from Thomas
Ricker my favorite Dutchman wonder where
you're gonna go with it okay so one of
the tips that one of things that I use
in iOS I don't think a lot of people
know about is shared shopping lists hmm
and what you can do is you can create
shared lists by going in setting up
sharing at a person and I can use Paul
so I can add that and then you'll
receive a notification on your iPhone or
maybe your iPad ooh I got it invitation
to share a reminders list of Thomas
Ricker
okay right now the list is empty it also
shows up empty for me so there's nothing
in it I get a confirmation that you
accepted the invitation hey Siri add
bread to the shopping list so added
bread to the shopping list and now what
you're gonna see is bread so that's
great because my wife and I I mean we're
separate during the day and we usually
shop every day because we live in a big
city and this way whoever goes to the
store will see the updated list and they
can buy things and then if you tap the
little checkbox then it'll disappear in
Europe we just buy one slice of bread at
a time it's very frugal Thank You Thomas
a real appreciative Danny ha tips
you want a real tech tip yeah okay so
I've been saying lately people should
pay for tinder
why do you pay for tender I don't have
agenda right now I suggest paying for
tinder because I've spent many hours of
my life swiping onto there and it is a
profound waste of time honestly it is
and if you pay for dinner you basically
get a page of just people who are
already select right on you right so
it's kind of like a catalog like you're
shopping for people and you can just say
yes or no and you know they'll like you
back regardless you can't pay for tinder
no matter what Ashley says because then
you just get thousands and thousands of
choices and you have to scroll through
them like a like a like a DVD catalog
it's terrible it's so depressing and so
bleakest thing that's ever happened to
me
probably a good idea terrible
relationship because of a dating actor
I'm really confused now okay so I've got
Ashley says money for for relationships
Caitlyn no money Lizzie wait what were
you saying someone's in a relationship
and they have a cool idea don't listen
to it so hot tips I guess you could say
this this one was learning a lot we're
back Paul always a delight my friend
thank you all right Dan hey I'm here
there is news this week yeah so believe
it or not there was Android SmartWatch
news because there's a there's a big
watch conference going on yeah okay so
the news is that Android wear is dead
long live Android wear it's dead it is
now where OS right or where O's as I
like
Google renamed is where us Google
renamed it and I think the primary
reason that Google renamed it is because
the company claims that one out of three
of these wear smartwatches is used with
an iPhone and so like to clear up
confusion that like you don't need an
Android use this we're taking Android
Abhinay yeah which seems to be a running
theme at Google they're taking Android
under the name of things and the reason
that the announcement was made this week
or last week was because this week is
Baselworld or basel world out in
switzerland which is the big watch
conference in here but that's she's
really weak to show up at a conference
is the thing I would say the garbage is
inappropriate 20% brush kinda feels like
like I mean so Android wears burner for
a number of years actually much before
the I Apple watch and it's kind of just
faltered and tripped and stumbled and
now we're at a point where we're 2.0
came out Oh over a year ago now this is
the Google's LG watch sport which was
like one of the flagship watches with
the wear 2.0 launch and nothing has
really happened since then basically
fashion brands have taken it over and so
right now this is the Movado Kinect
that's 600 bucks
and and so fossil Louis Vuitton and a
bunch of other fashion brands have
released smartwatches using Google's
SmartWatch platform but the tech
companies really haven't done anything
they've kind of backed up all out of it
and just left it to the smart are the
fashion moments and the the issue that
that presents is you get some some
nice-looking watches I'm wearing let's
see if I can here I'm wearing one of the
more recent ones this is the Skagen
foster which was announced at CES nice
it's a nice looking watch it is
right sighs it is sharp looking it
doesn't really scream I'm wearing a
SmartWatch it's you know got good design
it's comfortable to wear but it has
fewer features then this one does and
you know you might not care about all
those features like this one has LTE and
GPS and NFC for mobile payments and
things like that but maybe you care
about one of them and this doesn't
really have any of them cost this one's
for 275 your problem is this is the
Apple watch if you have an iPhone this
can do everything it can also send
messages without none of these can do
with an iPhone you know it has whatever
nonsense iPhone I watch apps exist they
just like not a big deal
but if you're in Apple's ecosystem and
you have an iPhone this is just such a
better option it really is I mean I've
been using this paired with my iPhone to
see what that experience is like and
it's pretty miserable you can't do
anything with the notifications you
can't archive your emails easily you
can't reply to messages you can't easily
control what notifications you get sent
to the watch and not sent to the watch
and things like that
so it's it's it's definitely a subpar
Sorenstam Apple watch
Frank in the chat says I have a moto 360
too and there's a waste of money I mean
I that's like to me Apple spent so I
don't write the first Apple watch came
out in the first line of my review which
is a huge big anticipated all the
attention Tim Cook's first new product
line the first sign of our review the
first Apple watch was it's kind of slow
and the last line was you shouldn't
spend money on what it looks like until
they figure out what it's for yeah
there's a pretty very medium review
since then they have made it
substantially faster they have
completely redone the interface twice
basically mmm it's a pair away a bunch
of unnecessary functions they've really
backed away from apps as far as I can
tell and they've really focused it on
fitness and then depending a patient's
like apples so bad at notifications
being like they focus on notifications
and just died that's a that's a form of
focus I reviewed the Apple watch 3 last
fall and it's it's like you said much
faster the software is easier to use and
more intuitive it's much more useful
than before
it's still very much an apple watching
very much not for everybody but it is
making forward steps at least so that's
where kind of Google's know if someone's
up familiar with where OS you just could
you run me through what is the basic UI
like so one of the things that is
different about where OS versus say the
Apple watch is you can customize the
watch face extensively you can download
third-party watch faces you can
customize look this one you know has
this much face here that you can
customize all these different cells to
do different things which is pretty
extensive but you can also download
third-party ones so you can swipe
through them very easily
it also does have apps you push the
button on the side this one has a little
spinny dial like a digital crown and you
can access your apps it is also a
touchscreen but it's your basic set of
apps there's not really anything
different here from the Apple watch the
difference being that there isn't a ton
of third-party apps that you actually
care to use on this that you might find
on the Apple watch you not likely to
find them here with Android wear 2.0
which is no guess where OS 2.0 Google
actually put the app store directly on
the watch so you can download apps
directly to the watch without using your
phone and that kind of is the clunkiest
thing in the world it is rather slow
it's hard this one's not connected but
it's hard to find apps it's loaded
download them it's not a pleasant
experience but that's that workaround
exists simply because of how impossible
would be for Google to get apps on these
when it's connected to an iPhone Android
wear so it has the Google assistant you
can say okay Google and it'll wake up
and you can use her voice command the
the Google now that exists in 2014 when
Android wear first launched basically
doesn't exist today Google's kind of
iterated on it changes so many times it
became now on top on the phone and
that's something else and now it's a
Google assistant and that like Norfolk
floor like useful information cards yeah
don't really show up in many places
anymore and they don't really show up on
your wrist
what the transition has been to things
like watch faces that you can put your
upcoming appointments or calendar
entries in you can put your step count
you can put weather and things like that
you can customize those complications
you know have these like interstitial
interruptions this is one maybe more two
others has the idea of the watch is
existing separate from your phone I just
don't think anybody's really figured out
how to make it an interface that works
great with this I don't think anybody's
really figured out what they're for
beyond hey I'm lucky I have a job that
makes me walk around a lot mmm right I'm
a nurse or a doctor or something I'm you
know a server like those people I love
them I have a friend who worked as a
worker in like a high-end art gallery
and she wasn't allowed to use her phone
when she wasn't working she loved travel
watch cuz she would be able to see and
respond text great that's all great it's
a little remote control for your phone I
think that's it that's Android where's
big struggle and why I think why the
fashion brands have adopted it because
you're just buying this fashionable
thing and then in six months they can
put a new color or they can like scrap
it a year later and the new design
because they're there cycles are
different than the tech cycles the other
thing that is seems to be with Google's
watches that has stalled is the actual
technology development so you can see
these are all pretty sizable watches
especially these two even the Skagen
it's comfortable on mice my wrists but
if you have a smaller wrist you're
you're probably find it large and this
is a big watch and you know it's
considerably smaller apples on its third
generation a processor in there this is
a brand-new watches just announced at
CES this year it has a two year old
Qualcomm processor in it so the the
processors are not getting smaller or
more efficient or more powerful that
would let you do slimmer things and
longer battery life and all the stuff
that Apple has been able to make we're
gonna wrap up the show they're new
questions here people ask about the
Fitbit verso which just came out we
think I'm highly skeptical
based on the last yeah some of Sean is
saying when is Google pay coming to
where OS it's like sort of there and
some of them yeah so if your watch has
an NFC chip like like this one here you
can make mobile payments using Android
pay which is slowly getting rebranded
who will pay it's just a rebranding
what's the update situation like for
where OS can you reasonably expect two
plus years of support I don't know you
can say two plus years but the one thing
about where OS is that all of the
current watch is basically get updated
at the same time it's not the same as
the phone situation where if you a
samsung my wait year for the software
that came to a pixel they all basically
do get updated at the same time the
current list of watches that are getting
the wear OS update which is basically
just a new logo are basically watches
they've been released within the last
two years if you got a moto 360 which
was last released in 2015 you're out of
luck or first generation wallowing
watcher I'd have walked from three years
ago but most of the ones within the past
18 to 24 months are on that update list
all right last one Samuel says what does
Google have to do to make where OS not a
joke a lot of people would say that
Google has to make its own watch which
it hasn't done yet there's no pixel
watch so there's no and like I'm saying
there's no advancement on that hardware
or the silicon or the chips inside of it
I think Google has not focused where OS
and the way that Apple has focused watch
OS on Fitness and so there's a real no
focus there I think it's still is trying
to get too much of the people who are
like interested in on a nerd level
involved and it's kind of dropped the
ball there because things that look nice
and what you want to wear don't have all
the features that ya meandered would
have bought so I just hate the idea of
another computer I have to care for mmm
I have a lot of computers they all need
a lot of upkeep the Russians are
parently trying to hack everything all
the time I totally like 9000 Facebook
apps today like I got enough going on no
another full-on computer in my life
it needs software updates and app
management battery charging it's got to
do more for me than just show me motion
notifications what if I had a calculator
I like that it shows me the weather
that's the one thing that I enjoy is
that it gives me weather at a glance
because my knowledge is that there will
be talk about where I website Google IO
I know what they're gonna say there's
new news there but I would expect if
we're gonna have any news about where or
less in the future we're gonna say that
Google IO alright well that is it to
look forward to if you're a watch okay
that is it for this week so can we go
live
thank you Dan Thank You Jake Thank You
Haim you Ashley rush thanks to Sam for
showing up and letting us harass him for
10 minutes at a time on the show and
thanks to all of you for watching
