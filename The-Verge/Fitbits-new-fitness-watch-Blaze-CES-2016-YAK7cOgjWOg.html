yesterday safe it announced its newest
wearable the Fitbit blaze at CES and a
lot of you have had questions about what
it looks like up post and how it works
so let's get a closer look it's the
first Fitbit with a color LCD
touchscreen so when I do this it brings
me to you the home screen you can also
use the home button to get to the home
screen so when you swipe down here
you'll see that you have the option to
turn notifications off Iran basically
put it into it do not disturb mode and
when it is connected to a phone it's not
connected right now but when it is you
can control your music you swipe back up
you get to the home screen you see your
steps there swipe up once more you would
see notifications if I happen to have
any notifications right now so go back
to the home screen and when you swipe to
the right that's when you start to get
any more of the features you can look at
a glimpse of your daily activity see
your current heart rate as well as your
resting heart rate go back home I think
I'm going to tap that to do that keep
swiping again it's the exercise tile the
fitstar tile which is an app that Fitbit
acquired and has customized workouts or
thing as part of the watch a timer and
pretty self-explanatory alarms and
settings that's where you can do things
like adjust the brightness if you want
to let's go back to exercise since
that's kind of the main event of this
watch and tap on exercise you can see
that you have I think seven different
options here on the watch itself but
Fitbit tracks take over a dozen
different exercises and you can go into
the Fitbit app and you can customize it
so that different things will show up
here then one of the things that this
watch doesn't have that something like
the Fitbit surge has is GPS built into
the watch itself but it uses connected
GPS which basically means that when you
go running or you go cycling with your
phone you will still get GPS tracking
but it's happening through the following
so in order to do that you would go to
the Run tile or you'd go to a cycling
tile if it was on
here you tap this Settings button and
you would tap use phone GPS and it would
connect to the phone and that's how that
works you can also set a secondary staff
that you want to appear on the interface
so let's say you've cared a lot about
heart rate and you wanted to see that it
would show you your time or your
distance and swipe and you see your
secondary staff another thing you'll
notice about the Fitbit blaze is that
it's not a solid unibody design it's
actually a pop-out tracker which kind of
goes back to fitbit's earlier designs
where you could pop a little pot out of
the band and then you can put it into a
leather band if it's coming out with a
rose gold frame the idea behind this
corset you would be able to dress it up
a little bit if you wanted to
assuming that you liked the way it
looked but I'm downside I don't know
kind of makes it feel a little bit janky
the blaze has the same optical heart
rate sensors that Fitbit introduced last
year with the surge and the charge HR
the idea is that it tracks your heart
rate continuously throughout the day
also during workouts they also gives you
your resting heart rate so let's say you
wear this to bed to track your sleep you
wake up you get a reading on your
resting heart rate so the jury is still
out on how accurate risk based optical
heart rate sensors are some people will
probably still prefer to use a chest
strap for working out if it says that
this is it's the same cure pulse
technology that's and the other devices
that this will actually record your
heart rate more frequently
did on the other devices so the sampling
rate is higher it launches this March it
costs $199 a lot of people have been
preparing this with a SmartWatch it does
do smart notifications from your
smartphone which means that if you're
getting a text message if you're getting
a phone call if you're getting a
calendar appointment it will show up on
this but it's not a SmartWatch in the
sense that it doesn't support
third-party apps the way something like
the Apple watch does or Android wear
does it really only runs fitbit's own
apps it also has a five day battery life
which a lot of smartwatches can't really
claim that's our first look at the new
Fitbit blaze for more information check
