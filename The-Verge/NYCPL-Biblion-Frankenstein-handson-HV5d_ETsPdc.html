public library's biblia nap basically it
takes archive material and it turns it
into a magazine-style interface last
year they did the new york world's fair
and this year it's Frankenstein so it's
actually a pretty cool interface in here
you have four different sections each
one based on a different theme and
that's portrait mode turn into the
landscape mode you've got all the
primary sources that they used the major
one being the primary text of
Frankenstein this is a draft on loan
from Oxford and when you look at it you
can toggle it page 4 page with a later
published version so you can see what's
changed and read along with it inside
each section you have the equivalent of
files in a folder if you tap on one of
them then you get this interface it'll
show you all of the information you can
sort of scroll through it you can see
your bookmarks marked in red and then if
you move through it here you can tap on
any of these photographs and they've got
a lot of stuff here a lot of movie
stills really since that's one of the
major parts of Frankenstein and then you
can look through and look at some social
features which I'm actually not that
crazy about but it's an edition from
last year if you enter a question it
might be featured by the new york public
library and i'm actually hoping that
this is going to become a regular
occurrence because this is a fantastic
presentation of it if you don't have an
ipad it's all going to be available
online but this is really a great way to
experience it
