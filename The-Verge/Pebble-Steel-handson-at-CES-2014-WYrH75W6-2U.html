CES 2014 in Las Vegas and we're taking a
look at the second generation pebble
smartwatch this is called the pebble
steel and it's made out of stainless
steel it has two versions one has a
genuine leather strap the other has
stainless steel strap actually both
straps come in the box the choices that
you have between a matte black version
and a brush stainless version the price
for this will be two forty nine dollars
it's a hundred dollars more expensive
than the original double smartwatch but
you do get a few upgrades to justify
that first is obviously the construction
also you have a much reduced size in
terms of lug to lug distance so in terms
of height of the watch it's quite a bit
more stylish they've employed a few of
the design techniques that you see with
more classical watches it doesn't look
quite as aggressively modern as the
original pebble he doesn't look as
sporty as that device uses grill glass
corning gorilla glass on the front it is
still waterproof as before is the same
screen size same display technology
public has actually made a big point of
keeping the device platform the same as
with the original device in order to
avoid fragmentation for app developers
now the big appeal with this side for
being a watch obviously is the app
framework and the things that you can do
with it so for example the pandora app
over here it can control the music on
your iPhone so you can start playback
like so and if you hold the button down
you can change through different radios
another example is the foursquare app
you can come to this app and actually
check in directly from the watch you
know how to take the phone out of your
pocket pebble makes a big point out of
helping app developers developed
specifically for the pebble photo watch
it now has a new JavaScript API would a
new OS two point O version of the
software which makes it easier for app
developers to make apps just for the
watch and make it a bit more agnostic
whether you have an iphone I have an
Android device the second version of the
OS is noticeably faster that's the first
thing we notice we picked up the new
watch noticeably faster than the
original but in terms of comparing the
two devices the look in the field the
new one definitely feels higher-end more
premium feels quite good on the rest the
reduced size is noticeable terms of
weight they don't seem to be any
different
terms of thickness the new one is a
little bit thinner than the old one of
the few design compromises that I would
have had to make is they've had to
change to a new power connector here on
the side the original one was actually
designed specifically for the design of
that Smart Watch so they couldn't really
deploy it on the new watch so in summary
the new pebble steel is a massive
upgrade on the hardware side of things
it brings this SmartWatch into a whole
new class brings it to a new audience
who might not have considered smart
watching the past but what the company
says is that it's committed to iterating
and improving particularly in the app
side of things with both the 149
original pebble and the 249 pebble steel
so really the future is all about
developing the software while today is
about showing off the brand new hardware
the new pebble steel will be laid up
with 249 on january 28
