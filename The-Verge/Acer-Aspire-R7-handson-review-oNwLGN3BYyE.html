is the Acer Aspire r7 it's a laptop kind
of it's also a desktop kind of it's also
even a tablet kind of mostly it's a
laptop it's an incredibly well made
sturdy premium feeling gray laptop with
all the ports and trappings you'd expect
it is very thick and very heavy more
than five pounds in over an inch thick
so it's really not a tablet at all
it's 15.6 inch 1080p touchscreen display
is also much more firmly in laptop
territory
it looks great by the way big and
accurate and sharp any way you look at
it there's also six gigs of RAM inside
plus Intel's integrated graphics a Core
i5 processor and a hybrid hard drive
with 520 gigs of total storage so
alright fine it's a laptop except the r7
has a hinge which Acer calls easel
that's easy e/l for some reason which
turns it from a laptop into a whole
bunch of other things it's kind of like
the Lenovo yoga with 4 modes notebook
mode which is basically just a laptop
easel mode which has the screen floating
on top of the keyboard much closer to
your face display mode with it turn
around facing away from the keyboard and
pad mode where it's basically just a
slightly angled tablet those are the
four technical modes but the one I used
most was at Acer called the Starship
Enterprise basically you have the screen
over top of the base parallel to it it's
like having a drawer for your keyboard
and it's also awesome for a standing
desk Acer is really big on the touch
screen here and the company is pretty
explicitly demoting the trackpad so much
so that it's actually moved the trackpad
above the keyboard so it floats sort of
awkwardly between the keys and the hinge
it looks really weird at first though
other than the horribly misplaced Intel
sticker I did get used to it fairly
quickly actually using the thing was a
whole other story though not having a
palm nest for the keyboard is just
awkward and uncomfortable
I almost wish Acer had just ditched it
entirely and forced me to use the
touchscreen other than all that this is
pretty much your average laptop there's
some bloatware but not too much and
performance is good without being
particularly spectacular as long as you
don't try to play games using the
integrated graphics the speakers are
surprisingly good which along with the
screen makes the r7 a pretty solid media
machine it's almost like a super
portable all-in-one in a sense you don't
want to carry it around too much but
it'll work great on a desk or a kitchen
table but it all comes back to the
design Acer's betting that you're
willing to either always use the
touchscreen or always use an external
mouse the r7 is otherwise a pretty great
machine and star
$999 it's even priced pretty well but
windows 8 isn't touch friendly enough to
ditch a mask completely and who wants to
always use an external Mouse Acer said
that it's looking at bringing the cool
easel hinge to other devices and I hope
one of them is a normal laptop I like
what a star's trying to do here but I
don't really like using the aspire r7
maybe we're just not ready for it yet</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
