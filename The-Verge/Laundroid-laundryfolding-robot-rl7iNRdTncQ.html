laundry folding robot because I insisted
on demoing it with a verge t-shirt that
I brought and apparently it wasn't
really made for that so we're just
waiting for it to pop out the t-shirt
whenever it's ready
I feel really anxious and apologetic and
I never meant to harm this machine thank
you okay to be fair it is a really
complicated piece of technology it's
called the laundry by a Japanese company
called seven dreamers it's got AI neural
networks steep learning it's got robotic
arms on the inside that'll pick up the
piece of clothing and scan it with the
camera in 3d to see what kind of
clothing item it is for example this
verge t-shirt the robotic arms will pick
it up and it would determine which side
is the front where's the collar
how long are the sleeves this verge
t-shirt didn't work because it's black
and this demo version is only set up to
work with bright colors so it actually
works with a companion app that
catalogues all of your clothing items
for you so when you first set it up you
can feed it all of your clothing items
and it can even categorize it by
household family member it will
eventually even have Alexa integration
because what doesn't have Alexa
integration these days and of course
because this is CES laundry isn't the
only laundry folding robot here we saw
one yesterday called folder mate which
is about half the size and around $850
but you have to clip on the clothing
individually and who has time for line
so should I start saving all my quarters
for the coin laundromat or a machine
that will fold it off for me
