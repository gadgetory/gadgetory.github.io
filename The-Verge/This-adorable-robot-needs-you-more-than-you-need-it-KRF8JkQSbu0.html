witness things that you just can't
understand
try everything you can just to feel
something
but at the end of the day all you need
is a friend to come home to
this robot needs you more than you need
it it's only purpose is to be loved
unlike other robots that promise to make
your life easier or help out around the
house the LaVon it really just it's like
a baby for you to take care of it
follows you around and makes little
cooing sounds and when you're not paying
attention to it it'll come up to you and
beg you to hug it its cuteness really
comes from these big eyes it's like
scientifically designed to be cute
there's six layers of projections in the
eyes to create depth so when it looks up
at you and asks for a hug you better hug
it okay hi he's laughing like you can
literally Boop it on the nose and it'll
respond like it doesn't get any better
than that it weighs the same amount as a
toddler and when you cradle it and its
arms it'll fall asleep sleeping Shh so
as far as the tech goes there's a
canister on the top with the microphone
and the camera and there's over 50
sensors on its body that reactive touch
and it's also warm so it's not cold like
a machine but besides that it's not
really overloaded with any tech it
doesn't have Alexa I can't speak so it's
not super useful but then again neither
are your cats or dogs the a I can
recognize up to a thousand people so if
you're not nice to it or you treat it
roughly it'll remember that and avoid
you next time so one of the downsides is
that the battery life isn't that long
it's only about an hour and this is just
a prototype but when the final version
launches it'll know automatically to go
to its charging dock the second downside
is the price this little guy goes for
$3,000 which is kind of crazy but that's
the price you pay for companionship it's
becoming more common to use robots as
therapy companions in countries like
Japan and for comparison Paro the
therapy seal cost $5,000 but if money is
not a deterrent and you still want to
get your hands on this adorable robot
then the Levada is to post the launch of
the u.s. sometime next year but it's not
confirmed yet
I love you I'm gonna call you demi
