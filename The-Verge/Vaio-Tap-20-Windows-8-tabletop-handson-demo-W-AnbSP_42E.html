are at Aoife 2012 in Berlin checking out
Sony's tap 20 via machine is pretty much
the antithesis of the vaio do sense in
every single sense of the word whereas
that is a slider that's super line thin
this is a very very heavy 20 inch
behemoth it's very thick again it's not
meant to be portable though it's what
they're calling a tabletop PC that's the
best way of putting it you can run
through all your windows apps of course
if you push it down you've got a flat
surface presume that you can kind of
game around with I'm not sure we have on
here so close this is a form factor we
haven't actually seen before really not
to be portable but is a tablet for the
home this is the windows 8 you know and
have seen as coming out to everybody
however the difference is it's a really
big screen it's a fairly sturdy I do
mean that in terms of weight as well
device not quite sure who the audience
is for it but leave it something to make
a device and kind of hope for the best</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
