advanced pop smartphones in the world
this is galaxy s6 and so today's Samsung
showed us for the first time the galaxy
s6 edge actually did a whole entire
video on all the things it can do and
reasons why it's different but aside
from just looking cool why would you
actually want the edge on both sides of
the display well for one thing to have
specific features dedicated to it one of
the things is always near where your
thumb is on the display to bring in your
contacts and that's called people edge
another thing is when you get an
incoming call it'll actually notify you
with the side of the display facing you
so little things take advantage of the
fact that you can see the display from
the side also fun fact if you receiving
a call and you don't want to answer you
can just hold your finger right on the
IR sensor on the back and it'll send us
sorry I can't answer message another
thing it does is when you're facing up
it'll well since it's an AMOLED display
not light any of the pixels except for
the time so you can use it as an alarm
clock and it'll sort of dimly show you
what time it is at night so something
really cool that I found that might not
ever be mentioned on stage or in any of
their presentations is affected so many
apps Android apps right now take
advantage of a little swipe in from the
side and that drawer on the side which
shows up in the Google Play app and
Google Play Music and Google Play Movies
and hangouts and a whole bunch of other
stuff Gmail inbox stuff like that all
takes a swipe in from right at that spot
where the glass curves and I kind of
thought as I was playing with it that
seems perfectly natural actually kind of
thought this could have been the main
phone and not an accessory and Samsung
would also release the galaxy s6 as a
sort of safety net I like it that much
the display is already gorgeous but
we've seen things like watching videos
on it and using all the rest of
Samsung's apps in a normal way feels
fine but it's sort of a nice touch that
you can use that side glass for a way
that you don't really see
something you don't notice until you've
used it worth knowing</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
