Con 2014 were thrilled about it it's my
first comic con I've been researching it
online and what it turns out is that
comic con is a way to get a hundred and
thirty thousand people to fly down to
San Diego and then stand in line for 14
hours at a time and they're standing in
line because they want to find out about
all of the upcoming movies if you look
at what's going to be here it's
incredible I mean all the Marvel movies
ant-man Avengers 2 maybe and then
Jurassic world The Hobbit Star Wars
Episode 7 maybe it's all going to be
super exciting there are also panels and
discussions for you to go to we've
gotten about 15 different emails about
where george RR martin is going to be
signing autographs and so i have this
vision that you're gonna walk around
Hall H and you'll come around a corner
and boom he's right there and he's like
you have a pen and ya hand it to him any
signs her book obviously we have to talk
about the elephant in the womb sharknado
2 sharknado one kind of redefined the
art of cinema and narrative storytelling
it is back to blow our minds all over
again so much to get excited about this
year but the thing that I'm most excited
about is honestly just seeing all the
fans we're going to be spending a lot of
time in line and so the idea that i'm
going to be standing next to a beautiful
lady thore and a beautiful man thor and
we're going to be able to share a moment
together and just kind of like celebrate
that geeky spirit of fandom that is
going to be super cool and we're just
really excited to bring that to you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
