something really stupid I'm out here in
Utah because I'm going to get chance to
drive the new Ford GT but I wasn't ready
to just hop right into a supercar and go
so Ford let me take one of their 526
horsepower Mustang GT 350s out on the
track first the problem is I didn't know
how to drive a manual car I've stalled
this thing 10 times this is like eating
your vegetables before having that sweet
dessert except the dessert is like a
rare dessert with like gold leaf on top
of it and it served you by Butler
on like a private island that you took a
helicopter to get to yeah
so the Mustang help me get comfortable
with things like what the basic racing
line is and where and when to brake on a
track and how to get comfortable with
pushing a car to its limits
and I think this has me ready for the
40c I think so I had no idea how to
drive a manual car today
hey do it alright right now
this gt's automatic
I like my chances
that noise is cool
so I'd say my goals for today are don't
wreck don't wreck don't wreck have some
fun go fast and don't wreck you see the
Ford GT is a very rare car it's one of
the only American supercars and what was
a VA in the old gt40 has been replaced
with a turbocharged v6 that still makes
647 horsepower and if you want to buy
one Ford has to personally select you
from a list of applicants oh it's also
four hundred and fifty thousand dollars
so this is definitely not a car for
everyone it's not even a car for the one
percent it's not even a car for that
half percent it is might as well not
exist in all practical purposes but that
said it does exist I'm here to drive it
I'm gonna shut up because I want to get
in this thing and show you what it's
like
you
the guy next to me is James he's a Ford
Racing School instructor and the person
tasked to keep me from crashing the GTA
it is just this is a poster carving this
is a car that you would dream of driving
and never get a chance to drive which is
why it's so cool that we're here today
drive Hammacher the Ford GT just looks
like it belongs on the track and that's
no coincidence Ford developed this car
alongside the LeMond racecar which means
the street-legal Ford GT is nearly
identical to the car that won LeMond
last year it's an aerodynamic
masterpiece
the rear wing works is an air brake but
it also adds downforce and the front
splitter even adjusts in real time to
balance that out and keep the car
planning like most sports cars you have
a few different driving modes that alter
the car's personality but the most
dramatic is track mode which drops the
car 50 millimeters and adds to that
mind-bending downforce let's talk about
the v6 behind my head
Ford's argument is that using a smaller
engine allowed them to do crazier stuff
with the aerodynamics of the GT and I'm
willing to buy that argument because
while I was driving this car at my limit
I was only scratching the surface of
what the GT is really capable of
it is like any other supercar in an
especially performance car where it's so
low it's so wide everything's built
together so well that it just goes where
you tell it to and the Mustang something
like that you know you're rolling a bit
here and there it was a wonderful ride
whereas this was like about as accurate
as you're going to get so that was my
ride in the Ford GT I can't really think
about what else to say because that was
pretty unimaginable and pretty rad now
the real test will be basically just
what can Ford bring from this car to
cars that you know more than a few
hundred people can find so I'm really
excited if this is what the future of
Ford looks like really excited to see
all of that play out I just the worst
part was I've been first in line for
everything so I've been stalling this
car front of everybody and hopefully not
doing too much damage to the clutch</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
