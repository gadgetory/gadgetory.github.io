looking for the best soup dumplings
nearby there's an app for that this is
the new Foursquare when you first open
the app you'll notice that there are no
check-ins for friends or even a check-in
button at all instead you find a row of
intense like breakfast or lunch and
allistic categories and places below
that dig deeper into what you might be
looking for these categories range from
great dinner places nearby to places
you've saved and places to get a juicy
burger the coffee intent might even
include a places with Wi-Fi category
these groupings are great but here's the
key to the new Foursquare everything in
pink is content customized just for you
if you tap on the pink F in the top left
corner you're presented with a list of
tastes add some like sashimi and they
start showing up all around the app to
indicate that one of your favorite foods
is particularly good at this or that
place these pink results show up in
search but also in the apps venue pages
where tips including your favorite
tastes show up first you might also
notice tips with a yellow star beneath
them these are tips left by experts
people who have left many popular tips
around town in this category you can
even become an expert yourself if the
tips you leave are liked by lots of
people you can check on your progress in
your profile a lot of the new Foursquare
revolves around personalized
recommendations but if you know exactly
what you want you can still search for
it and if you've arrived at a bar and
are looking for something good to drink
you can tap here a new tab that gives
you quick access to tips at the place
you're at tips also live within another
tab which acts as a newsfeed of tips
from Foursquare people you follow and
tastes nearby which is a collection of
recent tips only related to stuff you
like if you only want to know what
people are buzzing about check the
popular page this is for squares most
practical app yet by focusing entirely
on recommendations really for the first
time ever the new app could finally
break through to the masses and
challenge the app on its own turf while
four squares dataset is still largely
the same the company has finally taken
advantage of the 55 million tips it's
collected converting these tips into
tastes which help influence your search
results it's the most personal
recommendations engine I've ever used
and it's only getting better
