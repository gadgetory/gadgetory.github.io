valentina palladino and since it's my
first time hosting I thought I'd bring a
little CGI movie magic to the show this
is 90 seconds on the bird verizon today
released a tally of the requests it
receives from law enforcement at all
levels totaling over 320,000 requests
these include phone numbers and content
like text messages and emails 18t is
promised to publish its own report but
we're still waiting for it to follow
verizon's lead they say it pays to play
but if it's an xbox one it really does
Microsoft's partnership with the video
gaming site machinima is getting flack
for paying YouTube personalities to
promote the xbox one but forcing them to
keep quiet about the deal Microsoft has
since halted the program and is bringing
any existing videos in line with the
FTC's requirements for all updates on
this story remember to check out the 90
seconds app exclusively on the Sega Game
Gear and finally terrible weather often
brings leaks to homes and it looks like
the biggest leak happened to Quentin
Tarantino the first draft of the
directors next film entitled the hateful
eight was leaked online after Tarantino
reportedly gave the script to six people
including actors Tim Roth and Bruce Dern
because of the leak the quote very
depressed Tarantino will now hold off on
making the film and move on to direct
another project in the meantime however
Tarantino has also said that he might
just completely change his mind to make
the phils and that's it for today's top
stories coming up tomorrow I start my
own Film Festival composed entirely of
Brendan Fraser's classic The Mummy and
all of its sequels and spin-offs</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
