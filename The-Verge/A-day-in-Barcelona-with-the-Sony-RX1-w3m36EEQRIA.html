best images require bulky DSLRs while
the most compact point shoots are
lacking in both image quality and
control that is until now
enter Sony's RX want the Rx one is an
unassuming camera that's roughly the
same size as Sony's NEX line of the
interchangeable lens cameras it has a
full-frame image sensor something that's
usually reserved for those super
high-end DSLRs full frame sensors offer
much better image quality shooting with
the arcs one almost feels like cheating
low light bad light no light all of
those things that are difficult to
manage with most cameras just disappear
when you're shooting in the arts one
it's also littered with control dials
including three control rings on the
lens it's a system that requires some
setup but once you're set with it it
works really well the arcs one isn't
without its limits though the sheer
compact size of it means it doesn't have
the ability to change lenses and it
doesn't even have a zoom function but
the Carl Zeiss lens nearly makes up for
those limitations the lens is incredibly
sharp edge to edge even when open to its
maximum aperture and it doesn't have any
vignetting in the corners or problems
with chromatic aberrations images are
contrasting and vibrant and the lenses
manual aperture ring clicks along with a
satisfying field the manual focus ring
is well damped imprecise which is good
because the autofocus kind of sucks and
the battery life is pretty disappointing
as well and then there's the price the
RX one is nearly three thousand dollars
and you'd be a fool not to buy it with
the electronic viewfinder for another
four hundred and fifty dollars it's
definitely more of a luxury camera the
RX one isn't perfect it's not for the
faint-hearted or the beginner but if you
do have deep pockets and a love for
photography the RX one is the one to
beat</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
