people with an example of getting so
much power out of it now this is an
example of a closet simulation cloth
simulation right this is this is an
endless simulation where the gravity
between all of these different bodies is
being modeled and this particular
algorithm interacts everybody with every
other single body it's an N squared
algorithm the technical term
everything is interacting with
everything everything else that's right
and we computed one frame at a time and
we do it so fast and we're able to do a
million particles per second and we see
of course this callous email in motion
so this is 20,000 particles but because
it's N squared that's all hundred of a
million interactions each image Wow okay
and and we surely admire the work that
we've done in the past though what's the
big deal now let's let's see let's see
Kepler let's see Kepler right so this is
all right what are we looking at here
this is a whole step this is instead of
twenty thousand forty two hundred and
eighty thousand volumes but I'm modeling
it that the Banzai multipole code out of
the observatory of Leiden and in
collaboration with her own fedora and
Danny have so much success in taking
this code and applying all of these
amazing pepper things to it now I reckon
I recognize there's this I see this
where are we right now or enough space
on the lower left we have the Milky Way
on the upper right we have the Andromeda
galaxy the the year is up in the top
left hand corner is about 3.8 billion
years in the future server we simulated
just pretty young we simulated from
present day to 3.8 billion years from
now so this is not a time machine oh I
don't know what is like this perfect
example of a time machine and we've
reached the moment where really
interesting stuff starts to happen the
Andromeda galaxy is heading towards us
and we are going to end up merging not
the first pass later on so this code is
based on a in currency code where
instead of interacting everybody with
every other body we create this tree
hierarchy of interactions and we can see
the hierarchy right here this is this
grid that you see is showing with ever
increasing intensity where we are
focusing a nuclear power and so each box
is grappling about 16 stars and out of
280,000 stars I'm axon
offices and so we are using the dynamic
parallelism is popped about to very
efficiently Thrun out these boxes and
generate this tree structure in a way
that would not be possible and you can
see the beautiful swirl that starts just
being flung around there's a 50-50
chance the sun's going to be out there
in part of that it's just pulling out of
the galaxies well so it's three and a
half billion years we are going to
collide with dominant that's right
it'll eat pastas terribly stas away and
come back so I guess the advice to the
audience is to put our personal matters
in billion years we might end up in the
diff reality now think that that's
really curious is is to me is all these
scars and all these all these stars on
the outer fringes of the galaxy don't
seem to be moving nearly as slowly as I
would have expected I mean in the center
where where there's greater mass I would
have expected that the planets and the
stars to be rotating a much more put
they on the outside much more slowly
oh boy why am I not seen oh there's
something wrong with the simulation so
you've actually had one of the great
mysteries of astronomy
based on exactly these kinds of
simulations and observations and stars
they realize that the stars in our
galaxy and every galaxy we see are going
way way to ours and without a good
explanation of what this was without the
computer models to show it there were
they spend about 50 60 years trying to
figure it out and finally in models
approximately this size but we can now
do in real time they figured out that
there is in fact only 10
laughter in the galaxy is visible to us
and 90% of it is invisible dark matter
that lives in a big halo around the
outside of the galaxy holding it
together and driving in a ladies and
gentleman we've identified Dark Matter I
need someone on an issue of paper to
write up a paper quit</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
