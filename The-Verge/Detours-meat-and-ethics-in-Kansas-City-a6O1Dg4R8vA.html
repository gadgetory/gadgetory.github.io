years old and he would take me in here I
was this little 7 you know
eight-year-old going with him to the
farmers market you get a relationship
with the people growing your food and
that included in meat as well the
butcher's would be there with the
Farley's my career has been in
technology around business development
and I just saw from working in
technology and working around startups
they had these plays around
collaborative consumption and I thought
was why couldn't collaborative
consumption also be applied to food
production creating a platform where
there could be collaborative consumption
for the farmers white clover is a
hundred percent grass-fed beef farm with
a 45 head of cattle we also race pasture
pigs on pasture we have about 60 acres
of pasture that's right the rest of
woods swamp about 125 total we had some
friends they got their first free kicks
and they named them a ham sausage and
bacon
the traditional beef production is is
basically you have ranchers that have
cow calf operations on large ranches and
usually the calves are born there their
own grants for you know somewhere close
to a year and then they're shipped to
feedlots I've seen these huge feed Lots
where they're felt a lot of grains
antibiotics so on and so forth this is
kind of more sort of old-fashioned or
retro farming and it's good for the soil
it's good for the environment it's good
for people's health so so the hope is
that we're making a contribution you
make things a little better my name is
Kevin esco executive chef of Park Avenue
summer autumn winter and spring we need
suppliers who are consistent which is
very difficult to do with small farmers
you can you can't tell them pick the
tomatoes if they're not ready you know
some that's kind of why especially large
scale operations are very difficult to
round not opposed to like a smaller 30
or 40 c restaurant whereas this
restaurant 180 seats we're serving 500
people some nights for selling you know
filet mignon we need 8090 orders of that
small scale farmers have a tough time
producing that if I walk into a
restaurant and I said oh this is what
we're doing or co-op you know beef
producers what you wanted to you can you
work with us and you're like well we
want hanger steaks well guys there's one
hanger per animal but you know I how am
I gonna supply you with hangers you know
I'm not a feedlot with you know ten
thousand thousand animals to get you
your hangers every week these huge
companies I everything and you can the
farmers just have to sell out in the end
if I'm a farmer today you know I need
some qualified demand I'm a very
specific type of operator I'm an Ag
operator you know I'm not going to be
somebody who has a lot of time to you
know set up a really sophisticated
business development or sales
infrastructure for my farm add local man
come in and create that qualified demand
that only exists in the commodity
channel and provide also some you know
some light infrastructure to be able to
service that they are creating the
infrastructure necessary to house all
the information meaning that you know
this way there's there's one central
spot where all the farmers can of their
products listed and chefs can go on
there and know exactly what's available
and have descriptions of the products
it's something we could never do I mean
we never have the budget for something
like that in addition we're small I mean
we really couldn't supply a restaurant
ourselves that's its whole new
infrastructure film from the way things
were done for the most part you know
Midwestern cities have been left out of
this technology startup kind of story
over the last 20 years until recently
and I think a lot of that has to do with
the access to technology it's cheaper to
start companies now there's more
free-flowing capital now and there's
just a better education and awareness
that has been opened up for people that
want to found companies what I think is
great about Kansas City is that like
it's very very communal in a certain way
whereas like in most big cities now you
wouldn't know who your neighbor is in
Kansas City it's like you know all your
neighbors you know everyone around you
immediately when I decided to start the
company I had you know like a small
community of like 10 or 15 people that
were just like giving me advice
connecting me to funders and all that
happened for me in Kansas City so I
think it's like it speaks to something
where I think entrepreneurship is more
accessible geographically as well now
for our business model to grow one of
these things will have to catch everyone
wants to eat local and everyone wants to
eat organic or you know flavorful foods
I think that these apps and new
platforms are going to make it much
easier for restaurants to order that way
things are changing for the better there
still is a very long way to go right now
it's probably ninety percent to ten
percent and to get it to 6040 you know
forty percent small local farmers and
sixty percent commercialized food that
would I think that's definitely going to
happen next ten years or something a lot
of this house still so happening and in
Washington our policies have to change
everything from subsidies to the weight
of food systems regulated I guess what
I'm trying to do is put the control of
the system put the control of the power
back in the hands of the people who want
control of the system to create
transparency because transparency
creates democracy and if we're
successful we will change the way that
the world works in a certain way</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
