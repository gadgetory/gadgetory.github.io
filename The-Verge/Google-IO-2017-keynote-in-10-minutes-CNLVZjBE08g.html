this week we crossed over two billion
active devices of Android we are clearly
at an inflection point with vision and
so today we are announcing a new
initiative called Google Apps Google
Apps is a set of vision based computing
capabilities that can understand what
you're looking at and help you take
action based on that information so for
example if you run into something and
you want to know what it is say a flower
you can invoke google lens from your
assistant point your phone at it and we
can tell you what florida's or if you've
ever been at a friend's place and you've
crawled under a desk just to get the
username and password from a Wi-Fi
router you can point your phone at there
so we've been working hard and I'm
really excited to announce our next
generation of TP use cloud GPUs which
are optimized for both training and
inference each board is capable of 180
trillion floating-point operations per
second and you know we've designed it
for our data center so you can easily
stack them you can put 64 of these into
one big supercomputer we call these TPU
parts and each part is capable of 11.5
peda flops so cloud GPUs are coming to
Google compute engine as of today we are
excited about designing better machine
learning models but today it is really
time consuming we want it to be possible
for hundreds of thousands of developers
to use machine learning so what better
way to do this then getting neural nets
to design better neural nets we call
this approach Auto mo it's learning to
learn
the most important product we are using
this is for Google search in Google
assistant so today we're adding the
ability to type to your assistant on the
phone soon with the smarts of Google
Lenz your assistant will be able to have
a conversation about what you see I just
tap the Google lens icon point the
camera and my assistant can instantly
translate them into English and now I
continue the conversation what does it
look like this picture should match all
right it looks pretty yummy second the
assistant is becoming a more connected
experience and today I'm excited to
announce that the Google assistant is
now available on the iPhone we think the
assistant should be available on all
kinds of devices where people might want
to ask for help the new Google assistant
SDK allows any device manufacturer to
easily build the Google assistant into
whatever they're building starting this
summer the Google assistant will begin
rolling out in French German Brazilian
Portuguese and Japanese on both Android
phones and iPhones by the end of the
year will also support Italian Spanish
and Korean starting today
actions on Google will be supporting
transactions it's a complete end-to-end
solution for developers including
payments identity notifications receipts
even account creation the platform
handles all the complexity
I'd like delivery from Panera hi this is
vedera I'll need your delivery address
which one can I get from Google will go
at 1600 Amphitheatre what can I get you
started with of a strawberry poppy seed
salad with steak instead of chicken
great are you ready to check out yep
okay the total is eighteen dollars and
forty cents are you ready to place the
order yes I'll just scan my fingerprint
to pay with Google and that's it so
first we're announcing support for
proactive assistance coming to Google
home so for example let's see I'm
relaxing and playing game with the kids
well I can see that the Google home
lights just turned on hey Google what's
up hi Ritchie traffic's heavy right now
so you'll need to leave in 14 minutes to
get to shoreline athletic fields by 3:30
p.m. the assistant saw the game coming
up on my calendar and got my attention
because I had to leave earlier than
normal so today I'm excited to announce
hands-free calling coming to Google home
you can call any landline or mobile
number in the US or Canada completely
free now by default we're going to call
it with a private number but you also
have the option to link your mobile
number to the Google assistant and will
use that number whenever we recognize
your voice so whoever you call what snow
is coming from you
and finally we'll be adding Bluetooth
support to all existing Google home
devices so you can play any audio from
your iOS or Android device so today
we're announcing support for visual
responses with Google home ok Google
show my calendar for Saturday showing it
on your TV it'll show up right on the TV
screen I'll immediately get results from
the assistant and today I'm excited to
show you three new features we're
launching to make it even easier to send
and receive the meaningful moments in
your life now thanks to the machine
learning in Google photos will not only
remind you so you don't forget to share
will even suggest the photos and people
you should share with in one tap you're
done sometimes there's a special person
in your life who you share just about
everything with I would love it if
every photo I ever took of my kids was
automatically shared with my wife and
that's why today we're also announcing
shared libraries we're bringing google
lens right into google folks and during
your boat tore down the chicago river
you took lots of folks but it's hard to
remember which building is which later
on now by activating lens you can
identify some of the cool buildings in
your photos like the second tallest
skyscraper in les Willis Tower you can
even pull up directions and get the
hours for the vegan finally we know
sharing doesn't always happen through
apps and screens and today we're
bringing it all together with the launch
of photo books there beautiful high
quality with a clean and modern design
but the best part is that they're
incredibly easy to make even on your
phone photo books are available today in
the US on photos Google comm and they'll
be rolling out on Android and iOS
next week today we want to walk you
through two themes you know that we're
excited about jump straight in and walk
through for new fluid experiences whit
live demos done wirelessly what could
possibly go wrong my kids recently asked
me to build a lemonade stand so I opened
the view tube and I started researching
DIY videos and I found this one at the
same time I want to be able to jot down
the materials I need to build for this
lemonade stand
so to multitask all I do press the home
button and boom I get picture-in-picture
you can think of it as a kind of
automatic multi window I give it out of
the way I can launch keep I can add some
more materials so I know I need to get
some wood glue like so then when I'm
done I just simply swipe it away like
that if you know we're extending the
reach of notifications with something we
call notification dots it's a new way
for app developers to indicate that
there's activity in their app you'll
notice that the Instagram app icon has a
dot in it and this is indicating that
there's a notification associated with
the app so if I pull down the shade sure
enough you can see there's a
notification in this case someone's
wanted on a photo and tag dad
what's really cool is I can long press
the app icon and we now to show the
notification in place another great
feature you know that helps make your
experience more fluid is autofill Widow
we've extended autofill to apps let's
say I'm setting up a new phone for the
first time and I open Twitter and I want
to log in now because I use Twitter comm
all the time on Chrome this system will
automatically suggest my username I can
simply tap it I get my password and then
boom logged in it's pretty awesome
we know from user studies that phone
numbers are the most copy and pasted
items the second most common are named
entities like businesses and people and
places you know we're applying a device
machine learning in this case a
feed-forward neural network to recognize
these more complicated entities so watch
this I can double tap anywhere on the
phrase old coffee house and all of it is
select for me no more filling around HEC
selection handles so a no we're
investing in what we call vitals keeping
your phone secure and in a healthy state
to maximize power and performance
the single biggest visible change in o
is boot time on pixel for example you'll
find in most cases your boot time is now
twice as fast and we've made all apps
faster by default so in oh we're adding
wise limits to background location and
background execution these boundaries
put sensible limits on usage they're
protecting battery life and freeing up
memory today we've launched play console
dashboards that analyze every app and
pinpoint six top issues that cause
battery drain crashes and slow UI for
each issue the app has we show how many
users are affected and provide guidance
on the best way to fix
we have never added a new programming
language to Android and today we're
making Kotlin an officially supported
language
I'm excited to announce that the Samsung
Galaxy s8 and s8 plus will add daydream
support this summer with a software
update I'm excited to announce that an
entirely new kind of VR device is coming
to daydream what we call standalone VR
headsets the idea is you have everything
you need for VR built right into the
headset itself there's no cables no
phone and certainly no big PC and the
whole device is designed just for VR and
we've dramatically improved tracking
with a technology that we call world
sense with it your view in the virtual
world exactly matches your movement in
the real world and it works by using a
handful of sensors on the device that
look out into your surroundings and that
means it works anywhere there's no setup
there's no cameras to install and with
it you really feel like you're there
these devices will start to come to
market later this year I believe we are
on the verge of solving some of the most
important problems we face that's our
hope let's do it together thanks for
your time today and enjoy Google i/o
