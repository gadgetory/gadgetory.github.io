heart in his new book present shock he
explains what the internet and modern
society at large is doing to our brains
and our humanity and it's not all good
part of the reason I left the internet
is that I found it to be overwhelming
everything happens all at once and I
couldn't keep up and the book rushkoff
explains some of my syndromes like how I
tended to synchronize myself to the
digital instead of paying attention to
my own biorhythms he captures the stress
I felt with the endless information at
my fingertips and what seemed like
futile efforts to monitor my Twitter
stream or wade through my email I got a
chance to sit down with rushkoff and
confess some of my fears to him luckily
it's not all doom and gloom just mostly
doing good
I guess present chuck is really is the
human response to living in and always
on immediate real-time digital reality
hmm and it's it kind of looks at two
things that have happened and they've
happened simultaneously in a way that
supports one another you know one thing
is our transition from a kind of an
industrial age world to this digital
world and what does that mean as we move
from analog clocks and cycles and things
to the digital clock which is always in
the now which is a you know a minute is
no longer some portion of the day it's a
segment of itself you know what does
that do and then at the same time we've
gone from a very future based kind of
movement oriented world into this 21st
century this post-millennial end of time
it's funny you know the Mayan calendar
it didn't mean the end of of times but
it kind of meant the end of time how do
we deal with problems that are that are
steady-state present tense problems
rather than sending a man up to the moon
and sticking a flag in there you know
it's like how do you deal with like
global warming it's like you don't win
there's no victory there's no thing it's
not Martin Luther King having a dream of
a world without global warming it's just
like we got to kind of perpetually deal
with this and what does that like I feel
this terror
of what you described as present shock
for me I actually wrote on the margins a
lot stress like I was stressed out while
reading this and I'd kind of get
overwhelmed as you're listening things
because this is stuff this really scares
me just trying to keep up keep my head
above water
its present shock something I do to
myself I've decided to immerse myself in
this level of technology and therefore
I'm experiencing present shock or as
presence not just our status as a
species and we're all dealing with it's
either our status as a species or maybe
more likely our status as a civilization
the way the book moves is through the
sort of five main syndromes that I
identified you know the first one is
narrative collapse what happens when
time seems to stop when we get from the
twentieth century to the 21st from all
the forward-leaning numbers of the 19's
to the standstill numbers of the 20s
what happens is your movements die your
stories die this sense of forward
momentum dies and you you don't have
goals and long term thinking to motivate
you forward what do you do you end up
then in a much more of a kind of a video
game like world where you're making
decisions and doing things in that sort
of almost digital mindset of I'm
programming my world rather than
responding to the stories that have been
left for me which leads you to didja
Freni a-- when you're in a program
environment what happens well you end up
with more than one instance of yourself
and I'm gonna now instead of being
programmed by my technology I'm gonna
program my technology to conform with me
you know and that's then what leads to
this sense of responsibility which is
what I'm I'm calling you know over
winding you're like calculating this
whole giant thing so I renamed the long
now the short forever
it's sort of the paralysis of that
long-term thinking and basically all
these ways that we try to almost make up
for a lost time work or or maximize this
efficiency into this single moment you
know and and mistake one time scale for
another there because they're not
interchangeable this is less of
necessarily a symptom of present shock
but something that we try to do because
of president Choe yeah well over winding
would be almost like OCD you know it's
the sort of obsessive compulsive urge to
to compress time and to be more
efficient and to conform on a certain
level and then you know from there I
went to fractal neue which is the idea
that if you are living in an eternal
present how do you make meaning you know
we used to make meaning through stories
kind of through narrative but now if
we're in the moment then we try to make
sense by kind of taking a picture of
where things are and drawing connections
between them and you can end up drawing
way too many connections and then going
crazy get neue basic that's where the
paranoia comes in because not
everything's not connected to everything
else you know but if you have no time in
which to make sense of things then the
only way you can make sense of something
is to connect this to that to this to
that this leaves us apocalyptic
apocalypse Urkel right people want there
to be a beginning and I think what it is
is these guys particularly older guys
who are enthralled with digital
technology and made great careers of
digital technology they are very
intolerant of steady-state it's very
hard to be this mean is just gonna be
ive best begun to understand narrative
collapse it's of left the internet i
started to realize the value of a novel
length idea for me dear Jeff Renia is
the most dangerous of rushkoff syndromes
I've always had a problem with
priorities for instance email would take
me ages to get through and I responded
to half the ones I should over widening
is why I quit text messaging in addition
to the internet I just hate how text
messages arrived and need to be dealt
with out of step with my own reality
well rushkoff calls fractal neue I call
ignorant it always bothered me how
I knew so little compared to what the
internet India by leaving the internet I
could read books and insulate myself and
and wrestle with one idea at a time
finally rush cops term Apocalypto was
reflected in my decision to give up the
Internet in the first place I was just
one step away from buying an underground
bunker I find the names of each of these
chapters almost that they sound like
names of like sci-fi contagion style
diseases that wipe out mankind well in a
way I mean I meant them more like almost
psychological syndromes you know did you
friendly and fractal Moya so it's sort
of like the present estera or present
shock era versions of the mental
elements we've come to know and I guess
I think a dick where a mental ailment
couldn't wipe help you well they can I
mean in a certain level yeah they can
wipe out humanity at least from a
subjective yeah but humanity I'm talking
about I talk about wiping out humanity I
don't mean that the human bodies go away
necessarily I mean that humanity goes
away you know what I'm fighting about
right are humaneness and that you know
in the Industrial Age we very much ape
the machines we tried to be like the
machines that were we're a kurd of
guiding human experience through that
millennium the more we try temporarily
to keep up with an asynchronous temporal
landscape which is the digital temporal
landscape you talk about computers are
multitasking and we fundamentally aren't
right and computers go in sequence and
we don't we go into continuous what we
do live continuously I don't I don't I
don't really buy that human beings our
sample so I'm still scared of present
shock but if you can't tell by now
rushkoff is an entirely pessimistic in
fact I plan on using some of his terms
and solutions when I returned to the
internet actually what rushkoff
prescribes is sort of what I've been
doing this year like taking time to meet
people in person and dealing with data
one item at a time he said you had to
pause things or you said just as we can
pause we can unpause if you decide to
pause long enough to read my book for
example you can unpause when you're done
and we'll still be there you don't have
to take a whole year off I mean I
learned to you know dip into the digital
a temporal reality and then go it's now
I'm back in this one but you know when
you when you maintain your own clocks
even in the face of all this it's really
interesting and then you start looking
at things how do I make digital time
conform to my time again this all sounds
terrifying and horrible to me it's
always it's really stressful to the
extent that you refuse to take charge of
your own and so how do you do that well
I mean you're doing it in an extreme way
right by saying okay no no I'm gone well
I'm doing Apocalypto away where I'm so
afraid of it I'm just gonna avoid it
I haven't solved anything yet one simple
thing to do is to distinguish between
what I'm kind of calling flow media and
stacked media you know so something like
Twitter is a flow media that's just
going Twitter or something you dip into
to get the sort of cultural weather and
then dip out of you don't try to keep up
with Twitter you don't try to read all
the tweets that happen between the last
time you looked and now it's just it's a
thing that's moving on the other hand if
you're gonna get you know a book or an
email or something don't just dip into
those as whether those are stacked
media's so that's something you actually
sit and you give a period I'm gonna read
this email that came from this person
you know and if you rush through that
email you feel stressed after it you
know most of us try to deal with our
inbox and it's like this awfully
stressful experience because we're
treating it like flow you know
and it's like no it's not flow so you
know you I have my phone my phone sure
it could
buzz me every time an email comes and
then I can quickly check it or it's like
no you say email is in there if someone
else relegated a piece of information to
the atemporal universe why should i
convert it back to the temporal universe
and have it zap me as soon as it arrives
no this is a temporal this is this is
something that waits it's not it even a
text it's not a phone yeah you referred
to this idea this is something I talked
to people a lot I call it like a
cognitive load you can put on somebody I
could text somebody can you make dinner
plans tonight and that took me five
seconds to write that took the person at
Howard well you opened a loop you know
it's like the way the brain works is
it's just like you know it's
coprocessors and stuff it's you know you
open a loop in the brain if you don't
deal with that open loop right away it
creates stress for you because it's
sitting there open so they've basically
set up even if you don't agree to do
them Oh will you send me this book where
you write this quick piece will you send
a bio will you make sure this you've
just inserted ten or twenty open loops
into your brain that you're not gonna be
able to get to later a part of it is
realizing that the the distance and
anonymity that sort of Asperger's like
non emotionality afforded by digital
technology frees people to lay at
your doorstep that you don't really have
to accept the thing that technology
gives us is choice is more choice and
the more you're gonna use technologies
the more you're going to be making
choices so you you get the freedom to
choose what you want but you lose in
many cases the freedom not to choose you
know the freedom to just be if you're on
a computer the choices are gonna come
more and more and more rapidly
particularly if you're living in a
programmed environment where they're
trying to get you to choose more because
they make one money the more you choose
I guess that Kutta gets back to this
idea
of you know humans and the uniqueness of
humans and it does feel like there's a
there's an humanity to what we've
created and we're humans but at the same
time we're the humans who created this
machine thing so where does this leave
us
we are the humans and we did create our
technologies but the difference between
the industrial age and the digital age
is Industrial Age technologies pretty
much sat there and although they were
unintended consequences like carbon
emissions and slavery and things like
that digital technologies are different
or digital era technologies like
computers nano robotics and genomics
because they carry on after now there's
it's not like a shovel that you make and
sits there it's it's a seed that you
make and then it tries to stay alive it
replicates it adjusts itself and self
modifies and finds others so we're
launching things that have something
very much like lives of their own what
we're looking at in some sense is a
competition between human agency and
intelligent agents it's sort of the old
divide was between you know Marvin
Minsky and artificial intelligence
versus like Timothy Leary and
intelligence augmentation and these were
seen as sort of the two sides of how
computer technology was going to be used
and I'm myself and on the side of
intelligence augmentation rather than oh
if we're not with ourselves too
dramatically I'm more I'm more
interested in humans getting smarter
than just making information more
complex by itself because if we don't go
along for the ride I don't think anyone
will be there to see what happened good
good apocalyptic notes and
thank you so much thank you I have a bit
more than one month left before I return
to the Internet to be honest I'm pretty
scared I don't know if I'll be able to
deal with it any better than before it
could be present shock all over again
except now I'll just be out of practice
what gives me hope is that smart people
like rushkoff are beginning to diagnose
some of these problems and I think
they're even starting to grasp with some
solutions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
