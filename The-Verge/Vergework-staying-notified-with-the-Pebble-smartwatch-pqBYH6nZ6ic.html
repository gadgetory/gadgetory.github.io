I'm one of the hyper-connected I need to
know what's going on constantly and my
social networks and beyond
I can't miss an email any Twitter
favorite or even any snapchat and if I
miss a text message for my wife well
that's a whole nother ball of issues and
I need all of this immediately without
pulling my phone out of my pocket the
thing that solves all of these
notification problems for me is the
pebble smartwatch it's an always-on
constant nag that alerts me to anything
I tell it to and right from my wrist I
can determine whether something is
important or can be addressed later the
pebble uses a standard 22 millimeter
wrist band so it's easily customizable
and since it works with both iOS and
Android that makes my life easy since
I'm constantly having to change devices
for work setting up the pebble with an
iPhone is pretty simple thanks to a
recent app updates right on 7 you just
pair it with the phone over Bluetooth
and then download the app from the iOS
App Store from there I can get virtually
any push notification sent from my phone
to my wrist with the Android this set up
is very similar but if I want every app
notification of my wrist I need to
download a helper app from the Play
Store in addition to pebbles official
one I like using one filled with a
vacation center but there are many
options available and there are a bunch
of helper apps that extend more
functionality to my pebble like extra
security for my phone setting up Gmail
alerts is as simple as having the Gmail
app display notifications on the lock
screen of my iPhone or checking the box
next to Gmail in the Notification Center
app on Android on both platforms the
pebble has other basic but useful
features like controlling music playback
and pebbles open API has led to some
more bizarre uses for the SmartWatch but
for me what's most important is the
glanceable information sometimes the
pebble can feel a bit like a hat it's
not great for clearing notifications for
example if I see an email on my wrist
I'm going to see it again on my phone
the next time I pick it up I'd also love
for a way to delete or archive an email
right from my wrist
so I don't have to process the email
again later on and look sometimes the
pebble can be too good at keeping me
updated
if I'm working on something with a
deadline and I need to be heads down the
pebble can be quite annoying
interrupting me with every email that
dings my inbox in those cases I tend to
just take it off instead of going
through the tedious process of disable
notifications we're still at the cusp of
a boom in wearable technology and it's
very likely that the pebble and its
competitors will be greatly improved
upon in their future but here today the
pebble sir is a need in my workflow and
it's not something I would want to give
up it's not quite the Dick Tracy sci-fi
future of computers on our wrists but
we're getting close</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
