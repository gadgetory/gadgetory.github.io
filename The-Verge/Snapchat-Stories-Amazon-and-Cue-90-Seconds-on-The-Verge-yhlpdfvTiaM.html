ross miller or as my study groupies to
call me the international man of mystery
this is 90 seconds on the verge facebook
meet your latest competitor snapchat the
ephemeral picture messaging app has
released a new feature today called
stories its take on facebook's news
feeds your friends can now view a real
of your most recent snaps but of course
in typical snapchat fashion the pictures
and video only survived 24 hours now
just sit back and wait for the person
naked picture to accidentally get added
to a story snapchat is the only company
looking to expand the Wall Street
Journal reports the Amazon is planning
on releasing a Roku like set-top box in
time for the holiday season no word yet
on pricing but amazon has a history of
setting the price of this device is
fairly low instead aiming to make money
off their use amazon has also rumored to
be working on two different phones one
that has four cameras on the front for
head tracking and another that would be
free rumors however suggest that those
phones will not be released this year
finally it looks like Apple is stepping
up its competition with Google now Apple
has reportedly purchased Q a company
that combines emails and calendar
appointments to provide a daily agenda
it's unclear what exactly app was
planning on doing with the new
acquisition but Q has since suspended
its surface my hope is that I can get to
talk to my iphone by saying serie q up
and then laugh at myself because I love
puns that's if today's top story is
coming up tomorrow do you love your
luminate a keyboard should check out our
Illuminati keyboard it will all make
sense in the end</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
