brand new nokia lumia 900 announce
exclusive for AT&amp;amp;T in the US as 4.3 inch
WVGA display it is AMOLED clear black
AMOLED consistent with the Nokia Lumia
800 physically it's also very much
consistent with Nokia's previous device
it has same carl zeiss optics as with
the lumia 800 and the same sort of
Hillary shape that's the way that Nokia
likes to describe it for the design so
we've got the Loom 800 here in the Lumia
900 it's quick comparison they seem to
be about the same thickness but the big
difference with Lumia 900 is that this
is an LTE device and as I say is going
to be exclusive to AT&amp;amp;T in the US so but
arrangements pretty much the same
another significant difference i will
say is that is now a front facing camera
over here and then your AT&amp;amp;T device and
there's quite a bit less space down
where the windows skis are the
capacitive windows skeezer at the bottom
it does have the same single glass pane
cover in the front and we're still
looking at pre-production devices we
can't do too much but what we're looking
at is very consistent performance with
the rest of the Windows Phone experience
this windows phone 7.5 not all of these
applications are yet ready for prime
time so we can't go into them but
generally speaking it has the same riya
tractive display as lumia 800 it's just
stretched out to be bigger what nokia
has also said is that the American
market prefers bigger devices so this is
why we have this 4.3 inch LT connected
device nakia tells us you have 16
gigabytes of storage but they won't tell
us when it will be out in the US just
coming over over coming months is what
they said they won't tell a surprise
either so the keeping few mysteries back
but this is not his first Windows Phone
for the US
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
