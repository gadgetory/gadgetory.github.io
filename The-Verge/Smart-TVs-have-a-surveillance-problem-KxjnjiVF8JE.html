a TV and how many of those TVs have
built-in microphones documents published
by WikiLeaks show that the CIA has
developed a method for hacking Samsung
Smart TVs when the methods used properly
the TV will appear to be off but the
microphone will be on sending audio back
to a server controlled by the agency in
essence that turns your Smart TV into a
remote microphone this particular
exploit had to be installed in purse and
there's no indication that it was
deployed at a large scale but the
implications are really troubling
intelligence agencies are actively
looking for ways to turn Smart TVs into
microphones and if the CIA is doing it
it's a good bet the NSA is - along with
its counterparts in Russia and China a
lot of modern devices have this kind of
always on microphone particularly the
echo in the Google home but Smart TVs
let hackers reach farther most people
have a TV and most new TVs have this
kind of feature which makes this kind of
attack really hard to escape even if you
don't have a smart TV in your home
you'll probably find one in your office
or in a hotel room and this isn't just a
problem for Samsung all Smart TVs run up
against the same basic security problem
unlike a computer or a phone these TVs
are running on very basic underpowered
processors that have little room for
antivirus or other security measures
whether you're using Skype or voice
commands the TV needs to be able to hear
what you're saying and send the
information back to a central server all
hackers need to do is change the program
so the information goes to a different
server that they control now you can
turn off that internet functionality but
you can't stop someone from turning it
back on so it's not much protection
there's also the microphones themselves
in recent years some manufacturers have
moved them from the screen to the remote
but it's still hard to get a TV that
doesn't have a microphone at all
this is a really hard problem to solve
voice control has become a huge part of
how we interact with devices from Siri
to Google
and TVs want to be a part of them
there's a big downside when it goes
wrong the WikiLeaks documents show that
but for most manufacturers it's still
better to ship a TV with a microphone
than without one changing that will take
a shift in thinking from both companies
and consumers but if you want to sit
down in front of your television without
worrying someone's listening that's what
we'll need the CIA represents people
from all walks of life besides
traditional intelligence officers the
agency also needs doctors hair stylists
seamstresses and other skilled personnel
to help meet the unique needs of its
mission</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
