here so it's been popper here at CES
2015 and I'm hanging out at the music's
music music spewed wearing what appears
to be Google glass but is actually the
m100 that's right
Synnex is a ten-year-old company they
used to make immersive like kind of VR
style eyewear then they did stuff for
doctors they've done stuff in the
military and now they're going into sort
of the prosumer area hoping to make this
for the average person yep the average
person and actually getting into
industries as well this is a lot of
industrial applications so tell me what
I would use this for out on the street
as an average person or what I might use
it for if I was like a company trying to
you know by an average person you might
want to get directions to somewhere and
just have it tell you where you're going
give you map directions or you might
like the stream video showing you know
what what you're looking at or tick
ticking pictures storing them you can
put an extra memory in here as well okay
so I can take video of what I'm looking
at and store that I could take a photo
using like a voice command yep and you
pretty much can load almost any Android
app right on the device itself okay I'm
here with Todd Ferguson who does a tech
support for the view six tell us a
little bit about how people are actually
using this out in the field and some of
the stuff you deal with on a daily basis
sure probably the primary focus when we
designed it was for an industrial
application we wanted it to be a tool
for a jobsite so two of the greatest
things that we are doing is warehouse
picking and field tech service the
display in the camera combined is gonna
put an arrow down on the floor it's
going to guide you around to the pallet
you need to highlight the box say I need
one of these to pick up the box you hold
it in front of the device you scan the
qr-code
inventory management software is updated
in real-time they'll tell you where high
voltage is don't touch it it'll tell you
how to de-energize the panel you need to
work on it gives you step-by-step
instructions and in both situations
you've got the opportunity to do live
video conferencing with a supervisor if
you run into this
do you feel like this is something you
would wear as a consumer yeah as a
consumer it is a little bit you know the
market is still accepting at the
consumer market is still kind of
learning where wearable technology is
cool right I was visiting New York City
a few months ago I could have had this
on walking down Broadway and had menus
popping up as I went by every every
restaurant previews when I go by movie
theaters with that yeah I think the
consumers are gonna start buying into it
would you wear this around all right
it's been popular here at CES with the
b6m 100 Karen tell what to do subscribe
