the drone guy rocking in the desert to
determine which machine drone or car
best of all time once and for all race
to the death
I'm here with a prototype of the hexo
plus it's rated up to 45 miles an hour
there's gonna be a little GPS in the car
it's gonna lock on it's gonna follow
it's gonna kill I'm in a BMW m235i I got
it for a couple hours now I can say it's
a pretty cool car has well over 300
horsepower I'm pretty confident beat
drones with it Nora I love you guys okay
that'll make it out he's done he's done
sometimes you get in a car and it makes
you feel like a kid when you rev the
engine but every time you fly a drone
it's like joy alright he's putting this
joint in front of us Chris you're
supposed to be able to drive a car let's
see what happens let's do this
so Ben tell me why you think a drone is
better well drone never gets flat tire
Jon never gets stuck in the mud drone
can follow me and shoot some amazing
aerial footage I mean what's so cool
about a car it's fast it's awesome
driving on highways expressways dirt
roads whatever kind of road I want well
they say that they'll be self-driving
cars but there's already self flying
drones I may be right now I'll give you
that crazy there nobody's piloting that
thing
that's crazy that's amazing and this is
the air dog but I'm here with Chris
chasing his ass we're gonna give him one
more run through the desert see if you
can get away
drones are probably more dangerous than
cars these days and yet Chris I don't
need a license or insurance to fly one
yeah but you know what drone isn't gonna
get you out of here what's gonna get you
out of here it's gonna be the car some
guy that thinks it's an auto blogger
