This is the Pixel 3a,
and then there is a
slightly bigger Pixel 3a XL.
And, here's what you need to know
right at the top of this review.
This is a solid phone
that costs 400 bucks,
and it has a great camera.
That combination of those
three things never happens.
To start, I just want
to lay out the basics
of why I think this phone is so remarkable
and why a lot of people are
going to be really happy
if they go out and buy it
because there's really
nothing else like it
on the market right now.
If you want to go out and buy a smartphone
with a great camera, you've
got a couple of options.
You can get something in
the top tier of what's good
and what you can trust, but to do that,
you have to spend a minimum
of like six or seven hundred bucks,
and sometimes you end up
spending well over a thousand.
Your other option is to
scrabble around for a deal
or to look for a slightly older phone.
If the camera's less important to you,
you can get a lot of surprisingly
decent Android phones
for less than 500 bucks, and, lately,
they don't even have the
compromises that you might expect.
A lot of them are fast and nice looking
and even have recent software.
But, none of those cheap Android
phones have great cameras.
The Pixel 3a, though,
it has a great camera.
For the most part, I
can't tell the difference
between photos shot with this phone
and photos shot with a regular Pixel 3,
which costs about 300 dollars more.
I'm not even going to tell you
which of these photos is which
because they're so close to each other
that it doesn't matter.
They might as well be identical.
And, you get the same camera
features as a regular Pixel 3,
including Night Sight for low light shots
and a new time lapse feature
that's coming to all Pixel phones.
On top of all of that, it has good design,
a nice OLED screen,
reasonably load speakers,
and a guarantee to get the
most up to date versions
of Android first.
And, hey, what, look at that!
It's an honest to god,
regular old headphone jack,
right on the top.
The small one costs 399, and
the one with the big screen,
and also no notch, costs 479.
They're available on
Verizon, Sprint, T-Mobile,
Google Fi, and U.S. Cellular.
And, it'll also work on
pretty much any other carrier
that you have.
That carrier support actually matters
because it means you can
go to your local store
instead of dealing with
mailing stuff back and forth
to Google if you have a
problem with the phone.
So, what's the catch?
There's always a catch right,
there has to be a catch.
Well, yeah, there are a few.
There's two big things, and
then a dozen little things
that you're going to be giving
up by not buying a phone
that costs 750 dollars or more.
First, and probably most
importantly, it's not super fast,
it's kind of slow.
Here, look at this, I just
reset both of these phones,
so they're fresh, and
were going to launch apps
on both of these at the same
time so that you can see
that there is a delay.
Mostly when you open apps,
you're going to find that they
take a second or two longer
to open up than you'd want.
You see it, right?
That slow down is because
the chip inside the Pixel 3a
is the Qualcomm Snapdragon
670, which isn't as fast
as the 845s and 855s you get
on more expensive phones,
like the Pixel 3 or the Galaxy S10.
And, it's definitely not as fast
as the processor on an iPhone XR.
The weird thing though is,
once I get into just using
the phone, it didn't feel slow
and it didn't stop me from
doing anything at all,
even playing intense games,
like PUBG on high graphic settings.
The camera doesn't process photos
as quickly as it could either
because it doesn't have a
separate image processing chip,
but, again, that didn't change the quality
of the pictures that I took.
Is the faster speed that
you get on a premium phone
worth spending an extra 300 dollars?
Maybe not.
But one thing to consider is that overtime
we know that all phones tend to slow down,
and that's been a particular
issue with the Pixel 3
and that phone isn't even a year old yet.
So, if you're not in a hurry to buy,
it might be worth taking
a wait and see approach
with the Pixel 3a.
The second thing that you lose
by not buying a more expensive phone
is just overall build quality things.
The things that make a phone
just look and feel really good,
that make you feel like you
have a nice thing in your hands.
Now, don't get me wrong,
I don't think that the
Pixel 3a feels cheap,
but it's definitely not
premium, whatever that means.
Actually, we know what premium means
and why this phone doesn't
fit into that category.
First, it has a plastic,
sorry, polycarbonate body.
It has these big bezels,
especially the top and the bottom.
It doesn't have two cameras on the front.
It doesn't have wireless charging.
It doesn't have an
in-screen fingerprint sensor
or facial recognition.
Losing all that stuff isn't too painful,
as long as the overall
experience is well designed
and pretty good, and the
Pixel 3a is those things.
You can get it in white or
black or this color right here,
which Google calls purple-ish.
It looks good.
The only build quality thing I
really have to complain about
is that its not water resistant,
and that one kind of hurts.
The other thing that makes
an expensive phone premium
is a killer screen.
Something that not only goes edge to edge,
but is also tack-sharp and color accurate
and maybe has some techno features,
like fast refresh rates or whatever.
The Pixel 3a does not
go in for all of that,
but it does have a nice OLED screen.
It's maybe not the highest resolution
and the color temperature on the small one
runs a little bit yellow-ish
for my taste, but, then again,
it's better than the Pixel 2XL
from a couple of years ago.
It's also a glass screen, not plastic,
but it's not technically
Corning Gorilla Glass,
it's something called
Dragontrail, but whatever.
I think the screen is totally fine.
When a phone costs 750 or 1200 dollars,
you should knit-pick the
hell out of the screen.
That doesn't mean it's
okay for a cheaper phone
to have a crap screen,
but, luckily, this is not a crap screen.
I think it's all right.
So those are the two major things
you lose out on compared
to a flagship phone:
the overall speed and the premium feel
of the body and the screen.
But there are a bunch
of other little things
that most people probably
won't lose sleep over,
so let's see.
It doesn't have stereo
front facing speakers
because the bottom one
fires downward instead.
It doesn't have the fastest networking,
so you won't get ultra
broadband speeds on WiFi or LTE.
It doesn't support Daydream VR,
and you can't do wide angle selfies
which, honestly, I am kind of sad about,
but also I'm kind of over
it, but I don't know.
Oh, one annoying thing I should mention,
Google Photos will only give you
the regular high quality
backups for free here.
To get the full resolution,
original quality for free,
you have to step up to a full Pixel 3
which I think is a cheap
move, but whatever.
Anyway, the important thing
that Google managed here
is nailing the basics.
So, for example, battery life is great.
If you're an Android
person, you'll want to hear
that I'm getting about four
to four and a half hours
of screen time on the small one
and even better on the big one.
For everybody else, you should know
that it'll last a full day,
unless you do something
really battery killing,
like sit in an hours long video conference
or play a really graphically intense game.
And, again, the camera is great.
It's on par or better
than the iPhone XR, XS,
and Galaxy S10.
Video quality could be better,
and phones like the Huawei
P30 Pro are beating it
on low light photos, but, still,
this thing costs 400 dollars.
I don't know if I have ever
said a 400 dollar phone
had a great camera before.
Also, I'm going to
repeat myself again here,
headphone jack.
(upbeat music)
Am I recommending this phone?
Yes, if you want a phone
for less than 500 bucks.
You get Google's version of Android
which is clean, and easy
to use, and always updated.
You get that camera,
and you won't have anything
that annoys you day to day.
Like I said, even the speed thing
hasn't bothered me that much.
Do I think this thing
will sell like hotcakes?
I honestly don't know.
People aren't upgrading
phones as often now,
maybe that means that, when they do,
they're going to want get
nicer, more expensive models
that they hang onto for longer.
But, I do know this.
I have been waiting for Google
to make this exact phone
for something like five years.
Google used to make phones
that were ridiculously good
for the price, shout out to the Nexus 5,
and I'm glad that it's getting back to it.
This is the kind of phone
that Google should be making,
something really good
and really affordable.
Hey everybody, thank you
so much for watching!
Let me know what you think of the Pixel 3a
down in the comments.
Does it seem like it's the phone for you?
And also, obviously, keep
it locked to The Verge.
