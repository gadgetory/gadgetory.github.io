and it's an instant film camera just
like all the Instax cameras that have
come before it but with one huge
difference it's also digital this is
fuji films attempt to taking the
fleeting fun that's associated with it
in fact cameras and finding a way to
keep it relevant in the age of Instagram
now they did that by putting a three
point seven megapixel sensor inside in a
3-inch LCD screen on the back now this
camera also uses a new format of intact
film it's called in Sachs Square and
it's a little bit bigger than the
insect's mini a little bit smaller than
the insect's wide there's two different
ways to shoot with the XQ 10 there's an
auto mode where it prints everything
that you shoot and there's a manual mode
that lets you shoot digitally as much as
you want and decide what to print later
you can also edit those photos there's
ten filters built-in a vignette tool and
an exposure tool now one of my favorite
things about the SD 10 is actually the
animation that plays when you print a
photo it is a total gimmick but it's
also one of the most fun traits of the
camera it's also a sign of just how much
this camera can delight people people
get genuinely happy when they see it
start printing photos they all want to
be the one that's holding the picture
while it develops and they also want to
be the one that gets to take that
picture home the difference with this
camera more than any other insects is
that you can finally accommodate that
request
it's also easier than ever to try out
the creative modes like double exposure
or long shutter because you can try and
try until you finally dial it in all
without wasting a print the battery is
great too it'll last you through a full
weekend of shooting editing and printing
you pay a price for all that though
literally the film packs cost seventeen
dollars each and the camera itself costs
two hundred and seventy nine dollars
luckily the camera performs well enough
that that price doesn't seem so
unreasonable it turns on fast focuses
sounds and shoots s the only hang-ups I
really had was they can definitely miss
exposure from time to time and it's a
bit awkward to get back to the live view
from playback mode the viewing angle of
the screen which is not a touchscreen is
also pretty bad you have to be looking
straight at it to get a good read of
anything that you're framing up
otherwise it's really easy to use the
shutter buttons on the front are
satisfying as well as the ones on the
back now the new square film is just
like in saks film in the past it's super
contrast II it's got good colors but
it's definitely going to take you a few
packs to get a feel for it and the flash
on this camera is strong but it's not
strong enough to wash things out it can
actually help create some of the best
photos this camera has to offer and
that's coming from someone who doesn't
usually shoot with flash now the most
dumbfounding thing about this camera is
that it's not connected to get the files
from this camera to your phone you have
to take the microSD out of the camera
put it in an adapter put that in your
computer and then get those files to
your phone from there for a camera
that's supposed to be all about the
Instagram generation it feels awfully
disconnected from Instagram now maybe
it's good that it's not connected in the
sense that you don't wind up
interrupting the moment to focus your
attention on which photo you want to
post to Instagram or some other social
media network and besides Instax cameras
have always been at their best when
they've been used to capture fleeting
moments like it partying with friends
something that the S q10 is missing is
that sense of urgency with other insects
cameras people know that their time and
attention is precious and so they're
more willing to play along so that you
don't waste film that goes away when
they know that you can take 20,000
photos and print the best later now
don't get me wrong there is something I
love about the idea
camera it's sort of what I always
thought would make me want to buy an
insect in the first place and could you
film got a lot right here I really love
the design I love the way it feels to
grip and shoot with it and the interface
is quick and fun the printed pictures
look great and the hoarder in me is
happy to have digital backups but now
that it's here I'm realizing this idea
isn't all I thought it would be maybe a
more connected version of this camera is
exactly what I'm looking for or maybe I
just need to learn to cut the cord and
stick the instant film oh no why did you
print that one home is so bad but it's
just going to be Tina from Bob's Burgers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
