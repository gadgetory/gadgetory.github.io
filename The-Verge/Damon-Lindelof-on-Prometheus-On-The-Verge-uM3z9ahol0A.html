a small film that you've done an
independent film you've done yes
Ridley Scott sure you are the co
screenwriter yeah a gentleman by the
name of John Speights wrote on the moon
wrote the first draft of the screenplay
for several first drafts he worked in
the movie for about a year and then I
came in after him so we didn't ever work
simultaneously you kind of took what you
added that's right exactly another plays
yes I mean that's the that's that's the
the process out here right John when I
was just I was still working on the last
season of Lost while he was writing on
prometheus and then he went on to do
bigger and better things and then I came
in on prometheus and normally there's a
whole chain of screenwriter so I'm proud
that it's just John and I write it this
is a small process yeah Cowboys and
Aliens which is the only other movie I
have a writing credit on I think there's
nine credited writers does that bother
you that there's nine credit writers
yeah I think it would have been a better
movie had to just been your name on it
no I know I would have been a better
movie I've been nowhere near it really I
just think I mean because I would feel
if anybody tampered with anything and I
did I would always feel like whatever
the end result is gonna be somehow
bastardized a bastardized version of my
version yeah but I'm yeah he's easier
said than done because I'm tampering
with you know when it but when I came
into that movie it was between the
fourth and the fifth season that lost so
I worked on it for two and a half months
and and injected some ideas and did a
draft of the script that was built on
the foundation of other drafts and then
there was considerable writing done
after I left which is just it's weird
it's sort of the equivalent of like
going to the sperm bank and saying like
maybe this will be used in a kid in
combination with a bunch of others like
you can't really do it you know if you
don't have fundamental authorship so
it's a worse than that in a way cuz at
least with the with the kid you know
it's at least one of them right the good
news was I got to meet and work with
Favreau Jon Favreau on that the the
draft that I wrote with Alex Kurtzman
and Bob warsi got John on board and then
I started hanging out with him for maybe
a month before I had to go back on the
lost and he's a great cool guy and I
love
I love that collaboration but he seems
like he seems like a guy who is
incredibly powerful and rich and famous
but whenever I've seen him speak
anywhere or just he's not the kind of
regular dude he's like a very nice guy
yeah he's free or is he a huge-ass no
he's not a huge-ass at all he's one of
us I mean he's when I when I first came
out to LA in 94 swingers was like the
big thing and essentially he and his
friends Vince Vaughn the most prominent
amongst them we're sort of living the
Hollywood existence that my friends and
I were except they were much better
looking at having much more success with
women but that's what that movie was
about right and so I completely and
totally idolized Jon Favreau and the
idea that he was also a writer and a
director and started putting more time
and attention into that part of his
career than the acting part of his
career I thought was commendable and
then he's into all the same stuff that
we are as fanboys you know he just nerds
had already got he's nerdy and that
comes across in his movies I mean they
don't they seem like they're they have
the touch of obsession
no definitely which is a huge component
for making these things work and also a
tone is everything and I think I give
massive accolades to Joss Whedon for
Avengers and he did an incredible job
but I think that Favreau was the guy
with Iron Man that did the first like
four so when you see the Avengers other
than the fact that it's awesome and you
want to see it again you go like why did
it take so long to figure out to do this
I mean these characters didn't get
invented like ten years ago right why
did it take them so long and the answer
is it's such it's so totally difficult
to pull off those movies and Iron Man
was the first one where it's sort of
like I'm gonna take this seriously I'm
never gonna have the characters turn and
wink at the camera but at the same time
it's gonna be super fun to watch right
women are gonna want to go and see it
and there's legitimately funny movie
yeah they're awesome so III i give fabro
huge props for basically kick-starting
you know that whole progression of
movies it's like he kind of took the
we're still way off topic of my question
but it's like he took which I don't mind
all he took him wait to hear it is and
there's a lot for what I want gay boy he
took that that um he took comics the way
comics used to be even up until the 80s
were they when they really got dark in
the 80s but where they were that you
could tell a real story and still have
fun with it never there was actually
like there was something kind of
adventurous and exciting that wasn't it
wasn't dark and heavy and brooding you
know if it wasn't all Batman yeah and he
made a movie that was did all the stuff
that like a rift that a great Batman
movie should do right where it's like
action-packed and has serious moments
but is somewhat light in a way that like
is way more palatable to a broad
audience yeah no definitely which is
weird because it's actually really nerdy
that kind of tone is kind of a nerdy
weird specialist tone yeah it's it's
it's completely and totally socially
acceptable right now and actually
socially expected to think superhero
movies are cool yeah and we take for
granted that 15 years ago that was not
the case well this is a good bridge to
talking about your new movie that while
you talk about it that's right he did
you but a city said no doubt go at that
segue just say that and we'll move so
prometheus is is an arm movie it's not
really a broad audience well it's
obviously a broad audience but it's an
adult audience yes and I'm curious to
know what your thoughts are me we've got
movies like The Avengers that are very
much like they're for kids and they're
for the kids parents as well and this
seems like you specifically really and
you are obviously trying to make
something that is for adults yeah I
think you know the first thing that I
have to say and I and I mean this
completely genuinely without an ounce of
Hollywood you know false
modesty is its Ridley's movie John and I
John John certainly contributed at a
tremendous amount of ideas most of which
I built on and then I came up with some
stuff organically to the process but at
the end of the day my job was sitting
across a table from Ridley Scott asking
him a series of questions like he was on
60 minutes
and then based on his answers to those
questions I then went and generated at a
screenplay but that process that I just
described to you went over the course of
three or four weeks so I really felt
like I just I just kind of bullied
Ridley into dictating the movie to tell
you what then I got to put my name on it
so the movie a lot of the ideas are
actually the seeds are from Ridley
directly absolutely because a aside from
its relationship to the original alien
which is a question iterations of that
question are the things that I've been
asked about the most I'm looking forward
to it at the end of the day when you're
working with Ridley Scott who is and
people throw the word visionary around a
lot but that's literally what he is by
definition and so he's gonna make the
movie he needs to get the movie and it's
not about me coming in and saying hey
Ridley I've got this great idea do you
want to direct it it's about him saying
I want to direct a movie in this
universe here's what I want it to be
about here are the ideas that excite me
here are the thematics that I'm
interested in and here are the character
traits that I want to demonstrate and
it's it's not to reduce the process of
screenwriting but I feel like in film
which is much different than what I did
in TV it is a little bit like Mad Libs
where my job is essentially you know
really saying adjectives now you know
euphemism and you know that's how the
movie was made yeah that's and that
exactly I'm sure he'll be excited when
to hear that you describe the
moviemaking process as Mad Libs i but i
but I do feel like I I have great pride
in my own lack of authorship in the
movie and I feel like if the movie is a
huge success it's all because of Ridley
Scott and if the movie is not a success
it's because I wasn't able to execute
his vision successfully and that's
that's the that's the feeling that I
have so let's talk about the connection
between aliens or alien or that universe
because there's been there seems to be
some and correct me if I'm wrong but I
feel like people who are talking about
the movie who are involved with the
movie have gone not out of their way but
have made a point to say look this isn't
a sequel to alien or aliens or alien 3
or alien Reservoir
sure or alien versus Predator right or
alien versus Predator - yes you're
saying this is a different movie but it
is in I mean it's it's not a sequel -
it's a prequel if anything right you're
not even calling it that well I mean I
take exception to the fact that it that
it's called a prequel because and and
and I know a lot of this sounds a lot
like that you have to get on slightly
defensive terrain but for me just as a
fan boy when I hear the word prequel
that doesn't get me excited like and the
reason that it doesn't get me excited
isn't because I have a negative
association with prequels we have to
think like what's contextualized that
word the first time that I heard that
word in any sort of public or social
setting was in reference to the fact
that George was going to do the first
three Star Wars movies and I was
enormous ly excited about that yeah that
aside once you actually see what a
prequel is a prequel is by definition a
march towards the inevitable so while we
know that the guy is going to get the
girl or there's going to be a happy
ending there's certain story beats that
you hit the idea of saying I'm now just
gonna watch this young boy turn into
Darth Vader you're leading me into the
story that I already know there's
certain things that I know can't happen
like nothing's gonna happen to obi-wan
right because it's a prequel and so I
and and then I went and saw the thing
prequel and I loved the I love John
Carpenter's The Thing and I was really
excited about it but then when it ended
it spoiler alert the the thing ends with
a dog that has the thing inside it
running across the frozen tundra as it's
being chased by a helicopter that's
shooting at it and when I saw that there
was a small degree of satisfaction in
terms of like oh this is where the other
movie began and on the heels of that a
tremendous amount of disappointment and
going like then why did I just watch
this movie it was just sort of you just
wrote the prologue for me and I felt it
was really important that prometheus was
not positioned as a prologue to alien
right that in fact if Prometheus were
successful and there was a sequel to it
the sequel to Prometheus would not be
alien I also felt like alien is as close
to a perfect movie as it gets
and I was very reluctant to engage in a
conversation that would somehow diminish
alien right like that if you saw if for
some reason Prometheus didn't succeed
creatively that when you went and
watched alien again you'd be like this
movie is now you should taste it would
be soured in some way why yeah why why
oh I bet that so all that by way of
saying that if you my hope is that if
you see Prometheus and you watch alien
again there will be certain things that
where mysteries before about alien that
you have more clarity on but not but but
the mysteries that made a lien great are
still mysteries right and I've had a
certain degree of success and failure in
mystery resolution I feel some mysteries
are just much more engaging than their
resolution and I don't want to answer
those it's like ooh where is Amelia
Earhart
she's rotting somewhere and the bottom
of like the ocean are you like you're
saying that's probably unless she was
abducted by aliens or you know or she's
living you know somewhere in you know in
France
like 15 high-end and has discovered the
Fountain of Youth like but the reality
is is the answer to these mysteries are
usually less compelling than whatever
our imagination transposes onto them and
so if they're I do think that we
succeeded in if there's a sequel to
Prometheus it's not about the things
that alien is about which is eggs and
facehuggers and chess bursters and
xenomorphs right like that that not only
alien but then aliens they need to go
and live off on that tangent prometheus
is launching its servicing that tangent
it's saying here's an explanation you'll
understand the context of maybe where
some of those things came from but it's
much more interested in going off in its
own direction and where there a sequel
to Prometheus it probably wouldn't need
to trade in any of those ideas so let me
let's just get nerdy for a second I'm
gonna get real specific as opposed to
what I did for the last 20 minutes
you're speaking very broadly about that
you know you're kind of setting the
stage for this but
yes but here's my impression based on
the trailers and it's funny because I
actually could not I haven't seen alien
for years probably since not since I was
a teenager or like I really young like
13 mm-hmm
and it was on television we had this
debate in the podcast and we were
talking like how does it start because I
couldn't remember mm-hmm and it was on
television I watched it and I remembered
I saw a bunch of stuff I was like oh yes
now it all makes sense so Prometheus
clearly is not about Sigourney Weaver's
character correct it's clearly not about
I mean I think from just what I see in
the trailer it's not about people
fighting the alien creatures that
doesn't seem to be at least said that's
not what a hint of what I've seen you
know yes but it does seem to be taking
place in or on or around the the
beginning of alien which is or or alien
full-stop which is this large there's
this large alien craft they stumble upon
I mean that is that seems to be in your
in Prometheus so there is a connection
some connective tissue there right I
mean there is there are places that are
shared there else is what I'm asking yes
but not I I I think that again I'm not
trying to be Crypt overly cryptic but if
I answer all these questions I think
that we cross that line from let me just
say like there there was a two minute
trailer out there that people were like
I can't wait to see this movie and then
there was a three minute international
child yeah and that one extra minute of
material is the line that you cross
where people start to say you told me to
my right and I agree I think the trailer
was gave away so my desire to not tell
you what is the relationship between my
hope is and again this is frustrating to
some but it's the space in which I live
which is the reason to me that I loved
inception was after inception was over
there was stuff for me to fight about
and discuss with my friends as to what
it meant what happened what was a dream
what wasn't a dream like all those
things that the movie left in some sort
of ambiguous space and I know ambiguity
is a very scary word especially when you
apply it to the context of of the
television that I've done
however I will continue to embrace
ambiguity because I find it really
interesting and I have a tremendous
amount of faith in the intelligence of
the audience most of them are much
smarter than I am and I will have an
intention but the idea of not spelling
it out entirely I will tell you right
now that this movie even when you go and
see it there is space to debate what the
relationship between this movie and
alien is we are not connecting the dots
for you we are giving you the requisite
information to make an impassioned an
impassioned discussion about it
you will know a hell of a lot more than
you did before but it's not like this
movie ends with a derelict spacecraft
full of eggs crash landing on lv-426
which is the derelict spacecraft of the
Nostromo happens upon at the beginning
of alien that's inevitability and it's
not interesting right so but with
ambiguity the the danger there is it by
the way I'm not just I think I'm not
trying to get you to tell me like what
happens in the movie no I guess I was
there in the same universe because
there's been a debate with people that
this isn't it's completely separate
right a universe they are they share the
universe absolutely and I don't want to
segue into the viral of the movie but I
will say like when Ridley and I and I'm
sure he and John and a couple of guys
worth mentioning
Michael elenberg who was sort of
Ridley's right-hand guy at scot-free
when I came on there and an executive
producer in the movie and then the guy
Steve as bell who was an executive at
20th Century Fox who was like the hugest
like alien compendium of information
incredibly impatient creative guy those
guys are worth mentioning very early on
we started saying this is the question
that is not going to go away is it a
prequel what is it so is there a way
that we can start generating content
other than just the trailer to start as
opposed to Ridley Scott in interviews or
me and interview saying here's the
movies relationship to alien where we
can begin to message to the people who
care about that stuff and the people who
care are the people who are fans of the
original the Nerds the fanboys if we're
gonna typecast so that was the birth of
the the Weiland idea
now Weiland was a character in John
Speights draft he's a key he is a
character that appears in Prometheus in
a different way than he did originally
but I said Weyland becomes the universal
bridge because we all know the name of
the the company in an alien is
weyland-yutani they are the company that
basically that the Nostromo works for
and there are multi a conglomerate
that's into terraforming amongst other
things and so if we say Weyland is in
our movie and we give the audience some
context for who he is and we are then
they'll know that they're happening in
the same universe right and can we can
we shoot a cool piece of material that's
not gonna be in our movie it's not a
trailer it's not a scene that you see
three months before the movie comes out
it just exists completely and totally on
its own that will begin to sort of
message that to the people that care and
we think it's important to do that and
really completely and totally agreed and
that was the birth of what evolved into
this Peter Weyland TED talk right that
we unveiled at ed and then and then went
viral that guy Pierce who plays Weyland
in the movie agreed to do and I think
that it's hard to watch that in any
context and then make the argument that
these don't occupy the same timeline
yeah what's interesting about the
original alien is you can watch that
movie and be like I'm curious as to what
who what's the story with that space
jockey in this derelict ship but that
isn't important the movie isn't telling
you that that's important the movie is
telling you that the thing that just
jumped out of the egg on that ship and
is now stuck to John Hurt space that's
important that's what you're supposed to
worry about now and then and then the
sequel and so on and so forth but the
idea that Prometheus now enters into a
more and maybe this is why Ridley and
those guys sought me out in the first
place into the movie is asking very
specific questions the characters are
saying we want answers to these
questions some of the answers they get
some of the answers they extrapolate and
but then something happens that leads
the resolution of the
questions is secondary to their own
survival I think all of this stuff is
already endemic people don't want to see
Prometheus like a bunch of people
sitting around a table pondering the
meaning of life they want to see like
what happens when you open Pandora's box
like that's fundamental sci-fi
storytelling the scientist wants to make
giant tomatoes to feed the world and the
next thing you know there's enormous
ants and spiders like crawling through
Albuquerque eating people and it's it's
that idea of like we want to there's a
line we shouldn't cross the line we all
know we shouldn't cross it we shouldn't
fly too close to the Sun we shouldn't
steal fire from the gods
we do it anyway we can't help ourselves
we're humans and then we pay the
consequences
that's sci-fi 101 that's a story that
really wanted to tell that's why I loved
Blade Runner it's it's why I loved alien
and it's like almost every alien movie
is essentially about an iteration of the
same theme which is no matter what these
things do to us the company keeps
feeling there's a way to monetize all
right you know right it's like all right
well you you think we would have learned
our lesson that we got it right it is
odd you would think for such a smart
group of people they would just go you
know what but that's us I mean we can't
help ourselves and we want to everyone
says like oh my god like when people are
in a scary you know in a house and they
hear noise in the Attic and then they're
like we should go check that out you
just moan to yourself like ah but if
they just left the house like what's
that movie right you know or but in but
it's your life you would I mean you
would you go investigate the sound I
guess maybe you would I'll tell you what
I would do I would call the police
that's what I do just immediately
depends on the sound maybe just like a
little like a squeak or something you're
not gonna call the police no I will go
and check it out what's say what how
what kind of sound would it have to be
to get you to call the police let me ask
you a question like is the house like a
people been murdered in the house before
yeah you bought a house you got a summer
home for your family yes and you found
out when you guys were moving in and
that family had been murdered there
right and then I hear a noise in the end
you hear a noise it sounds like a person
moaning yeah uh I do not go and check
that you call the police right well I
send my wife or that's nice you know
he's just I'm sure your wife would be so
happy
see with the screaming right on it is
yeah that's really wonderful um I
probably don't do anything you know I
probably just like that's a really scary
noise like we should just stay down and
flip the house right for profit sure
absolutely best try not to do try not
like no bet the murder think we're
grandfathered in
we weren't murdered yeah you were there
for a whole couple of days right exactly
Prometheus viral stuff yes you first off
what is your level of involvement in the
in the viral things like the the David
video and and you've got a new one a new
viral video that's yeah it just could've
just came out the the viral stuff that
stuff that we did on lost all the time
I'm really into viral stuff for other
movies I did not invent viral by any
stretch of the imagination but it's
always been something that I've really
been interested in one of the one of the
failings I think sometimes a viral
content is that it doesn't feature the
actors from the movie so it's just like
it's kind of like just for the Nerds so
it's like put together the trailer for
the movie or whatever and I love doing
that stuff but I'm essentially like for
something to really like be interesting
and compelling like it should have the
same production value or the movie and
for that you need the resources so it's
like who's gonna have the balls to say
to Michael Fassbender can we take you
for a day and do this cool idea that we
had but Ridley the great there are so
many great things about him but he and
Tony run this company RSA which is
essentially their commercial production
house so they have all these brilliant
like young commercial directors who are
enormous ly innovative individuals used
to basically just kind of
conceptualizing and figuring out on
their own laptops how to make content
and so we had that resource at our
disposal and so Michael elenberg and I
essentially started saying like the the
first idea I had was I was just really
into TED Talks and I was like we should
do a TED talk with Weyland and it'll be
we'll get if we can talk guy into it we
don't have to do a full 18 minute TED
talk but we could talk about some of the
themes of the movie but it'll be like in
the future like we'll set it in like
2023 tree tab and like we just have to
ask Ted
they let us use their branding otherwise
it'll be like a Fred talk and it'll feel
like cheap and disingenuous right and I
know this guy Tom Riley who is who's
sort of them you know this very plugged
in super tech-savvy very cool geek at
Ted who when I went to the conference
was sort of like my conduit in there I
called him up and was like would you
guys be open to letting us use the Ted
branding and he said I'll do you one
better
what if you showed it at Ted you know
what if you unveiled it at Ted and we
and you could use even the Ted website
to show this thing and so everybody got
super excited about that when we pitched
it to Ridley and then he essentially I
wrote the TED talk and and then his son
Luke Ridley's son Luke directed guy
through the TED talk and then produced
that entire thing through our essay and
then the I said the other idea that we
had was we should do a commercial for
David the Android I was like there's
there's commercials for iPhones this is
before Siri came along it's like there's
a commercial for an iPad or an iPhone
wouldn't a robot have a commercial like
and what would that look like
and so this guy Johnny hard staff that's
his real name
come on you know what his porn name is
Glenn Frankfurt like it's completely
innocuous no his name's Johnny hard
right of course I'm we have to be he be
he basically took that idea the David
idea and ran with it and I wrote some
some some dialogue for that but a lot of
the visual ideas were totally Johnny's
and and were produced by those guys and
then the first piece of viral was new we
were really wanted numiri pass to
basically be the star of the movie and
she had done Girl with the Dragon Tattoo
and was already doing the Sherlock
Holmes sequel but I think Fox just
wanted to see to see her on film to do a
screen test with her and so I wrote this
this transmission that she makes to
Wayland in an effort to try to convince
him to fund her crazy mission and so
that it would just be a monologue for
her because there wasn't really any
there weren't really any monologues in
the movie and so we gave that to new me
and then she did it and it was super
Ridley didn't shoot like it wasn't just
new Mira Paz on video he filmed it like
she was in costume
she you know it was there was incredibly
high production value it was like well
this should go on the DVD and I was like
screw the DVD this should be a piece of
viral like if I saw this on my laptop
like on YouTube I would find it
enormously compelling I'd wanna I want
to go see that movie right and so that
was that was sort of the genesis for for
that idea so in Fox marketing I have to
say like it's easy to blow smoke because
essentially they're my bosses but all
the people over there from bumble Ward
and and and Katherine covert and Nathan
Marcy of all like so embraced the viral
idea they completely understood what it
was and so the idea of using that to
kind of bolster the more traditional
trailers because there was this period
where nobody was talking about
Prometheus is it a prequel what is it
and then very quickly we just flooded
everybody with all this material so then
the conversation became about like well
what is this
what does this mean how does this how
does this fit into the overall puzzle of
the movie and they just the way that
they doled it out and however they doled
it out created a zeitgeist where there
there was no as I guys there was only
sort of curiosity bordering on
frustration yeah because it's that thing
of like you've got to give me something
right and I think the viral became an
answer to all right well this is the
something that we're giving you what's
really interesting about it too is that
it creates this growl it somehow makes
the it makes the film so much larger it
broadens that universe of the movie
right it's like suddenly it feels like
it's got gravity that didn't have before
because there are artifacts from that
universe that have you know it's kind of
clear the David commercials not gonna
appear in the movie yes right you
wouldn't have that in the middle of the
film but it gives the idea of this
universe so much more wait to have these
little artifacts that live outside of
the film itself which i think is really
fascinating it's something that we now
have a medium where we can we can you
can you can do the film for theaters yes
and but we've got this amazing fluid
flexible medium of the web that allows
you to show the masses these other
little pieces that kind of flesh out
some way that the universe that you're
trying to create for the big screen and
I think that as native people are so
hungry for any additional content
because it creates this sort of this
this feeling of being in the know being
a super fan of something you have sort
of a stock-in-trade so you're able to
say like hey did you see the David video
and other people are like no and you're
like oh I'll send you the link and then
that suddenly makes you a purveyor of
content you're you're on the inside and
I think it's like again to go back to
like kind of what Marvel did buy it at
the end of Iron Man by just dropping in
that reference to the Avengers and
having you know Nick Fury pitched that
Avengers initiative and that became the
first piece of viral for that I have a
better word you know that led us down
the road to Avengers but suddenly what
started happening is for any Marvel
movie the entire audience would just sit
there through all of the credits just to
have the experience of watching 90
seconds more of content and it and and
it's like did you did you need to do
this Joss Whedon you did not you're
giving this to me this gift like you've
already got my 14 bucks and you're not
only gonna give me like one post-credit
scenes but now like if I sit through the
entire movie there's yet another one and
thank you like any kind of sort it's a
premium is what it is because you know
as opposed to looking at at viral as
marketing to get you to see the next one
which by the way that's what the Tony
Stark Nick Fury scene at the end of Iron
Man is it's viral marketing they're
essentially saying go buy a ticket for
the Avengers right like if you didn't
know what homing like you and I knew
what the Avengers were before we saw
Iron Man but my wife didn't she was like
what's Avengers yeah and I was like oh
boy just wait yeah do you have like two
hours you start with the Infinity
Gauntlet yeah that's that's I mean that
is interesting I mean to think that well
it's actually I think a viral is purely
for the internet but it's interesting to
think about it as something that now is
we're like putting Easter eggs and
movies because they're essentially
Easter eggs in some way right
fanboy culture has bled so much into the
mainstream that people are looking for
it like you said like people are like
looking for these little clues viral is
Sasha Baron Cohen showing up at the
Academy Awards and spelling ashes on
Ryan Seacrest and that's you know it
becomes web content because you heard
that it happened but when it first
happened it was live theater it was you
know it was that it was that idea of a
shell being in the audience so viral by
definition is any form of content that
gets you more excited for the product
that it's steering you towards right
it's Prometheus an action movie and and
before you answer I want to set this up
a little bit it seems like modern-day
science fiction cannot exist without it
having an action component mhm and if
you look at you know a movie like 2001 I
would not classify it's it's not an
action movie correct something else yes
so did you is Prometheus an action movie
or is it something else
I couldn't describe it as an action
movie any more than I would describe
inception as an action movie but there's
a lot of explosions and people shooting
guns and the entire you know that entire
final set piece an inception that takes
place at the snow fortress is actually
an action set piece you know it just
doesn't feel like an action movie so I
wouldn't describe it that way I think
not that I'm putting Prometheus and
Inception on the same in terms of
they're the same movie I'm just
answering your question in that way was
saying like first and foremost I think
it's a sci-fi movie and I think I think
that it's safe to say prometheus is as
much an action movie as alien is a
horror movie which is it trades on those
genre elements obviously just from the
trailer you've seen there's there's much
more of an action fuse on Prometheus
than I think then I then I then I think
alien but I would say aliens is an
action movie
yeah and prometheus is much more if it
feels a lot more like alien than aliens
to me in terms of its storytelling I
think it takes its time and and it's not
just about getting to the next set piece
that being said
once that fuse gets lit it's a there
there is a fair amount of sort of scope
and sizzle to it all and and really
really wanted to do that stuff I think
one of the things that I've been hearing
both again and in in the reoccurring
theme of this interview you take the
good with the bad is and the good side
it's like this feels a lot like the
original alien like because there's
motifs in the original alien there's an
Android you're not entirely sure you
trust there's people in cryosleep
there's a there's a female lead there's
clearly some thing happening to these
people that is reminiscent of those
ideas there's creeping around through
dark corridors with flashlights like so
people go this feels a lot like alien
and then there's other people who are
saying like this feels a lot like alien
so like it's just that it's just more of
the same sex and look and you that
that's what you're up against when you
are courting that fan base and I'll take
it every day of the week like that's the
price of doing business because I I'm
just as critical of of other content and
I rather have people say to me for the
rest of my career
you screwed up a Ridley Scott movie then
not say that to me because I'm like hey
like I got to be involved in a Ridley
Scott and I got a screw over rivers
goddess I fight not only did I screw up
a really Scott movie I screwed up the
first Ridley Scott's sci-fi movie in 30
years like that if that's not gonna go
on your headstone then what should</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
