boy there are three of them their
computer artists or artists that use
computers I think we are three guys that
work with pixels and make images images
like a chair or that robot from Robocop
some nude hippies a cool car in the end
we do everything with a pencil so it's
very I think more the most basic tool in
Photoshop is used to draw the each pixel
the size of the pen - is just one pixel
one by one everything is made like this
one pixel at a time so it's really
labor-intensive but they've been doing
it for nearly 20 years so they've made a
lot of stuff like a ton of stuff
so here they are again
EBU freeze-frame spent KY and Stefan
they all met here in Berlin the capital
of Germany home of the Brandenburg Gate
the Berlin Wall
sausage walkers and world-class graffiti
Stefan and spent have been friends they
were teenagers then when they met Kai in
the mid 90s group was complete between
the three of them they've made images of
Honda Adobe Yahoo total groove armada
Uniqlo mountain dew a six xbox Lacoste
DKNY a rebo HBO Qudrat we work with Mike
a lot o Smith adidas as well with
coca-cola New York Times Magazine Wired
magazine
but that's just to pay the rent I mean
what they're really excited about are
these giant pixel cities they build in
their free time their pixel versions of
real cities
because people know in New York for
example and they see a interpretation of
New York and that's always interesting
to see something you know how it seemed
from from a different side they've
actually built a lot of cities Berlin
Venice London Cologne New York Tokyo
Baltimore Los Angeles Harris RIA and
Marseille and they call them pics aramas
pixelize stylized versions of cities
working in their free time each one
takes two or three years to complete and
as of today they've created over nine
thousand little parts we have a huge
database with thousands of of objects in
it and everything can be reused the
Pyxis and module are modular now this is
the key so you can very easily reuse
pixels and combine them so like you can
get this car and then take this guy out
and put this other guy in or take away
as high or whatever also everything is
isometric so the things that are in
front have the same size as the things
are that are in the back so I can take
this topless lady and have remove all
the way over to this construction site
or have our hangout at this rooftop
barbecue you can move it wherever you
want and she'll always be topless always
the right scale this is a donor it's a
lot like a gyro but it has like
different vegetables different sauces
donors are delicious
there's even a donor place in their
Berlin pics or AMA
look at all this stuff look at all the
detail why would anyone devote their
life to building something like this
what's funny is that at home we had a
picture at from boyhood you know broader
and I grew up with it and it's a scene
with a lot of people of course Bruegel
all those little details that little
universe frozen in time could it be that
when KY was a kid life outside his home
was too complex full of confusion and
constantly changing
but the world of the painting never
changed he could examine it understand
it and maybe now that's what he does
with our world
to be honest I don't think it it has
anything to do with what we do is your
emergency yeah but I don't think so
it turns out it was more practical than
that for example you design something on
a computer a layout for an image you
just do something on your screen then
when you go to print you have to deal
with a different color space you have it
CMYK versus RGB on the screen then you
have to deal with the printer who uses
some kind of special inks and then you
have to deal with a guy that puts more
ink or less ink and so the result for me
never was I was never happy about
anything I printed I could live it with
it but more often than not I was like I
like to make a thing and then that's the
thing but the bad thing about making one
thing is that you cannot copy it so I
wanted to become an artist at some point
but I didn't want to make stuff that is
I have to sell to live and then that guy
puts it on his wall which might be nice
or not I would never see that stuff
again I hated to to to leave it alone so
that was the reason why digitally was so
extremely important being able to share
without having to to to leave your
work
they say a common sign that a pic sarama
isn't complete is if you look around it
and you can't find anywhere you'd like
to be we have a like a theory that there
has to be a place where you have to be
able to relax so if everything is just
in your face I don't want want to be
there so if you see that it's not we
cannot go into it it might be a source
of a problem so for example here you
have this scene in a cafe where the guys
are sitting with the computers and
that's for example place I think
everyone from us what I'd love to be
there yeah there are all these epidemics
working the blue shirts they they did
not talk in there they're the jeans yeah
their lunch hour I know their coffee
Joulies man sure but they didn't always
have genius lunches I mean up until the
fall of the Berlin Wall both spent in
Stefan lived in East Berlin when you get
it when you are a teenager and you see
that you can't go through the wall you
see the wall every day and you can't
travel so and you see it unknown
Intellivision divest all the cool stuff
all the pens played in an invest Belen
so you could hit in the radio with but
you couldn't go there so if you had some
cool stuff going on to like East German
bands playing in like churches and stuff
like in really strange places it was
very very cool as well but that weren't
the bands we wanted to see in the first
place so but growing up and Estonia was
pretty normal
that was a bit like a surreal moment and
about a sudden you can go to the side of
three-d-- was the foil was like a secret
hidden world and no it was just possible
and it took a while to believe it as
it's not normal for me it was like I
really ever after the work him down
there there was advertising everywhere
so back then East Germany was really
like black and white everything was kind
of the same the I remember I have first
went to like a supermarket it was like a
like a gallery all those cereal packages
and boxes and it is it was so exciting
just such a really cheap supermarket
here and in this area
it seems like everything they're excited
about eventually gets immortalized in
pixels and given a home in their cities
and they're pretty much excited about
everything
for us it's very important to to have
time to to play really setups one to see
we are really lucky to have to have met
you see it on on bands sometimes it's
just luck that somehow they matched and
it was a good fit and for us it's just
good that we are happy and we can live
from it
and we enjoy our work and that's quick I
guess
