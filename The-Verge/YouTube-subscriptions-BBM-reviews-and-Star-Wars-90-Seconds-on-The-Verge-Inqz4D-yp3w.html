Danberg the keeper of the keys at the
verge can I get the bathroom key yeah
it's 90 seconds on the verge YouTube is
preparing its own music subscription
service billboard reports that the
service will work similar to Spotify but
with an added video components sources
close to the project say the service
could launch by the end of the year if
the reports are true you'll be able to
either subscribe to google youtube music
service or Google's other music
subscription service wait what's the
difference blackberry's BBM app is now
available for iOS and Android and all
the kids are saying the exact same thing
the apps page in the Google Play Store
has been tarnished by hundreds of
seemingly thick user reviews though the
star ratings differ all the reviews have
the same grammatically incorrect phrase
blackberry said it had no part in the
so-called astroturfing and the phrase
had become something of a meme a very
very nerdy meme and finally the Jedi is
returning or at least the guy who wrote
it is Lawrence Kasdan is taking over
writing duties on the upcoming Star Wars
Episode 7 along with director JJ Abrams
the change of writers should come as
exciting news to fans of the series
Kasdan helped write the screenplays for
both the Empire Strikes Back and the
return of the jedi unfortunately fans
will have to wait until 2015 to visit a
galaxy far far away and that's it for
today's top stories coming up tomorrow I
addition to be on The Price is Right an
ipad 2 100 dollars drew four hundred
dollars</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
