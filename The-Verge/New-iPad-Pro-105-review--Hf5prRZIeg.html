iPads and so now we definitely know the
difference between a pro iPad and an
iPad iPad type iPad here's what it is a
iPad pro has a bigger screen a better
screen a faster processor four speakers
support for an Apple pencil and support
for a smart keyboard okay so what does
all that mean well it means that this
right here is an all-new shape it is a
10.5 inch iPad and it's so good and so
powerful it really just feels like Apple
showing off now
okay so 10.5 inches is an all new size
for an iPad and you can see here what
Apple has done is they've increased the
size of the entire iPad just a little
bit but they've also reduced the size of
the bezels they're still pretty big on
the top and the bottom but they're way
smaller on the sides so why bother
making a new size well Apple says in
part it's so that you can have a full
size keyboard now I don't know what
Apple's definition of full sizes but
it's not the same as mine this is not a
full size keyboard but it is just a
little bit bigger and it makes a big
difference when you're trying to touch
type on it that also applies to the
smart Keyboard that Apple offers here it
is and it is what we expect from a smart
keyboard what we've seen before it
connects with a little connector on the
bottom and it doesn't have shortcut keys
so a lot of people prefer the Logitech
keyboards which have shortcut keys and
they're also backlit but I really do
like this keyboard it's a little bit
awkward on your lap but it folds up to a
really small size so the thing is really
compact and portable anyway back to the
screen the screen on any iPad is the
most important element and the screen on
this 10.5 inch iPad is so good
it's basically unfair apples like that
football team in the fourth quarter
that's leading by twenty-something
points and they're just running up a
score because they can what do you need
to know about the screen
well it's 20 to 24 by 16 68 whatever
it's the same pixel density that we
expect from high-end iPads and
everything looks great on it it has all
the iPad pro screen stuff it has a true
tone display so it can ambiently detect
the color temperature of the room and
change the color of the screen to match
it it gets super bright up to 600 nits
it's oleophobic so you have fewer
fingerprints on it it's less reflective
it has a full p3 color gamut it's fully
laminated so the pixels feel like
they're right there on the glass all
that stuff is pretty standard but what's
new on this iPad is that there's a
higher refresh rate Apple calls it pro
motion and what it means is the screen
can refresh at 120 Hertz or up to 120
Hertz who cares why does that matter
well it matters because when you're
doing stuff on the screen like scrolling
the pixels stick with your finger a
little bit faster there's
tiny tiny little bit less lag there and
when you're drying with an Apple pencil
there's also less latency Apple says
it's down to 20 milliseconds which by
the way speaking of running up the score
is literally one millisecond less than
what Microsoft just claimed on its
latest product ok here the rest of the
specs just to get them out of the way on
the back is a 12 megapixel camera with
optical image stabilization it's the
same camera as on an iPhone 7 I think
it's super overkill for an iPad but
whatever taking pictures of the nigh pad
is a thing it's okay I don't judge it's
also really useful document scanning if
you want to do that on the front is a
seven megapixel camera you've also of
course got touch ID which on this one is
the latest generation so it's fast there
are four speakers you can get it with
LTE which this one has it also inside
has an a 10x fusion chip it's an apple
custom-made chip for iPads and what
matters is that it's just ridiculously
fast you're not going to have any
problems with performance on this thing
the other thing you won't have any
problems with on this thing is battery
life apple claims it gets you can get
about 10 hours on it and actually I'm
getting really close to that I'm getting
close to 9 little over 9 hours a couple
of times this past week so that's good
Apple never lies about battery life and
that applies here this thing should last
you all day no problem so I haven't
talked to town about software yet and
that's because the software that's
running on this iPad pro is the same iOS
10 that you already know you hit the
home button to go home to a big screen
of apps you slide over to get a split
view if you want to have two windows at
once basically the same stuff that you
expect from an iPad and I've seen an
iPad for a couple years now but what's
coming later this year is iOS 11 and it
is going to radically change your
ability to use the iPad as your main
computer the kind of stuff you're going
to see is you're going to swipe up to
get a dock just like a Mac where you
have a ton of apps on it you can also do
split-screen and you can even bring up a
third screen you can do drag and drop
and it's crazy multi-touch drag drop so
you can take multiple objects and drag
them together and slide them over to
another app and most exciting to me
because I'm a nerd is you're going to
have a real file system so you can get
access to your files without going
through
crazy who said she used to have to go
through whether your files are on
Dropbox or onedrive or Google Drive or
iCloud they're just going to be there
ready to access for any app iOS 11 is
going to completely change the dynamic
about whether or not this thing can
become your main computer but you can
get this right now and not wait for iOS
11 it's running iOS 10 and so should you
well let's run through it to start this
is expensive the iPad pro 10.5 starts at
six hundred and fifty dollars and if
you're going to spend six hundred fifty
bucks on a thing you should probably
think about making it your primary
device and if you're going to try and
make this thing your primary device you
probably want to step up to the $750
Edition which has 256 gigs of storage
which is enough storage for your main
computer now the question the perennial
question for iPads is can you make it
your main computer well maybe if you
know a lot about iOS you know exactly
what you need out of a computer you know
how to get everything out of it you
could probably pull it off for me I
can't quite do that there are a few
things that I just can't get out of an
iPad right now but I think that I change
with iOS 11 so if you're not in a hurry
I would wait wait for iOS 11 see what it
does to iPads see if you can turn this
thing into your main computer until then
basically if you need an iPad and you
must have the best thing the iPad pro
10.5 inch is definitely the best thing
