I'm here with the new 13-inch MacBook
Pro with Retina display it looks very
much like the previous MacBook Pro only
it is far far thinner because it omits
the optical drive it's got some new
ports here it's it's got the new Mac
safe port it's got two Thunderbolt ports
USB 3 on the other side it's got an HDMI
port obviously SD card slot and another
USB 3 obviously the the big change here
is the Retina display this has an
effective resolution of 1280 by 800 but
because it's pixel doubled you can't see
the pixels it looks amazing you can also
run it at 1680 by 1050 which is a
resolution of the old 15-inch MacBook
Pro which is great so this has a lot of
potential for pro users if you have a
15-inch MacBook Pro there's you have
every reason to look at this and
particularly important is this thing
seems to perform really really well so
we put together kind of an insane test
here I've got GarageBand open I've got a
1080p Iron Man 3 trailer and I've got
aperture with a 21 megapixel raw file
open this is the CPU monitor you can see
all four cores are kind of barely doing
anything I'm gonna start Ironman I'm
gonna start GarageBand this is a
cacophony of sound and I'm going to
start scrolling around in aperture let's
get iron man open here and you can see
everything is just kind of working
pretty well and the CPU is only about at
half so although it has integrated
graphics until HD 4000 graphics and it's
pushing this ultra high resolution
screen performance seems to be actually
really great
erasing kind of a big worry people had
about those graphics powering this
display so that is the 13-inch MacBook
Pro with Retina display that's a great
product if you're like me and you have a
15-inch MacBook Pro you have a whole new
reason to want a smaller computer</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
