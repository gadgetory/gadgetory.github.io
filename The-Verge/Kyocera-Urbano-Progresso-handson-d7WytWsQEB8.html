we're at eight years launch event in
Tokyo Japan for their summer models and
we're taking a look at the newest
incarnation of Kyocera speaker list
smartphone
okay the bone phone you might remember
this from CES the phone actually doesn't
have what you would commonly think of as
as a speaker grille up here and it uses
the entire surface of the screen for
bone conduction so you can press the
phone anywhere up against your head and
hear clearly in noisy environments it's
great for people that are hearing
impaired and this is the first
application of the speak of smartphone
technology that we're seeing in the
device this is for the Japanese market
it's launching with a 1.4 gigahertz
processor Android 4.0 it's got a 4.3
inch WVGA pentile AMOLED display which
maybe is not the best display on the
market it's also launching with a couple
of interesting business applications
bundled in notably we've got the die
gteen Japanese Japanese dictionary and
the genius whoops
and the genius English Japanese and
Japanese English dictionary bundled in
so you know that's probably 80 to 100
dollars worth of bundled software that's
that's packed in
so it's really good value other than
that we have 4 gigabytes of on-board
storage we have an 8 you could 8
megapixel camera and that's pretty much
all there is to say this is the Urbana
Progresso from Kyocera and KDDI</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
