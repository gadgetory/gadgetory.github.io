been promising to mine the Moon.
And now, they’ve announced their plan to
get started.
The company wants to set up a robotic lunar
outpost on the Moon’s South Pole by 2020.
The concept relies on this new fleet of robotic
landers that Moon Express wants to build called
the MX Robotic Explorers.
These spacecraft range in size — from the
small MX-1 to the larger MX-9.
All are powered by a new “eco-friendly engine”
Moon Express is building, too, called the
PECO.
And the vehicles all are flexible in purpose.
They can be used as landers to put payloads
on the lunar surface or used as orbiters to
travel around the Moon.
And some are even equipped for sample return.
The MX-9, for instance, can carry the smaller
MX-1 to the Moon’s surface.
And from there, the MX-1 can lift off again,
bringing resources back to Earth.
And just for reference, the last time anyone
brought something back from the Moon was in
1976.
Bringing back Moon rocks would be super cool
— both for researchers and for those looking
to take their rock collections to a whole
new level.
But Moon Express wants to do more than just
excavate lunar rocks.
The company is also interested in the Moon’s
water supply — well ice supply.
There is a whole bunch of ice at the Moon’s
poles, and Moon Express wants to extract that
material and potentially turn it into rocket
propellant that could then be used to fuel
spacecraft that are already in space.
Bob Richards: The importance of water on the
Moon and its constituents — hydrogen and
oxygen — are rocket fuel, so the Moon becomes
like a gas station in the sky.
However, the company has yet to detail the
technology it will use to actually mine the
Moon’s resources.
Before any of that can happen, Moon Express
has to prove it can get even one spacecraft
to the lunar surface.
The company is starting small with its MX-1E
lander.
It’s the smallest vehicle of the family,
designed to fly on top of an experimental
rocket called the Electron, which is made
by Rocket Lab.
Bob Richards: This little robot [MX-1] is
a robot that can fly from low-Earth orbit
all the way to the Moon by itself and land
itself on the Moon.
Once on the Moon, the MX-1E can ignite its
engine to “hop” across the surface, as
well as send back photos and videos to Earth.
Moon Express plans to fly the lander for the
first time later this year as part of the
Google Lunar X Prize, a competition to send
the first privately funded vehicle to the
Moon.
If Moon Express is the first to land its lander
before the other contestants, it’s poised
to win a $20 million grand prize purse.
Time is running out, though.
The mission has to launch before the end of
the year — the deadline for the competition.
And Moon Express has yet to show any of the
MX-1E lander’s hardware.
Richards says they’re still doing tests
of different components and putting the vehicle
together in Florida.
Also the Electron rocket that’s supposed
to carry the lander isn’t exactly ready
yet.
The Electron has only flown once, during a
test flight, out of New Zealand.
The vehicle made it to space but didn’t
quite make it to orbit.
Rocket Lab says it has figured out why, but
there are still two more test launches of
the Electron before the rocket can carry customers.
If the MX-1E mission is a success, it paves
the way for the next two missions Moon Express
wants to do.
It plans to start the lunar outpost in the
next few years, by launching one of its landers
to the South Pole to prospect for water and
establish a permanent presence.
Then in 2020, the company hopes to launch
its sample return mission.
If it can pull that off, Moon Express will
prove it can both land its vehicles on the
Moon and return them to Earth.
Bob Richards: We’re here to try and inspire
a whole new generation, open up the frontier
of the Moon, and redefine the possible.
And I think we have a great future ahead of
us, collapsing the cost of transportation
from Earth orbit to everywhere else.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
