selling hard copies of RL stine's
goosebumps I'm Nathan psyker tanned this
is 90 seconds on the verge is this
Amazon smartphone BGR claims were
looking at an early prototype wrapped in
a protective case to conceal its true
design here's the interesting part it
has five yes five front-facing cameras
rumors have long pointed Amazon
smartphone having a 3d experience with
the cameras being used to track your
face to give the illusion of a 3d space
but the bigger question is why would
Amazon want to enter the highly
competitive low-margin smartphone market
in the first place amazon has already
proven it can be successful with
e-readers tablets and even set-top boxes
but those will always be secondary to
your smartphone or device you always
have with you amazon also has a major
advantage over even Apple and Samsung it
can compete on price without subsidies
and doesn't need carrier partnerships
amazon.com is already the world's number
one online retailer and right now five
months top six best selling electronics
are its own devices it doesn't need to
be on actual store shelves to generate
sales and Amazon's philosophy is to sell
devices as close to break even as
possible the kindle kindle fire and fire
TV all of one important thing in common
they're all basically storefronts for
Amazon to sell you books movies music
virtually anything and smartphones are
more or less the only screen left to own
according to The Wall Street Journal
amazon is expected to announce a
smartphone by june with plans to ship it
by September for more on Amazon check
out the verge coming up Jeff Bezos
unveils the kindling fire it's perfect
for burning all those books you just
rebaudiana kindle</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
