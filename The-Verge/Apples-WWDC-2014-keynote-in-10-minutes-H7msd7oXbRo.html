powerful platforms OS 10 and iOS we
collected our crack product marketing
team they first ventured south
discovering OS 10 Oxnard OS 10 we we
discovered OS 10 Yosemite we started
with the most fundamental controls
you'll see how the use of translucent
materials gives you a sense of place as
you scroll your content and check out
these beautifully crafted new icons we
also focused on precise and consistent
typography throughout all in all our
gorgeous and more usable version of OS
10 next let's talk about Notification
Center you get an edit glance look at
your calendar your reminders weather and
more you can extend the contents of
today view with the contents of widgets
and apps that you've downloaded from the
App Store
next up spotlight or you get a big field
right in the middle of the display and
if you just type a few characters you
can launch an app just like that we also
tap into sources of information on the
internet type a few characters in like
Yosemite you can get news feed
information from Wikipedia and even maps
so next iCloud drive your Mac in
addition to let you look on those within
the document has all of those folders
right accessible inside a finder and in
addition to those apps that are local to
your Mac you can get a content from iOS
documents next up mail instead of your
message bouncing off your recipients
mail server you can elect to have the
attachments sent encrypted and securely
via iCloud separately message and it
rendezvous is on the receiving end and
those attachments can be up to five gigs
in size
so next markup have you ever been
working on an email message and you
realize that if you could just maybe
Circle something or write something on
the message maybe doodle a little
something you could get your point
across so much more clearly well now
with markup you can next up Safari we've
and Yosemite been able to pack all the
power of the Safari UI you
to this single bar now your smart search
field when you click it shows you all of
your favorites right there
you also get spotlight suggestions right
there in your completion menu and this
means you can get it things faster than
ever before
we now have a tab view that gives you a
bird's-eye glance of all of your tabs
something entirely different
it's called continuity we believe you
should be able to use the right device
for the moment maybe your phone your
iPad maybe your Mac now airdrop works
between iOS and the Mac but now we have
something where we really take it to the
next level and it's called
handoff your devices around you are
aware of each other and so if you want
to pick up where you left off on your
Mac on your iPad your iPad is prompting
you right in the lower left of the
screen just swipe up and you can pick up
working on what you're working on your
Mac right on your iPad this looks in the
other direction as well the next area we
really wanted a handle was an SMS we all
love iMessage we can continue our
conversations seamlessly from device to
device but then we have these green
bubble friends they have inferior
devices and they insist on sending us
messages and we don't want to hold it
against them but the problem is that
those messages don't show up on our
other devices now your phone is able to
act as a relay to automatically and
transparently send your messages between
devices we're able to do the same thing
with phone calls hey hey a doctor you're
on speakerphone with via my Mac it's a
wonderful new release Yosemite and it's
available to you developers here today
everyone else will get it in the fall it
will be free today we're announcing iOS
8 what I really love are our new
interactive notifications if you get a
message like this just pull down and you
can reply right where you are
so if you get a calendar event for
instance just pull down and respond you
can also use that same DoubleTap to get
at the people you communicate with most
frequently you're reading a message you
want to remember to get back to it's
gonna mark it on red we can do that with
just a single gesture you want to flag a
message you can just pull across there's
a flag option but if you pull all the
way across
you can delete with just a gesture
different found yourself composing an
email and then you really wish like you
could get it something else in your
inbox maybe for that reply just swipe
that message down and you have access to
the rest of your mail you can search for
apps and find matches of apps that you
don't yet have on the App Store you can
search for points of interest and get
Wikipedia entries and directions you can
search for news search for restaurants
songs not just in your own library but
also on iTunes next technology we call
quick type it's context sensitive for
instance and messages if someone asks
you do you want to go for dinner or
movie it's going to suggest dinner or a
movie it learns how you type the
different people in different apps next
up messages so when it comes to group
messaging you can now name your threads
you can add or remove people from a
conversation underway you can do not
disturb on a per thread level and you
can choose when to leave the thread you
also can share your location and you
also have a really great at a glance
view of all of the pictures and
attachments to have to talk you just
hold your finger down on the microphone
button swipe up with your finger when
you're done talking and send what you
said Craig it's good to hear that you
survived the great hair crisis of 2014
next up iCloud Drive you can bring up
your iCloud Drive panel and open
documents directly from other
applications now something that we all
care a lot about health and with health
you can monitor all of your metrics that
you're most interested in your activity
next up family sharing you automatically
get to share photos with a shared photo
stream to share calendars with your
family to share a fair shared reminder
list you can get it not just your
purchases but the purchases of all the
members of your family and it works
great for kids as well as when they do
make a purchase they get prompted to ask
you for permission we're bringing
together photos with iCloud so that
every photo you're
you take are available to you on all of
your devices your device actually has
access to more photos in the cloud then
it can physically store locally but we
also give you search and so that search
lets you match on things like location
time and also albums that you've set up
we also help you perfect your photos
with great new smart editing controls
you get all your photos in your
organization across your iOS devices and
soon with your Mac and via the web
windows as well if you take your phone
and you plug it in for instance in the
car you can say hey Siri and start
talking to Siri without having to even
touch your following we're rolling out a
number of new features on the store
we're adding an explorer tab we're
adding top trending searches to make
search even better we're giving to
developers the capability to form at
bundles we're introducing app previews
we're also introducing for the first
time today a new beta test service
called tests why this release is the
biggest release since the launch of the
App Store with extensibility
applications from the App Store we'll be
able to extend the system and offer
services to other apps in addition to
the system's built-in sharing options an
app like Pinterest can offer a share
sheet to Safari now we're also
supporting photo filters inside of
photos finally we're enabling
third-party apps to define widgets that
can now go in Notification Center so I
can tap the plus next to sports center
position it where I want I'm on my
widgets and my today beyou tap Done and
now I have information on my favorite
sports teams right here inside of
Notification Center now third-party apps
can take advantage of touch ID as well
we started working with the leaders in
the home automation devices and we've
come up with a comb kit with a common
Network protocol that has secured
pairing to ensure that only your iPhone
can open your garage door
or unlock your door with homekit you can
group devices and changes into scenes
and then with Siri integration you can
say something like get ready for bed and
be sure that your garage door is closed
your door is locked the thermostat is
lowered and your lights are dimmed we
have a new programming language the
language is called Swift and it totally
rules Swift is fast it is modern it is
designed for safety and it enables a
level of interactivity and development
that you've never seen on the platform
with features like closures generics
type inference multiple return types and
namespaces you know many people at home
are going what the heck are these guys
talking about
that's iOS 8 it's gonna be available to
those of you here in beta today and you
guessed it available to everyone else in
