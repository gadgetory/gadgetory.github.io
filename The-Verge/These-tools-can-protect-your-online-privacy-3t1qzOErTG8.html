everywhere around the internet those ads
are incredibly annoying they're kind of
a perpetual reminder that you're not
anonymous online no matter where you go
someone knows what you've been up to
maybe you looked at a sneaker on your
laptop last week and now as firt are
appearing on news sites on your facebook
feed maybe even on your phone that
happens because websites and advertisers
able to track us all across the internet
that's helpful in some cases you want a
website to remember that you're logged
in but it's not helpful in a lot of
other instances most of it is that
advertisers can make sure that you've
seen their ads or say it can target you
with even more specific ads based on
what you've been looking at these are
collecting a ton of information on you
that's something you shouldn't have to
put up with now there's some easy ways
to put a stop to it so maybe you're
thinking well I private browsing mode
it's available in Chrome Firefox you
name it and the mode is helpful but
doesn't have everything you need part
browser mode basically creates a new
untouched identity every time you open
up the browser and wipes it away once
you close the screen that's really
helpful if you're on a shared computer
and you want to say buy a gift for
somebody without leaving any traces
behind but it's not good for long-term
use because you actually do want your
browser to remember some things you
might not want Amazon to have its ads
tracking you everywhere but you do want
Amazon to remember that you're logged in
so how do you do that you need to start
blocking companies from following you
around the web and that's actually
really easy to do because most browsers
have an option for it Safari actually
has it enabled by default but Chrome
Firefox and edge all have an option in
their privacy settings to block
third-party cookies that's a good safe
place to start that'll increase your
privacy okay so what does it actually
mean though what are all these cookies
and add trackers we've been talking
about well a cookie is a chunk of data
that website stores in your computer at
its most basic level this could be
Facebook storing your login credentials
to keep you signed in which is good and
helpful now one website can't access the
cookies stored by another website but
the problem is ad companies can work for
and be present on multiple sites that
lets them gain your browsing information
from one place to use in another so for
example maybe you're looking at Legos on
a web store then the next day you're on
some completely different web site but
you see an ad for
Legos you were looking at yesterday that
happened because the first site Euron
had an ad module that's also on the
second site you're visiting that ad can
check her saved cookie to see what you
were looking at yesterday and show you
an ad for it today that gets even
creepier when it happens across devices
advertising data isn't just kept on your
computer some of it ends up back on
advertisers servers so if you use
multiple devices on the same Wi-Fi
network that network could identify them
as belonging to the same person so an
advertiser might be able to figure out
that the same person who looked at Legos
on a laptop is also the person who owns
this phone and now the ad is on your
phone too this all happens for a couple
reasons for one advertisers want to know
who you are so they can target ads to
you and two they want to make sure you
actually saw their ads they get what
they're paying for even if you find
personalized ads helpful it's hard to
argue the web hasn't compact with
trackers and advertisers haven't taken
things a bit too far so that option
built into your browser can help but
it's not perfect
some work better than others and none of
them block everything if you're really
serious about it you start to download
browser extensions that'll do even more
if you're on a desktop one I really like
is privacy badger from the nonprofit
Electronic Frontier Foundation or the
EFS it doesn't block all trackers
outright instead it's sort of learns as
you're browsing and only blocks the ones
that it thinks are misbehaving so you
might still see some trackers but they
shouldn't be too invasive you might want
to do the same thing on your phone too
you can download a browser that
automatically blocks trackers like
Firefox Focus which is available on iOS
and Android or if you're on iOS I want
to keep using Safari you can download a
content block like one blocker which
will allow you to block trackers and a
lot more too you should also be mindful
of privacy settings where they're
available to you Facebook and Google
both operate immense ad networks and
they each give you some degree of
control over how much data they're
collecting on you and how much they
personalize their ads other ad networks
even let you opt out of some track if
you go to opt-out dot about ads info
anything that gives you an option like
this is helpful but it doesn't
necessarily mean that advertisers are no
longer collecting and storing data on
you if you want to go even further to
protect your privacy there's more you
can do you download an extension like
HTTPS Everywhere there's also from the F
which make sure that you're always going
to the secure version of websites
whenever possible and if you really
really need to browse privately because
of surveillance concerns or censorship
there's always tor which goes a long way
to protect your privacy online this
isn't something that most people are
gonna need but if you're really
concerned about it you should know that
it's an option and it's easier to get
started with it you think you really
just need to download and install the
tor browser I think the best place to
start is that option in your browser
that blocks some of the trackers online
it's not gonna break anything and it's
gonna make the web feel a little bit
