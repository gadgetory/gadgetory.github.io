and we're checking out one to switch
it's one of the launch games for
Nintendo's new switch council think of
one to switch is a spiritual successor
to Wii Sports it's a game that revolves
around motion control and it gets you up
on your feet and moving around it's
essentially a collection of minigames
that both showcase the switch hardware
and frame how Nintendo hopes people we
use the new console it's comprised of 28
minigames that pede you against one
other opponent and a series of different
physical activities the key to the whole
experience is the joy con controller has
a bunch of pretty sophisticated tech
inside of it a few things like motion
control object detection depth sensing
even the controller also has something
called HD Rumble that lets it basically
mimic different physical sensations so
we can act like a wooden box with a
different number of marbles inside or it
can be a glass being filled with water
in one two switch each player takes one
of the two controllers and they face off
not by looking at a screen but by
looking right into each other's eyes the
whole point is to pay tribute to the
kinds of games I can only be played in
the same shared physical space it's kind
of like playing cards for instance for a
Nintendo which is over 120 years old and
got it start making playing cards this
is a core function of its DNA among the
activities you can do are your kind of
your standard motion control game so
like table tennis sword fighting there's
even like a Wild West duel game but then
there are very weird bizarre other
minigames you can play there's a
dance-off game there's even a game where
you pretend to be a model walking down
the runway scoring style points against
your opponent the weirdness only
escalates from there one two switches a
game where you milk a virtual cow's
udder it also has one where you hold the
controller right near your mouth and
mimic eating as many sandwiches you can
it's an eating contest against another
opponent these games are designed to
appeal to a wide range of Ages from
little kids all the way to grown adults
and Nintendo is not shying away from
describing this as a party game that
means you could probably play and have a
lot more fun if you have maybe one or
two drinks in you as well the one thing
you're going to want to remember with
one two switch is the wrist straps for
the joy con controllers because these
games tend to get quite physical
the Nintendo switch comes out next
Friday on March 3rd for more information
