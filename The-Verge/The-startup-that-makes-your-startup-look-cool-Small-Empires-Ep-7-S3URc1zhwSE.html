screens and broken dreams at least it's
what we're supposed to think
but is it true yes but we're not here to
talk about Los Angeles we're here to
talk about Sandwich video our company is
pretty straightforward they take an
interesting product to make an amazing
promotional video for it and share it
with the world this is nothing new
though Don Draper has been doing it
since the 60s what is new is that
sandwich video is collaborating with the
companies they work with in order to
potentially scale what was once a
totally unscalable business roll the
tape i'm alexis ohanian start-up founder
and Y Combinator partner over the last
year I went on a 200 event book tour and
met people building small empires all
across North America now I'm back with a
new season revisiting some of my
favorite stuff short old video is
increasingly becoming the way that we
consume content online and the power of
a good launch video is massive the
highest-grossing Kickstarter of all time
the coolest cooler failed its first shot
but 10 months later they came back with
a retooled video and raised more than 10
million dollars sandwich video in Los
Angeles is the leader in the make a
video for a startup category and they're
experimenting with totally new ways of
making deals with smaller companies so
that they can make high quality content
without taking a huge amount of cash
from the burgeoning startups who want to
work with them that's pretty cool
my name is Adam Lissa Gore nice to meet
you thank you I founded a company a
video production company called Sandwich
video here in Los Angeles in downtown in
the Arts District
we're a small company of nine people
full-time and we make videos for mostly
for tech companies for startups and
sometimes bigger tech companies
sometimes public companies sometimes
scrappy one person indeed iPhone
developer companies the whole gamut of
interest interesting tech stuff and
figure out how to condense what they're
doing into a 90 second to two minute
piece of video that that can be shared
to tell a story so how did I end up here
I booked it on Airbnb once I knew I was
coming to this city I took just a quick
search on Airbnb to find what I was
looking for sandwich video is the de
facto video if you're going to make a
sort of exciting promo like shareable
video about a thing it's a sandwich
video how did you end up here um it was
it was basically by accident and the way
it happened was I got really exciting in
post-production in the film and TV
industry
I got really sort of bored with that
side of things I got excited about the
tech industry and I started making
connections with people who made things
in the tech industry made tools made
platforms were working on working with
the web a friend and I decided to try
and make an iPhone app we made a small
iPhone app for Twitter it's called burn
house and I made a video for that so
that's bird house a notepad for Twitter
available today on the iTunes App Store
the video got a lot of attention and
then unexpectedly bigger companies
started saw that who had seen that video
and how its er drove a certain amount of
attention to the software product and
where you know came knocking on my door
and asking for something similar so
after I had made a few of them it became
clear that this could be an you know an
enterprise in of itself making a few
successful videos helped Adams clients
build their businesses but it didn't
mean Adam had built a business yet it
wasn't until he had so much inbound that
he realized he couldn't do everything
himself writing directing producing I
mean he was doing everything so realized
needed to find great people and then
still do all that stuff but also be
their boss so for the first year and
change that I was doing videos and
working with freelancers I was a one-man
company working out of a second bedroom
and then my dad of all people suggested
you know he seems pretty stressed out
maybe you should bring somebody on to
help you and then I heard that guy
sitting right there JP you and Adam met
on Twitter right he posted a tweet a
really eloquent tweet about needing this
number two to help him take his business
to the next level and I was familiar
with his work
I saw the square video and I just loved
the tone of it I thought it was
something new I mean it was something I
had never seen before I just liked how
honest it was I liked that he was dry
and he he wasn't really selling anything
he was just talking about it in a really
cool way and I love that you sometimes
get paid for this but sometimes get
equity from startups is that is that a
normal thing in this world certainly not
it's not common at all in production or
in advertising we do things that cost
real money we're not doing
work for free and asking our friends to
work for free paying people a piece of
work is going to have a cost and it's a
real cost in and a lot of times that
cost is out of the reach of a smaller
tech company but what as you know what
they do have to offer in their early
stages can be even more lucrative than
whatever the cash value of the booth of
the work that you producing is and so
that's that's a really interesting way
for me to participate clients that we
work with is this a way to kind of hedge
for the long term in terms of building a
business that has the potential of just
growing faster and bigger than its peers
I mean think the thing that offsets the
equity the long-term effect of the
equity is that we're also doing the rev
share in the short term and those happen
I mean sometimes that's happening the
day after we were a liver and then that
in the rev share you know is a much more
immediate return a kind of balancing
that so that we're not just waiting on
equity to pay off long term now that the
business has evolved so much you all
have no shortage of deal flow planning
everyone wants you to make a video yeah
how do you decide who to work with and
then how do you decide the sort of
equity trade-off for compensation so we
have two models we do the traditional
cash you know bid out a job this is how
much is going to cost we make it but for
a lot of the more interesting jobs and
frankly the the jobs that sandwich has
sort of made its reputation by creating
content for their startups that don't
have a lot of funding and if someone
comes to us with X amount of money we
don't necessarily want to make a video
for that because you know where we have
a certain status of the quality of the
crew we work with and the expenses that
go along with a shoe you know
crew size and whatnot so we want to make
a video for three times with what they
have in cash so at that point is just
the first thing is you know is this a
company is this a product that we're
gonna regret not launching a lot of
times these are companies for products
that we would want to use ourselves so
we're just we were able to tell a much
bigger audience about these things that
we love to and something had to change
so yeah we tried slack I mean there's
some jobs that are just absolutely no
brainers like we want to be the people
to introduce this then what was one of
those companies you know something like
square we're very proud to be able to
say you know we're the people who wrote
that when we launched that product and
then something like navdy we're hoping
that you know in a year from now that'll
be the exact same thing hi mom okay I
love you I'm making a video right now oh
okay I love you
my name is max co-founder push for pizza
and push for pizza is the easiest way to
order pizza ever oh you just push the
button once and pizza comes after you
give us your location in your credit
card and when you all first approached
sandwich how much of a budget did you
have so our budget was super super
minimal
fortunately Cyrus and I had a little bit
of capital to be able to live really and
put up a little bit for the video but it
was you know less than 7 grand so what
how did you approach the negotiation
about actually getting the work done so
I made it fairly clear in the first
email that we didn't have much money and
you know as we continued the
conversation that became more and more
apparent but we could afford to get
ourselves out there and put up what was
considered the bare minimum to at least
you know get kind of the basics down
obviously the video would end up costing
more than that we put down however it
was enough to give Adam a reason to want
to negotiate a deal with us one of the
really exciting things to me was that we
were eliminating the agency we were
working directly with clients and I saw
it sort of as oh this isn't necessarily
commercial we're not making commercials
we're trying to tell companies stories
in a way that we're interested in using
my coffee good it's made me be a better
person it's definitely much more of a
community feeling than service so are
you betting then you know there's the
story of the graffiti artist who tagged
up the walls of Facebook for some stock
who I think is now a multi-millionaire
are you betting then that some of these
companies are going to become that
successful and and and and this is like
how much of this I guess is financial
and then how much of this is like you
know what I really like what you're
working on you clearly don't have the
money right now so here's a way to
compensate us about 50/50 I talked to
the company earlier today that was
founded by an eighteen and nineteen year
old and they're doing something that I
don't think many people are doing in the
category that they're working in and
they already have a viable product and
it's bringing a very very small amount
of revenue
and I know that if I were to step in and
make a video and put my my own money
into it and make a video that would show
their products - you know conceivably a
hundred thousand people that are their
target customers then it's going to have
a profound impact on their revenue
stream that they're bringing in and when
I can do that for the relatively small
amount of money I can go out of pocket
and see a return on that investment I'm
talking like a VC now but when I can do
that and of course it's really
interesting yeah I'm willing to take
that bet it's in very rare rare
circumstances more often it's like these
companies are just big enough that they
can pay for video hmm
just small enough that it hurts a little
bit you know to write the check and that
in that case it makes a lot of business
sense to do a little bit of deal making
and then you know with the risk of you
know where could this lot could be
worthless the oh yeah absolutely
in fact statistically more than likely
to be worth nothing yeah but it you
found that there is this balance you can
still pay the bills still pay your
people but but how do you evaluate the
value of that when you don't have a ton
of budget and an equity is so important
yeah it's really hard you know it's one
of those situations where like you said
you want people to know about your
product or or not and we you know we
were prepared to make the sacrifice to
let people know in order to give up some
equity and some cash however with that
said you know that it's you know Adam is
a very fair guy he's not someone who's
looking to like rip startups off of
equity he's looking to make a deal
that's great for founders and great for
him and I see no reason why you know a
deal cannot be organised regularly with
someone like Adam for a small portion of
equity for what you get in return
because when you perform relationship
with Adam it's more than just the video
he acts as a mentor for us in many ways
someone I go to we go to for advice and
someone we hope to work with in the
future on more projects within push for
pizza or even beyond you know these guys
reached out to us it was sort of a plea
for like hey we don't have money but we
really want one of your videos and we
just really liked them and that's a big
part of it they were just really we
wanted to work with them it was an
equity arrangement where we you know
they just really didn't have much
capital and yet what we created I think
is you know they had a huge success on
their launch and I think the video was a
huge part of that and looking at that
you know it's I don't think that given
the market and what other people are
willing to do I don't think they would
have been able to have any sort of
commercial if sandwich hadn't done it
but nothing similar to what we delivered
both in the production value and the
creative quality it's like over for
pizza we can't say uber two choices for
now to keep it simple plane and
pepperoni just pick your preference then
and push the button push the button push
for pizza how are you a good judge of a
start-up I think that I'm just kind of
like I'm just enough of an early adopter
you know I have just enough of a vision
on the tech landscape I I'm just a
progressive enough but I'm not too
progressive I'm not too much of a
futurist
so I still am grounded in what and what
my parents are going to think about a
thing that's what I've always kind of
felt about why why I can sort of feel
whether other people in
enjoy your enjoy the experience of a
piece of technology it's a little bit of
empathy and I feel like this might be a
misstatement but it feels like empathy
is sort of what's missing from a lot of
the of the tech world anyway so that's
why this city was built on empathy
entertainment is built on happen that's
why we have something interesting to to
lens to the technology what I love about
slack is how it connects the team with
direct lines of communication business
uses it to send 20 pictures I use it to
send funny pictures I know what is
sandwiches I don't know what sandwich
video is is it a production company is
it investment company they're doing
something really different here I've
never seen anything quite like it before
they're making the same kind of
evaluations of early-stage tech startups
that an investor will accept instead of
giving them money they're helping them
tell their story the more you know about
your body the better you can be at
taking care of it so smile
this is Wella I know there are
entrepreneurs out there working on the
next big thing who just don't know how
to communicate it let's the advantage to
having an investor like Sandwich video
they're not just writing a check they've
got a whole team of super talented
people we're gonna help you introduce
yourself to the world on your terms you
know if they come to us and they want a
sandwich video and then we tell them
what our traditional price points are it
can be a letdown but then when we say
the other option is what cash do you
have we can take that equity reps or
whatever proportions of that makes sense
in this specific arrangement and we can
deliver a video that's more in line with
the cashier providing but what we want
to make for you and they get really
excited I think a lot of people aren't
necessarily expecting that that's an
option but most of the time like I've
gotten to the point where when a client
isn't interested in equity in rupture
when startups and you aren't interested
in I'm surprised
whereas before I was you know think that
this is a crazy idea no one's gonna go
for it now I'm just like why wouldn't
you and most of the times when we talk
through it they realize oh this is in
everyone's best interest a number of
your videos you don't have to pay the
lead actor yeah because it's you it's
true how did that how did that come
about because you I mean I like I said
when I came in here I kind of felt like
I already knew you from these different
videos why why did you always want to be
on both sides of the camera none at all
no I put myself on camera beyond for the
video I made for that Twitter app I was
mentioning Bertos because I didn't know
any actors and I didn't have any crew
but you were in LA and you didn't know
any actors yeah and I work in the
filming but I but I put myself on camera
and I just set up the camera in my back
yard and I just ended up being the the
sort of the path of least resistance to
putting a video up and then my next
client was Jack Dorsey and then he had
seen that video he thought I was decent
on camera and so rather than he being on
camera to represent square he asked me
to do it and then that kind of just
worked out for me I think it's fun I
mean I think it's cool that we're able
to have a part of us in those videos or
like it's him as the founder having a
having something that's intrinsically
sandwich in the videos is a pretty cool
surely most of your clients are in San
Francisco yeah why not why why does this
have to be in LA I'm a tell a kid I'm
used to this climate I love it here my
family's here I love that everybody has
an ambition but it's not debilitating I
love that everybody considers themselves
free to be anything not just free to be
one thing it's an industry town but I
feel like you
becoming more and more diverse more than
any of that in the context of working
with the tech industry oh I really love
that I'm an outsider in the tech
industry that I get to just chill out
over here and sort of let things over
happen in that cauldron and it really
does feel like a cauldron yeah you know
I can't imagine being there even when I
visit and do meetings and stuff it just
feels like overwhelmingly tech oriented
oh yeah
so I just kind of like sort of
separating myself from that a little bit
I think we've done 50 shoots this year
which is for this size of companies
doesn't really wait yeah and it doesn't
seem like it's slowing down what's
happening is we're becoming more and
more picky about who we work with I mean
ultimately sandwhich what it's known for
you know as much as we're a team and we
collaborate and everyone has their
strengths Adams voice is inevitably the
strongest I mean he's he created directs
everything whether or not he's directing
in himself you know he approves every
script he approves every casting choice
every location photo so there's there's
always going to be a point at which
that's the bottleneck and I don't think
that's necessarily a bad thing because I
think that is the quality control I
don't think we're ever looking to be
just the ability to take on infinite
amount of work because ultimately unless
there's another Adam there's gonna be a
chunk of work where he's not involved
and that's not that that makes you a
much more generic company and reduces
what's unique about sandwich I think how
do you imagine scaling this thing then
because again right you've got nine
people shooting a video clearly takes a
number of talented people if you want to
do more of these you need more people
like people are always gonna be the
living reagent yeah unless you can find
you know great ways to scale up revenue
like taking on investments right so
that's one way and then the other the
other way is to just by brute force and
add more people and add more
infrastructure we're sort of doing both
in parallel we're keeping up right now
but I can tell you it's very stressful
to keep up the one lesson that I've
always like kept very very close to my
heart that the core tenets
is to do things very slowly and
methodically and never grow faster than
is comfortable I feel like the smart way
to not screw anything up because there's
a lot to lose at this point I don't want
to ruin my reputation and the creative
would suffer and it's a domino effect
and so yeah how do we scale it I feel
like building reputation and strong
relationships we're at this really cool
time where before broadcast videos were
what everybody was seeking to make
everybody wanted to make TV commercials
and I think even when I joined sandwich
video I was hoping oh I can't wait until
we do TV commercials well now I don't
think we really care about that I think
we care about making cool videos that a
lot of people are going to see so I
think it's going to be delivery method
that changes you know broadcast budgets
are coming down Internet videos budgets
are going up and who knows what the next
content delivery method is but I think
sandwich video will be in a good
position to tackle that when it comes
about sandwiches doing something hold
they're making advertisements for other
companies but they're doing it in a new
way online and they're taking revenue
share as well as an equity stake in a
portion of their non cash deals all
right I know that's a mouthful but what
it proves is how important it is for a
new startup to get their message out in
a way that is elegant and effective
great ideas don't always have great big
budgets that's the lesson from sandwich
and it's applicable to founders really
anyone know what you're bringing to the
table and how much it can help the other
party next time you're going to
negotiate with someone keep that in mind
maybe have a sandwich first running a
successful business involves more than
just selling products or keeping your
inventory stopped what makes small
businesses stand out amongst their
larger competition is the ability to
offer impeccable customer service so try
focusing on your social media marketing
post questions to customers online or
offer tips and advice that pertain to
your product you can also create unique
offers for customers such as special
discounts when signing up for your
newsletter and finally make it easy for
customers to find you think
about what words or phrases they might
use when looking for your service or
province just because your business is
small it doesn't mean you can't make a
big impact on your customers for more
business advice visit the ATT Business
Circle wait T didn't have a beard when
you started working together no I just
had like stubble sort of like this beard
has become is a recent development it's
grown on you oh nice oh come on you're
just always striving for that easter egg
I just want it you just want something
someone we can use that okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
