the new Android OH home screen and what
you need to know here is that it is a
new way to look at all of your apps on a
TV it's not just a giant app grid what
Google is actually asking app developers
to do is turn their apps into channels
where the content is sort of immediately
available on the home screen and you can
scroll through it and some of the
channels even have live previews so
while you're scrolling through the home
screen you'll see something you want to
watch it'll show a live preview you can
click in and watch it there are of
course you know all of the apps that you
want hopefully they're listed up at the
top and there's even more apps over
sliding in from the right but really the
idea here is that rather than just grind
through the grid what you actually want
just right here on the home screen in
addition to all these little channels
that each you know app can set up
there's a watch next thing so this is a
queue of the stuff you've just been
watching it's the queue of the things
that you want to watch next and you can
even add stuff to it by long-pressing
on an icon so say I really want to watch
this next you can just add it to your
queue and it'll be available for you
there's other really subtle touches the
background of the screen actually
changes to match the thumbnail of the
thing that you're looking at you can
also set up custom channels within each
channel so for example if CNN has both
like what's the latest news and top
stories channels you can have both of
them on your home screen and it also
supports a live content so if there's a
channel that has live TV streams
happening right now it'll just start
playing that stream right on the home
screen and you can just click in and
watch it so in addition to the new UI on
Android Oh on Android TV it's also going
to get the Google assistant and we have
it here running on an Nvidia shield it
will run all the way down to Android M
and it does all the stuff that you would
expect the Google assistant to do on
other platforms so you can say play me a
Jimmy Kimmel video or you could say oh
hey
play me that Winona Ryder thing on Jamie
can't really specific searches that work
well but it's also context about her so
you can say tell me about stranger
things play that right now and it all
will just play that you can ask for the
weather you can ask about your commute
you can turn your smart home lights on
and off
basically all the Google assistant stuff
it's going to be very similar to what
happens when the Google home can send
information up to the chromecast but it
all works natively right on the TV for
much much more of what's happening here
at Google i/o 2017 you should definitely
subscribe to our channel we are the
verbs</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
