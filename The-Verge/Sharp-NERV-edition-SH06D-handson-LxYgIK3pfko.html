we're taking a look at possibly the
greatest cell phone ever made of all
time this is the special nerve edition
of sharps sh0 6d if you're in Evangelion
fan you're probably pretty psyched to
see it actually live and in person it's
a 3d phone and the computer display
looks exactly like the magic computer
system from the movies if you're
familiar because it's 3d the images
really pop off the screen and even
though it's 3d the viewing angles are
really nice there's a bit of a color
shift when you get beyond say 30 40
degrees but otherwise it's it's
perfectly viewable you can see the UI is
super information dense you've got a lot
of stuff everything from you know how
much active memory you have down here to
your clock your battery calendar or we
have a music player up here playlist is
empty so I can't show you right now
there's some original 3d Evangelion
programming that's been produced
specifically for the phone and if we
take a look at the outside we actually
have this nerve back panel here it looks
like it was you know ripped off one of
the bunkers in the film on the side we
have an antenna and the antenna isn't
just for one sec it's actually for not
TV which is a Nutella bruh television
broadcasting venture that
NTT DoCoMo is involved with it offers
original programming that you don't get
on a regular terrestrial broadcast and
it has deep integration with social
networks things like Twitter and so on
so yeah that's pretty cool I mean the
only drawback really is that it's
running Gingerbread under the hood so
you're not going to get the same nice
holo apps and you're not going to get
the great and snappy performance that
you would get on an ICS phone but
otherwise I mean is there a cooler
looking phone on the market right now I
sincerely got it that is the nerve
special edition sh0 6d from sharp
identity DoCoMo summer launch event in
Tokyo</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
