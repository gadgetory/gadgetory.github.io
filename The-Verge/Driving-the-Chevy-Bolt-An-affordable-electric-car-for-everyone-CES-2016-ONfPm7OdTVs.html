standing in front of the Chevrolet bolt
Evy now this is a very very important
vehicle for GM they first announced it
as a concept last year at the Detroit
Auto Show so it's been about one full
year between concept and prototype this
car is camouflaged obviously when GM
unveils it at CES we're going to see the
whole car but for our test drive here
today it isn't quite final now let's
talk a bit about this car in the specs
they're saying under $30,000 for this
car after tax rebates and it's a
practical evie can do over 200 miles on
range they're also saying about 7
seconds for a 0 to 60 run a little bit
under that which is not terrible it's
not a performance car but it could be
worse so anyway let's take a test drive
this is the very first lap in the bolt
that I'm doing it's definitely a relaxed
steering ratio like it it's I think that
this car is probably designed a little
bit more for comfort than it is for
performance but it's not a slouch I mean
it you know I feel I'm only pushing the
accelerator like ten percent I think
that if I yeah i mean the thing can move
I feel totally comfortable going around
this pretty tight test track and if you
mash the accelerator you can get you
know you can put a smile on your face
this is awesome the fact that it's on
full time is very interesting is
normally with these electronic rearview
mirrors I feel like they're only on in
Reverse so to have it on full time is
kind of novel the bolt is obviously not
a Model S competitor it's not designed
to be if anything it's a little bit more
comparable to BMWs i3 which I've driven
you can watch my video drive of that car
but the difference is that the i3 was
not designed to be a long-range Eevee if
you're super lucky you could probably
get 90 or hundred miles out of it this
is a true Eevee that GM is saying will
get over 200 miles between charges which
makes it practical as far as I'm
concerned the entertainment system for
the bolt is all new and it's unique to
the Volt which is interesting they're
not at least right now putting this
system in any other car thinking back to
like the original Chevy Volt there's a
lot of room for improvement they've
obviously made it here the display is
huge it's a 10.2 inch displays like
physically larger than my entire hand
and you can see how this works here
there are different boxes these are all
widgets and these are configurable you
can have different widgets in different
places and you can configure the
location those widgets by hitting this
edit button you can choose different
layouts standard layout there you go and
you can see the radio is bigger now and
any of these widgets you can click this
make fullscreen icon and pops up
fullscreen so after several laps many
laps with the bolt here at Chevy's tent
outside Las Vegas Convention Center
I'm not carsick quite often when I'm on
a track with a high performance car I
make myself carsick this isn't a
high-performance car and it's not an
exciting car in that sense of the word
but it's exciting for different reasons
right
it's the first affordable high range EB
hit the market or will very likely be
assuming that GM makes its launch target
of the end of 2016 and I think that it
still can be very fun for the driver in
many ways the infotainment system is
legitimately one of the better ones that
I've used the car on the road still
feels fast is just not lightning quick
there is a sense of evenness to it where
when you hit the accelerator the
acceleration is instantaneous I need a
lot more time with it to be able to say
it's any good but my first impression is
positive so we'll see you later this
year hopefully we'll have a full review
up before the car is actually on the
road I'm Chris Sigler with The Verge
keep it locked we're gonna have a lot
more from CES this week obviously and be
