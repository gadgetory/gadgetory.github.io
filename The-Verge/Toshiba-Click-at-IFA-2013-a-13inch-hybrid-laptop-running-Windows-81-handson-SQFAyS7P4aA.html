we're looking at the Toshiba click and
now the particularly unit we're looking
at is known as the W 30 t in Europe and
it includes a Haswell processor so core
i3 and a 13-point free inch display it's
actually running at 1366 by 768 so it's
not a full HD display that's a typical
resolution and it's actually got a 500
gig hard drive in the in the back of
this display here and it's basically
essentially a transformer and it's a
detachable laptop you can literally
remove the entire screen from the
keyboard and actually a kind of a unique
feature but again similar to the
transformer is that it's got a battery
in this particular part of the device
and behind the screen and it's got
battery on the keyboard so you get a
little bit more battery life there now
the American version which is known as
the click will ship with an AMD
processor and it will actually be a
fanless design so the fans you see at
the back here won't be on that
particular model and so this is
literally for this Haswell model so if
we literally detach the display you see
it turns into a full tablet your windows
key to swap around snap apps etc etc and
if I take a look at the actual tablet
you've got down the side you've got the
micro sd on the side here and then
you've got microUSB and micro-hdmi and
the usual sort of volume controls and
then around the other side you've got
the power and the ability to charge
there and so obviously touchable and
free connects it back and it basically
locks in to the keyboard like so what
you'll notice is you can also use touch
but it kind of the whole device like
rocks when you use touch it doesn't seem
to be a real this is the most studious
angle but if you put it slightly it's
like you can see the whole device drops
and it's a little bit on the hinge
it's not very sturdy so it's a common
complaint of like these transforming
devices but you know it's not it's not
too sturdy here it's obviously got a
full-size keyboard and a trackpad that
supports the usual windows 8 gestures so
that was a touch of a click a new
windows a hybrid laptop and tablet</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
