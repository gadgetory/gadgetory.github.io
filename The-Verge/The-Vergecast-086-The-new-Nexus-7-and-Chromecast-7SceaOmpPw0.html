the week of what I'm told is july twenty
second 2013 I'm Josh Topolsky how many
like to tell i'm ross miller it's weird
that we're not together i know and like
we don't have the modern what we just
see Josh's face like a cross right
didn't at all that's what I said to my
people my handlers is that I no longer
want my body to travel outside of the
home yes and there you know I think it's
gonna work I think it's gonna be great
it's a real problem long I've missed
your own real guns diagram back there
I'm saying your room for a bubble boy
I'm a real-life bubble boy with all the
hopes and dreams that a bubble boy can
have that those are included including
but not limited to going outside of the
bubble I'm actually a bubble boy by
choice my goal is to be in the bubble
for as long as Paco de vesci under the
dome if you will I got the job yeah
alright is good i assume that at all I
thought you think about it my life and
yeah Laura and I watched a 30 minutes of
it the other day and it's um it's it's
not it's not great TV in my dad really a
shame i'm at the black network but the
book is good where other people
experience things for me and then i've
read the tweets and then I'm like I'm
good that's good enough yeah basically
know what's happening here anyhow this
is the verge cast where we discussed the
we converge related topics and and what
a week it's been what a week we had to
experience it's been actually a really
busy week of news july very busy once
let's end july with news everyone that's
as i said in july yeah let's just in it
how you're doing that go ahead and let's
get on to the first topic while you're
doing that I'm going to attempt it's
probably bad idea I was going to attempt
to set up a magic trackpad you know just
forget it I'm not why would you do
we're kind of in the middle of a live
broadcast well I'll tell you I if I if I
had to go into the explanation of why I
wanted to do it it would be it would be
you know it's just let's just flip this
right yeah just what sometimes you want
to swipe things you need multiple
factors multiple choice I have my I have
my laptop i'm using my FaceTime HD
camera here on my macbook air mhm and I
actually had to prop it up on some books
because it's a little bit low like in
the angle is really weird yeah and and
then I was like oh it's so hard to use
this track pad to your si Padre I have a
magic trackpad sitting here that I
haven't set up do you have like a USB
mouse isn't that like also see let me
see what I have here I would just
imagine that your home like my home is
full of nice right oh hey hold on i have
like an original apple promesse my fear
is that i try to connect am game via you
know what it is now i know it is wow
it's one of the translucent black in
cement particle i haven't used one of
the best use a mouse in like a thousand
years Eddie are you worried you're not
going to know how to do it I'm worried
that it's gonna it's gonna screw up ya
did ya did oh wait this connection it
did it that's back now I would point out
that your computer literally just
freaked out yeah it's not brand-new ok
that's what bluetooth does I guess when
you turn it on on a rock pile all right
ok how's it going thank you ok you think
we're good you don't control let's talk
about oh I thought we were gonna talk
about Ashton Kutcher oh do you want to
start with that lean is the first thing
I'm ross's list I mean we can go
wherever I was saying we just get this
out of the way mentioned that it had its
news on the site let's do something new
z for once in our lives all right you uh
we put up a big interview with you and
Ashton today hey talk to AK huh hey plus
cap k plus K yeah a plus gay how'd it go
uh yeah so so so he is doing this movie
about Steve Jobs called jobs you
probably heard of it or jail and um
wheat so huge funny thing is that is
that Ashton became an advisor to vox
media which is the parent company of the
verge and uh you know it happened like
it was like a random thing that that Jim
Bank off our CEO was like oh yeah he's
actually going to be like advising us
and I don't really know what advisors
do my impression is that and this is
what I basically all I've heard is that
every once in a while when Jim is in LA
he like has coffee in action like gives
him like it's like hey have you you know
as like talks to him about stuff I don't
know like what they talk yeah eyes
because I certainly don't he's Jim
certainly isn't like you know Ashton
really thinks you guys should cover more
uh dinosaur stuff yeah but really does
like anything we don't hear me like
we're happy to cover dinosaur a little
bit like whatever Ashton Kutcher loves
dinosaurs yeah it'll love that you need
no it's nothing specific so i feel like
they just kind of rap about stuff but um
but uh we you know we've been actually
asking to like do an interview with him
for ages and like have gotten four years
yeah yeah for a really long time in like
adviser status no adviser status has not
helped us at all but he's doing he's now
doing some conversations with people
about this movie jobs and we finally
were able to like get he wasn't enough
that like we have some kind of like he
knows Jim and advises it's like we just
had to like wait for the right moment so
we had a chance to go and we met him in
Chicago was the only time that he could
do and the we could do it was we had to
go to Chicago and sit down have an
interview with him in and we actually
had a really long pretty lengthy
interview me it's on this looks like a
half hour it was a full I think actually
a full hour and the whole rock we had to
cut it down we had to cut it down a bit
because the show would have been much
longer and and and also a lot of it was
just us like randomly legislating about
random stuff um but uh anyhow it was it
was actually really amusing conversation
for me because I had never had a real
deep conversation with him about I
actually met him once before when I was
in LA but it was like a very it wasn't
it was like more like what are you doing
what are you doing kind of conversation
and this was like hey let's talk about
the stuff you think about and why you
care about it so he actually I mean the
thing is he's a pretty interesting guy
and he's got some pretty interesting
views on technology I actually thought
his his stuff about Twitter he talks and
you should definitely if you not watch
the interview I highly recommend if
you're a viewer or reader of the verge
but um his some of your stuff he said
about Twitter and the retweets and how
they change like the kinds of
conversations you can have on Twitter I
thought were really pretty smart pretty
a pretty good intellectual take on some
of the problems the twitter has and in
some of the problems he's had with
Twitter
uh and and I thought it was really
interesting what he had to say about why
he wanted to play Steve Jobs in a movie
and I said to him like I think it's a
huge kind of legatus t'kul move to go
like I'm gonna play yeah yeah like you
know it's like one of the most brilliant
creative incredible people thats ever
lived like I'm gonna play him in a movie
and you know the fact that he just died
is you know it's only been what two
years or not even I don't know but it's
like pretty close to the to this you
know to the the moment so it's kind of a
big he's an interesting explanation for
why he wanted to play jobs which you
know I saw the movie I he gets
something's really right he gets
something's really wrong his voice is it
nice and bring this up you know it's not
it's kill doesn't sound like jobs and
then in the movie treads like really
familiar territory if you've seen
pirates of Silicon Valley and yet very
soon it's really really similar like
almost identical in terms of its arc and
and I don't know if it's enlightening
and I think that for a large audience
it's actually kind of a little bit nerdy
yet the movie goes into stuff you know
in the scenes like where he's talking
about how much RAM like the mac should
have had and right you know for like a
major motion picture i'm not sure that
people are that interested in how much
ram well so you know what i think is
interesting about all these movies um
and you know there's another there's the
one from sony with like aaron sorkin
right that's it that's what that was
incredibly interesting format you will
get to that second right but so like but
there's a lot of moves like people want
to tell stories night Steve Jobs and
like the things he made and what's
really interesting is that that early
part of his life is the well-documented
part and right part afterwards which is
I think the interesting part please ipod
post ipod right where he made the iphone
in the i like all that stuff is right
really sparsely like there's like a
series of keynote videos and like wall
street journal articles and it's like
that's it I think it's working piece
isn't going to cover that either i think
this working piece also ends at the ipod
announcement yeah like has no like how
do you make a movie our steve jobs and
not be like dude made the iphone i still
like I don't understand that at a
conceptual lot I think that um i think
that uh what's really interesting is
that I get look this the the story of
his young life to his his you know
career at apple and in his you know his
defeats and successes can be told
really easily in that era of young men
in college too I'm sort of getting
kicked out and then coming back you know
which is what this movie covers I do
think there is and maybe it's a more
nuanced thing maybe it's a harder to
tell how our harder story to tell but I
think the period from the post ipod
period I mean I would be very interested
to know more about you know if you read
the book the Isaacson book it's sort of
clear that him finding out about his
cancer sort of drove him to do things in
a short period of time that maybe he
wouldn't have achieved or wouldn't have
been able to achieve had he not been
driven by that this sort of fear of of
death you know and dying before he got
it was it was uninteresting to me with
like I think Eddy Cue actually used as
an excuse to hug antitrust cases like do
you know in the wrongs like look Steve
is dying that's not a reason to break
the law well you know so juicing with
the icings but I trout was traveling a
lot in May and I literally ran out of
things to read on my my kindle app i
read on the plane so i like I had it so
I was like flipping through it again and
I realized it like about like when they
get to the iphone in the Isaacson book
like the book it's really boring and bad
like it like it's literally like jobs
and his people dictating like what
happened how it happened and like things
they scrub over are like really insane
where he's like we made the iPad because
I was pissed at some Engineer Microsoft
it's like dude that's not what I
definitely not what happened I but I
think that I think what happens is you
get into this minutia of I mean we may
find it interesting but I think an
average audience would not find an
interesting and the question is but the
question is I think ultimately how
interesting is the other part of his
story and to be perfectly honest like
watching this movie it kind of stood out
to me that his story is not you know
it's the story of a guy who was a big
personality who had some problems in
business but then he like sort of course
corrected and ended up being really
successful it's not a story of a guy who
had everything and it lost everything
you know like he had everything and then
he lost like a position and he still was
like a well-off businessman who started
a brand company was like I'm a minute
our it's like right and we have picture
which they don't touch on it all they
don't touch on it all in this movie I
mean they don't even talk about pixar
and then and then he my back to apple
and had tremendous success it was like
you know it's a little bit like are we
making more i'm not saying Steve Jobs
wasn't an enigmatic incredible character
but you know are we making a little bit
more out of his story than is necessary
and that's one of the things that I
thought while I was watching the new
movie you know I will say this it's
clear that Ashton really cares about his
story the story and it's clear that
people to pay the movie really wanted to
tell a great story i just i think it's
it's difficult material to really get
into dabangg into then i also think that
having seen something apart Silicon
Valley hello Josh you are like d rezzing
like you're literally falling into like
a collection like this step after this
is ones and zeros I'm just letting up
can I see you I mean it's like it's like
the matrix it's like blonde brunette
redhead probably the Prophet the problem
time warner cable yeah in there awful
awful service or it's a Apple it's my
router problem right TARDIS that anyhow
the point is you can hear me right we
can we can mean we don't want to see
it's actually kind of a ghastly look but
uh yeah yeah I mean you literally look
like like the very first computer
generated man it's like van Gogh or
Borgia better I mean you're not in the
camera anymore yes that's Beverly yeah
it's fine it's super weird yeah I can't
even I mean it's like you don't have
eyes like it's like--there's like the
frame of your glasses only a flesh
colored I call in a sea of people know
I'm doing everything I can shut him down
all processes on this computer yeah in
order to regain some semblance honestly
I looks great time warner and also maybe
okay yeah this guy has been bouquet and
you did any better now so bad it's a
little okay really a little bit can we
cranked up can we increase the bandwidth
is there is there a less person right
man yeah just reach down under your seat
then just trim stuff like a lever that
says more bandwidth and you just crank
it oh here it is the man would switch
why was I
why did I use that do you want to turn
my video off is that is it bothering us
fun she's gone sure well you better you
got way better it's that no no we went
back I definitely prefer this all right
but if that's better keep it keep it if
it gets bad again then I'll just turn
the video off alright that's fine though
anyhow so I was going to say that uh I
don't know what I was saying I just
saying that this story's kind of hard to
be able to get into and I think the
people who made it really cared about
the story but at the end of the day uh I
don't know it's it's I don't think it's
that great of a film I mean I just there
are several reasons right and not not
the least of which is that he that
action does just kind of selling Kelso
and it's true like it just his voice
does not sound anything like Steve and
like Steve had a very distinct voice
it's just unfortunate they thought like
the Steve Jobs story itself was enough
to do a sparknotes version that would be
exciting right that's why it's like this
is sorting one that no one's been
talking about anymore because it's just
been so far off in the future like it's
an interesting format just doing like 20
minute or 30 min chunks like in real
time of different moments not going to
fill in the pieces I'm excited to see
the experiment like the job story in the
jobs person I feel different I think the
parties are visiting the story is i
think i think if you look at the social
network which is probably the most
successful film ever made about a you
know a technology startup right which is
what Apple it was you know um uh you
know what what Sorkin does and what in
that script is he cleverly really tells
the story of Facebook through these
these vignettes these like moments of
treachery mm-hmm and and and he doesn't
really focus too much on detail you know
there's a there's a little bit of you
know how did we how do we do this or you
know they have this fake moment where
Zuckerberg like make some revelation
about oh we should show relationship
statuses vicino didn't happen but right
um but the point is that that it's
really shone through these moments of
sort of people being screwed over and
and like they kind of try to show what
it can what a conniving character this
mark zuckerberg is in the film and and
and this movie doesn't have any of
at it doesn't have any of that it
doesn't study those moments of treachery
or moments of uh you know difficulty you
know it goes into like sort of like what
that he was a rageaholic sometimes but
you don't really they never really live
in those moments and i think i think
that's that's the place that makes a
narrative work right so I would you do
this this way yeah so Josh you mean I
plcs what so we've got the the Nokia
Lumia 1020 on the table right here Neal
I trying to figure it out what's a gray
yeah which is just like oh you're in
that you of it in the dark thing oh yeah
yeah and I try to I tried this I tried
like to get it out of dock before we
started I couldn't do it I just couldn't
think oh that's so I was playing with it
yesterday and I was I was a little
shocked to learn that hello let me open
Instagram wait he doesn't really do it
doesn't really do any kind of macro like
their explanation for lack of macro I
guess zoom zoom later but but that
totally changes like if you want to do
like macro with like kind of a boca like
a depth of field you know mm-hmm like
you can't really it doesn't really work
the way that way when you're like far
away from your subject right well you
clear so a fake kind of macro thing you
can do I don't think there is they were
showing it to me at the event anyway so
we did the review we did yeah David did
it which by the way I'm just gonna take
full credit for the first line of his
review okay watch was on saturday night
yankee stadium exploded which I thought
was extremely hilarious yeah oh god I'll
give you that one um and what I think
everybody okay first of all I was very
surprised by the reaction through view
after having reviewed the Lumia 920 why
is that because we gave the Lumia 920
like a middling score and if you know
then the death threats came right we
gave this in okay score actually I
thought if it wants a surprisingly high
score yeah they David I talked about it
a wing um it's a great phone right its
enormous it's a great camera it's Ricky
okay it's a great camera it's it is the
best Windows Phone that is available I
think that is clear and you're going to
buy the into the platform you should buy
this one it's really hard to get it out
of the stuff
see the fact that it has this crazy ass
grip legs kind of cool I don't know
there you go I don't know that it's
worth it any meaningful way here you can
hear have this battery Jones I me it's a
nice piece of hardware so nice crystal
hardware this lens is ridiculous really
great the fact that you can't like put
it on table is like silly but I mean I'm
kind of at one and a bling but it's
missing all the software right it's
missing it's missing an incredible
amount of Kate here I'm holding it it's
missing an incredible amount of
capability because this running Windows
Phone and what's interesting to me is
that the Windows Phone fans and our
comments or all like it that's fair it's
fair to just say like it's that place
and I think the lines are they opening I
mean not all of them some of them are
insane insane oh that's the way it goes
the one you care I'm though the ones you
do care about those ones edk right um
yeah you know the normals uh they're
saying things like I mean date so the
line from David's review that I thought
was like the big takeaways first place
hardware third place software yeah rom
and I think that's totally right I mean
I that's just where the platform is and
you can argue with me about and David I
actually argued about instance which is
the Instagram client because I was like
you have to mention it and he's like no
I don't um because it's like it costs
money it's not an official client like
on every other platform that the
official client is free right so if
you're gonna use Windows Phone you have
to pay extra money to use all these
weird other clients which is fine and
that's like that ecosystem and how it
works and if you believe in it that's
great and some of the weird other
clients are even better than the
official clients but the average person
buying this phone is like now pay 20
other dollars to use all the services
you want on and that's just you got to
deal with it but it's a really cool
camera it is but that's things like you
take amazing pictures and then what I
think that was the point David me i was
making he was taken great picture at the
jay-z concert they used in the scenic a
stadium line and then he didn't know
what to do with them like you couldn't
share them and then by the time you got
home was like he didn't matter to him as
much like he was trying to share a
moment right you just can't and this is
a real thing so i have a few friends who
are like super into instagram now which
is interesting I actually think in the
Instagram I'm beginning to think that
buying Instagram is like the smartest
thing Facebook could have done because
it is the number of my friends who have
gone from using Facebook to using
Instagram it's like increasing by the
day
because it turns out that all the
facebook is really good for is photos
right I mean it's I update my status
like whatever I don't you like it I
never do that like no purpose a birthday
and then here's pictures yeah i know i
have one on i mean i have a large number
of crazy family members who post their
screeds about whatever side of the
political spectrum there on and that's
like Facebook and then I've Instagram
which is like people thinking cool
photos right and that's like really what
I want to look at so like yeah it's
great you know like you can and though
so those people who are raised in
Instagram they keep asking me like I
want to use a better camera than the one
in my phone and I don't know what to
tell them right they literally don't
know what to tell them because it's like
I can tell you to buy camera but then
what I'm really telling you to do is
like by an SD card and put it in your
computer and like screw with it and then
get it under your phones and like there
are all these little solutions to make
that easier but none of them are really
good right and they're like not what you
want and this the 1020 could be the
thing but it like it's missing the piece
it's just missing the piece that will I
can make that puzzle work and it just
has to like whatever nokia microsoft
have to do to kevin systrom they should
do it and I don't believe I don't
believe in I don't believe in I know
some people do this thing where they
take photos with a real camera and they
upload them to Instagram which i think
is cheating and defeats the purpose of
Instagram yeah um you know why not like
here's an idea like take a picture with
film and then process it like in your
lab and give it one of those effects
like while processing it like that would
be then you could have a real Instagram
picture like that's the whole point of
Instagram is that you're not processing
an actual piece of film you're not
taking a photo with a real camera like
you're on your cell phone right and
that's what Instagram gives to the
photos is that it makes it feel like a
real photo um anyhow but but to your
point the UI what you're getting at here
is but there's the solution where
there's kind of a pretty good phone with
a really good camera yeah the only
problem is it doesn't have Instagram
which is you know a problem for people
who use Instagram right but not but not
for any but I think if you want to get
the mass market you have to deliver the
mass market services and that seems like
you didn't have facebook or twitter we'd
be sitting here going what are
doing right well I don't I don't I don't
disagree but you know you're always at a
disadvantage when when you're in third
place or when your truck when you're
trying to make you know it was like
webos i remember it was they did the
same thing like there were all sorts of
weird hacky apps that did there were
quasi real versions of apps that were
just like somehow plugging into their
API or doing some weird hockey stuff to
make them work like i remember i use a
google voice app for for webos it was
just a total hack right now and and
there were other ones I also taught my
head I can't think of them right now but
I know there were a handful of well we
don't really have the real app but we've
got like theirs and that's sort of works
with the with the website and that stuff
is pretty painful for users because they
never quite work the right way right I
think Facebook they had a few facebook
apps and even Android for a long time
before they I mean there was a period
you don't remember where Facebook was
not on Android yeah it was there now I
remember that like in then the actual
real facebook app that they made the
first versions were bad right because
they're super a Chanel 5 i'm even on top
of that layer with the 1020 like I get
it that's like platform evolution you're
in third place you got to get there
you're going to get there Microsoft a
lot of money they have an investment in
facebook which owns Instagram I can't
imagine how they're not getting there
and like honestly to know to Nokia's
credit like today like the announced and
youtube upload nokia made a youtube
upload app that Microsoft and Google
could have but so here's the thing about
like all that sucks but and then on top
of it in a donor not only do these
companies have to make a Windows Phone
app to really get at the camera on the
1020 they've got to use Nokia's SDK for
the camera yeah so the 41-megapixel
actually a 38 depending on and if you do
it for real there for megapixel photos
of the camera takes their stuck in the
pro cam app and then every other app
gets the 5 megapixel like shareable
photos which is like kind of not what
you want like you you don't want to go
through all these steps and so like not
only does Instagram have to make a
Windows Phone app they have to like make
one that understands this camera which
is on one phone which probably isn't the
end of the world because if anyone's
going to buy windows phone they should
like this one it's a really yeah Jordy
of Windows Phone devices
not the 1020 they're not right not right
at the second right so I think like look
we just have to ask the question one
more time and people are gonna freak out
it's like did they bet wrong right I
mean I look I think I don't I understand
Nokia's reasoning behind going with
Windows Phone what I don't understand is
when I look at the lineup of devices
that are available you know for Android
when I think about this this thriving
growing platform that doesn't require
you know by in like at this point you
don't need to if you're a developer I
mean maybe if you're like an iOS only
developers it's like a die-hard like I'm
making money off the iOS App Store I
don't need to mess around anything else
but most developers now are going like
head is a big ass audience here yep
people are buying apps people are using
apps there's a thriving ecosystem like
you know and maybe the scene was
different two years ago I mean that's
the thing it was different two years ago
I think it was still you know iOS was
kicking ass Microsoft had a different
there was a different uh angle they had
certainly has so a locked cell what he's
been saying for the past week is we new
Samsung would come to dominate Android
and we didn't want to play that game
with him which is which is like the game
if that it's such a myopic point of view
though but I guess I guess they're
they're thinking was we need to just
have a completely separate option right
which is probably wanted me a samsung of
Windows Phone but here's the thing it's
like right great you know what you know
who can definitely be the samsung
windows phone at a moment's notice
samsung like no that's true look it
doesn't matter like it detention yeah
here's the problem if Windows Phone does
continue to get a foothold and it gets
to a point of market share that Samsung
thinks is really attractive they're
gonna start pushing the hell out of
windows phone devices I think and you
know they're gonna be in the same boat
right and they're gonna have that
they're still going to be samsung
they're still going to have the brand
it's not like people are gonna like Oh
galaxy that's only an android phone but
I they're just gonna make it I mean to
me like it's such a such a myopic point
of view like it was so stupid because
like to me it's like I would really be a
level playing field you're assuming that
Windows Phone and or equal they're so
not like if you can make better hardware
is hardware I ask a question like
do you think a hard world bring people
here
he's like it's the whole package yeah
but it is the whole package is really
like this is have instagram for most
people like that's the sad yeah that
right that's it look listen I get the
instance exists oh my god it's yelling
at me what's happening dude this phone
just started telling me that ATT is
terminating because of an activity
that's what it said yes 18t network is
terminating because of an activity
activity did you just do I didn't do
anything I picked it up that should we
be worried is this is like some
combination of Nokia tting the
innovation they think you like we're
shutting down our network because the
city's being blown up or something you
know I have this I this joke with Seth
bloom who's 18 th PR person that every
time I write something critical at
eighteen t he makes my service bad
because it happens every time there's
like a little switch somewhere that this
point is like Anna I'm pressing the
button right now and then like my friend
dies right and I guess yes that's was
just a towel hotel actually speaking
which you want to do something else do
this this is today's Wall Street Journal
the thing I didn't realize it uses the
biggest humblebrag right now it's out of
home I didn't really see what would go
so insane look they're crazy wait you
did really change hold on thicket
especially do they even clear these
quotes what they did they did okay then
I didn't know that it would be like this
I didn't know there would be a page
right gang so they're like we want to
use your quotes and ads which the
company's ask us all the time this is
they manage to make sure not section of
wall street journal this is the back
it's just join pink t mobile ad with two
quotes from our 18t next right so look
I'm glad somebody's paying attention to
us I'm going congratulation you lie hey
stop that right no idea how about this
like it's cool alright I guess that's
cool that like like it's cool like it's
cool for the verge that were the you
know people are using our quotes but
it's like you you're still a phone
carrier man if you were the biggest most
important run carrier would you leave
you're making a slightly more attractive
case for themselves at this point yeah
cuz you're using her no no I mean like I
honestly was like looking at their plans
and we did that piece the other day
breaking down all these new plans and
there is some advantage to what they're
doing I mean it means you're saying I'm
gonna be bringing my own phone anyhow
because right I'm gonna find like a
stock device mm-hmm so to me I mean
verizon's out yeah
right all together like forget it you
want to stock Android well actually we
should to start talking about Google in
a second cuz right Google's do concern
about google but can we can we um just
cap off this nokia absalon conversation
for a second I just think like I
understand their their reasoning two
years ago mm-hmm um my question now is
do you think is there any indication
that that they would consider doing
Android devices I mean in addition to
yeah that's something I don't understand
why they're so all in I think that's
like the real question that I have why
are you why not make even Samsung's not
all in even a TC like right HTC's not
all in samsung is making like they're
making Tizen phone is a better guy
rotten I think no I think bada got
rolled into Tizen what is just a afraid
that i said i bought my bada app
developers it's the bulging honest of
devices and by the way our headline can
I just but who wrote this sam byford
Rufus no in February 21feb route when T
fifth all right he literally wrote this
headline samsung finally folding bada
the wait is over everybody samba who
wrote that sam byford i don't know what
you're doing man I mean finally well
you've been waiting for this day time
it's finally come and he's celebrated
yeah who oh my god nope sometimes we'll
be able to run apps design for bada
devices but it won't be possible but
already bought it I didn't I several
years for that by the way by the way
somebody just um just tweeted at me that
they got an email from Stephen Elop
about a personal this guy begged for a
new android phone and Elop wrote back
thanks for the comments we were focused
on windows fed regards yes I so I got
the same tweet it's funny that he sent
it from from gmail and Android cuz i bet
i just i just want to point this out
Lyceus question I don't know you me i
think is your name uh did that email the
new opera back to you did that break
your gmail threading cuz i bet it did
haha cuz no right oh right cuz windows
phone is just as a weird formal thing is
it's like a weirdest you cast is
aggressive it's like it's like regular
email regular email regular emails like
what's happening
reply right back to regular you know I
mean if it didn't break the thread and
easy that's literally it's like the
weirdest most like insane
passive-aggressive platform lock and
move where it's like Oh guys if you all
use Windows Phone your threads would
work they're like yeah like it's like
each each it's like each character is
saying sent by Windows Phone haha yeah
anyhow so okay you want about Google now
let's say that's how my google so the
reason the way I was gonna get into it
here's a nexus 7 okay right yeah this is
my segue because it by the way I have to
say I am fairly psyched about so i've
been using an ipad mini i love the ipad
mini i think it's great um but what I
realized like I pretty much only all
that I do on my iPad Mini is read books
and magazines and feeds like yeah that's
it it's a reading device for me and I
like it a lot as a reading device i love
it as a reading device like I read my
feeds every night like when I'm so by
the way it may have talked about this
before but when i go home from a day of
working on the news what I'd like to do
is settle in with some news to read yeah
on my sofa so I haven't like these
personal feeds that I go through like
it's a lot of art and architecture stuff
and um and I and I and I like Rihanna on
the ipad mini but but uh the other day I
was like you know I'm gonna get my nexus
7 out and mess around with it Yeah right
I was like why not just have gmail and
all the other crap like if I need to
send an email or yes I want to like use
chrome like it's right there and I don't
have to do my number of Android tablets
that are like that thing right that's it
that that irritate my wife like it's
like a stack of stuff that bothered ya
say so all I really use you use the mini
but I just don't have used my full-size
iPad every time so I got out of I got
out my fault sighs I've had the other
day and it was like I couldn't believe
how huge and unwieldy it was and then I
got the nexus 10 I was like are you
kidding me like I can't type on this at
all like this makes no sense for me but
so so I held that the nexus 7 the new
Nexus 7 yesterday and it is a perfect
size it is an awesome what perfect what
you think these top and bottom bezels
are the perfect size no because I'm
kidding holding it I'm usually holding
it like Lance portrait now in portrait
it's ridiculous I mean orders this looks
more like a giant phone that ever be
that much all the here's what I like
best about you can hold it with one hand
it's super thin you can hold with one
hand and i gotta say the screen looks
really dope it's like no stream is
amazed so it's so compact compared to
like even compared to the mini like i
know it has bigger bezels on the top and
bottom left and right it looks for those
vessels look ridiculous I fear writing
if you're reading I'm telling you like
if you're reading a book or magazine on
a bag in your hand is a lot more
convenient than something like that ipad
mini and the screen looks incredible my
only real complaint all yet my only real
complaint about this device is the
bezels I think everything else about it
is really cool I just think it looks
insanely tall and it's actually really
surprising to me that you're so into it
given how much you hate 69 tablets well
I do I guess is like the most except
except it's so compact that it doesn't
feel I actually when I first saw the
pictures out I was like you know this is
like really tall for no reason but when
I held uh when I held it in the office
yesterday I was like oh this feels great
like all I saw was that I could like
hold it with one hand comfortably and it
had a really really nice high resolution
screen it does have a great day 60 i
like the 16 x 10 reb like aspect ratio
to that feels good to me like can I tell
you that I've what I'd like to make a
confession confessed oh I think
on-screen buttons are stupid I really
think on-screen buttons are still really
do every time I see the keyboard on this
thing and that the spacebar is right
above the home button I'm like why are
you wasting part of the screen for three
buttons that I definitely only want to
press on purpose not to mention you'll
want on that on-screen buttons make it a
lot of sense really we're a tablet and
and I and I'm gonna say like when you're
like hitting at home when you're in
landscape and you're hitting the home
button on the side of the iPad it's
definitely like a little bit weird but I
know yeah I mean I guess I just I just
throws off the symmetry of the thing but
like look at how much screen is being
wasted by these buttons in landscape
where that's the screen like I would
rather be like that's a little stupid at
the button on the side to me like oh
please uncle screen that going it's also
designed like Android could just keep it
on the smaller side like those buttons
don't have to move that's also salts and
happen here that will they do move
though yeah they do but they do and they
sometimes I go away I get it but like
any
actually it is too let's talk about the
one let's talk about their announcements
yesterday right and Ike the real self
remote if you want more about nexus 7
we're definitely the reviews coming soon
and obviously top shelf big episode on
all the Google stuff on Monday alright
keep Josh let's do the news I so so so
you know relatively low key event for
Google with a significant number of
announcements so Nexus 7 new Nexus 7 uh
they have a 16 and 32 gig version excuse
me do those both have LTE options yes
actually that was what I was gonna say
about verizon of like ridiculous right
like they have LTE built in its 229 and
what 329 yeah 32 gig LT for 329 which is
like an Alton I'm sorry 349 the LTE is
single skew for tmobile AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon
but so yeah so that's that's what I was
trying to get out with verizon so it's
only 700 megahertz LTE on verizon so it
won't what 3g verizon's building at LTE
on okay but it's only using its LTE only
doesn't go to 3g right which is kind of
nuts like the thing that Google is doing
they did it with this they did with the
Chromebook pixel they're building radios
that connect the part of verizon's
network that you can connect to write
that all that auction stuff like they're
they're still working with verizon it's
great they're like adding the device a
certified she have to do but they are
not even like considering the fact that
verizon has an entire other network
that's totally locked down there only
building devices for the open network
which i think is correct well it's a
good move for google it's a good look
well no it's a native I then will fight
you know wait does it is it fully
functional with with 4G and LTE on on 88
yeah yes okay so but still it's very
cool that they're even able to their
packaging this like single skew like
here you go yeah your carrier right and
do your thing well you can do that
because ATT also has 700 megahertz all
to you like they can do it like they're
doing the thing that you want that I
want every company to do which is build
one device ticking out to all the all
the network so there's an tablet it and
they're doing it in in what is a
somewhat aggressive way because you you
won't be able to use this for verizon
does named LTE which is ever shrinking
number of markets but it's still kind of
like
it's cool it's like they fought the
fight to get the 700 hurts open access
rules another colic using them and I
more fun alowed like it's the thing you
buy device and you pick the carrier
later right which isn't matter as much
for tablets will matter just do it with
a new nexus for you do that for me or
well there is leaking for next week
motor huh the motor but the Moto X was
not gonna be their flagship device well
not Google's know yeah do it with really
or is it no they'll make a new nexus for
sure is that they've got they've got the
nexus they've got like now they've got
like these these these google play
editions right and they've got the nexus
4 yeah by the way they new edition why
not just do the Moto X's like another
version of a Google Play I mean so
here's the other thing that like I mean
there's a rumor today about like
Samsung's making the next Nexus tablet I
think Google's still very interested in
nexus program despite like you wanting
like this ds4 hardware so what uh what
sundar said it d was the Nexus program
is where we make advancements in
hardware right but they don't but it's
not a lot I mean that's a lie like let's
be clear that is well done yesterday
when when when Hugo Barra was on stage
talking about this tablet which was made
by Seuss he was like we did this and we
did this he was not like Anna Seuss made
these decisions like but no I don't
think it's just makes this on their own
but if you look at but if you don't at
I've seen the other stuff they make if
you look at the nexus 4 it is an LG
phone with completely SPECT exactly like
an LG phone that was on the market yep
lacking LTE which was so it lost a
feature in the translation all that they
did was put stock android on it the
galaxy s4 and the HTC One are much
better phone yeah nigra then then their
flagship and when they released the
Galaxy Nexus like two or three months
later samsung did the galaxy s3 yeah hmm
and it was like a better version of that
phone right so I don't believe that
they're doing this we're doing I think I
think they're still going to do that I
think if you're there I think there's a
lot of things at play right if you're a
sous it's like this is the only like
Google's dragging you kicking and
screaming into relevancy
with Android so like you're happy about
that right if your samsung and motorola
and I'm sorry samsung or HTC or whatever
other LG you're worried that Motorola
will become the place where Google puts
its like hardware efforts and this is a
way for Google to like reassure those
companies that they're still going to do
partner devices and partners are so
important and motorola's firewalled off
and blah blah blah blah so like I think
there's a lot of like political reasons
for them to still do Nexus I don't know
if there's a lot of like consumer
reasons because what are they going to
do like do the new droids that came out
like they have cool features at Android
4.3 announced yesterday does not have
right and we should talk with us because
like a lot of people think this is a
precursor to the Moto X announcement
next let's finish google because the
Nexus 7 is like kind of not the most
interesting and no absolutely this is
kind of reason why we're late too
because we wanted to like see how I was
playing with a chromecast ok I'll just
admit it Josh relayed to the show
because I was screwing off the
chromecast just--all you know that's a
that's a classic Neil I move plus I just
like this you're trying to see if you
connect an IR blaster to it oh yeah
definitely which makes sense I just want
to take video from one place and stream
it to know that's also a cuz they're
naxos announces your nexus 7 android 4.3
which is in crotona incrementally baby
the software and letter and and and more
most importantly oh god excuse me um the
chromecast you get over the chromecast
you want to share your share your your
your take on the showcase as a device
will have a review them to interview my
working on I literally just open it
today so these are first but spoiler
it's kind of awesome it's kind of
awesome so like I very much part of its
stupid that is incredibly stupid and
i'll just start with this tort that ski
do it I took it out of the box uploaded
in my TV and nothing happened I was like
man nothing is happening then I realized
the reason nothing was happening is
because I had not yet plugged it into
power which for a dongle that plugs in
the back of TV is ridiculous on a second
counter it's redonk redonkulous oh my
god josh is fire kinda argument if it
was any bigger you would like hide it
that well jealous fine and like the
thing that I did which is the thing that
most people will do is there's a USB
port in the back of the TV in my office
and never used for anything and I just
ran the USB cable from the back of the
thing to the USB port which is insane
but so way better than like an apple TV
any box they've to put like outside in
front
not is better than those things but it
is still crazy like it's like why did
you make this so small if it can't do
you know but yes I get it anyway so you
do that then you go to the google
website you download an app on your
computer to set it up it like finds the
Wi-Fi network right that the thing sends
out it sets it up puts in your Wi-Fi
network and then it's just there and
then when you switch to that whatever
input it's on it just says like ready to
cast and then you're in chrome and you
just like push the button you install an
extension in chrome and push the button
and sends a tab to this great is it is
the chrome extension available now yeah
yeah is it not for beta it's like an
it's like you can just get any version
of Chrome yeah it says beta I think that
the extension says beta but it's the
version over their own but the but the
extension is oh here it is look at that
yeah yeah it's great it's just an
extension waiting it is this really it
this looks this is a third party thing
oh there it is google cast is what it's
called yes yeah google cast um and it's
great like it just works like that is
like a i know that's a very cliche
phrase but like we were testing in the
office and like i went from open the box
to looking at a thing from my computer
in like what maybe five or ten minutes
yeah I didn't realize like I i miss a
little bit enough I didn't realize how
well the mirroring was working like so
when I use airplay mirroring for Apple
TV all persons more I Wi-Fi network in
this office can be shaky but it's
usually pretty good yeah Billy and like
I think that's a big part of it maybe
we'll try it I'll try our network
appears fast when it works but like
airplay even like here airplay mere like
it's lags like every now and then yeah
this thing lag at the beginning like to
second like delay but otherwise it was
pretty we gotta try it out more I will
say this is ok so that's right that's
gonna say its cost thirty-five dollars
and like it at least in this 10 minute
experience I had with it yes it just
worked like it just did what it said was
great now we have to try out the iOS
apps we have to try out the Android
there's a lot of stuff left to do right
but like it did what it said it's gonna
do which is like it there's a button in
chrome and it sends a tab to your TV
that's awesome yeah but so there's a lot
of stuff at can't do right yeah what are
you saying Josh well no I wasn't say
like I I am psyched that they have this
extension already I just want to explain
just can you just before you going since
I have not used this just before we go
into whatever you're going to say
next I'm gonna give you a scenario can
you tell me what happened all right I go
to a website let's say vimeo yeah and
i'm watching a video in my browser in
the vimeo window like it's not full
screen yeah and I hit the chromecast
button the google cast button what
happens it will send that entire tab to
your tea or screens so I what I don't
know because I thought it would whole
tab flash playing in the tab the whole
thing right it uses web it's basically
like a starting a video conference right
okay so it's doing that it's saying a
whole tab what I don't know is if the
audion the video will stay in sync
dieter had some problems with yesterday
okay so that was like does it doesn't
send the audio it does tell you but I
don't know if they're going to be
perfectly in sync does it does it can
you fold so I'm assuming you animals so
when I try to pull strings on your know
when I when I tried it with youtube
today did not full screen it full screen
Don my cuz away flash works cuz flash is
janky so the answer here is flash is
janky and like wait a second so so if I
if I am watching why have flash turned
off off on my so if you're using vimeo
html5 I don't know what happens right
gotta figure that yeah I want to really
want to know and you're saying I can't
full screen the video on my television
right so if you take a tab with flash
video playing like YouTube which I did
yeah and you send it to the chromecast
they on full screen the the YouTube the
flash takes over from chrome and puts up
the full screen and because chrome isn't
sending that all you see is like a black
box on the screen because flash stepped
in front of chrome because chrome error
because flash is janky right wait wait
wait this is a my cousin airplane here
black box what on my television all I
would see is a black box yeah are you
sure hundred so what is the point of
what is the point of it then well that's
um what they depict in the commercial
but to a point is great so the point is
what you're supposed to do is you're
supposed to go to youtube com and
youtube com the people you tube in their
player will have a chromecast button
which they do so you just hit chromecast
in the player and that automatically
sends it to the dongle but what if I
want to watch some of it is it on
YouTube then you are going to get a
weird black box I'll
it's Netflix well then what's the point
of what you say it's simple San wait
what's the point of being able to send
that at all but it's the same with
airplay like it's not it's the same it's
literally the same thing that happened
to know if I if I full screen if I if I
mirror an air player I send a video to
airplay it if I mean if I'm in the video
player and I say send to air send to my
TV it full screens the video right in
chrome does that too if you're in the
video player and you send to the TV
chromecast does that too it's when you
are sending the tab and the tab is
playing flash video that flash doesn't
know i'll say i keep seeing indy control
john is like trying to explain this to
us John go well so Vivian might very
much right partner so John can know I
can't hear you or not we need to get to
the bottom of this I'm sure this is
thrilling for people watching the verge
cast right now but I know my answer it's
literally it's it's the same issue that
I have you know the answer but but I
like I run air parrot on my mac right
which lets you send what lets you send
windows to air play right okay it works
until you try to full screen a flash
video because then then flash steps in
front of the browser and full screens
like locally on your computer so the
thing that your full screening is no
longer being say control room can we
just go send someone to test this out
like literally just go around the corner
I'll test it to know and they're like oh
we'll have the answer soon we're just
gonna like cinder so if they were
showing vimeo with a thing yes true
thats because vimeo you're doing it on
the TV behind us ok what's happening can
we roll out the TV make it very dramatic
this is very strange josh i wish you
were here with us yeah i wish i was with
you only you it come in wait what the
TV's new harness for doing nothing just
what's happening I don't know control
room singing in our yard let's just okay
let's just all right so let's go we're
on so here's the other thing that I
think is very strange okay yes um
because I've been tracking as you may
know google TV very closely yes as its
dies it's slow inevitable death well
because it's a bad product espite what
they said today despite what they said
say so the guy who was in true in a
chromecast on say gestures Rishi Chandra
who was the head of Google TV right so
like the fact that he's introducing a
new product that has nothing to do with
Google TV like no man is google TV dead
and everyone's like no it's not we're
gonna keep making them
sundar Pichai yet today was like head of
chrome and Android he's like reporting
more effort behind it than ever right
and it's a why I mean I think that's I
think it's a lot I don't believe that
yeah it's like I just don't know what
their so they're gonna update google TV
to add chromecast but here's thing like
once they do that they're prana doing
anything else with it like oh it
supports cast we're done with this I
don't know I've been like moving this is
probably a live PA they drop the mic
this is what I will say this we've
watched Google and other companies try
to compete with airplay for years I
think airplay is like if you had to ask
me why i have an iphone like still have
an iphone there are two reasons it's
airplay and I message straight up those
are the reasons like yeah the game there
are some games and apps that couldn't
get otherwise what I would live right
but those two things have been locked in
so the idea that Google can finally
compete and like they tried they've
tried to compete remember Josh member
when they showed us a nexus 4 and I look
at miracast it's the best oh it's like
that went nowhere for them just by
nowhere so it I actually I mean I
actually think this idea sort of
brilliant in a way mm-hmm making of
people to partner with them but though
you got like Apple has the same problem
with airplay the only the only real
meaningful difference right now is that
Apple's had years and years or getting
people army built into the mine not like
any apology they're like no look at
he'll go look we ran stories about HBO
Go adding airplay support just recently
but but now but ok yeah kasturi took a
year ago to get I mean the same thing
like all the all the content companies
left a partner to make this work right I
guess you're right I didn't think it's
by the way I I don't interact with my
when I want to watch something I use an
apple TV I asked to turn on the apple TV
go to cydia partner begins on rockin buy
stuff and read and stuff I know YouTube
some versed in renting for this haha I'm
less you're getting you're getting all
bandwidth you even you've gone down
again yeah now hold on a second wait a
second let me try something there are
some crazy stuff happening on the TV's
back a bit ok right now I dislike
complete behind-the-scenes what about
now how does it work there everything
that is just
uh anyway improved I don't know go back
to josh's video to devins you know I
think the problem is I don't let her see
me if I quit IRC if that has any entire
see is a noted bandwidth hog is it
absolutely not dude I've got IRC to work
over like like Go Go connections on
airplanes or I haven't even like paid
for it yet because again whatever it's a
couple of characters of text how about
now I don't know can you see me now I
see myself hold on no let's switch over
you can't see me John isn't letting us
other guy look like okay fine it's my
kid is my video okay yes well you don't
there's nothing here to see okay right
and so here's the thing so here's the
things chromecast can't do and I think
there's actually really important right
the number one thing you can't do that i
use airplay for all the time can't
stream audio so like all the time I'm
like I want to listen to stuff on
Spotify those gonna work with and I turn
on Mike home theater right right and I
just like do it I saw her this problem
with sonos yeah but I'm not gonna buy it
so knows like what its own are so
expensive and apple trees Mainieri oh
that's a very expensive solution but a
very good solution yeah but like that's
I'm saying like I can you can go you can
buy a pike a really great pioneer
airplay speaker system for like 1 99
yeah and I can hit a lot of things
that's like a lil J styria just say send
the audio just from Spotify to airplay
he can do it all the time does it have a
separate not imagine you think about the
Mac you but with the mag if the buyer
for the Mac that's what I'm saying no
but like you just buy airfoil cost
twenty dollars which is still in forget
I do down you know that's cheaper than
that wrote cheaper than sonos haha not
better it doesn't work better hey worse
but i don't use some batman i understand
i was convert I've seen the light you
were a real mad at stone us about two
weeks ago I don't have I was freaking
out because I couldn't get this set up
working but once I got it working all I
do is buy an hdmi switcher once I once
heard about this other expensive thing
it worked grows it was it wasn't that
expensive I bought an expensive one you
can get them for like 50 bucks from
monoprice yeah um but I will say this I
it's a very expensive relatively complex
problem but I was trying to I was trying
to find a whole house who lists a
completely seamless solution when I have
like a three story house
so like it's it's hard to deal with like
and I'd found I found that like the
airport like the extenders with like the
you know the the headphone jack you can
we plug in to say that stuff so that
stuff all gets it all gets very sloppy
very quickly right and and so it's a
different problem but I hear what you're
saying I used to do the same thing I
would play I would air play music I
guess I had my apple TV hooked into my
receiver so i could just turn on the
receiver and airplay music to it right
at this second you can't do that with
chromecast and i think that's what you
can't do it you can't you if you plug it
into your ways again if you have an hdmi
if you have an open USB and HDMI jack on
your AV receiver couldn't you plug it in
there and run it just as like a channel
streaming music no I don't think so I
mean why not I don't know if it would
like do that we have to try it I'm not
gonna work I mean that's like I'm not
using google play you just ring cugel
play music right yeah right right so
before we get bars like there's like if
you want a more experienced like on the
airplay vers of chromecast we've got a
great chart like this yeah we actually
do have a true this breakdown airplay
for all credits I'll coach Bill
authorial in our box design the apple TV
beat beat the pants off of chromecast in
its current state yeah but like it's
also 35 bucks it's also but it also just
got released one day ago right yeah no
there's yeah like there wasn't all the
support for airplane Eli is correct and
in that that there wasn't all the
support for airplay day one the question
is google has a really shitty track
record getting some work for products
like this so can they get people to
support this this product right right
you know but I think what I think what
their cell is easy it's because if you
think about everything else which was
DLNA which is a huge failure and like do
the I nerds I don't care if you think
the owned a successful you use it with
your ps3 at home that I'm telling you
that people people who have worked at
the DLNA organization are like this is a
huge failure let me pitch you on my new
startup which makes deal and I easy like
that is like a routine pitch that I get
can we verge cast ourselves huh oh wait
duh we have a chromecast cover the Nexus
7 there's a nexus 7 behind me what am i
doing you were going to chromecast
chromecast and I don't know so I'm just
opening chrome what am i doing oh how do
I do this it's nothing's happening
no I think you have to then you want to
do it from a computer is that our
discussion oh yeah let's see if he can
uh is it gonna find you have the plugin
no they're ok here I got it here so
here's YouTube was gonna do on my on my
computer I'm gonna cast this tab which
is the best well there it is here we go
right ok Josh you can't see this I mean
no idea what's going on but I'm we on
this camera barking so he can see us so
that's gonna run an ad do you see this
playing now the video is playing back
here I'm gonna hit full screen on the
YouTube player and it's not gonna work
oh it worked do it it worked
upstairs no it didn't work upstroke
upstairs didn't worries you're working
your good oral inside go to Allah which
is not a google player yeah that didn't
work upstairs all right wait what's work
what's happened it worked dry full
screen and it worked let's see if this
works in y'all see oh god this is gonna
be so weird here alright this live
stream let's watch us this is complete
inception top right full screen pull it
worked I don't know I don't know what's
going on Josh you wanna look I guess
this is so weird see it works just fine
I look so intense a full screen and then
go to a different to have to see what
happens I don't I can't it's full screen
on my computer can you to switch absent
like if can you just leave chrome alone
like it'll stay here and there's do
something else yes no no none of that's
working okay this is so weird I just I
just want you guys to know what I'm
seeing right now at this second is I'm
looking at my laptop screen which is
showing me looking at my laptop screen
and on the screen behind me but there
isn't me looking at my laptop screen
this is so you can pay the control room
cracking up right now and then there's
Ross what's up Ross has a different head
in every single one of these screens I
don't know what the allottee but it
sounds really entertaining oh you know
what I do my way I came to tell you how
its craziness want to really kill my
bandwidth right now just do whatever
you're doing keep doing because i want
to see I'm gonna watch what I'm doing is
I'm experiencing a reality that I need
to lose weight but one and a half
minutes ago
 there's little it's there's there's
me 30 seconds I'll be way back and then
there's yeah no I can see that it's a
problem because it's all right controls
are they told me to face my earpiece but
I can see it because I'm seeing for of
myself chromecast man who's going just
good or bad I can't really tell from
your take on it josh is looking at it
are you looking at it no I'm now loading
up our live stream so i can see it all
right well whatever oh my god it's over
that being chromecast rate being
chromecast right now oh wait I got to
turn this down how insane is that yeah
it's great where am I I don't see myself
in this well please push it yeah only
chromecast again for you bro well here's
thing is me like chromecast fast like if
these switch it'll kind of delay a
little bit I think we might be able see
I think flashes crash to make enormous
delay right now and it's exciting and
weird and upsetting and exciting all
right look at this and that night we're
back nice that can we switch the Josh
yeah well Josh he himself ya see how
long this delay is we can see the
extraordinarily long delay it really is
it several minutes mm-hmm okay I get to
see all of your previous facial
reactions to everything that was
happening this is pretty incredible
anyhow this has got to be one of the
worst verge cast of all time I think not
in the in the you know the Canon of
horrible verge yes this one whoa all
right oh god is that is that what my
shot looks like yeah crowd oh yeah
waited in yeah yeah yeah god this is so
weird hair right here oh there it is
look I'm glad that Craig a dustman
forgot ago at closing it's had it's over
I'm glad the chromecast let Josh check
his hair all right yeah well that was
really weird and I'm sorry that I got it
wrong earlier although I swear that
didn't happen upstairs hey whatever yeah
I'm what it looks like it looks like you
don't really know much about technology
I don't know anything about Cory on is
that your knowledge of technology is an
amateur at best hmm yeah I mean I just I
just can't believe that that happened
you know it's funny I was so excited
because I just disabled um flash
completely from chrome
yeah and then I just realized that live
stream doesn't it only live streams
using flash flooding it was like sorry
you have to get gave me like a you get
it you're gonna have to get flash yeah
like warning and that sucked alright
let's talk about let's talk about
motorola real quick are we done with
google i think so the chromecast just
the reviews coming i got a good play if
it's my next 7 reviews coming in tops i
haven't let me just tweet an amazing
shot of verge section by the way I don't
Sicily Italy understand we want to be
there now you were you took the live
stream of our verge cast yes you and
then you hit the chromecast button and
it sent that in full screen to the
chromecast yes unit yes dongle yes hmm
right and then I wait Matt a mat Honan
wrote something good about some he spent
a night with with chromecast and I just
read a little bit of it while we're
trying to figure out it's doing what you
can and can't do with it and it's a
pretty good like it's not a long post
it's a short little post on wired that
was helpful yeah but uh but hopefully
not hopefully we will cover all this in
our review which is going to be going up
yeah I'm not to say look soon you're
right Josh google has a terrible track
record of supporting the stuff i think
miracast guys like getting support for
and miracast is the example right last
year when the nexus 4 came out there
like look at miracast the certifications
going through this is gonna be the
right all the tvs are gonna have it and
like it isn't nowhere it just like died
on the vine right it's not there that
wasn't their standard though yeah right
but they're like this is the one like
this is our airplay and i showed us and
like mirrors showing that they they
never really committed to miracast in
like um and also there is no flagship
miracast advice really and like this is
also like also worst case scenario the
Chrome browser mirrors and you can see
videos there right but this is this
website that's gonna be none of the
standards that I've ever tried to take
on airplay have ever succeeded it's
always been airplay and then like
mishmash of crap right and why'd I write
Intel pushed wide iphone like it's not
going to happen for you uh inside and
Google's like learn the lesson they
built a weird proprietary thing that
like leverages some standards for this
is like a weird proprietary thing called
google cast and they built a device it's
$35 it uses it and i think
like really strong but it is a it is a
weird like what's particularly strange
about it to me is that it doesn't it
runs on Chrome it's a chrome standard
it's not like an Android standard it's
like they're literally leveraging chrome
is what it is and not anything else and
I think that's like that is one of the
more interesting like Google like only
Google can pull that off in this way
because chrome runs everywhere and you
know Apple will never do that like
Microsoft won't do it that way I think
that's like I don't owe the review is
coming I'm very excited about it I'm
excited about what I just saw and I'm
excited about where my mind frankly went
alright that's all these droids droids I
just say something yeah while you were
saying that man I don't know what's
going on here forget it I'm not gonna
get into what I'm looking at that's not
worth after we're done i'm going to i'm
gonna tell you something you're gonna be
shocked yeah all right um okay so droids
droids I went to the droid event uh so
sick I'm sorry droid all right I really
I really they really need to do
something about the droid branding just
in general well so they were like you
know so we go to the events super weird
event it was a Juilliard very strange
really yeah it was action weird room and
like get Julia I don't know man um uh it
was in they like it was like it was like
we were at a wedding okay I take it was
circular tables like wedding tables what
um and in the middle there was like
these like weird plastic boxes it looked
like lamps okay now I'll use light up
and they're like huh and I'm like they
SAT us down the start of the event right
away but he's super fast like they open
the doors and I started talking like
while we were still sitting down like
plugging our laptops like live blog the
whole event was five minutes long like
the guy from rises like and the droids
are really important to us we love the
brand the guy from motor i was like
droids are awesome here the three new
droids you're the price once thank you
very much and then they lifted the lamps
and the edge right there and so we got
got to play with them so it's the droid
mini $99 the droid ultra which is 199
which is the thin one and the droid maxx
which has the battery for 299 you've
seen it is you're listening to some
chorizo not just be better the 48 hour
48 hour battery
they told a number of incredible lies
I'll just tell you that right now the
first lie was that they're all running
the motorola 8x computing platform
hell's that which is just a Qualcomm
processor just a regular old Qualcomm
processor rate and so they counted eight
cores this is how they got there they
counted the regular two cores okay of
the processor they counted the for
graphics cores participa and then the
the processor has features one of them
is voice recognition and they called it
a voice recognition core a natural
language processing course makes sense I
sent and then they they're like and then
another core that just monitors the
sensors this is up there with
Microsoft's three platforms for the xbox
yeah it's like I mean they were like
literally like they're like we have this
a custom eight-core processor and then
like a couple hours after the event
everybody figured out they were just
lying wow that there was just a regular
dual-core mid-range Qualcomm processor
1.7 gigahertz and I feel bad because I
didn't figure it out until we got back
so if you watch her a hands-on video I'm
they're like being like and it's an
eight-core processor and Thank You
motorola for making me tell a lie the
second lives they told and they were
like really lies to motorola tells ya
the name i'ma tell story and the second
one was so all these screens are 720p
which is for a two hundred ninety nine
dollar phone like a dual-core processor
in a 720p display is like you're buying
that battery you're not buying like
flagship specs tonight well I love how
we're using chromecast notes like see it
for ourselves in the back now we're
doing chromecast that's cool that's very
clever um now show 15 pictures of me
okay so so I've been very harshly a
little bit of what was happening um I
was very harsh on motor oils previous
phones for having crappy pentel displays
right because they were crap and I
called him crap and Motorola like I got
to the event they're like man you're
gonna love these new screens they're not
pentile right which is like a shade of
the truth right so they are is they're
they're like better their drastically
better screens than the let's plays but
but they're not like iphone or HTC One
caliber
displays they're using their still 0
lead and they're doing all kinds of
weird stuff but their lower resolution
and they have they still have like a
weirder pixel arrangement right I just
weirder it's like different and so like
I just don't know I don't know what the
intent okay they have good features 21
the voice activation core is always
listening dizzle this ultra creepy one
that we thought about that was just Moto
X at the time yeah so these are a huge
preview of the motor de moto x right so
the phone is always listening just for
the words ok Google now let's all
recognize it's not doing Google's not
always listening to you just the phone
is listening locally for those words
right and then i can actually to google
now and you can like talk to it that's
cool right and the voice training is
good like the guy the rap at the event
he had a train to his voice and i
couldn't make it go like I just imagined
screaming okay I mean yeah we all tried
I was like it was like I was like their
party trick was we all tried it and it
only worked with his voice but here's
thing like I can't believe it worked in
like a crowd that crazy I mean yeah it
works so whatever that works by and then
and then and then their other feature
and then what very dramatic I don't want
to say these words do it the other
feature is called it's called droid zap
and I'm sorry what does he could you
just say that again it's uh it's Troy's
app droid doesn't like one laser pistol
cuties I did you say droid zap droid zap
you can you tell me what droid zap does
the droid zap feature when you take a
photo on the phone all right and you
want to share I like this to the people
around you you do what you can say you
can zap it snap to other and then other
people it goes to google and other droid
owners can you can do a two-finger swipe
down and you can look at all the hair do
things at the American pilot precise
mean Zach and you can see for two
minutes all the photos taken by the
zappers around you oh it's kind of like
color yeah and columns after its right
they should really called zappers uh so
only droids can show
here to zap okay there will be an
Android app that can receive oi handsets
yes but there we Android app so that
everybody can receive which is insane
because you know what's gonna happen
next week Motorola's going to put out
its flagship phone that can't use its
this feature it will only be leather
receives apps not put zaps in unto the
world but no one's going to use zaps to
begin with no human being will ever say
these words ever again or do these
things I there's no way in hell this is
catching on nope no so these are the two
generation if you hate to break it to
motorola or verizon whoever's behind the
scheme like no one to droid zap anything
to anybody and certainly droid owners
are not going to collectively get
together and like zap each other and
like the idea that i'd be like dude i
want to share a picture with you
download this app to your phone and then
do this weird is like not gonna
happen like just useless all right by
the way hold on a second now huh
somebody just tweeted at me that you can
airplay that our live our live verge
cast works without flash on an iOS
device yeah and you can airplane it hold
on a second wait buddy I was in chrome
without flyer was not playing now this
is the great flash html5 idiocy of 2013
which is that everything works great on
devices mobile devices about flash
because they built cool html5 players
and then as soon as you get a laptop
it's like well welcome to hell so it
doesn't detect you look so subjecting
this as a desktop browser it's not
showing me the html5 player that's
exactly what's happening can I spoof
only do a little user agent spoof in
here go nuts wait how do you use
radiation in chrome I haven't had to use
her agent spoof it so long yeah out a
second I mean you know it's not you're
not a young man anymore yeah I'm not a
young guy I just want my old what I just
wanted to work you know time please
please I'm an old person there's a
switch on sex on a UAS all right access
your date on all websites hold on that
doesn't sound dad's any interval he's
doing that is there the interim select
look I don't understand if you wanna
we'll get the phones will review them
the right I think they're coming out
August twentieth and the mini which is
nine and all
same spec smaller screen 4.3 720p all
coming out the August August twentieth
for the two big ones 29th for them oh
god why by the way but okay by the way
we just ran a story uh that Google has
ended its it's a netflix promotion for
the chromecast really just you free
overwhelming demand for chromecast
devices since launch yeah I'm sure I
mean people want the other $35 like it's
a good idea i think the chromecast if if
they just don't forget about it which is
like a google thing to do right it will
be good people will like it but even if
like even if i can pay 35 bucks like
just mirror my chrome like that's fine
like mayor mike your browser that's more
than enough and wrap my SAT my droid is
that my droid is anything else to say
about that i just want to look so the
last thing we talked about is next week
the Moto X mm-hm and I I think we
already I don't know what they can do
I'm Josh I'm actually curious what you
think because I think we ran at dieter
and a story after the new droids what's
left for the X right and I think we saw
all the software stuff they're going to
do right they're gonna do this voice
activation they're going to do you can
like shake it to turn on the camera like
what why do you can you I just don't
know why google bought motorola i still
don't know the answer I don't think
these three droids I it's I think it's I
do if your business model is putting out
200 i know our phones with like utterly
mid-range specs hmm that's great then
google shoulda bought Motorola I don't
that's what they're interested in let's
take a little bit of let's figure out a
little bit of let's figure this out okay
why would Google want motorola well the
answer is patent okay night like blew up
anything you know I just I don't we
don't know we don't know that I
definitely need to make an incredible
phone no they have uh maybe they wanted
Motorola's IP that those are called pens
yeah oh wait a second they wanted their
IP they wanted their patents yeah I
guess that's possible I'm but like the
Panzers I just don't understand like I
think that I think what do they do with
the anti smile when they bought Motorola
they needed to protect they had there
was a fear that it was gonna be an
all-out shitstorm of a patent war number
one number two I think that some
we're in the back of their mind they
were like hey if this thing doesn't work
out with us having hardware partners we
can always build our own yeah so here's
the so all that time has passed right we
know it seems like we know what the Moto
X will be right I think we have a really
good pre-launch the one thing I'm very
curious about with the Moto X this is
one remembers from our from our pieces
based on the specs we expect Moto X
could sell for as little as a hundred
nine dollars off contract you know this
this would make sense what Google wants
to do they want to sell things outside
the contracts t-mobile's can be very
happy for that idea that seems like an
insanely sanely cheap number for me i
don't know i don't see how they could do
that especially the droid mini itself as
ninety nine dollars on contract yeah I
mean look but if you need a decent not
Nexus you get a decent Android stock
Android experience with a few little
tweaks or whatever for two hours off
contract taking t-mobile let me just
give you let me just present a scenario
to you are a human being let's pretend
yes now you walk into a verizon store
all right in front of you is this lineup
of droids yes in front of you is the
Moto X why would you pick them out of
whack I wouldn't pick any of those but
right yeah but right but that I don't
know how grants right that's right for
any of those people like you're not
gonna get the Moto X unless you're
probably buying it directly from Google
or like it's free or their gateway or
you're gonna design your own for the
negative but we don't know we're saving
live maybe it's something we don't
expect that they've been announced next
week yeah they're making a huge deal out
of it they are making huge you automate
so we'll find out next week Josh do you
know what they could do do you have any
any deep fuzzy inside because I'm about
a bunch of them but with the moat with
the Moto X yeah why does it why does the
droid mini exist in the same world as
the Moto X the droid mini is ninety nine
dollars in contract has the same specs I
mean presume only phones the only phones
that Motorola sells our phones through
verizon stores called droids yeah and I
know that's true they're not showing any
other phones anywhere else they're
selling just droids and I mean I assure
you that's the only place where where
motorola devices are still actually
selling in any decent amount and so they
have to do that because they want to
have some kind of business they don't
want to constantly just be
like a weird right down for google right
um and I think the Moto X is them taking
a stab at having a standalone device as
like free as a free agent right I just
don't think it I don't think it gets
them like to the goal line in the way
that they wanted to because I think it's
going to be a relatively unless they
really introduce something just
mind-blowing that no one saw coming I
think it's me relatively unexcited
device I think the issue is motorola
doesn't have I mean it's cool they're
making it in America that's kind of a
cool selling point like we would
definitely consider a device made in
America bout this before right I
definitely will seriously consider the
device if it is up to I mean you know at
this point it needs to be as good if not
better than the galaxy s4 or the HTC a
so i will give you that the droids are
running their android is about as close
to stock like their home but it's not
it's not stocked out its stock like its
stock the differences are the difference
is that i noticed on their running for
point-to-point to you and the
differences are when you pull down the
notification shade the icon to go to
settings is different they have the
motor or icons their icons are all
different their icons are not all
different that is like what it's like
yer icons are different okay like
literally it's like four icons there's a
bunch of verizon on the on there
and they have the date that motorola
widget with the circles there now
referring to is the droid command center
I think all what are they calling from
which you zap your friends app from the
commitment that their widget is now
called the droid command center you can
do stuff with it okay I mean yeah those
are the differences different than I
mean the phone icon is different that
the people icon is different like you
know there are differences here it's
also it's a disgusting droid wallpaper
I'm looking at I didn't sell Sal yes
just like these designs it is awful like
I I maybe they sell them maybe they're
selling really well for verizon but I
find there there it's not as bad look
it's not as bad as what Samsung does to
Andrew no no no anyhow I think I think
the I think the insight on the only
insight that i have about
why they're making droids is that they
have to make them because they need to
sell something because they want to
still be a business the Moto X is their
attempt I think to break out of the
we're the guys who make droids for other
people and try to break into the getting
back to where motorola a company that
has actual products that you might be
interested in and look I'll be honest
with you if they make this really cool
colorful interchangeable whatever you
know too well spec device and has a
great price point as LTE and it's a
device I can just go and buy somewhere
like I think that'll be and it's made in
America they're going to be a pretty
cool attractive option for some people
who really care about that stuff but
right nobody's asked you this question
well I reckon a change the guys or the
or the galaxy s4 like probably not why
would you change the color of the phone
it's the same icon only there's as green
in the stock is blue which one the phone
icon isn't the same icon it's the same
icon only there's this green which is
just that makes more sense to people uh
sure and then they change the people I
come with a camera icon is the same like
what are you doing why not just do why
not just do it with stock everything
yeah and throw in a couple of droid
wallpapers and the widgets an exam in a
couple of customs and you never get
zapped and of course yeah by the way so
i got i will say this so all the phones
at the event were they had all the sound
turned off mhm and i thought that that
meant the droid sounds were gone I
thought I was like sitting on the scoop
of the century are you like you got here
that's so exciting I was like I was like
literally calling everyone who's still
there like try and then they're like I
are our video guys zac he actually got
one and plated over the phone for me uh
and it's the opposite it's not that the
droid sounds are gone it's there more
obnoxious than ever really oh yeah
there's like metallic scraping sounds
and like the way like babies after it
says droid all right it's terrible
sounds that sounds cool to me yeah it's
the best i love i love like when the
device is overtly robotic yeah it's the
best natural because it's like it
reminds me of 1999 and i think that's
really cool it reminds me of like the
age yeah it's the matrix not not rinse
not princess dude you know we just sent
a bunch of people to comic-con
requested a question one thing one
investigative report from comic-con
which is when are they gonna remake the
matrix because we're gonna hit on Iowa
job that's definitely how I can't give
you that but i can give you Quentin
Tarantino talking about the matrix
really yeah you say hold on you weren't
there no I wasn't there we shall hold on
what do you would he about to bust out
here I'm looking forward to it was it
may be old as hell I saw him read it
today anyway I'll find it later but
because this is my theory like we've now
remade every movie in the style of the
matrix right so at some point we have to
remake the matrix in the style of the
matrix just think about it there's no
other reality that can possibly exist
and Keanu Reeves I'd like to see the
matrix remade in like a totally
different style no that would be the
obvious thing to do but what Hollywood
will do is to remake them I'm just gonna
happen it's gonna happen mm-hmm and
they're gonna like Peter Berg do okay so
check it out so I just want to say
something to somebody tweeted me about
this so html5 livestream player works
fine in Safari it does not work in
chrome yeah on my on my laptop yeah and
that is annoying why doesn't that work I
don't know man this is a great web
browser hell over 2013 hey it makes
sense that works in safari because fried
is no yeah you know nice what you're
trying to set my user agent that's your
Safari oh yeah I users fre in in Chrome
yeah maybe it'll work yeah yeah I think
it will work have you played shadowrun I
feel like I should place okay height let
always have my shadow run for a second
okay so we ran a romantic posed today
about shadow run which is it's a new RPG
cyberpunk RPG right elbow on steam today
uh it was a crowd funded project and
windows an awesome-looking andrew
webster wrote about it i bought it on
steam and every when I loaded up it just
it says like caching and it never loads
it's driving me insane it's yeah it's
the game in you're playing the game
right now no that's not the game to game
yo mm-hmm you know
um anyhow you should read it's it's
really cool done its I mean the game
looks awesome I can't wait to play it if
I can actually play it letting it right
now just you should definitely check out
the post on the site this story on it we
did kind of like a little feature story
on it it's like a review / report /
feature you should go see it it's very
cool yeah by the way amazing amount of
content this week I hate calling it
content but if you guys you really need
to like go read back through the site
there's so much good stuff even today we
have this really cool thing that Trent
will be wrote about the beaches of
Malibu which I had no idea there's this
thing that the beaches of Malibu there's
all these public beaches but people like
rich people build these homes there and
then they act like the beaches are
private yeah they do all kinds of crazy
stuff like they build fake garages with
like fake curbs yeah and if a garage is
insane yeah no David Geffen building a
fake garage with a fake kerbin people
get tickets for parking there even
though it's a completely legal place to
park and like but to keep people out of
the beaches but there's this app that
will actually tell you which beaches are
public in which you can go on and you
can basically like when you're there you
oh actually if you look at you know city
code you know section whatever like
we're allowed to be on this beach which
is I'm sure can work really great when
their security guards come out but um
anyhow that was cool there's this shadow
run thing we did this piece on weed
which is really great if you haven't
seen it as we talked about before my
interview of that tree Koecher went up
and this is just today um there's a
bunch of other things i'm forgetting now
but uh just an enormous amount of
fantastic stuff oh the story about the
plague a squirrel california out that
way make sure looks so gross i only it's
a terrifying story it's actually really
interesting though because apparently
the plague is not play can do that oh

waiting on ya bidding on there's a lot
of good stuff what else am I forgetting
