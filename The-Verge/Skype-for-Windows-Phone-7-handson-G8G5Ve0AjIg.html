we got a quick look at Skype for Windows
Phone ok so we're just going to launch
the app here from the home screen you
can see there'll be a little bit of a
Skype animation to begin with and then
you'll be presented with your sort of
recent list here so yeah recently missed
calls or chats and all that sort of
stuff and there's a notification at the
top there just to signify that as well
and if we swipe across to contacts you
get full list of all your Skype contacts
you can obviously go in you can chat
with them
now you could swipe across again to get
their profile and their profile image
there and let's just try called
Jamie so that there doesn't seem to any
sort of search on the UI here but you've
got the sort of classic search where you
can go in and tap on the actual letters
to get to uni contacts just going chat
to Jamie and real actually try and give
him call him on the video now what
you'll notice is it automatically spins
it to horizontal so even got a vertical
view there but when you're going to chat
it kind of it takes it back out of that
let's just see
hey Jamie he video okay so here's the
video here there's not there's not much
in terms of customization so you can't
can't drag this window around you still
got the notifications at the top there
and but it's fairly clear and trying to
move around Jamie dance come on there
you go disco Jamie
but yeah it's fairly fluid I mean it's
working pretty good there so and you can
swipe across to get to the chat we'll
see end the call or switch it back just
a standard audio caller
we're just gonna say goodbye Jamie thank
you
okay as I say it was kind of strange day
it's fixed in the landscape mode day now
if we go back to recent we can go to the
calling interface so you can also use
the application to dial a standard
number so mobile or landline okay so one
thing we've noticed is it doesn't appear
that Skype can run in the background so
it can't accept calls when you're in an
other application for example so it's
just demonstrating how that works at the
moment we're just going to try and call
the phone here and you get the call
dialog here now if we actually just put
out the application you'll see that it's
canceled the call and so if we try and
initiate a call now there will be no
sort of notification on the Windows
Phone side so it's ringing on the Skype
phone here
I'm just waiting and what we're probably
hear in a minute
don't forget to pick it up
please leave a message after the beep so
um so you get some kind of Skype
voicemail which we haven't signed up for
so we don't know what's going on there
and but it works well when you're
actually in the client so and we show
that now
you can obviously accept the call and
then you can change it into a video call
I know that's the meet one so you can
turn the camera on there Gainey is going
to go horizontal and you can also turn
the camera on and switch camera so we
can have the rear facing camera and but
overall is a pretty decent app for a
first look at Skype for Windows</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
