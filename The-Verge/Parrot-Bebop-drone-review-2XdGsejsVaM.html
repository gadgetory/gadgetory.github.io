days when it feels great to just be
outside
I love getting shots like this hello mr.
Swan you are majestic okay this is going
to be my opening shot
zooming under this bridge and now I'm
turning around
okay or not okay I've lost my connection
it's just hovering now there's somebody
over there she's walking her dog
maybe if I it'll pull us back no okay
now it's moving again this is bad please
stop Oh God out of the way lady
reviewing a drone in many ways it's like
reviewing a phone how long does the
battery last is the software intuitive
how does the hardware stack up against
the competition in terms of power and
speed but before you get to all that
there is one simple question you need to
answer if I put this thing in the air
can I be sure that I can control it
safely with the new bebop drone from
parrot the answer is too often no parrot
had one of the most successful drones
from the first generation of consumer
quad copters but it was definitely a toy
for the bebop parrots vision is to
transform their offering from a toy into
a tool something anyone can use to
capture high-quality photos and videos
from a great distance
like parrots earlier models you can
control the bebop with just a smartphone
or tablet but you can also use a more
traditional controller which parrot said
extends the range of the unit to 1.2
miles unfortunately in our testing the
connection between the pilot and drone
was simply not reliable when using my
phone I would often lose connection to a
bebop flying just a dozen feet away I
got nothing I got no control so the
drone got maybe like what 12 feet away
and we lost our connection and now it's
just going on its own
I literally just lost the signal again
like I'm not
right now in the best case scenario it
more or less hovered in place while I
furiously click through my settings and
the app trying to reconnect in the worst
case it just kept flying wherever it was
headed perfect now there are some nice
things about the bebop it's very small
and light fits easily into a backpack
even my two year old toddler can carry
it it's cheap at $4.99 although that
price doesn't include the optional sky
controller which tax on another 400
bucks and the video the bebop captures
while not as nice as you might get from
the latest GoPro is good enough to make
friends on Facebook jealous of your
latest hiking trip or surfing adventure
when it maintains its connection the
bebop flies well for complete beginners
the fact that the bebop uses a
smartphone as the controller makes it
really approachable it might be good
enough for some very limited flying just
as you learn but for really getting the
most out of your drone the app is a
controller Falls way short it can be
hard to see the screen and figure out
how to toggle between menus to get to
all your controls the bebop does come
with a hood which you can wear to block
out life but in our testing this was
pretty awkward and not always safe the
bebop takes a really unique approach to
its camera rather than mounting an
external unit underneath with a gimbal
it has an internal camera with fisheye
lens you can use your thumb in the app
or special joystick on the sky
controller to pan around 180 degrees
within the cameras field of view this
can prove really useful if you're out
trying to get a shot you can just let
the drone hover in place and focus on
framing without worrying about where
you're headed the drawback is that all
the video footage has a slightly stilted
quality to it as a result of being
stabilized with software and when you do
crash the lens on the camera is in prime
position to bear the brunt of the impact
the basic bebop comes with two batteries
but you're not going to get a lot of
flight time out of them I average
between 10 and 12 minutes depending on
the wind and the number of backflips I
decided to do that's far less than the
15 to 20 minutes you can get on many
comparable drones and after having spent
a couple of weeks with the bebop I have
to say the overall build quality is a
little suspect the power button on the
sky controller popped off and the covers
on the bottom of the aircraft fell off
as soon as I pulled it out of the box
this same issue shows up with the
battery for some reason pair designed it
in such a way that it never really snaps
into place with a solid connection to
solve this they provided a little velcro
strap you can use to secure the battery
in place this is literally putting a
band-aid on a design issue and after any
amount of rigorous flying I always found
the battery had slipped a bit leaving a
noticeable gap the be-bop feels like it
landed right in between a tool and a toy
in terms of its price and feature set
that makes unique in the market when it
works you're getting a great value but
the build quality and software lack
attention to detail and the number of
times we lost connection paired with
parrots and vicious claims about range
are frankly a little dangerous the bebop
is a drone that gets a lot right but it
also promises you can do things which it
is really not reliable enough to safely
