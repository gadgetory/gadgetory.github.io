this is the Oppo n1 with CyanogenMod if
you've ever looked into the vast world
of Android modification chances are
you've heard of CyanogenMod the most
popular custom operating system for the
platform
CyanogenMod has been installed on tens
of millions of devices and has a very
loyal and dedicated following people
like Evert speed stability and
enhancements to Android that don't take
away from the core user experience it's
also a great way to breathe new life
into an older or abandoned Android phone
but now cyanogen is a real company and
you can actually buy a phone with
CyanogenMod already installed no
modification or elbow work necessary
that phone is the n1 a $600 5.9 inch
device from Chinese manufacturer Oppo it
has everything you might expect from a
high-end Android phone today a 1080p HD
display quad-core processor 13 megapixel
camera and impressively solid build
quality it also has some unique hardware
features such as a swiveling camera unit
rear touchpad and Bluetooth keychain
accessory that beeps when you walk too
far away from your phone but its display
looks pretty washed out and has poor
viewing angles the camera isn't very
good despite its high specs and the n1
doesn't have support for LTE which is a
huge bummer in addition those extra
hardware features don't really work that
well and do little to add to the
experience the n1 is also really really
big virtually every one that I showed
the n1 2 remarked it just how big it is
it's a well-built phone with nice
materials but have I mentioned how big
it is but the story here isn't the
hardware it's a CyanogenMod software the
N one comes with CyanogenMod 10.2 which
is based on Android 4.3 jelly bean it
looks very similar to stock Android but
includes enhancements to the lockscreen
messaging app notification bar and more
I much preferred over Samsung HTC or
LG's custom interfaces and in many ways
it's actually better than the stock
Android that ships on the Nexus 5 it's
really fast and responsive on the n1 and
in the multiple weeks that I use the
device I didn't want see an app crash or
have the device freeze up
CyanogenMod is similar to the software
Motorola installs in the Moto X it's
like the stock Android that you might
find on a Nexus phone but better the
overall experience hasn't really changed
but I appreciate the smart enhancements
to the platform especially the
lockscreen shortcuts it's also quite
customizable under the surface you can
modify the notification bar apply
various themes and even tweak the
processors performance to your own
liking
themes can change the appearance
Conn's toggles and more and can be
downloaded from the Play Store and
applied with just a few taps there's a
reason why cyanogen claims the software
has been installed on over 11 million
devices it offers an improved experience
over standard Android without ruining
the clean interface at Google designed
but as much as CyanogenMod is a niche
operating system for the advanced user
the Oppo n1 is a niche phone for the
dedicated signage and fan at $599 it's a
hard sell against the best from Samsung
LG HTC and others it doesn't have LTE
can't be bought at a discount and can't
even be purchased in a retail store
chances are the people that be
interested in paying the price for the
n1 and ordering one are the same type of
person that wouldn't mind doing some
command line work to get CyanogenMod
installed on any other device cyanogen
has some really great software and would
likely be a compelling option for many
prospective Android users it's like
stock Android but better in many ways
but in order to go mainstream it's going
to have to come on more mainstream
smartphones something that you can buy
from a carrier in a store
fortunately the n1 is just the start a
way to get sine engines foot-in-the-door
now it needs to blow that door wide open</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
