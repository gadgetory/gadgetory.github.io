California's Institute for Creative
Technologies in LA since it was founded
in nineteen ninety nine ICT has been
where people go to research how we might
teach learn move and talk in the future
it's where you go to see how things that
seemed like science fiction 10 or 20
years ago could become a basic part of
human communication
this is one of the centerpieces of ICT
the wide 5 a professional-grade vr
headset that's nearly 10 years old the
red lights on those horns talked to a
tracking system that covers the room and
you can put them on anything gloves
shoes even a drone so first time I've
ever moved my feet in VR I think I like
seeing my avatars beat in BR yeah so
it's a big deal right if you're tracking
hands and tracking feet and tracking
torso it completely transformed the
experience you can see the path it that
you walked this is an experiment and
redirected walking I feel like I've been
exploring a whole compound but some
clever visual tricks mean I'm really
just going in circles the goal is to
implement this in various training
regimens so the army has a system called
dismounted soldier training system where
they take a squad of men and women and
they put them in head mount displays and
then they run them through a virtual
scenario turns out that it's much more
effective if you start to involve the
body as well as the mind in an immersive
scenario so the lab has gotten pretty
good at this and we can we can fool you
into thinking that a small tract space
is a bigger space the next steps that
the lab is working on is what happens if
I now have two people in the space
because now I have to keep them for
running into each other so imagine being
able to play madden and move around and
do madden without getting in each
other's way what we're really focused on
is how can humans use this for training
and learning opportunities we know that
robots and drones and all of these
autonomous and semi-autonomous objects
are going to be part of the landscape
the whole sort of steam punk ethos of
I'm going to put my Wi-Fi up on a drone
and I'm going to put my sensor systems
up on the drought and I'm just going to
have portable sensors wherever I want is
going to come through once you put those
sensors up they can do something like
tell a drone in a disaster area exactly
where to go no matter how much it gets
knocked around so the computer is
telling it to stay in this spot see now
it's upset because I'm basically giving
it more lift to push it up and then it
realizes that it wants
go back down ICT gets funding from the
US military and one of the things that's
produced is Project Blue shark a
prototype for the future of ships it's
an augmented reality command center made
from an oculus rift and a bunch of
displays which could show pictures and
controls or be totally blank the images
could be projected onto them with a
headset it's supposed to make you feel
like you're right up in the crow's nest
even if you're really in a dark room
miles away the actual design would have
to be a lot more sophisticated than this
but that's up to the Navy and a future
VR designers the reality is it's going
to change the way that you design the
ship it's going to change the way that
you design the ship's complement the
number of people the type of tasks that
they do the structure of the Navy itself
it all changes because you can now start
to immerse people in these environments
and once you hit robot arm so this is an
example of connecting a physical world
object with the virtual since we're
dragging your hands you can use gestures
to control beyond these prototypes are
never going to go up for sale to the
general public but the effects could
trickle down the whole sensor markets or
wearable sensors you know Apple watch is
a is kind of a bad first generation but
Apple will evolve it and get it better
over time to do a limited set of things
but body sensing is going to be huge all
of that stuff is going to start to crash
together and we'll probably wonder how
we got along without it as long as it
doesn't end up becoming Skynet
even if it's not Skynet does making
military technology raise ethical
questions any technology has the ability
to be used for positive outcomes and it
can be used for negative outcomes I mean
is it is it ethical to scan one of our
employees and then make him dance
gangnam style ICT was working on VR
years before the oculus rift type but
there's still a lot of work left one of
the biggest obstacles as haptic switch
companies like Disney have been working
on and that ICT is interested in too if
you want to immerse someone you need to
immerse all of the senses and right now
we're very far along the way on the
visual and we're very behind on all of
the other senses so I think that's those
are areas that are really ripe but
they're really really difficult problems
if you look around I see T's lab you can
see the past and future of technology
whether that's drones or light-filled
video or body scanning or a predecessor
to google cardboard it's tied into
everything that we talk about when we
talk about virtual reality augmented
reality and telepresence and if I came
back in a year I'd probably see even
more</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
