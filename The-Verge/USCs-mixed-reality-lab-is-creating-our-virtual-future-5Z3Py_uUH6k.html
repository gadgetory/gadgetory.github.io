California's Institute for Creative
Technologies in LA since it was founded
in 1999 ICT has been where people go to
research how we might teach learn move
and talk in the future it's where you go
to see how things that seemed like
science fiction 10 or 20 years ago
could become a basic part of human
communication
this is one of the centerpieces of ICT
the wide five a professional-grade VR
headset that's nearly ten years old the
red lights on those horns talked to a
tracking system that covers the room and
you can put them on anything gloves
shoes even a drone so first time I've
ever moved my feet in VR I think I like
seeing my avatars feet in VR yeah so
it's a big deal right if you're tracking
hands and tracking feet and tracking
torso it completely transforms the
experience you can see the path it that
you walked this is an experiment and
redirected walking I feel like I've been
exploring a whole compound but some
clever visual tricks mean I'm really
just going in circles the goal is to
implement this in various training
regimens so the Army has a system called
dismounted soldier training system where
they take a squad of men and women and
they put them in head-up displays and
then they run them through a virtual
scenario turns out that it's much more
effective if you start to involve the
body as well as the mind in an immersive
scenario so the lab has gotten pretty
good at this and we can we can fool you
into thinking that a small track space
is a bigger space the next steps that
the lab is working on is what happens if
I now have two people in the space
because now I have to keep them from
running into each other so imagine being
able to play Madden and move around and
do Madden without getting in each
other's way what we're really focused on
is how can humans use this for training
and learning opportunities we know that
robots and drones and all of these
autonomous semi-autonomous objects are
going to be part of the landscape the
whole sort of steampunk ethos of I'm
gonna put my Wi-Fi up on a drone and I'm
gonna put my sensor systems up on the
drone and I'm just gonna have portable
sensors wherever I want is gonna come
through once you put those sensors up
they can do something like tell a drone
in a disaster area exactly where to go
no matter how much it gets knocked
around so the computer is telling it to
stay in this spot see now it's upset
because I'm basically giving it more
to push it up and then it realizes that
it wants to go back down ICT gets
funding from the US military and one of
the things that's produced is project
blue shark a prototype for the future of
ships
it's an augmented reality command center
made from an oculus rift and a bunch of
displays which could show pictures and
controls or be totally blank
the images could be projected onto them
with a headset it's supposed to make you
feel like you're right up in the crow's
nest even if you're really in a dark
room miles away the actual design would
have to be a lot more sophisticated than
this but that's up to the Navy and a
future VR designers the reality is it's
going to change the way that you design
the ship it's going to change the way
that you design the ships complement the
number of people the type of tasks that
they do the structure of the Navy itself
it all changes because you can now start
to immerse people in these environments
and once you hit robot arm so this is an
example of connecting a physical world
object with the virtual these prototypes
are never going to go up for sale to the
general public but the effects could
trickle down the whole sensor market so
wearable sensors you know Apple watches
of is kind of a bad first generation but
Apple will evolve it and get it better
over time to do a limited set of things
but body sensing is going to be huge all
of that stuff is going to start to crash
together and we'll probably wonder how
we got along without it as long as it
doesn't end up becoming Skynet
even if it's not Skynet does making
military technology raise ethical
questions any technology has the ability
to be used for positive outcomes and it
can be used for negative outcomes is it
is it ethical to scan one of our
employees and then make him dance
ICT was working on VR years before the
oculus rift type but there's still a lot
of work left one of the biggest
obstacles is haptics which companies
like Disney have been working on and
that ICT is interested in too if you
want to immerse someone you need to
immerse all of the senses and right now
we're very far along the way on the
visual and we're very behind on all of
the other senses so I think that's those
are areas that are really ripe but
they're really really difficult problems
if you look around I see teas lab you
can see the past and future of
technology whether that's drones or
light-filled video or body scanning or a
predecessor to Google cardboard it's
tied in to everything that we talk about
when we talk about virtual reality
augmented reality and telepresence and
if I came back in a year I'd probably
see even more</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
