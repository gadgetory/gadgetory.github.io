Pierce and on this show we bring you the
best in consumer electronics past
present and future this week it's all
three really we're talking about google
glass it's one of the most anticipated
products we've seen in a long long time
and we just got one last week we plunked
down $1,500 for and we've been playing
with it to see if this really is the
future but really it's kind of part of
the past two on some level Google glass
is a long time coming in science fiction
books and movies for decades we've been
imagining a world where we're not
looking at our phones or tapping
incessantly on keyboards in the future
we've learned we do everything with our
voice or maybe even our thoughts our
computers whatever they might look like
will project data into the world around
us will wave our arms like crazy to move
information around like Tom Cruise data
Minority Report or maybe we'd be like
Tony Stark with a heads-up display
permanently in front of our face while
we order around our own personal Jarvis
every author and director has a slightly
different vision but they've all been on
the same thing technology is not going
to be on a screen anymore it's going to
be out in the world on top of the world
inside the world and we're going to be
spending a lot of time poking it
prodding it and especially talking to it
so far Google glass is a small cautious
sort of imperfect step in that direction
it's designed to be used with your voice
you say ok glass and then issue a
command take a picture email my
girlfriend show me who won the yankee
game it's less like talking to a friend
than it is issuing a series of dictates
but glass obediently carries them out
well most of the time sometimes glass
goes to sleep and you have to wake it by
either tapping the side of your head
like your Cyclops or by tipping your
head upward at the exact degree you'd
use for a slightly exaggerated eye roll
and while glass understands and executes
its basic commands navigation is a bit
of a chore you swipe along the temple of
the glasses to move forward and backward
through the endless glass interface from
the home screen you can swipe through
every interaction you've ever had with
the device or swipe to settings or
Google now
or to other apps swiping upward takes
you back and tapping on the temples is
like pressing enter and that's all once
you're connected to your phone which you
need before you can do much of anything
glass can't connect to the internet on
its own so without your smartphone it's
really nothing more than an unimpressive
camera glued to your face once you've
signed in to your Google account and
linked it to your glass it uses a QR
code in the camera in the glass to
connect and it's probably the first time
a QR code has ever been the simplest way
to do anything but the process is still
far from over every contact you an email
or message you'll have to manually add
from your phone or computer every app
you want to install every place you want
to share images you just can't manage
anything from glass your smartphone is
the engine it's the power source glass
is just an accessory attach to your face
glass isn't anywhere near finished and
we know that even if Google hadn't said
it over and over some of the gestures
don't work reliably and glass doesn't
understand me quite like I want it to
it's like being in a foreign country
where no one fully understands English
and like The Ugly American i am i still
find myself yelling where is mcdonald's
into the upper right corner of my eye
line more often than i should glass may
come straight out of science fiction but
ok glass doesn't begin quite the
technological revelation that star
trek's communicators or how 9000 taught
us to hope for actually now that I think
about it maybe Google followed Hal a
little too closely oh
so one of my favorite things about glass
is actually people's first reaction to
it everybody wants to have their picture
taken with it and they want to take a
picture with it and then everybody has
these weird sort of different reactions
so I brought chris ziegler who has never
tried this on before and it basically
just shoved it on your face and was like
here you go yeah and you like haven't
spoken to me since this started it's
basically it's happening right it's a
little yes and it is a little weird and
I'm a little discombobulated so what's
that what do you think so far so you put
it on your face what next my first
reaction is that it doesn't I think that
I expected for whatever reason the menu
available options to be significantly
richer like you say ok glass you only
get one two three four five six seven
menu item and there's like sort of a way
to scroll through them but it's not
really obvious right wait can you scroll
through it with your head is that
possible so I've wondered this the whole
time I've been using this and I can't
tell sometimes it works and sometimes it
doesn't work which is kind of like the
whole thing with google glass but yet so
there's not that much you can do but you
took a selfie already didn't you oh no
this is gonna be huge mistake what are
we going here we're googling whatever is
coming out of your mouth yes as much you
owe the breath of fresh this is what I
love about google it is like it doesn't
it doesn't actually like search for
anything of anything are you it seems to
just pull up Wikipedia you can't ask it
a question no like asking a question Oh
like playa what year did Abraham Lincoln
died try that ok glass Google what year
did Abraham Lincoln died
see that's not bad and it's actually
telling you in the weird speaker over
your ear so like if you ask it a very
specific question it works that would
make you a killer at trivia that's true
that night at a bar just imagine you're
like thinking pensive later like what
year did Abraham Lincoln nor yeah ignore
like oh I got it is it ignored the
google glass on my face is not there I'm
just thinking aloud towards the right
corner of my eye this is so weird so one
thing I noticed is that if you move your
eyeball very quickly the RG and be
separate out from one another mmm and
that's a signature of dlp displays I
don't know what kind of display Google
is using in glass yeah they're super
they're weird about talking about the
specs of it they like a parrot to what
it's like on a high-def TV from eight
feet away isn't helped doesn't mean
anything yeah and so yeah that's a
little uh that's something that I would
like to see them change on the final
version so what does that mean it's a
dlp display like what is that actually
it's like you know like a dlp TV which
has i think they call it the rain
there's an official name for its the
rainbow effect it's like if you if you
scan the display very quickly you see
the r g and b individually right and so
that's that's a little distracting
because you you know it's just showing
you white basically white fonts white
text right but if you look left and
right really fast you see RGB yeah it
can also it also made it really hard to
film we had first of all it's like this
tiny little screen rah and we ended up
having to sort of shoot it and it looks
a lot better than it looked in that
video we were showing it's actually like
at least in my opinion as long as you're
looking at it fairly normal yeah it's
it's not that right yeah I'm just
looking straight straight no the other
problem is that you have to go like this
to turn it on without touching it which
in the bestest you kind of have to do it
like four or five times sometimes you're
standing you're like right yeah I'm just
nodding I'm nodding my approval except
everybody walking past me any June I
maybe this is a setting you can change
in vector probably is but if you turn it
on by holding your head up and then you
put your head back down the display
turns off almost instantly so you just
have to sit here like this while you're
asking your question or not googling for
instruction or you navigations
directions or whatever so yeah they have
some things to work there yeah so what
have you discover so far you were just
like messing around through the
interface and you were finding I tried I
tried
on you right didn't work because it
couldn't find a phone number for you
right that's what so that I should
mention is like the worst part about
glass right now is like what I would
love is if it hooked into all of my
google stuff automatically and you would
think it would because it's it's google
right so like you would it doesn't seem
that hard but then they have you know
you have to go in and manually add every
single like in safari here i have to go
in and add every single contact i want
yeah it's just it's just a giant pain it
kind of reminds me of the cr-48 right
because like it looks like no I mean
it's like it's this really early hard
whether they just want to get out there
and the software sucks the hardware
sucks but you know the hardcore you know
the the bleeding edge people are going
to love it and I think that glasses is
the same yeah if you can seriously walk
around with it which I don't know if I
would have the guts to but but but some
people yeah I will say I got I we went
out to shoot the video we were just
watching and they we got stopped by a
lady and man they were sort I think
together I don't know not important it
was conciliate didn't want to ask but so
they stopped us and we were talking and
we had like a conversation and the guy
goes so have you ever picked up any
girls at that and i was i was like no
just none like- women with this and and
he was like i was talking to this girl
that and he was like well you got one in
her and she just immediately was like no
no never I would never date a guy with
Google glass and then like turn to
walked away you know this might not be
the chick magnet I was over yeah I mean
and it doesn't help that the the camera
doesn't seem to be very good because you
could say oh let me take a nice picture
of you but the camera just isn't that
great one thing I wanted to try while
I'm here is I want see if I can create a
screen ception by taking a picture nice
uh ok glass take a picture oh no that's
not going to yeah so it doesn't end the
world it turns out if you take up for
the screen okay well that's always
pretty sure that's good no I mean the
camera the one thing I do like about the
camera is how just like seamless it is
we sent like Sam sheffer our social guy
to the Justin Timberlake on so of course
because as you do as you do right people
and and and he loved just being able to
stand there and like look at a thing and
take a picture
yeah take a picture of relatively that
thing right which is cool but yeah the
camera it's kind of a long way to go
before it's actually a good camera yeah
it's not great i will say that i'm
impressed with audio quality i know how
it would perform at a concert yeah i
thinks it I remember Sam saying that you
couldn't hear anything but um well so
it's bone conduction right and you can
feel it right so his bone conduction
like is it going to be a thing they've
been talking about it in smartphones is
it is it actually useful tech here or
anywhere it is for low fidelity stuff
you can have some company makes bone
conduction stereo headsets that is not
designed for like swimmers so they can
listen to music while they're swimming
but I don't think that it's very high
quality right and this is the same thing
right like the idea that the reason why
they're doing it is so that you can hear
in more situations like you can be out
on a new york city street and here you
know these alerts and tones and voice
navigation instructions but I you know
am I going to want to listen to music on
this thing well no for one thing there
is no left side but read even if there
was I don't think about doing another
thing where you're listening to music in
two headphones then you take one out and
it like throws your whole balance off
that kept happening to me with this
right was like I was completely my whole
brain is just like veering right as I
yes it does his are you know it doesn't
it doesn't help that you can feel you
like you can seriously like feel it what
like when it makes a sound there's like
a pressure on the right side of your
head for where the bone conduction is
yeah and edgy I can see why that would
be just feels great it's exactly what
you it's nice a massaging sensation
really so what I mean so what do you
like we've been talking about glass
forever right it's been out there
they've been talking about it's like
what's yeah it's the first time you've
tried it what did you expect ha I just a
pretty of white or orange first of all
disappointed in your color selection I'm
black you personally yeah I did I'm so
sorry but I mean you can obviously see
how and why this has potential but it's
just so early both in terms of software
in terms of hardware in terms of just
like basic like social acceptance of
having this weird thing on your head
yeah all of that I think is kind of like
collaborating against Google pushing
this to the mainstream soon but you can
imagine how like five ten years down the
road these things are 99 bucks and they
just look like regular eyeglasses
it's gonna be a different ballgame what
was so for like four you know you Chris
tiegler a day in the life of Nazi power
yeah where does where does glass come in
for me it was it was directions like I
actually loved having a thing that i
could just be like oh i wonder if
there's a starbucks nearby and it would
just like no and sort of find me
starbucks like what is that is it for
you i will tell you exactly how it fits
in front in fact i'll show you i'll
demonstrate go ok glass hang out with
david pierce oh haha no google+ contact
but i would definitely come for this
we're using one of our test accounts and
it's actually suspended because i think
google doesn't know what to do with the
fact that we have google glass connected
to this account yes it's complete it
does normally work right and i would
hang out with you so you think you want
to do that you just want to walk around
and be like hey what'swhat's dieter up
to and just hang out and yeah just do a
little little call you know a little
voice caller look I guess there isn't I
mean I could probably see him is that
the idea I could see him in the Hangout
will he'd be able to see you too I guess
no no see this is the weird thing about
what he'd just be at his computer or
something right i mean if i held the
phone up then he might see me right
there needs to be that's true there
needs to be another camera that just
just your why I it's just like no no it
is he would have to be it like on this
little stem that you could like rotate
out and then it faces back at you then
all anybody would do is just selfies
just like Google glass tiles on your go
ever since vine added front-facing
camera capability it's all selfies all
the times you Jack Dorsey on the like
half of his face with device yep
brilliant it's perfect it is perfect
yeah so so what else you you want to be
able to hang out but there's like
they've talked about all these other
apps that sort of to me seemed not super
useful there's like Skitch and it's like
I don't know that I want to take a
picture and like annotated on my I don't
even know how that works necessary well
so what else so the first thing I'll say
is that until they get to the point
where glass at the very least they need
to get it to the point where I can wear
it all day it's just like a phone like
these be able to last a day if it's
lessening through what is it three
nights yeah it's somewhere between like
three or four types I'm not gonna be
home and be like oh I'm going to dinner
let me go grab my glass and put it on
like that's not how you're gonna use it
you're gonna set you're gonna either
have it on or gonna have it off yeah and
and so they need to get past that hump
in order to enable an entire like Set of
apps that aren't really useful right now
like a simple example like the new york
times app like I
I I really like the idea of his just
having breaking news fed to me all day
in my eyeball that's really that sounds
like misery I'm wait it's just like I
guess what just happened I'm way into it
like that's you know I want to feel
connected and I don't want to be the
jerk that's pulling his phone out and
looking at actually I will say it was
did you get uh the emergency alert on
your phone this morning for there was a
flood in New York apparently maybe it's
just a memo bourhood in Brooklyn but
there was a there was a flood alert and
it occurred to me this morning I was
sitting that's like that would be a
hater thing like my phone's going crazy
nice if it was just like hey it's
flooding go inside yeah that's actually
happy that would actually be super
useful um yeah you can I mean it's it's
so obvious the potential of having a
displaying your eyeball the time but so
okay here's here's my last question for
you and this is what I totally don't
understand what's different about google
glass versus like if I just held my
phone here all the time but like wait
hold your phone wow that's true that's
the point no you're it is that it's here
also there are two things right one is
it IM guy made like a homemade glass
this week and the critical thing the
reason why it is not a homemade glass is
that it doesn't have a transparent
display being able to have this thing
that's sort of like basically out of
your way even though it's right on your
face is critical that's true and then
also there's the simple fact that you're
not can hold your phone up all day so I
think don't see why not you just have
like you need one of those things that
they give dogs with like the carrot in
front of them that makes them real just
just hang my phone I think well no
that's where your front facing camera
goes oh got to leave space for that I
think the more interesting battle in the
next few years is going to be between
this form factor and this form factor
smart interesting because there's going
to be so much overlap in what they're
trying to accomplish right you're gonna
get text messages delivered to your
eyeball you're going to text messages on
your wrist you're going to get weather
alerts here and here so I can see a lot
of conflict there and I can definitely
see why people kind of like fold into
one of those two camps and just not have
both except for me with who of course
what I was gonna say you're you're a big
you know take you know chris ziegler guy
who owns did you buy a palm folio
recently did I make that up not really I
have you own a folio it has been in my
collection for many years oh okay fair
enough but so you're a guy who buys lots
of tech
just start you can say David garbage
useless things that no one has ever
needed Reverend lives right and sold for
eight dollars uneven right yeah uh but
so you're you're also big watch guy
right so where do you think you'll and
between glasses and watch I feel like
for me I land on watch but yes as much
as they want to say it's out of my way
it's still in my way like it's still
gonna be there and the watch is
genuinely like I'm once i watch now and
I don't notice it and that's also a
social Norman to wear a watch it is not
nobody looks at me funny when I go like
right exactly and and one thing that's
for me the killer app for smartwatches
is vibration because you frequently
can't feel your phone ringing your
pocket especially if you're like walking
you can't feel it if you get like a text
message you always feel the vibration on
your wrist mad phantom vibrations on
your face are going to be the worst
you're just gonna walk around your ankle
it's just happen oh yeah I'm fine yeah
yeah yeahs thought I got a text me with
no no dice yeah we're world we're all
going no you're gonna die really really
soon yes we are all right we have to go
so get out of here and you use that to
get you actually will get you anywhere
because you'll go down into the New York
subway and it'll be like I can't tell
you anything I can just take a picture
and probably get you arrested I'm
actually going to sell this on ebay
right and then and then buy more palm
folio yes with the proceeds right all
right awesome thanks Chris thank you so
the future is much more exciting than
the present in the past for google glass
they're both cool and there's some nifty
stuff going on but what's really
exciting about glass both from Google's
perspective and consumers perspective is
what's coming next so we sent evan
rodgers to figure out what is coming
next the funny thing about google
glasses the expectations clearly exceed
the reality the first thing people want
to do is take a picture and have their
picture taken but after a few awkward
voice commands 30 to take it off and
admit that it's pretty cool but there's
just not that much you can do with it
right now but we're starting to see
developers stretch their legs in terms
of what you can do in addition to what's
available right out of the box you can
now get hourly updates from the new york
times app send and receive tweets and
upload videos directly to youtube with a
new full screen be map there's also
plenty of apps coming soon like evernote
and others but some developers aren't
waiting around if you have successfully
rooted glass allowing them to run apps
that google otherwise wouldn't approve
one app Winky enables you to take a
picture too
just by winking another less you run the
full android desktop right from the
eyepiece the explorer edition of Google
glass was designs the developers could
try new things but the speed at which it
was rooted has caused some to speculate
about the downsides of an ever-present
microphone and camera someone could in
theory tap into your glass without you
ever knowing but for right now hacking
glass requires physical access and
hopefully it'll stay that way right now
glass is a concept physically manifested
it's an expensive accessory that has far
more potential than it has functionality
but that's okay as units arrive on the
Stoops of developers will undoubtedly
see the number of apps expand pretty
quickly glass will be a playground for
the imaginative and though will
experience some growing pains people are
excited and ultimately that's what
matters for now Google glass is really
more interesting than it is good it's
good just for the fact that it works but
the future is really where it's going to
start to get interesting and part of
that future is coming next week at
Google i/o where Google's bound to talk
a lot more about glass and try to get
developers and buyers on board for this
to actually be a real product speaking
of which will be at Google i/o next week
bringing you all the news on glass plus
all the news on everything that google
