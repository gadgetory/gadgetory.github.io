speaking to you from sony headquarters
in new york and i'm here with jack
tretton the president and CEO of sony
computer entertainment of america jack
nice to see you again Ryan great to see
you too so tonight you will be you're
staying up I guess you just flew in from
the west coast but you're staying up for
the the launch of the Vita here in North
America yeah the morning came a little
hard but by midnight I should be cooking
and you know if you can't be excited
about a platform launched you shouldn't
be in the business I'm thrilled that
this will be my fourth platform launched
with sony and very very excited about
vita now this launch is I know this is
the the full launch but you've already
had I guess a little taste of the launch
with an earlier version that came out or
a bundle that came out a little earlier
this month have you gotten any sort of
numbers or do you have any sense on how
that went yeah it's the first time we've
ever done that we had a pre-sale bundle
available that gave consumers an
opportunity to get in their hands a week
early so they picked it up on the
fifteenth and we did see some initial
reads and clearly we're dealing with the
most hardcore of the core but I was
really pleased to see not only the
number of games that sold but the depth
of games and then also great great
peripheral attached a lot of people
going out there and buying a lot of
different accessories for Vita as well
is there a particular game that's doing
really well were people going out sort
of buying specific games for that when
they got the bundle or if you're not
seeing no question about that and really
not a surprise there uncharted golden
Abyss i think is the ultimate launch
game and really a testament to what the
vita can do so near is I think a neat
idea the idea of sort of being able to
pick up or drop off like presents to
your friends I through this sort of
online network I'm a little a little
confused in how I'm going to use it in
the long term like I'm still it's what
it's one of the newer things I guess
that I experienced when I started
playing around with the veto so how do
you use it in like what kind of future
do you think near has for the Vita and
maybe for other PlayStation products
online well I think consumers in general
and people you you take comfort in
people that are living the same life
that you are so if you're traveling all
the time it's you know you realize that
you're not the only one living out of a
suitcase
spending a lot of time in airports if
you're a gamer your real social you want
to share your experiences you want to
talk about your experiences with your
friends the great thing about near is I
hit that button and I'm able to see an
incredible amount of people that are
gaming locally and find out what they're
playing what they like make new friends
that way and it's done in a you know
it's done via GPS so if I'm here in New
York I live in San Francisco all of a
sudden I'm exposed to all these people
that are gaming in Manhattan with a
touch of a button and it's amazing how
much you have in common with the people
that are out there gaming that only the
games you're playing but the type of
games that you're interested in as well
one of the other things i noticed i
think everybody's going to notice
obviously is the live area which is sort
of the interface that you guys have we
don't we don't have the cross media bar
anymore what was the reasoning behind
that do you think that library is going
to be sort of the future of the user
interface for playstation products well
i think in general terms we've really
focused on the user experience and to
try to make that as seamless as possible
to make it is easy to use and that's
just something i notice about the vita
initially not only the game controls but
the ability to toggle in and out of apps
and get from point A to point B very
easily and connect with other gamers so
do you is it an experience you think
that's specifically designed for the
portable market or could we see this
either coming to the PlayStation 3 or to
a future hardware that's sitting at home
well I think PlayStation has really been
a bellwether among the Sony family in
terms of connected digital devices and
of course the goal is to have all sony
digital devices connected in a format
that people are very comfortable with in
and connect various devices at the same
time not only within the sony universe
but outside it as well so i really see
it as a potential sign of things to come
on other so many devices is this is
maybe a little a little too nitty-gritty
but the ps3 does it have the ability to
have that sort of massive change go live
could you for instance do an update or a
patch for the ps3 that would completely
change the interface to something like
what the Vita has I don't know that
you're going to see something that's
identical to the Vita
day one but I think if you look back on
the history of the playstation 3 that
interface is improved on a regular basis
and has evolved that being said people
have worked with it since 2006 and it
kind of has its own look to it and Vita
certainly works in concert with that but
I don't think you're going to see Vita 2
point 0 on the PlayStation 3 in the near
future you will see a lot of the
features influence each other though
actually the cross media bar you think I
think the cross media bar is here to
stay in PlayStation 3 for the
foreseeable future so the Vita we were
talking a little bit earlier about how
you might use the veto one of the things
I think is really interesting is that
the Vita seems from a design perspective
to be a device that wasn't created with
the idea of the form factor first so it
doesn't feel like Sony sat down and said
okay this needs to fit in a pocket and
then we're going to figure out all the
things we can put on it it kind of feels
like Sony wanted to design something
that was a good gaming device and then
worry later about the form factor is
that right i mean d was this about
designing something that was a certain
size or was it more about the experience
there's been a real focus across Sony
for a number of years and I think Vita
is one of the perfect examples of
focusing on the user experience and
putting tools in the hands of the people
that would create that user experience I
think historically we would create a
great engineering technology and we
would hand it off to software
development teams and say here so we
could do with this and then they try to
create the best gaming experience and we
turn to consumers and say what do you
think of this I think we did it in
reverse order this time we said to you
know consumers what would you ideally
like to see in a device we said to the
software development community what
tools do you need to create the best
possible games and user experiences and
then ultimately we designed device
around it so I think we did it ideally
from the users perspective out as
opposed to the designers perspective in
i think in designing something like this
there's always this risk when you're
doing something innovative that instead
of making something innovative you
perhaps create something that's out on
guard in this sense that someone will
see the device as interesting
and different but over time might lose
interest in it so it's it's it becomes
not something that that can kind of jump
that hurdle and become mainstream I the
Japanese sales have sort of been
dropping a little bit are you guys
worried about that or do you think that
there's going to be a main mainstream
appeal to this device I think we've had
a better focus around the design of Vida
of any device that we've been involved
in and make no mistake this was designed
by gamers for gamers and if you're a
gamer you will get it immediately when
you hold it in your hand and you will
see that we've created tools to create
the ultimate games for gamers if you're
not a gamer then you're may not be able
to get it day one and we'll eventually
ideally get to you but we didn't design
it for the casual consumer that dabbles
with gaming we designed it for the
hardcore gamer and we think we can reach
out to the casual audience but clearly
we designed it with the core gamer in
mind would you say that this is going
after the playstation 3 audience or do
you think it's more of a hardcore gamer
like that broader like xbox wii ps3
audience a bc the the center of the
bullseye is the ps3 owner male
20-something and i think the second
concentric circle out from that is just
core gamer in general but i think the
advantage of having a playstation 3
consumers being the center of the target
is they've already got their trophies
they've already got their friends
they've already got their online ID
they've got the playstation 3 experience
and they're going to appreciate the
cloud saves and picking up a game that
they had just paused on playstation 3
and taken it with them on the vita going
after the ps3 market you sort of outline
some of the things just now that would
make that a little easier you know you
don't have to essentially re-educate
some gamers right but are there are you
guys are already starting to think about
okay how do we appeal to someone who for
instance owns an xbox 360 and wants to
have that full sort of core gaming
experience on the go you don't have that
appeal built-in of being able to say you
can go from your Xbox to your Vita
obviously so is there some way that you
guys might sort of try to tackle that
you know first and foremost we're
targeting gamers and the good news is
there's more gamers and there's ever
been before supposedly there's a billion
consumers worldwide they consider
themselves gamers 163 million in the
United States and those of us been
gaming for a long time know that that
was a much smaller audience back in the
day and now everybody considers himself
somewhat of a gamer and I think that's
good you know that that ultimately gets
people to appreciate that this is
mainstream entertainment and for those
of us who are dedicated to the gaming
industry it says you know you picked the
right business to be and it's bigger
than it's ever been so you mentioned I
phone and tablet gamers earlier you
talked about sort of I guess everybody
sees those those people people who game
just that way or primarily that way is
sort of the biggest broadest audience is
there a way do you think to attract
someone who's used to spending less than
a dollar on a game to a system that
granite has less expensive games but
doesn't have dollar games and really it
sounds seems to live in forty to fifty
or thirty to forty dollar range I think
there's a great opportunity because just
gaming in general intimidated a lot of
people i mean just buttons and control
and how do i make that work and why
would i want to play a game and i think
if you looked five years ago 10 years
ago 20 years ago you you'd find the
majority of people didn't consider
themself gamers and may have never
played a game nowadays you know just
about everybody that you're going to
encounter is either playing currently or
is played at some point in their lives
so it's less intimidating than it's been
before and so once you demystify gaming
and you understand that it's not so hard
to control characters and you realize
the interactive and immersive nature of
gaming as i said i think is it starts to
hook you you find yourself wanting more
and more you want more depth to gaming
you want more control of the characters
and that's where i feel we can really
migrate up people up the food chain and
the great thing with a device like a
playstation vita it doesn't have to be
the fifty-dollar uncharted experience it
can be 99 cent playstation minis which I
think compare very favorably to games
are available on smartphones so that
entire ecosystem is available on the
Vita but it's not limited to those small
form experiences you do have the
opportunity to play you know the full
form games like an uncharted it's
interesting because again we're talking
about this earlier but the idea of
I think over the years with the
introduction of smartphones like the
iphone and android phones you've had
this rise in devices that get people to
make decisions in terms of what they're
willing to accept because of the
convenience so the convenience of having
something in your pocket that you have
to have there because it's a phone but
then we're starting to sort of see this
this turn now where people are going out
and I'm one of those people I went out
and I bought a kindle i can read kindle
books on my iphone but i went out and
bought a kindle because i like that i
like that it was designed and developed
for a book so do you think that you can
sort of convince people like amazon has
convinced people with a kindle that they
need to go out and buy a device that's
made just a game and won't do other
things well you just hit the nail in the
head and you probably know it better
than anybody if you're a gamer then
you're going to gravitate towards a
dedicated gaming device everything has a
core competency and you said it yourself
if it's a smartphone it's a smartphone
that can also gain and if gaming is
number four number five on your priority
list for what you want that device to do
that might be good enough for you but if
you're a gamer you're going to be drawn
to something that's going to give you
the ultimate gaming experience do you
have any way of tracking or have you
tried to sort of look at those people
who are the angry birds game players or
hidden object game players or you know
the two minutes every three or four hour
game players and seeing if they have the
interest in sort of making that jump
over from being super casual gamers to
being what I guess we call net hardcore
gamers I think there's more interest
than there's ever been before I think
back to the launch of PSP in 2005 and
that was a dedicated gaming device
targeted towards gamers but the thought
of getting a housewife or a business man
under the PSP was much more daunting to
me than it is today if some mom is
sitting there playing words with friends
or playing angry birds and she sees a
Vita where she wouldn't even notice it
before you find them looking over to it
going you know what the heck is that and
again people have the ability to see
that the visual effects they see the
graphics they see the depth the game
play in there and they're going to be
drawn to it so i think there's
absolutely that potential just from you
know being able to demystify it and have
people holding a controller in their
hand whether it's a you know a touch
controller on a smartphone or whether
it's a dedicated controller and a
console than ever before so I know we're
running at a time I really want to talk
to you though about the PSP so obviously
this isn't the first portable that you
guys have launched you have seven years
I think experience with PlayStation
Portable and yet the PSP come out you
had four iterations of that and then the
PS go came out what do you think you
learned from that because you mentioned
several times sort of the launch of the
PSP and that came during a time when I
think portable gaming wasn't the
expectation of portable gaming wasn't
the same in many ways in two different
directions you there wasn't the
expectation that you could have this
really light enjoyable experience or
that you could have this really hardcore
experience so what do you think you've
learned from the PSP and applied to the
Vita and also the go I thought was a
really i love the PSP go I felt like it
didn't get the consumer support it
deserved I was a big fan of it so what
did you guys take away from that
experience in coming out with the veto
well tremendous lessons learned there as
i said earlier in the discussion when we
came out with the PSP people saw
dedicated portable devices is more
casual is more youth oriented we ushered
in the older consumer the more console
like experience and we very successfully
sold over 75 million units in that seven
year window that you referred to now
with the PlayStation Vita we have
promise of a lot of the things that we
attempted to do with the original
PlayStation Portable we've got the
technology and the horsepower to be used
in conjunction with ps3 much more than
we did back in the early days of PSP
we've got a true multimedia device
that's really the expectation as opposed
to an ideal expansion of the market as
it was in 2005 but we've got the gaming
in the user interface that we'd always
hoped for the dual analog sticks the
front and back touched the dual cameras
so it's really the console gaming
experience in the pamir
that we hope to bring the consumers and
quite frankly I think we very proudly
did based on 2005 technology but as I
said the gaming universe is bigger than
it's ever been before we've established
the fact that portable gaming isn't just
for casual isn't just for youth that it
can be for the core gamer as well and I
think we're going to reap the benefits
of that with the PlayStation Vita I very
last question i promise i just wanted to
get clarification because it seems like
there's been a little confusion on the
UMD passport program it's coming to
North America not coming to North
America it's not coming to North America
mean that was a program created in Japan
for Japanese consumers and I think if
you follow Sony and you follow
PlayStation in particular you realize
that the platforms are marketed very
differently there at very different
price points with different product
offerings and I think we're proud of the
product offerings we have for the
consumers in the States but that's
different from the product offerings and
the way we mark it to consumers in Japan
so that was a Japan program that I
believe worked really well for them but
we feel we've got a good amount of
offerings and a good value for consumers
it you know with the existing program
that we have all right well thank you
very much for taking the time and love
tonight I think it's going to be be
exciting thanks i'm looking forward to
it
