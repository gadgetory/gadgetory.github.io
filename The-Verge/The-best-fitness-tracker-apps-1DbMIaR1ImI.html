important it is to try to live a healthy
and active life but actually making that
happen every day can feel like a chore
the truth is you don't need a personal
trainer or gym membership if you want to
stay on top of your activity in fact you
don't need a wearable tracker either the
smartphone you already have in your
pocket can help you stay on top of all
your activity goals the best activity
tracking apps just use the motion
detectors built into your phone and they
don't require you to purchase any
additional hardware they also make it
easy to set and monitor goals that work
for you and motivate you along the way
with timely information about your
progress the app that gets all that
right and even goes a few steps farther
is up by Java up can learn from the data
that it collects and give you a nudge
when you're having an off day or a
thumbs up because you're exceeding one
of your goals because a tracker that
requires you to check in all the time
it's too easy to forget the first step
to getting any of these trackers to work
for you is to set up some simple goals
but it's really hard to know where to
start without some extra help
most trackers start everyone out at the
same 10,000 steps per day goal and
expect that you adjust it to find the
right balance instead up cleverly
suggests a good place to start with your
goals by showing you where other people
with the same height weight and age
averaged it's a simple feature but it
goes a long way to ensure that up feels
more like an aid than an annoyance up
can also let you customize how it keeps
track of you during the day you can set
up notifications for when you've taken a
certain number of steps as well as
scheduled progress reports for a more
detailed overview of your day if you're
the competitive type up can use Twitter
and Facebook to find your friends and
compare your week's progress on a
leaderboard even more game-like is a
feature called duals that lets you pick
a friend to go on a head-to-head step
battle with over the course one or many
days keeping tabs on your movement and
exercise during the day can only give
you a partial picture of how you're
treating your body the problem is
logging everything you eat and drink is
a huge pain and often far too
time-consuming to maintain up tries and
mostly succeeds at solving this problem
by making it fast and easy for you to
input the things you eat drink drink
you can use the camera to log many
simple items like an apple or a
peanutbutter sandwich a scanner can
quickly find any prepared food or drink
item with a barcode and a list of
restaurants nearby allows you to add
whatever you've just ordered to your
food log with a few taps if you're using
an iPhone your next best option is
Fitbit like up Fitbit lets you use your
phone in place of a separate hardware
tracker fitbit's notifications and
social features are less robust but it
still does a great job of tracking your
activity weight and food intake on
Android your next best option is google
fit google fit is a more pared down
approach to tracking asking you only to
set up a single goal for daily activity
with this home screen widget you can
quickly check your progress or dive into
the app and see how your day stacks up
against your weekly average if you're
not worried about capturing things like
your food intake or just want a simple
way to start tracking your progress
google fit is a great choice apps like
up fitbit and google fit lets you grow
into the world of fitness and health
tracking get your feet wet with a simple
step goal and then add or subtract other
goals to make these apps work for your
routine they won't track your latest
marathon using GPS or build detailed
graphs of your weightlifting regimen if
you're a hardcore gym rat you probably
want a dedicated wearable tracking
device which all these basic apps also
support but if all you're looking for is
to monitor your step count and daily
activity Jawbone's up app gets the job
done
