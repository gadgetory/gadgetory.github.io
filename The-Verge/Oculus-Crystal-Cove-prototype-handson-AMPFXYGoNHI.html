I saw the oculus rift virtual reality
headset for the first time it was
impressive but there were some obvious
problems you couldn't turn your head
without the world blurring and the low
resolution meant everything looked like
it was behind a screen door at CES 2014
oculus unveiled a new version that's
supposed to bring virtual reality in
line with real reality the new Crystal
Cove prototype isn't perfect but thanks
to a better screen and some new software
techniques looking around actually feels
natural not blurry on a normal display
but pretend is a hypothetical normal
display with but it's perfect it has no
switching time no lag whatsoever you
render an image on the PC you send it to
the screen and then that image stays on
the screen until it gets sent a new
image now the problem with that is that
means that during motion the image is
only correct for a vanishingly small
amount of time then the rest of the
frame it's wrong until it gets a new new
image and so you end up with an image
that's actually wrong most of the time
it's like a broken clock it's right for
very brief moments every once in a while
but the majority of the data that you're
getting from it is garbage and so what
we're doing with our low persistence
prototypes is rendering an image sending
it to the display showing the image on
the display very briefly and then
turning it off and then leaving it black
all the way until the next frame and
then the next frame new image then it
goes off and if you do that at a high
enough frame rate it means that you get
a smooth continuous image that doesn't
have any garbage data in it that's not
the only new thing in Crystal Cove if
you lean forward or sideways your
in-game viewpoint will too thanks to a
camera and sensors that sense where your
head is the wild card of course is games
I was able to get a second look at Eve
Valkyrie a space dog fighting game I
also saw d3 with the rift you can really
see ships moving in your peripheral
vision and you can target missiles with
your eyes but that great is only one of
the few games you can play on the rift
and it's hard to tell what will actually
work oculus says it's rift prototype
still isn't what it wants to ship to
consumers but it's getting a lot closer
it's still just early days of us getting
all of the features worked out we've
shown the HD prototype in the past now
we're showing the Crystal Cove prototype
which has the positional tracking and a
low persistence so each of those big
ticket items that we
wanted to solve for the consumer market
for the consumer product we are solving
one by one we're running out of things
to solve so we're getting very close we
do know that game pads I mean that's
what we're using right now they're not
the end game for VR input their kind of
a hokie left over from what people know
how to use and you can make it work well
in VR like you can make a game that
works well with a gamepad but what we
really want to do is be able to track
the body be able to you know track your
movements and especially your hand
movements in a natural way that is like
real life and I think we'll update get
there of course you won't ever mistake
Crystal coves virtual reality for the
real world but it's at least a lot more
fun to Jack into
