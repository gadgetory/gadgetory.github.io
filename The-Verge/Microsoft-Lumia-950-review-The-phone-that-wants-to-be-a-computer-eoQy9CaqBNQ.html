has had an interesting phone to talk
about but now we have the Lumia 950 s
the first smartphone running Windows 10
the $600 950 is going head-to-head with
the best phones out there and to make it
it's going to need a few tricks up its
sleeve it has one or two but is that
enough but before we get to the
interesting stuff we've got to talk
about first impressions let's face it
this hardware is not particularly
interesting or notable the 950 is a
rectangular plastic slab with no real
defining design characteristics it's
virtually indistinguishable from the
ultra cheap Lumias Microsoft has been
selling for the past couple of years it
has modern smartphone things like a fast
processor and enough RAM and there's a
5.2 inch display that's sharp but a
little washed out it also has a
removable back which is neat if you want
to swap the battery the camera is 20
megapixels and it's fine but slow
basically if this were just another
Android phone it'd be okay but it's not
an Android phone it's Windows 10 and
that's what makes this phone different
the real story here is Windows 10
instead of it running on a laptop it's
running on your phone Microsoft likes to
talk about home Windows 10 is now a
unified platform the same code that runs
on your laptop also runs on this phone
that's true but on the surface Windows
10 on a phone feels a lot like Windows
Phone 8 there are a couple minor
interface updates and slight UI changes
but this isn't a complete overhaul I do
like the new hello feature which lets me
look at my phone to unlock it just like
I can do on a Windows laptop it's kind
of like androids face unlock from four
years ago but it's actually usable
though you have to bring the phone
pretty close to your face to make it
work
but what is new and big and different is
this continuum feature which lets you
turn your little phone into a PC to do
that you need Microsoft $99 display doc
a monitor or TV and a mouse and keyboard
it's admittedly a fair amount of
accessories to tote around and after
using it's not clear to me that this is
any better than just using a laptop you
plug your phone into the dock fire up
the continuum app and boom your phone's
display and contents are on the big
screen it's basically trying to be the
dream of turning your phone into a
full-size computer you could check your
email
browse the web compose Word documents or
send text messages from a full-size
keyboard on a big display you can even
have one thing up on the big screen and
do something else entirely different on
your phone there's something fun about
crushing emails with a mouse and
keyboard and then unplugging my phone
and walking away most of this works fine
but the system really drags its feet
when you fire up the browser
try to navigate to a few sites which are
now full desktop versions but beyond
that you can't do much because the only
apps that really support this feature or
Microsoft's own I can't use slack in
continuum nor can I use Twitter Netflix
or a bunch of other apps I might want to
see in a big screen
let me change and developers might
enable their apps to work with it the
history tells us that they likely won't
so it's not like turning your phone into
a computer
it's like making your phone screen
really huge so you could do more phone
stuff that's admittedly cool but it's
limited and if anything continuum
magnifies which is still the biggest
problem with Windows 10 on phones the
apps that matter just aren't there I
really like managing my email with Gmail
or inbox on an iPhone or Android or pay
for my delicious chick-fil-a launch with
my Apple pay or Android pay and good
luck if you want to use a smart watch or
other wearable the vast majority of them
just won't work here none of that is new
it's been the problem with Windows Phone
for years and it's the reason why so
many people don't even consider it an
option when buying a new phone
Microsoft managed to update the hardware
which trust me was desperately needed
but it still has the same old problems
that have plagued its mobile efforts
forever Lumia 950 maybe a phone to
satisfy the few remaining Windows fans
that want out every device to use but
unfortunately it doesn't do enough to
resurrect Microsoft's mobile efforts</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
