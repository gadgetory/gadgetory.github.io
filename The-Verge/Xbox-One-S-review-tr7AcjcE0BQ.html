little it's cute and it's just a tiny
bit more powerful than the old Xbox the
Xbox one and let's face it the original
Xbox one had some problems but the new
1s scraps basically everything that we
hated about the old Xbox and replaces it
with a 4k blu-ray player all that's
great but should anybody really buy this
thing the Xbox 1s is out now for 399 for
a 2 terabyte model later this month
you'll also be able to buy a one
terabyte model for 349 or a 500 gig
model for $2.99 people play all the same
games and do all the same things as the
old Xbox but what a difference three
years makes the 1s is 40% smaller but
it's actually smaller still because it
doesn't need this insane huge power
brick that the old one needed instead
you just have this single simple chord
the wife still needs a room to breathe
though the grille on top is a fan vent
and there are more on the sides but
whatever it just looks so much better
this robot white color is really nice
and you can also get an optional stand
to mount it vertically it comes with a 2
gigabyte model but you got to pay 20
bucks extra to get it for the cheaper
versions now there are some other
differences besides the looks so let's
go through them really quick first up is
the controller it's white and it now
supports Bluetooth so it has a longer
range and it's easier to pair with a PC
if you want to use it there and it also
has a 3.5 millimeter headset jack for
your headphones second the Xbox 1's
supports 4k video streaming 4k blu-rays
and high dynamic range now I wasn't
actually able to test the HDR because my
TV doesn't support HDR 10 yet so if you
really care about that you should check
to make sure that your TV is compatible
with HDR 10 because it's the only thing
that the Xbox one has supports I did
watch some 4k blu-rays and streams and
4k Netflix and the difference is
noticeable but I don't know if it's
enough to convince anybody that has a
current Xbox to upgrade the other thing
I should note is even though it supports
4k video it doesn't support 4k video
games that's not coming until next year
with the next Xbox 3rd and I don't want
to make a big deal out of this but
xbox1 s is just a little bit more
powerful than the original Xbox one
microsoft says that some games won't
have to drop the resolution in order to
keep up their framerate but I didn't
notice a huge performance difference
when I was testing it and in Mirror's
Edge for example where I died all the
time
load times were about the same lastly
there's no Kinect if you have a Kinect
and want to use it you have to use this
ridiculous adapter which requires its
own power cord and I wasn't able to test
it it's basically a sign that Microsoft
is admitting that it doesn't care about
Kinect and nobody uses it and I kind of
agreed and really that's what I mean
when I say that the Xbox one s scraps
everything that we hated about the
original Xbox one you can still use it
as the white-hot center of your
entertainment system but you don't have
to even if there is an IR blaster on it
but it doesn't feel like Microsoft is
trying to force you into it anymore
instead you can just do what the Xbox is
good at play games and watch movies the
new interface on the Xbox one s is the
same as the one that's rolling out on
the traditional Xbox is with the summer
update it's designed to make it easier
to get to games and movies and it also
adds Cortana and background music so you
can say hey Cortana into a headset and
ask your Xbox to do stuff and then it
does that stuff so I have to admit I
really like the Xbox one s but every
time I think about it it puts me in this
weird logic loop let me explain one if
you already have an Xbox I don't think
that there's enough here to justify an
upgrade really you should just hang on
to your big old black box too don't
forget
Microsoft already announced its
releasing another Xbox next year it's
called Project Scorpio and it's going to
support 4k games and virtual reality if
you waited this long to buy an xbox why
not wait another year and the third
thing to think about is the reason you
buy any console it's the games think
about how much you love halo or forts ax
or Gears of War if the answer is you
love them a lot chances are you've
already bought an Xbox one which takes
us right back to step one in the logic
loop there's really only one thing that
breaks this logic loop in addition to
being a really good-looking console
it also supports that 4k video and for
okay blu-rays and if you've been looking
for a cheap 4k blu-ray player the Xbox
one s could be it but I don't know that
enough people care that much about 4k
blu-rays to make this thing worth
purchase but hey at least it finally
looks good next to my TV I wasn't able
at limited second the Xbox one s
supports HDR yeah HDR second second</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
