visual effects movie specials how they
made the rancor monster or how that
water tentacle knee of this worked
that's the stuff that I wanted to know
about and most of the time the company
behind it was Industrial Light and Magic
now that same company they're getting
into virtual reality they're getting
into augmented reality and interactive
experiences and the group is called ILM
xlab the goal is to create a sort of
digital Disneyland an interconnected
world of experiences that let people
immerse themselves in their favorite
stories to ever degree they want
so this this lets the mocap system sort
of see where you're on space and make
this view custom to your location so the
character that you're seeing holy
ha don't-don't-don't I'm sorry to
campaigning at the dinosaur what were
you saying
I'll MX lab came out of a collaboration
between three companies really its
Lucasfilm story group and ILM for the
visuals and Skywalker Sound for the
sound and all of us works boring on top
of the advanced development groups
technology the area VR and AR and
immersive technologies like these so so
basically right now what I'm seeing is a
dinosaur right here like at my hand
basically like you know resting at the
chin on my hand right now in the
three-dimensional space it's pretty what
you're seeing actually is Chris over
there performing as as the Raptor and so
he's you know responding to you and his
performance gets translated over to the
Raptors emotion so and all in real-time
so this is nuts yeah because it's ILM
they've got 40 years of visual effects
experience to work with and because it's
Lucasfilm they've got some pretty big
movies to play with you know the ones we
have different experiments that we're
running right now to see which ones are
going to be the most successful but the
amazing opportunity here is to work with
the filmmakers and the production art
department and all of creators of both
the standalone films anthology films and
the episode you know seven eight nine
films those are all those creators
actually work right here in the building
and spend time here working hand in hand
with us so we have the opportunity to
show them the latest technology show
them the latest experiments in terms of
storytelling and riff off of each other
try the next generation of things to to
see you know what is successful what
what isn't and what what do people want
to experience see feel shorter than I
thought he was gonna be ah just what
everyone says this is another kind of
toy sort of related to some of our
experiments with doing you know set
design stuff so you can go and do sort
of like virtual kind of building block
yes certain things you just rough layout
I might have to imagine the implications
here for I mean funneling back through -
ILM like if a filmmaker wants to tour a
virtual set before they shoot in it or
even like change things have the DP come
in it's got to be edible opportunity
yeah and that's actually one of the main
sort of real-world applications that we
use for this now one of the tools we
created for Gareth on his film was to
help him pre visualize some of his sets
he's talking about Gareth Edwards who's
directing Star Wars rogue one and he was
looking at one of the sets through a
virtual reality headset like the oculus
rift he was in virtual reality for the
first time and this was a very rough set
it wasn't a high degree of finish or
anything and he was in there exploring
and a couple minutes in he said this
looks way better in real life so I
leaned over to Doug Chang who's a
production designer I said Doug can you
built this yet is he talking about real
life or is he talking about he's like no
he's talking about the VR headset oh and
when when he you know two minutes into
having the headset on referred to it as
real life I was like okay we're onto
something here
it's fun yeah now can we have the
Velociraptor hangout with the Threepio
in our to take about five minutes to do
that are you you know my whole career
has been about creative development has
been about designing moments and
perspectives upon moments and things
like this by things like this
he means things like this
if you saw Speed Racer you saw John's
work pioneering a hacker stylized visual
aesthetic depth photo anime and then
this scene from The Matrix Reloaded use
a technique called volumetric
cinematography also pioneered by John
know yeah all the time
that was John to the actual experience
of the matrix itself started expanding
my my thought on the very topic that the
movie was about so you know I joined
that effort with the Wachowskis partly
because I thought it was so well written
how they sort of considered virtual
reality completely sublime and in the
perfect state it's it's flawless it's a
flawless simulation you know our
approach is as each film went on and
then the years after was to really
trying to make it in the city in the
same sort of way that it might actually
be made some day right to try to find
some techniques that were about
capturing reality and then of course it
would end up as cinema you know composed
and all that but yeah that we went deep
into a lot of exploration and a lot of
things fell out of that that you know
are super relevant to to me today and
what we're doing here and a lot of those
friends younger people then have found
their way into some pretty interesting
places you know throughout the community
that we you know we are watching right
now for a while he left film to start
his own company and focus strictly on AR
and VR that's him there covered an
augmented reality tank coop and if it
seems like John is trying to build a
matrix for real that's because John is
kind of trying to build the matrix for
real to quote his LinkedIn page I'm
trying to design and enable platforms
that lead to the matrix
- machine dominance so that's reassuring
and he's the kind of guy that really
might pull it off just listen to him
talk about the future of filmmaking and
this behind-the-scenes featurette from
1999
saw baby steps towards something much
larger that won't be really commonplace
for a few years we're talking about
cameras that are now broken from the
subject matter that are virtual 15 years
later so this is a virtual camera it's
basically a window into the world so as
a director you can see what's going on
in your peripheral vision as you're
framing up on something you can sort of
pan over to action that's happening
off-camera without having to rehearse it
because you just see it X Labs is also
making stuff that you might actually get
to play with soon so all this is
actually generated in real time from the
cloud and it's streamed to this iPad on
my hand and that less it's deliver a
level fidelity that's way beyond what
this tablet could do approaches movies
or TV but at a touch of a button we can
let the user take the cinematic borders
away and everything is fully interactive
we think experimenting a lot with story
experimenting a lot with how we get
people to relate you know what what is
their persona in this environment that
is our focus is if we can if we can
solve those creative problems or at
least make progress against those
challenges then I think the demand and
the audience will find a way to
experience our stories and at the moment
time is frozen so if we use a slide over
here we can start to add time back and
now we'll we can actually watch the
whole section unfold while still having
full control of the camera as well as
camera control we let you interact with
environment and characters so if you tap
a stormtrooper
we'll go into an orbit around this
character and we could actually follow
him through the whole piece and see
everything that he sees quite literally
we can jump into his perspective and now
everything would play out with us here
we have this prototype device in the
back there's a depth sensor it's kind of
like Kinect it's actually the same type
of sensor because we have depth we can
actually let you walk into the scene
mehran Bjorn cameraman until you run
into a wall we do think that people want
to go further right they want to get
deeper so we you know revisit a gate in
the movie and observe our story
sculpture you know it's like a work of
art it's like a sculpture this next
question is for film nerds only so I'm
seeing here down here it says that it's
running about 24 frames a second why
that versus thirty or six so as you know
yo cinema is 24 frames a second if I we
start we actually physically model the
properties of the camera so when you run
it at 24 you get just the right amount
of motion blur that gives you that
cinematic feel and when we had that we
did a lot of a be testing with people
internally like in which one you prefer
and overwhelmingly everybody thought
that 24 was more cinematic the whole
experience is just under two minutes you
can re-experience that an infinite
number of times an infinite number of
ways anything that you may see should be
things you're allowed to experience
right not necessarily you know I mean
I'm sure there are versions of this that
involve gaming in competition but really
what I'm talking about is kind of being
in the shoes of a character like a
character you saw in the story for
instance I could be watching the speeder
bike scene and return to the Jedi hit a
button and then suddenly oh whoa I'm
like on a speeder bike
there's buttons here and there's weird
dials here I put in your hand and so
that's your speed control slow dad and
lean sideways yeah you it's like a
motorbike so I'm king of me leaning it
turns it got the phone this is fun this
was very much like a skunkworks project
like we were building this other
experience and in the hours after work
kind of I decided let's just focus up to
the oculus and see what works and like
the cinematic cuts for example that
you've seen we still need to figure out
what the real cinematic language needs
to be like
when shook you cut to the uppercut
there's a lot of like new hundred years
of cinema learning that needs to be
relearned in this medium he brings up an
interesting point it took us a really
long time to develop the ideas of what
would make cinema work early on people
thought you had to show scenes in their
entirety before they realize you could
compress time with cuts and evoke
emotion through the juxtaposition of
different imagery this is called montage
and also create moods with lighting and
framing and a million other things that
we don't even think about anymore like
you inherently know if I use a
transition like this now this is kind of
a cheesy low-budget video understanding
of film vocabulary is so advanced now
you can watch a heavily edited it seemed
like this with no problem but 120 years
ago people were just excited to see
moving pictures in fact according to
legend people saw this train headed
straight towards them and jumped right
out of their seats sound familiar
human beings in general are comfortable
with passive media story to storytelling
in general right it's been with us
forever and if you want to draw the
masses and you have to do it in the most
you know you have to baby step them
deeper and deeper into you know what
will become you know some pretty
sophisticated
types of engagement okay yeah this
concludes the VR portion
at the heart of it of course you know is
the story group and I'm lucky insofar as
I work with them directly the story
group is kind of like lucasfilm's
creative brain trust it's the team
responsible for shaping and shepherding
every piece of Star Wars content out
there so they're all part of the same
big story
no matter what the medium that goes for
new movies TV video games the VR
experiences and any future form of
entertainment not yet discovered real
transmedia stuff that we've never been
able to do before because in the past
we've had one camp that was making the
films and another camp that was doing
the publishing and the licensing in the
published fiction so now by putting them
together we're able to be a lot more
coherent a lot more cohesive a lot more
connected and our stories going forward
that's the kind of future xlab is
envisioning one with interconnected
experiences that go from films to VR to
your tablet and back where movies are
shot on virtual locations that you can
then go visit with your friends and hang
out in and because it's all happening
under one roof it's part of the same
giant interactive Star Wars story we'll
see how far you know far we can get but
I think that's the new model deep media
highly connected smashed silo structures
you know and all tapped and hubbed off
of the origin creators you need to be
close to that to understand how you can
get emotion so it's the it's the X
Factor around here
you know if AR ends up being huge and VR
ends up being medium-sized that works
out just fine for us we've got lots of
plays in both you know if even if we
were to only leverage this technology
for the filmmakers to be immersed in
their environments that's really useful
too so they could just stay behind the
scenes and that would work out fine but
the team at X Lab clearly had bigger
plans and they're taking their
inspiration from somewhere that should
seem obvious we really really like
working with the Imagineers because they
are aiming Walt Disney you know is the
godfather of experience UX and all the
parks in a way are the first prototype
for immersive entertainment and so
there's some real foundational stuff
there and their method you know this is
exactly the same program modernized
this is like a 2.0 supercharged version
of the same philosophy once the
destination is built you can wander
around in it you can be social in it you
can do other things you can play in it
you know the Metaverse will begin like
one one room at a time and what you put
in the room and what people do in the
room you know can be the beginning of
many things right it's just like in the
crafting of what this room is going to
be about so I'm hoping and assuming
right that people are going to create
brilliant rooms right where there'll be
interactions and it could be like you
know just hanging out with my friends
but you know folks will be more creative
than that they'll create mechanics that
you know make people interact in new
ways I mean like I'm not sure if you've
tried any other social vr stuff but it's
pretty unique to be all in a common
virtual space together and you're all
over the world right but you are
together this is one of those virtual
spaces he's talking about
that's John it's it feels very
interesting you quickly you quickly
forget that you're talking to someone
who is on the other side of the planet
you know you're just like they're a lot
of a lot of kids already really pretty
much live a life adorned as an avatar
already right so let's show up
let them go nuts</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
