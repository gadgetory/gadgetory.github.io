pocket operator 14 from teenage
engineering it's a tiny cheap base so
nathan wrote about this on a site awhile
ago it's just a tiny cheap bass synth
this one I think everything together
with shipping it was like 80 bucks so I
just bought it they didn't send me this
or anything and I've been playing around
with it for a couple weeks it's probably
my favorite object that I own right now
you only get sort of 16 and change
buttons I guess 23 buttons and that
determines kind of everything you're
gonna do with all the melodies are
programmed in in advance so you can play
it like a traditional instrument but
it's really you're sort of not supposed
to the way it works is you program the
melodies in hit a button and you turn
this knob and it says okay do I want
that to be a C or do I want to be a D
and you sort of turn the knob which is
really awkward and kind of takes a while
but the plus side is once you have
programmed in it'll just play over and
over again and you can sort of worry
about other things so right now I've got
it programmed to play the bass line from
Billie Jean so this is what it looks
like when it's working you know I've
done all the grunt work of programming
it in uh you know you can see what
that's like I'll just put in right mode
and if I want to change this note to
something much higher I just turn the
style so now it's an octave higher than
what's before you see it's not really a
satisfying way to you know change the
notes you have to sort of have in mind
in advance what you want but the effects
are much more immediate so if I want to
add distortion in that same note I can
just
I'll be where I'll be always and see the
baseline starts to change but it's
better because it's well anyway it's
different because its effect what's
changing is that I'm punching and
effects or punching them there's this
submarine visualization in front of
everything so each torpedo that's
getting shot out is a beat and the
different machines are different effects
so he's running between the different
machines to sort of put in the effects
that I've already punched in I have no
idea what is going on so the result is
when you're playing it mostly what
you're doing is you're punching in
effects which is a very different way to
think about music and sort of
performance and it's a way it has a lot
more to do with how popular music works
right now when you hear a particularly
sort of rousing or affecting part of a
pop song it's generally because some new
instruments coming in they're putting in
some effect you know a bass drop that's
that's what a bass drop is that's sort
of hard to do in software I mean that's
generally how people do it but it's very
difficult to get that sense of a
performance generally you're sort of
arranging these effects in advance you
have to sort of know what you're going
for before you do it
whereas you know having a little guy
like this lets you really get into it
and feel it in a sort of much more
visceral way so I don't know I like it
and I've had a lot of fun with</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
