when I was in college it always tastes a
little bit different I wanted to make it
always tastes good and so I developed
this system where I could see the number
of variables that actually mattered to
coffee and then when I was out looking
for a coffee machine that could control
these variables independently because if
you're gonna be scientific about
something you have to independent
control of your variables I couldn't
find anything and so I decided to make
my own we run a Fiat proportional
integral derivative feedback control on
our brew chamber unit so it's basically
a fancy way of saying that we measure
the temperature of the coffee while it
brews and we use heating elements to
correct that temperature to be whatever
it is that you've set it to be so we can
control temperature to be perfectly flat
line we can do various temperature
profiles as well for a net dynamic
control of temperature this is the first
machine really capable of doing what it
does and so we're just now discovering
what happens to coffee when you have
this level of controllers a temperature
is extremely important for extracting
the proper flavor from coffee every
machine will be connected to the
internet so you can download the perfect
brew recipe through our cloud service
we're having a web application that
we're writing right now so you can
access your machine through our web app
and for example if you were to use it on
an iPad or a computer it would give you
very in-depth control over what you can
do with your with your coffee brewing so
you can craft your temperature profiling
or your your durations or ratios of
coffee to water right there on our web
application and then load it to your
machine so this is our dev 2 prototype
it functions similarly to our final
product that's going to be delivered in
the spring but looks quite different so
we have a user interface here with a
knob that you twist to make a selection
and click to confirm and you can store
preset brew recipes in there 200
Fahrenheit 8 ounces of water and that's
70 second brew duration when I am
pressed to begin get started was taking
that exact 8 ounces of water out of the
reservoir and moving into the boiler
using a water pump once it's inside of
that boiler we're going to run a PID
feedback control on
so there's an Arduino mega
microcontroller over here and that
Arduino mega is what is doing the
processing for this to all all of us to
occur and then there's resistive
electrical heating elements inside of
the boiler itself with the second relay
that does power management to our brew
chamber unit and inside of our brew
chamber unit we have 500 watts of
resistive electrical heating elements
that's enough to boil water directly if
we want to do it it is a lot of power
that also is controlled by the the
Arduino mega in terms of the sort of
larger competition the buns and the you
know the the bigger companies out there
luckily I think we've stayed small
enough so far that that they haven't
spent too much time looking our way I
absolutely want to expand to blow
markets it's my vision to make amazing
coffee available to everyone and so
absolutely I think you know bringing our
prices down as an aspect of that
everybody wants to see what's possible
to see what can taste better and there's
a very large group of people that are
embracing technology as a way to do that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
