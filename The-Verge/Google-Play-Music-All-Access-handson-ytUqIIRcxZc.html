birch we're looking at Google Play Music
all access which is an upgrade to Google
music that was announced today at Google
i/o it's a web and Android app that
allows you to play music that you've
uploaded to the cloud or music that at
Google owns you have unlimited access to
all streaming music if you go into the
web app here we have listen now which is
recommended songs and albums that you
could play in my library which would
have music that you've uploaded as well
as any other songs or albums or artists
that you've pinned that you wanted to
have as part of your collection Google
is also offering a radio service which
is sort of like Pandora where you can it
makes an automatic playlist based on the
song or an artist and you can thumbs up
or thumbs down and skip unlimited
because you're paying every month the
service is also available on Android and
the app is very very similar to how it
is on the web which is a good thing it's
seen a complete upgrade from what we had
before on Google music what you can do
here is you can go into any artist that
you have and you know obviously you can
play whatever you want just like Spotify
even if you own the music you can also
download songs if you go here you can
just pin a song and say you want to
download down on Wi-Fi but we also have
radio on here obviously what we really
like about the Android app is they're
integrating all the music that you own
in the cloud that you've uploaded using
music manager and all the music that
you're renting so to speak from the
service the app is quite smooth and if
we're going to compare it to Spotify or
do we'd say that the service is looking
pretty good
the one concern we have is that the
ecosystem is not particularly great you
only have Android and web you can't use
like a stone of sort of Roku of course
iOS and Windows Phone are not supported
the Google Play Music all access is
available now for $9.99 per month and
you can get a 30-day free trial if you
want try it now
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
