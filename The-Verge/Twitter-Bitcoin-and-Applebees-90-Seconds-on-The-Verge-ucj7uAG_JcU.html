Scheffer and if you'd like to hire me
for your next corporate event
or Bar Mitzvah I will accept no less
than point zero eight two bitcoins this
is 90 seconds on the verge twitter has
named Marjorie Scardino as the first
female member of its board previously
Scardino spent 15 years as CEO of
Pearson one of the largest multinational
book publishers in the world this move
addresses growing accusations of sexism
regarding Twitter's leadership as of
this time Scardino is still waiting for
her account to be verified China will
not be welcoming Bitcoin into its banks
Chinese regulators have banned financial
institutions from using the virtual
currency warning that it could be used
for illegal activities and speculation
individuals are still free to use
Bitcoin in China albeit at their own
risk meanwhile Bank of America today
said Bitcoin could become a major means
of payments but for now it is still
plagued by price volatility and
questionable legal status and finally
tired of the whole talking with waiters
and giving them money thing Applebee's
is here to help the restaurant chain is
installing 100,000 presto tablets to its
table and bar areas allowing customers
to order food and pay the bill with as
little human contact as possible these
devices are going out to 1,800
Applebee's locations in the US by the
end of 2014
this comes as rough news from my grandma
who will no longer be able to complain
about the waiters exposed tattoos and
that's it for today's top stories coming
up tomorrow I test out the latest valve
controller for your ears am i winning</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
