happening around artificial intelligence
and Virtual Assistants these days but
most people know these Virtual
Assistants by their consumer friendly
personas like Apple Siri or Amazon Alexa
Apple Siri was first introduced in 2011
and since then people have either found
her incredibly useful or not so useful
Alexa how old are you I was released
November 6 2014 so compared to Siri
Alexa's a little bit younger both of
these virtual assistants can perform an
amazing amount of tasks you can ask
general interest questions ask for the
news set timers you can even use them to
control your smart lights but they're
also different in a lot of ways and
there's one that I definitely use more
than the other so here's what you need
to know Siri is available on what I call
AI devices most people access there
through their iPhone or their iPad or
even their Apple watch Alexa's not
available on phones you can access her
through this Ecco speaker here or
through the new echo dot speaker which I
don't have with me or through this
Amazon tap speaker Siri is also
available on Apple TV and Alexa's
available on the Amazon fire TV so same
deal so how much do these Virtual
Assistants cost it's a good question in
short the software is free but you still
to pony up for the devices that they're
available on yep exactly and iPhones and
iPads tend to be pretty expensive the
echo speaker here costs one hundred and
seventy nine dollars and the other
products I mentioned cost less than that
the biggest difference between them
really is how they're meant to be used
with the exception of Apple TV Sirius
something you can take on the go with
you she's in your pocket she's in the
car she's on your wrist
whereas Alexa is something that's really
useful in the home and these devices
work when they're connected to a stable
Wi-Fi connection also when you talk to
Siri you have to be pretty close to it
whether it's on the iPhone or whether
it's on the Apple TV remote and
has to be your voice but the echo here
has a crazy array of microphones at the
top of it so you can literally shout to
it from across the room and Alexa will
respond and it could be anybody's voice
so what can these virtual assistants do
well if you ask Siri to make a phone
call or send a text message in your
behalf she can do that
Alexa can't really do that unless you're
using a specific Wi-Fi calling app but
on the flipside if you ask Siri what
today's top news is she can't read the
news aloud to you she just shows you a
bunch of links she can do better than
that Alexa what's today's top news
here's your flash briefing in NPR news
from tuning Alexa liza stop okay I have
to hand it to you that's that's pretty
impressive but Siri can give you
directions when you're in the car based
on what your location is at that moment
Alexa can give you travel estimates
based on current traffic conditions but
you do have to go into the Alexa mobile
app and enter in your current location
now when it comes to interacting with
apps these work differently Siri can
play music for you through Apple music
and she can control your smart lights
for you provided that the smart lights
work with apple's homekit framework but
when you start to ask serious stuff like
call me an uber or play a spotify
playlist
she kind of stops just short of doing it
Alexa works differently with a lot of
third-party apps so you can for example
ask Alexa to call you an uber or play a
specific Spotify playlist and she'll do
that for you also when you ask Siri to
add something to your shopping list
she just add something to your shopping
list she doesn't go and buy it for you
not surprisingly Alexa takes it a step
further so you can say to Alexa
reorder garbage bags and provided that
you purchase them before she'll just
reorder them for you through Amazon okay
so one cool thing that Siri can do now
is you can answer your questions about
Game of Thrones like is Jon Snow dead
I don't know I just hope someone is
setting up doggy daycare for ghosts
I don't watch game of friends you can
also ask Siri and Alexis silly questions
like who is Tim Cook or who's Jeff Bezos
or will you marry me or tell me a joke
and that's all good and fun but for the
companies who make these virtual
assistants they're taking this AI stuff
pretty seriously so which one of these
is better well let's stop to say mostly
because they're so different like I said
earlier Siri is great for on-the-go and
Alexa is great in your house but at the
same time Amazon is trying to make Alexa
a little bit more accessible on the go
and Apple is trying to make Siri
accessible in the house so generally
speaking it's still pretty early days
for these virtual assistants I happen to
love Alexa and I definitely use Alexa a
lot more than I use Siri but Alexis
still isn't super useful to me outside
of the home at least not yet
if you happen to use Siri or Alexa a lot
you have some tips or tricks you'd like
to share leave them in the comments
