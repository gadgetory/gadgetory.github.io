we're at South by Southwest 2013
Google's playground okay so I'm here
with Kate Packer she's part of the
talking shoe teams that rise are talking
to you actually I'm calling a talking
shoe yeah exactly
what guys since what do we have in here
so inner we have a pressure sensor and
accelerometer and a gyroscope got it and
this is just like it's just for telling
steps when you sit down and you stand up
yeah so can tell when you stand with
when you're sitting down and when you're
walking or running how fast you're going
if you jump up and down it can tell that
and then it can give you feedback and
its own sarcastic little way is this
running Android um so the way it works
is it actually connects to bluetooth
which can connect to Android or can
connect your computer so right now is
connect to a server it's actually
tracking all my terrible steps so inside
it's connected to computer that is like
taking that data and then translating it
into that fun stuff you see up on screen
so theoretically I could have a phone
that's kind of a dick to me and all this
transfer from there well so actually we
have a pair of shoes that connects to
the phone and then it shows what it was
saying on app and then you could share
it to the web if you want it okay thank
you so much</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
