creation humanity to make more sense of
the world people were asking was it too
soon that satire go too far most kids
inside of a household you get a book
like see spot run I didn't get that book
i got this is apartheid this cute chubby
as helpful as possible it's not all
about taking it's about giving as well
so we have the opportunity for new
stories you have the opportunity for new
ways to engage there is something
happening here when you marry the
creativity and potential of the tools
with the story swing it around the world
and move that ball of freedom forward
that's what we're about here so bear
tunde thank you so much for speaking
with us ha who is there to nicoles
genesis are you kidding me here it's the
first question do I have to answer the
third person yeah you have to the whole
interview yeah I'm sorry does Berra
tunde have to answer yeah Nathan refer
that all right Nathan better tunde I am
i embarrassing day I'm a human being all
born to a human mother in the United
States of America and yeah I'm a writer
I'm in a creative expressive person I
use a lot of tools to do that I love
comedy I love politics I love exploring
the intersection of those especially
with technology and I'm a traveler I
like hopping around the planet
relatively freely and uh yeah that's who
I am I'm someone who likes to try to use
humor to make points or to bring people
together or as a catalyst of some kind
so often it means it's me talking
sometimes through like the company I
helped set up it means bringing other
people together to express themselves
and that's cultivated wet yes tell us
about cultivated wit cultivated wit is
an organization a new york-based LLC
that was founded by me and two other
former employees of the onion we all
left roughly a year ago summer of two
thousand twelve to extend the mission a
little bit love the onion was time to
try something new but still grounded in
humor and so the idea is to use humor
creatively with technology to make the
world better better content so we do
original programming that our marketing
so we act as an agency using humor to
power marketing campaigns and ad
campaigns better products so we put on
hackathons that are comedic Lee grounded
to make hilarious products and we have
some products and development on our own
and I saw you have one coming up but
next month yeah we're doing this is our
third comedy hack day it's happening at
the MIT Media Lab September 21 and 22
it's going to be amazing that we've done
we did one in New York almost a year ago
September 2012 we did one in san
francisco at Twitter's headquarters in
april 2013 and this will be number three
which should be the most perfect what
kind of apps have have come out of this
beautiful things that the world needs
like shout roulette which lets you find
people you disagree with on the internet
and open up a video channel between you
for the purpose of yelling at one
another in real-time possibly HD
depending on your camera and we need
yelling in high def so that's very good
there was also citation needed which one
the San Francisco around a group of
Stanford students made it possible to
lie to your friends with ease you've
ever been in an argument with someone
and you're not sure you have the facts
on your side you can ensure it with this
app which allows you to insert your
chosen fact into a copy of the Wikipedia
page in question so if you claim like Oh
Miley Cyrus is actually 40 years old and
I've been using sort of a human growth
hormone to maintain her youthful
insanity you could add that to a
facsimile of her Wikipedia page through
a mobile web app and show it to your
friends seconds after uttering that
falsehood do you know where this happens
now since yeah you can play with it as
that citation needed that CO and then
most interestingly actually or at least
as interesting as an app wasn't an
overall winner but it's a purchasable in
the App Store it's an iPad app designed
for people who have kids or access to
kids you're like reading two young
children a lot in the to the four year
range of age you don't really know what
you're talking about they just demand
that you read to them so parents are
often stuck reading nonsense to their
kids about a tank or a dinosaur or a
princess same story night after
night what if you could read the news
you want as the founder says news
written for adults by adults so you
choose from mashery powered api into USA
Today or some other news source the
stories you want to read then you pick a
skin a design motif of a children's book
an original children's book and it
merges the two so you have an article
about the eurozone crisis looking like
it's a story about a cute little monkey
dangling from a tree and that's not
where else yeah it's literally a win win
win win I think it's a four-way win
because the parent gets real information
a child gets placated but then a child
gets educated about the eurozone crisis
and then you're also powering a tech
economy its innovation so um how long
have you been doing comedy I've been
doing it uh through amplified
microphones since 2002 prior to that in
writing roughly 1996 my freshman year of
college I started a satirical email
newsletter and that's when i first got
serious about trying to be funny do you
feel like since then humor has become a
bigger part of of news or I guess The
Daily Show on The Colbert Report
obviously huge the onion far with the
Daily Show it's it's on comedy central
comedy central okay I'll it up you got
it yeah um anyway do you feel that
comedy is an important part of news is
it a great way to make a point I think
comedy is an important special power
that is often deployed for good purposes
sometimes that is to relieve people of
their pain sometimes it is to remind
them or teach them something that they
may not want to learn sometimes it is to
inform them about things they may not
know about so in the context of news I
think comedy is really important I think
not necessarily as a primary delivery
device for news but certainly as a way
of set in the context of what's BS and
what is it and you will often find that
people are willing to listen to a
comedian where they wouldn't listen to a
professional news delivery person or a
preacher or professor certainly a
politician so
there's a level of trust that comes with
an authentic comedic voice that you see
and strong examples like colbert and the
daily show through text and even in
college humor and the onion through
overseas outlets through fake twitter
accounts we got a yearning for someone
to be honest with us and there's fewer
people in society more prepared to be
honest than a good comic now so you when
did you start at the onion 2007 2017 you
started in college writings caracal new
yeah got to the onion yeah what did you
do what did you bring to the onion mmm a
bicycle I wrote it in those days and
some granola bars what really super erbe
organic type yeah this quinoa based
nonsense I was hired initially as a
politics editor they were looking for
someone to orchestrate the two thousand
eight election coverage under the banner
war for the White House Onion News
Network web video had just been launched
a few months prior to my arrival that
was Onion News Radio on a podcast format
that was the print paper and the website
and social media hadn't actually yet we
had a myspace page back then to post
links to videos and links to articles
who is in your top eight Tom and then
Tom's friends okay mostly and I think
maybe general Assad probably he's a
different guy back then it was a
different time yeah stop a koala yeah
yeah he's really fallen today so my
overall job was kind of coordinated to
integrate all this coverage to come up
with new types of digital comedy that we
could do do you have a favorite onion
headline man I do and it's no one else's
favorite go ahead but it's uh is really
simple was a magazine cover I think
mocking the new york times mag is sunday
magazine and it says enough is it enough
it's a question mark is very deep it's
great seemingly deep yeah headline but
it captures so much of you know our
quests for meaning but also like the BS
layer and like super serious media you
know headline treatment I really and I
like the simplicity of it yeah
now the onion is clearly evolved from
just like a newspaper to go online and
then you brought the onion to Twitter
sorry about that do it if you've made it
actually what was being a lot Twitter
yeah it's a new--it's a platform for
anybody but comedians can use it now
yeah to do you think it's to work out
material is it a new stage yeah
everything's a stage someone great once
said all the world's a stage he's dead
now but he was right that is right and I
think Twitter being a part of the world
is true for that the biggest realization
I had consciously at the onion I think I
realized it even in my own work
passively but everything is a
performance venue your e-mail newsletter
your 404 error page the apps that you
release the Terms of Service wherever
you have an opportunity to communicate
you have an opportunity to be you that's
true for individuals for corporations
for nonprofits for editorial outlets
like the onion or you know the verge so
I think with that our social media
evolution at the onion went from one
that was explicitly simple and
promotional read this article come back
to our real estate and spend time on
site to power that metric so hey we can
play out narratives and scenarios on
this other platform for comedians it's a
lot of different things it's a public
notebook it is an open mic it is a way
to connect with potential fans and
collaborators like meet other comics
like you and start mutually mutually
following people including idols you
know folks you've always looked up to
and there's judgment you know that comes
with being on Twitter there's there's
the release of your material before it's
really ready you know the idea of speed
over quality and maturation I something
to Twitter doesn't really respect
twitter is all about the instant zing
the splash that going for maximum faves
and retweets and that's a little
different from trying to cultivate a
voice over a period of time and really
hone your craft is there like shame
associated with comedy now because of
things like Twitter possibly just like
people are going to throw in zingers out
there but for those who do take it
seriously I think it pushes the envelope
when
Bush left office there were a lot of I
think really dumb questions will comedy
exists now that this guy's not president
anymore it's like don't be an idiot but
a lot of people were idiotic a lot of
very profound news outlets asked the
same question that everyone can you make
fun of the president if his name is not
george w bush he hasn't spent a lot of
time on vacation clearing brush
obviously you can but it does raise the
bar I think Twitter does a similar thing
I think all these outlets was give
everyone microphones step up the game
for those who really want to wield them
with some skill you look at patton
oswalt he basically said something he
split his full statement across two
tweets so what tested your attention and
he said something in the first tweet
that set up something ridiculous to be
said in the second tweet and if you just
saw the second one you just lost your
mind because you're like way what I
don't want blacks in my neighborhood but
the setup was something that made that
not about race what about something else
so that's great because it also wasn't
just about him it was about the audience
and where their minds are and who was
willing to do the work to figure out
what he was really trying to say and I
answer is not a lot of people for those
who were willing to do the work you got
an extra reward that's novel that's
interesting that sort of thing interest
me do you think any part of that though
was uh yes it was a creative creative
way to tell a joke on Twitter to test
people's attention you think it all
others any part of it that was just kind
of see what the trolls would say of
course I mean who's begging people yeah
but that's the other here's the problem
with twitter is that it it is an outrage
endorsement engine you can find anything
you think you don't like you can
literally have an all sexist experience
on twitter you can have an all
imperialistic experience on twitter if
you just search enough you can find
something to upset you and often you can
choose to interpret someone's words in
the most negative possible
interpretation regardless of whether or
not that was their intention yeah I have
a little saying that I have been burned
by not following before which is click
before you retweet like before you know
something that looks really interesting
maybe it's someone you think you trust
you look up that's a fun headline
retweet you don't know where that goes
test it first before you inflict that
upon your own community so there's a
responsibility of media literacy that we
all have in the way media is now
changing and I think what Patton did
with that was hold that mirror up to us
to say should we really be mad or is he
really you know messing with us he was
definitely messing wink that's good air
tunde thank you so much for a man
sitting down with that of course</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
