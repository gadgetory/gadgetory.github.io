talk about this today but please stop
the
sorry I promised myself I wasn't gonna
swear today Elizabeth wherever you are
your father didn't mean that I've been
at this business for about 33 years but
I don't have wireless industry
experience and after a while I went home
and I said to myself holy I don't
have wireless industry experience what
am I gonna do and it suddenly dawned on
me there's not a goddamn person in the
world besides a wireless industry person
that would understand why the hell this
mess works this way and the worst fear
of the wireless industry is that
somebody from outside AHS comes in and
starts looking at their industry I've
already told you about the spaceship and
the aliens coming in it doesn't make
sense
unbelievable high prices how the hell
can that cost that much unless you're
gonna drive it I mean come on that nasty
guy on the end that sprint and you you
gotta see that the day you go in that
store they love you it's like you know
oh you got to have this phone we're
gonna be so good to you here's a free
t-shirts and balloons by the way need a
back rub maybe that's just me you who
pay so much for your phones it's
incredible everybody's blogging holy
crap I can't believe you just said that
oh he said that's how I lost the
family pool I bet he'd only swear five
times</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
