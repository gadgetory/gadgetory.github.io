trying out iOS 12 it's supposed to hit
your phones this fall but it's available
in beta for developers right now things
are definitely still subject to change
but there's some cool stuff in here so
let's check it out the first thing I
want to talk about is probably the most
superfluous but also the most fun and
that is MIMO G this is Apple's new
version of an emoji that lets you
customize it to your face so I have
worked on this all morning this is my
best job at making my face I can't say
it's amazing but it works just like the
other ones where you pull it up and it
will start mimicking your face but now
you can customize it there are a ton of
different options it's actually pretty
interesting they don't group things by
gender at all it's just all mixed
together and allows you to create
whatever you want you can even make a
sort of alien-looking thing if you feel
like it so here's my like a punk alien
and what's really neat is if you take a
photo of yourself inside messages you
can overlay it on top of your head so
here's my like punk alien I can have fun
with that so that's me emoji I imagine
you're gonna see these everywhere
starting this fall the second thing I
want to talk about is it really it's fun
but it is a really big deal and that is
screen time this is Apple's answer for
iPhone addiction and then just us using
our phones too much and so as this new
screen inside of the Settings app that
lets you set time limits basically on
how much you use different categories of
apps so when you open up first thing you
see is this chart of how much you're
using your apps and it'll break down by
individual apps but also by categories
so you can see if you're playing games
too much or social media too much but
the really big thing is downtime and app
limits and basically you can go into a
Plymouth's and tell it you know what I
should only be able to play games for an
hour everyday and then once I set that
that's locked in place
it's gonna tell me once I'm playing
games if I've been doing it for too long
and it'll sort of lock you out so let me
show you what that looks like I'm gonna
lock myself out of basically every app
and there we go so now when I jump into
an app its until you've reached your
time limit on the app there's a button
at the bottom that lets you ignore the
limit and just keep using it again so
really this is all about your willpower
but I think it's still a really neat
approach Google is doing something very
similar but the big difference with
Google is that you don't have this
button you have to jump through a lot
more hoops to let yourself back into
your apps so I think it's gonna be
interesting to see which those is more
useful and if people actually take
advantage of them
so the next thing I wanted to show you
is how iOS 12 is changing notifications
and we're gonna have another video
that's going like really in-depth on
this soon so I'm not gonna go too deep
in it but it's actually a really big
deal because this is a lot easier to
read now I have for slack notifications
in total there's only taking up one
thing because they're all grouped and so
I can just tap on it to see them all I
can deal with the ones that I want to
deal with or manage my notifications if
I want to this is just much much neater
than that endless list that we've been
used to for years and years in iOS right
now one of the other new features in iOS
12 is Siri shortcuts which lets you
create custom commands to trigger
actions with Siri it's a really big
feature and I think people are gonna use
it in very different ways but let me
show you how I've been using it so is
this big list that has a bunch of
different available commands you might
want sugar and these actually change
depending on what you've been doing
riesling their phone so I've been using
voice memos and so I was suggesting I
might want to make a command to start a
new voice recording so I'm gonna hit
that and it's gonna ask me what phrase I
want to use to automatically start a new
recording so I'm going to show you that
record this
so now whenever I tell Siri record this
is gonna automatically launch it to
voice memos and immediately start
recording so I'll show you how that
works
record this so now it's immediately
jumped over to voice memos and it's
already recording which is pretty great
because that's actually really fast way
to start recording so now we're on the
iPad because iOS 12 also brings iPhone
10 style gesture control over to the
tablet and it's not a huge change
especially because I also haven't
already had a lot of gestures involved
but there's some key ones so for one
control center is now in the top right
corner and notifications are in the
center or the left or anywhere else the
other big thing is that if you're inside
an app you can now swipe up to go
straight at home and if you want to go
into the multitasking menu it's more of
that bringing it to the middle and hold
kind of thing so if you're switching
between the iPhone 10 iPad basically
this is going to be a little bit more
consistent for you there are a ton of
other new features not all of them are
available just yet we're definitely
gonna have more on iOS 12 as the summer
continues but these are some of the
biggest features you can look forward to
