could be pretty traumatic the first time
you see fireworks it might be scary the
first time you see an r-rated movie
might be too violent for you heck the
first time most Americans saw moving
picture it was of Thomas Edison
electrocuting an elephant well hopefully
today we won't quite be so traumatic you
are seeing us on video for the first
time stay tuned for the verge mobile
show hey I'm dieter bohn I'm glad settle
and i am chris sigler and this is
episode 1 of The Verge mobile show /
episode 30 of the Virgin Mobile podcast
we are here live on video it's a week in
May 28th and we're sponsored by the
samsung galaxy note which is one of the
reasons you're seeing video right now
they're really freaking me out by the
way I got it I got to be honest it's
really specially going to turn off the
stream so I I can't actually see what we
look like because it'll just send my
computer into a tailspin of flash and
doom yeah these are you these MacBook
Airs do not deal with this much activity
very well um well I mean should we just
jump into the news because it's it's
really self-conscious to know that no I
talk no we should talk for at least
another five minutes about uh the the
transition to video actually first of
all we should give a shout out to uh to
Brendan Murphy and clearly Simone
amazing yeah these guys are killing it
on the on the back end right now you
don't even realize what's happening in
New York where this is all being put
together in real time guys are the
unsung heroes in fact they share you
they should just do the podcast we don't
even need to be here in my opinion they
are they're currently sacrificing small
animals in order to make the technology
behind this the stream happen
right now it's very well that's the last
I heard I just want to point out I
shouldn't be bringing this up uh and and
Creighton and especially deed are going
to kill me but we are looking into a
crate and I as a side project we doing a
fast and the furious themed weekly show
called the fast cast where we where we
talk about all things vin diesel paul
walker um and and i don't know when
that's gonna launch but and that's that
isn't really a purge project but but
keep an eye out for that if you're if
you're a Creighton fan anyway who know
we can canoe I'm done with my with my
fast cast promo spot and and now we can
talk galaxy s3 right that's the big news
that is the huge news it's it's out in
Europe but more importantly Vlad has
provided a killer review of it a lab
would you say killers right word I would
say killer i would say amazing also
stunning I'm gonna let you drop the
adjectives um and I agree with you I'm
gonna turn on the stream because it's
completely unnerving first of all seeing
your sales peak second of all seeing the
little lag between when we have our
conversation and it's happening in the
screen yeah hmm so there's about a
couple of seconds so I hear you guys
speaking and then your faces catch up
with the things are here and it's just
somebody on Twitter just asked me if if
my studio is where they used to film
Oprah and the answer is yes I'm actually
and i are both studios in the west loop
in chicago illinois and and yeah i mean
it's a beautiful space Oprah doesn't
need anymore neither does rosie
o'donnell so here I am I do have any way
to a halo of light behind your head
though Chris it's it does look very
studio ish yes are you drinking like
sake or like hot tea or something out of
a bowl what is that uh yes it's hot sake
which if I'm navas de I'm not a sake
expert um but if i'm not mistaken hot
sake is like the lower quality sake um
so yeah i'm drinking low quality sake
while we're are casting pretty soon it
speeds it up to detract from them Oh
take away from the low quality is that
what it is I
I think that's the idea yeah it's um
it's kind of yeah it distracts you from
the crappy flavor of the sake the good
sake is is the chilled stuff I don't
know why were you mad you know can we
please can we please talk about cats are
you drinking on the video and I had to
ask because it's a whole new media
format now and we've got ya a million
more ways that we can get off on
tangents than we did before before
before I could get away with drinking
this uh in silence in peace and quiet
nobody would bother me about it now
people are giving me crap about my about
my sake by the way it's not so good boys
give you crap will give you questions
you're derogating me on my delicious
beverage it's actually an espresso I
just want to point is a dumb guy sitting
Dunkin Donuts coffee no I saw God me
that you bought some dunkin dogs ah come
on man sorry Gavin too I have a
two-pronged colony strategy in my
household I use I use a burr grinder
paired with a sochi russia a water
boiler with a french press for coffee
and then i also evidence an espresso for
when i needed a quick jolt a quick shot
and so that's what i'm doing right now
I'm hoping that I don't fall asleep on
the air and the only way I can do that
is by drinking espresso can we talk
about the galaxy s3 please yes really
wanted to point out two things point out
right here first of all just because of
called the verge mobile show doesn't
mean we're going to be any different
from the verge of a podcast including
the five minutes of Prelude where we do
not talk about my wife owns so we've
kept to that local tradition and the
second thing Miriam who we might know is
tango on Twitter she emailed me and she
had this awesome Type O which i thought
i would share with my coffee loving
friends which was a Tesla roaster
without the d I just thought Chris would
love one of those so it's not a
gasoline-powered roaster it's it's gonna
be a lecture but it's a Testarossa it's
not it's an electric roaster I like it
it's gonna be supremely designed well
probably a rebadge of somebody else's
eye but whatever rights Tesla branded so
galaxies free I think we're done we can
go on to the next topic that way however
pretty
well I think actually uh yeah I mean
like I pretty much the out of the review
with the question how do you review
something I the galaxy s4 you because we
already had a dedicated podcast
specifically to it yeah narrative arc of
the galaxy s3 for us I feel like it was
like crazy build up huge event and we're
like pretty disappointed but then it
started building up again as we actually
started getting time with it building up
to the second huge event the review in
the release and flat yeah okay your
training of me and well and my all
states another peak its second peak when
it's a somewhat surprising one because
samsung's event let let's not make any
bones about a samsung is launched before
Gallas history will just complete train
wreck and a disaster and so much of what
is good about this phone was either
obscured or confused by Samsung's
message the first thing to say is that
there was so much branding at that event
which either made no sense or again
obscured the meaning and the purpose of
the feature underneath it that you just
didn't grasp what Samsung was trying to
convey to you like the company is trying
to oversell features which are handy and
useful but in one of those like much
more limited ways and it's something
that I get is the same vibe that I get
with the Apple hardware I mean yeah very
quickly I'm Sharpie to Apple hardware
but you know if you're not familiar with
the iphone if you're not familiar with
the ipad there is so much exaggeration
going on not from Apple itself but from
other people about how huge the rat they
are and how important they are that when
you come to use them you're under
whelmed they just work and they do a
couple of handy and useful things but
you don't feel like your world is
changed or being flipped upside down you
just gradually end up using them more
and i feel this analogy actually fits
with the gaseous free there's things
like a picture in picture mode which i
believe is only for the video that you
have on the device itself so at this
stage it isn't as useful as something
like
let's say streaming a news channel via
the internet which you can just kind of
stick into a corner you can reposition I
I need to interrupt your life are you
are you actually going to convince me or
try to convince me that picture in
picture is not a completely ridiculous
feature on a phone yeah yeah I am
because I thought about this is ok but
but that's what i was saying right now
it isn't that valuable because you need
to have the video on the phone in order
to do that but I'm somebody who may be
just a weird habit but I like watching
the BBC News Channel I like watching the
live stream of Russia today that
international news channel as well and I
kind of let like the idea of having a
little window that you can reposition
across the screen on your phone while
you're doing other things again it's
limited utility but it's one of those
small things which adds to it but then
Samsung calls it pop up play which is
like haha Amy what does that mean what
does that mean to you if you're not
familiar with the actual feature it
means nothing and they do have skinnies
a little more it means a little more
than smart stay though you have to but
it's what state you just started is the
worst thing ever and actually ever since
Samsung like I actually understood what
they were actually showing with that and
not just like some creepy you know your
phone is watching you your photos
watching you like every time I see my 1x
screen turn off and i'm still using it i
get really angry and I bike the Samsung
has gotten under my skin with that
picture I think I want that exactly and
this is exactly my point it's a subtle
feature it's a neat feature but you
don't have to oversell it the way
Samsung is selling it like the phone is
smart or the spawn is more intelligent
and another false anybody isn't that
intelligent you just use the
front-facing camera you still have the
same screen timeout time is usually do
so 30 seconds a minute two minutes so if
you don't touch the screen the screen
switch itself off but during that time
if you recognize is that your eyes are
on the display without you touching it
obviously you're reading it obviously
you looking at it so it doesn't switch
yourself off so that's all that smart
she does but you give it that silly name
and people don't understand what the
hell it even youths
and you know it that was just two of the
features and it is just a laundry list
of all these additions which are handy
in uh you know most of them are actually
unique so Samsung Samsung gets credit
for that but Samson just kind of berries
and excuse them um over late let me put
you on the spot and I I don't want to
stop talking about the galaxy s3 I want
to continue talking about it at length
bonus um I'm kind of ntldr mode right
now and I just I want to know I have a a
snap of a Snapdragon s4 1x in front of
me and a galaxy s3 upon me which do I
choose and when I'm holding the one that
I would choose is the HTC One X really
yes um I mean again this is there's a
lot to say about the galaxy s free and
there's a lot to praise about it oh but
the HTC One X has this display which you
just can't get away from um as first to
see my galaxy s4 reviews well when
you're using the phone you're probably
method of input and output is a display
so your most important thing in a phone
is the display yeah so if the HTC One X
is the best display in the world which
as far as smartphones are concerned I
think we're all in agreement it does
it's just kind of a no-brainer at the
same time having said that I spent half
of my Saturday this weekend trying to
install a stock android rom on the HTC
One X and it's such a reverse
engineering feat they had before I spent
my weekend reinstalling boot camp on my
old Mac so that I would have a proper
Windows machine because I can't find my
netbook so that I could install a custom
rom on my HTC One X same thing I just
didn't quite get there I think I have
you guys both be I actually a couple
years ago I started this project where I
wanted to make my own digital picture
frame that had some advanced
capabilities and I wrote it in c-sharp
it was this whole thing and it used a
samsung a LCD like a eight eight or ten
inch LCD that had their there's some
display technology that works over USB
is
display what is it called someone may
ask now display lately it it has
displaylink support and so I connected
that to a tiny pc called a fit pc to
which i believe is made by an Israeli
company and they have some orders in us
and so I bought a fit pc to this ad
empowered and has built in Wi-Fi and
everything and literally electrical
taped it to the back of this samsung LCD
and set it up on my on my desk and I
could do a few different cool things
with it so I in the last time I needed
to to route a device I think the last
time that I seriously put a lot of
effort into it was with my g2x the stock
rom on that was just a steaming pile of
garbage and so I I literally connect I
had the g2x connected to this digital
picture frame and I was VN seeing into
it from another machine going through
these these insane steps and like you
know if that there's that they're like
five or six steps where you know if
something goes wrong you're just
completely hosed and so you know there
were so many layers of communication
between you know my machine another room
connected over VNC and the phone itself
that you know if any one of those broke
than the phone was was bricked and
fortunately I didn't break it but i
think i may have to bring that thing
back out to do something with the 1x as
well ok ok that's my annexes yeah never
the point is valid i mean i first of all
stumbled across a bipolar Brian over at
motor co he has a problem with just
standard issue ice cream sammich
four-point-oh for the HTC One X it's
waiting is there you just need to
install it but in order to do that you
need to have root access you need to
have superuser privileges in order to do
that you need to unlock the bootloader
in order to that you need to part of HC
dev which are registered again saturday
i believe it was and I still haven't
heard from HTC so just a whole bunch of
okay I want to be more adventurous with
my phone I won't install some fresh
software okay I'll go the extra step
I'll do this
and then oh hang on a sec there's
another extra step in an oh wait there's
another extra step but now I need to
register now these guys need to let me
know and no he grows exasperating on the
other hand and this is the perfect segue
back to the galaxy s free um the gaseous
free stock software is actually good
yeah yeah yeah I explain this to me it
should be well hang out before we really
want to get to this offer but like we we
started this conversation talking about
the screen and actually before we get
into the software that's a really long
conversation yeah pentile does bother
you does bother you doesn't bother you
now it's as if you thought of wood
what's the story wait definitely the
correct answer is the last one that you
offered that doesn't bother me as much
as that expected it would I mean you
hosting her shots you had a macro shot
that made it look not great right I mean
then that's also part of my job I feel
you know if he spent our you need to dig
it up and you need to show that it's
bent out because right right other
people might care um I'm usually one of
those other people like um I don't make
any apologies about that I am extremely
particular about the spike technologies
for the aforementioned reasons than that
because it really important um but in
the case of the galaxy s three yeses
pensao but then no I don't notice it and
the problems with pens are usually
things like jagged edges you know fine
details looking almost imperceptibly
wrong but then once you see them you
can't unsee them in this case you have
to basically bring the phone right up to
your eyes and stare at it and stare it
really really tiny tiny little details
to be able to pick out the fact that
this penthouse so to me that is not a
relevant issue with the display actually
a more surprising issue is well I don't
know about surprising but a bigger issue
for me is the fact that it has this blue
cast which was seen on whole ton of
AMOLED displays and you know it's just
the wrong color temperature for
everybody displays the displays
definitely better than the Galaxy Nexus
right bar none uh well honestly I don't
have that much experience with the
Galaxy Nexus is there you go green stood
yeah this experience the deed or not
had at ctia and our brief time with the
galaxy s3 was that it was but I
definitely like some more side by side
time with those two devices to be sure
you know sure but you know as much as
anything else maybe if you gave you guys
a nexus to use for a couple of days at
our level absolute the exact same
complaints and even more severely but as
much as anything else I also feel like
amoled isn't as impressive as you has
been a year ago two years ago it's just
kind of stagnated at this level I mean
okay that sounds extremely picky when
you look at the fact that this is an HD
display with 1280 by 720 resolution and
all of that stuff but in fact this is
the strength of AMOLED have not changed
at all a good viewing angles not perfect
the HTC One X is better uh you know
great vibrancy extreme brightness when
you actually haven't turned up to the
maximum and I mean also the galaxy's
freeze very readable in sunlight I steal
again the HTC One X is better in
sunlight so but it's a strong display
just isn't amazing it isn't amazing the
way that IPS lcds are looking on the HTC
One X and you know the potentially what
we can expect from next iPhone so i'm
actually at this point I'm actually the
IPS LCD camp but I feel like that is a
more advanced technology than holla'd at
this stage of proceedings last time I I
feel like if you know there was it was
obvious that amyloid was gonna be the
winner there and then I think that that
technology kind of petered out I think
Samsung push it as far as it possibly
could in a very short period of time and
it's not to say that they're not
continuing to advance but i think that
they kind of hit a brick wall with pixel
density and with you know the black
magic of pentile that allows them to get
around some of the pixel that is the
sort of thing with pent-up you don't
actually have as many sub pixels as with
a regular RGB layout mm-hmm so yes it's
1280 by 720 full-size pixels but because
of the way things are arranged you
actually have fewer sub-pixel so again
the definition is not going to be as
high as a proper 720p display but
also again you kind of knew that with
the Galaxy Nexus a secondary issue is
actually that Samsung seems to be
over-aggressive with the auto-brightness
so the only thing yes go see emily play
uses up a very significant proportion of
the battery which is very generous 2,100
milliamp hours but then you also need it
to the quad-core Exynos processor and
this display its 4.8 inches he's gonna
use a lot of power so Sam some kind of
tries to cheat by having the auto
brightness set at too low I mean
particularly right next to the One X is
just waited only babe Douglas they did
this on the Galaxy Nexus they did this
on the Nexus S III think the GS tues
that I've used have all had auto
brightness settings are way too low and
it's super annoying because you you know
you you turn it off you turn it off
you're constantly futzing with it Apple
does such a better job with auto
brightness because I'm on iOS you can
turn on a brightness on and you can also
adjust the slider so if ya still a
dynamically adjust the auto brightness
but you can say I want auto brightness
all the time but don't go lower than
this because come on I need to look at
the screen come on I don't understand
why Samsung if they're gonna copy stuff
from Apple copy that because that's
that's human centric design if you if
you say that this thing is designed for
humans design out so humans can look at
your screen it's not just that that they
need two sliders they need that one and
they also need a slider for adjusting
the the light sensor sensitivity mmm
that's also true and does the other
thing is that do new brightens jumps
around it isn't gradual so when the
phone senses that light around is
changed it kind of jumps into a you know
a significantly higher brightness or
significantly lower brightness and it's
kind of a prompt you know it isn't
smooth it isn't gradual but honesty I I
do feel like those nitpicks now those
are things you can just kind of get used
to and accept the the overall conclusion
that I drew with the galaxy s3 displays
that if you never see this right next to
the HTC One X you'll be very happy with
the display if you if you do end up
seeing your writings of the One X you'll
be like me UV UV saying okay I know
since four sucks I know
Oh TouchWiz in this iteration iteration
rather is actually pretty good and it's
a tolerable skin and he kind of
justifies the guy who says I gotta have
my ways but all that's being said I just
love this band One X and I can't get
over it you know I will go through the
misery probably this weekend of actually
installing stock Android 4 on the One X
and then I will have a joyous lifetime
you know what's funny to me about the
display on the one axis that I you know
we we talk about this place at length on
this podcast and we have for a very long
time and we talk about him on the site
and and I kind of believed that you know
when you get into the the top 5% of
displays average consumers or you know
just pretty much anyone that isn't us
can't tell the difference and doesn't
care they just know that it's a
high-resolution display when you look at
it dead on it looks fine it looks great
and and that's all there is to it but uh
last week I I had drinks with polygons
chris grant and who is an iphone user
and he specifically i had the 1x in my
hand and he specifically said wow I'm
impressed at the fact that I can see it
when you hold it on the side I can still
see the display and of course the 1x has
just an absolutely insane viewing a it's
basically 180 degrees so that was that
was very unusual and impressive to me
the fact that HTC is is using a display
so good that somebody who isn't attune
to you know looking at 20 different
phone displays on the market every month
is still able to to notice that
difference yeah and doesn't this thing
that I'm also saying as good as good as
history may be in terms of software and
other aspects you can't do anything to
upgrade its display where's with the HTC
One X the display is there and then you
can upgrade the software experience all
right so you know neither of them is
perfect both of them very good and I
would say that it's just down to what
you prioritize you know by in my case
it's i prioritize the hardware to stare
and
I can take care of the software so so
let me ask you something glad um would
you talking about the 1x and going to
stock Android would you insist on the
custom HTC camera Apple are you willing
to go to a stock camera app as well I
can get I can get on without it that's
kind of the camera app is pretty good on
the what acts oh yeah I'm that's what
I'm saying it kind of feels
counterintuitive because it is very good
and the other thing with the 1x is when
you take a picture is so quick but you
you feel like an arrow happen and never
happened right it was is that quick so
not to take away from it but it's it you
know given that it's a trade-off I would
say you know I I like it but I could
live without it great let's let's get
back to the the the the s3 because we're
up to you want to talk about the
software um so how's the camera on the
s3 and how's the camera software on the
s3 well camera software is pretty much
identical to the galaxy s2 software the
only magician the only real dition that
they've included now is this / shot out
which is pretty much like the butcher
out in the HTC One X and so far as you
could take up to 20 photos in quick
succession then you can choose the best
out of them you can choose 1 2 3 7 11 um
however many you want you can save those
you can save all 20 if you like but it's
just the worship of the actual camera
though quality of the camera is the best
in a phone that I've seen yet that's
just my judgment on it like I took a
bunch of photos on the display did a
good most of the time we take photos
with a phone they look good in this play
and then I dropped away from my computer
and I was like well where is the noise
where is the degradation of quality like
most of my gallery photos was actually
from the center of London where there
was just so much going on around you you
know that there are people close to you
away from you there are details there
are buildings this is so much um
and the camera captured all of it it's
so detailed it's amazing to me i can't i
can't honestly compare it to the iphone
4s because i haven't used one of those
for ages but i do feel like it's better
I've usually oppressors yeah the HDR
samples that you that you put up I
thought oh yeah that really was great
I'll be on bed with you the hdmi expose
the pictures look very good but at a
hundred sent crop they didn't look
noticeably sharper to me than the 1x
shots and you know I don't know how are
they the I mean maybe I didn't pick the
best wants to crop out but I mean it's
just it it's a massive difference to me
versus the one ex I mean HTC uh the One
X camera is 8 megapixels as well but the
thing I always say is that it's usable
resolutions probably closed three or
five megapixels or something more
reasonable like that I feel like um the
galaxies freeze the closest phone to
actually giving us an 8 megapixel usable
image coasters phone outside of us hip
nokia n8 it just it just is that good
anything they don't wait right yeah you
don't wait which is on sale yet so god
damn i don't get me started in the 808
this does a camera Chris that's not
really into camera that happens to have
a kind of smartphone sort of it you know
it also by the way doesn't matter at all
until it's using something other than
symbian right pretty much genifique the
other thing i wanted to point out about
the galaxy s3 which annoyed me was the
fact that you can't tap to all get auto
exposure which is something i'm pretty
sure you can do with the HTC phones so
tap to focus would also get you 20 to
expose for that spot um which is really
handy when you have a really sunny day
like i did and maybe you prefer to
expose for the sky or prefer to expose
sort of thing the foreground because
usually the two are mutually exclusive
so if you get the sky right the thing in
the foreground looks to dock you get
full bayan image right this guy looks
just washed out in white again the a GMO
observe said that but i would like to
just tap and get the
also explosion happen that way yeah I'll
tell you what Android good hey Doc I oh
goody remote yeah sorry I go I say
there's software for iphone that lets
you actually separate those two things
out which I find really convenient
sometimes I want to expose on this but
focus on that anyway that's all yes I'm
your date yar mode a good HDR mode makes
such a huge difference for like everyday
usability and if you'd asked me a year
18 months ago I would have said no way
do I want there's software interfering
with my picture taking experience that
much but it makes a huge difference in
what you're able to capture on the
street with a bright Sun in particular
it really does do sue doesn't look as
natural as you would get with just a
straight one shot right you just and
herbal because of what is doing is
compiling multiple images at different
exposures and giving you a composite
image at the end but exactly just say
you can just get so much more detail in
there which actually actually is it is
perfectly reasonable that you would like
a Chris because the opposite of
Instagram another detail you're actually
adding more detail into the picture
still making it unnatural arguably which
is kind of foodies photograph yeah I
don't know why I'm arguing myself with
myself here but but yeah it's it's it's
good the one problem that I've noticed
with it and this makes sense because of
what it's doing like you say is that if
you're taking a picture of fast motion
you get some weirdness some weird
ghosting just because it's you know it's
taking two or three exposures and
compiling them together yeah so Samsung
actually when you turn a GMO Don says to
keep the camera steady has a little
warning message yeah which could bring
me back to the South spider I don't
wanna you know we review the galaxy s3
because I'm aware not everybody is
enthused about a four point eight inch
phone which again it's big you know it's
big um as good it has good economics but
it's a big phone and I'm still keen to
see something like this in the HTC one s
size range like for 4.3 inches I'm sure
somebody will do it and we sell a lot of
phones there's there's a lot
go ahead go ahead now you have it ready
just enough sinkage arable it really is
we're having just enough sync issues so
that like it's impossible to talk over
each other um I shouldn't call them sync
issues it's just like you know it's it
comes part and parcel with the move to
video like I think that you need to
relearn your your dynamic when you're
talking because otherwise you get this
this weird train wreck stuff but uh
anyone was against oh yeah was gonna say
is that I think and we've talked about
this before the fact that that we're
still kind of in this state where
consumers particularly Americans but I
think that they're kind of pushing this
philosophy worldwide believe that there
is a one-to-one Association there's it
there's a linear relationship between
the size of the display and the high
ended pneus yeah phone and and I think
I'm hoping that within a couple years
that philosophy will kind of dissipate
and yeah for 4.5 to 5.3 inch phone start
to become standard place and that no
longer becomes a focus of attention and
they can say okay well now we're gonna
do a four inch or a 4.3 inch and people
won't won't think that that's a crappy
phone yeah no I totally agree but yeah I
do want to wrap up the guest as free as
i was saying the thing with this version
of TouchWiz first of all is called
nature UX again completely useless
pointless intuitive and helpful branding
from Samsung there's pretty much nothing
nature UX see about it they have the
water ripple on the lock screen and
that's pretty much it but it's clean
right the app launcher the app tray is
fully customizable you can arrange it
anywhere you like you can hide icons
it's pretty much transparent so you just
see your home screen wallpaper behind it
there's just no noise and extra junk
around it it reminds me I respect your
mother the air colored either that's
right they got rid of lot of thing ever
to a lot of the the candy color stuff I
mean this is the yeah this is be gone
for a while now but it's it's nice and
subtle they've got you know gradients
that aren't completely overwhelming yeah
yeah yeahs knows it totally I mean most
of it as I say he's just kind of feels
boss and just acceptable again I feel
like ice cream sandwich itself is a more
cohesive a visual experience but there's
very little that you can point to in
this version of TouchWiz and say oh this
is a nightmare this is dragging things
back holding things back the thing that
is going to go hold things back is when
jelly bean turns up and the Galaxy Nexus
gets it a week later and then your
Galaxy S fries like yeah we'll do it in
a month or two them no that's a
beautiful that's a beautiful dream Vlad
remember how long it took the the nexus
one to get gingerbread okay how long you
guys some negatives people have waited
to get ICS like this is the sprint
version of the nexus s only got ICS what
like three or four weeks ago okay but
we're never the galaxy s the Galaxy
Nexus gets the next version of android
you you can be assured of waiting a
minimum of one or two months I this is
the most optimistic projection ever you
can be sure to waiting a minimum couple
of months and before the galaxy s3 gets
and this is the thing that bugs me about
it's getting the fact that it's very
existence is still going to delay the
updating of this phone relative to a
stock device um again we're not going to
harp on this issue again I just wanted
to point out I mean yeah the good things
about the skin are actually there's a
quick settings whole bunch of quick
setting tacos in the notifications menu
and again Samsung has done a whole bunch
of little tweaks that you can read full
review to actually taking this with no
the notification screen toggles are bomb
like that is one of the very few
customizations over stock that I fully
support and something that of course
cyanogenmod has been doing for a long
time it's awesome it's great yeah but it
so so like I said the skin itself is
extremely comparable 200 four-point-oh
in terms of user experience it's not
going to get in your way um I am just
worried about first of all the immediate
of upgrade and when it might happen to
the next version of android and then
following that the fact that Samsung has
a really terrible track back
we'd software updates again this was
something I felt compelled to including
my conclusion because as awesome as this
phone is today you're not going to be
signing up to the company with the best
track record for updating his phones
like if you did what I forget Lisa one
important point I'd like to make is that
I feel like in the past year yeah bout
the last year most major android oems
have shown some amount of remorse uh and
and and an apology around that the the
entire update process and some have kind
of tried to repent a little bit we've
seen sony ericsson now sony Mobile yeah
you know that they did a really early
alpha of their ICS update for some of
their experience HTC of course has
started to become very good about that
Motorola has tried to be very
transparent not fast but transparent and
Samsung i think is kind of a notable
exception and they are a very important
exception because of course they are a
huge huge supplier of android devices
and there's no question that the gs3 is
going to sell tens of millions of
devices around the world so it would be
nice to see them kind of commit to some
sort of structure even if it's not
instantaneous even if they if they can
just put out a roadmap and be very
transparent about what's going to happen
with these devices once they're out
there in the field that would that yeah
I mean to your point that would just
make me a lot more comfortable sure
great but I think we're done we began
his history no I want to talk about you
know that would be a great time to to
talk about what happened with with webos
because uh I don't know if anybody if
you're watching the video may have
noticed uh but there are currently
firemen uh walking into my apartment I
just moved and they have set up a
brand-new fire alarm speaker intercom
alert system and they decided they need
to test it right now so that sounds
really fast yeah it's it's great it's
amazing I've got stupid kindness running
all over my apartment and dudes tramping
around in the background so I'll be back
when they're done hopefully it won't
take more than five or ten minutes okay
good luck if we do here here for like
half an hour we'll just just keep
checking on the video feed from time to
time
and if you see open flames the test has
failed well like I said Roger that line
is the deadline is half an hour and if
you don't come back then you're just
permanently written off of the show it's
just well at night after that yeah I'm
good I mean we're gonna miss you but you
know who-who plowin well yeah we'll move
on so one more thing I wanted to say
about the galaxy s3 because we we moved
on is that you gave it an 8.5 right hmm
and and that that neatly straddles the
Tegra 3 version of the 1x at 8.4 and the
the Snapdragon s4 version of the the 1x
at 8.6 so I think we can we can agree
that regardless of which of these three
devices you buy you're probably going to
be happy now certain regional variants
of the galaxy s3 we've long believed
will not be using the Exynos processor
which hasn't proven pretty superlative
in terms of performance and so we'll
have to see what happens with these
regional rights but I'm assuming that
even the regional differences will still
be s4 which is a great processor so
exact I don't know if that's gonna be a
concern or not in fact it may raise the
score will see ya I expected my do
because if that 20 100 million power
battery stays where it is and you stick
a Snapdragon s4 next to it and that
phone is gonna last you a long long time
it smart phone terms yeah like yeah I
expect that will be really impressive
that's four sips power relatively
speaking compared to my old circa 2002
nokia dumb phone it's still a power hog
but i digress i think those days are
gone but the days of going a week on a
single charge will never come back it
doesn't matter how far battery
technology advanced osaze i misses a
days they were amazing days like it's
like you don't realize about to go off
on a really philosophical tangent here
but i don't think that you realize just
how much um it worrying about your
phone's battery level effects
you're your daily life like it actually
has like a measurable effect on how you
plan where you go and when you go there
and you know do I need to be near an
outlet do I need to bring my charger
with me um what happens if my phone dies
like am I gonna be able to find my way
home which my hotel or you know whatever
it is that you may be doing do I need to
be connected on email because I'm
expecting a really important email like
there are all these considerations that
didn't used to be there yes Chris look
at this and this is gonna be very
helpful to our audio podcast systems but
as a massive display on this phone this
is this effect I mean no you can you
could own a blackberry today you know
room is going to very kindly sell your
blackberry with a tiny freaking screen
with the tiny freaking resolution but
you don't want to do that so the trade
of that we've basically chosen to make
ourselves to have a massive Amongus
gorgeous screen in our pockets which
yeah i think that opens up a whole new
set of issues rightly because it to a
certain extent it has to do with shelf
appeal like you walk into a carrier
store and your battery life is not the
first thing on your mind you're looking
s tree at how cool the phone looks and
you know what is capable of doing can it
play these awesome games so you might
buy a phone based on that and besides
even if you were worried about battery
life sort of natural selection in the
phone industry has eliminated a lot of
those power sipping options from the
lineup anyway like OEM sarn't working on
I'm like I think of what's a good pic
see right the palm pixi which is
actually a mold premature on this but
would be a nice transition into our next
topic um yeah if more phones were in
that category um I think they might do
pretty well and that's not to say that
we don't have we don't have like free
Android phones out there like the
Optimus series is still out there but I
would really like to see more devices
that have displays between say I don't
know 2.2 to 2.8 inches single core
processor processors would still run
gingerbread and even ICS just fine just
look at the nexus s so I mean um in this
code kind of gets back to what we were
saying earlier about four
displays right there's no reason they're
there is no good reason that Samsung and
HTC can't come up with a quote-unquote
high-end 4-inch to 4.3 inch phone it in
fact they have the 1s but the problem is
that the carriers just don't want to
push it I guess one exception would be
t-mobile's blaze 4g but um you know I
mean who owns a blaze 4g I mean come on
really but besides that I mean it's not
just enough to have more devices in the
pixi form factor everyone is still
trying to give you the same smartphone
experience in spite of the smaller for
fact and I think that's the wrong way to
go about it like if you're gonna sell me
a phone in the size of the pixie you're
gonna have to sell me a phone without
all the bells and whistles of a
full-sized 4-inch foreign chin above
smartphone you know right um I don't
know exactly what you're going to trade
off what you're going to throw out and I
mean I don't think you should sacrifice
the camera for example I think there's
no reason why you can't fit a good
camera module one of those devices but
there's applications is things like
mapping applications which is on is
useful so you do have to have a user
experience which is custom to that
screen size that form factor and you
know the previous user experience that
was you know Nokia's bread and butter
meat and potatoes whatever are the
metaphor you want to come up with was a
much more limited user experience in
which case the much more limited screen
size wasn't a problem or is he trying he
was like you mean symbian oh yeah I
don't want to name names here come on so
so so you're not you're knocking windows
phone is also um no I'm not talking
about in the windows phone oh well I
mean we're talking about the five seven
ten years ago like he was saying about
the week on Betterlife well I'm so so
wait let me get this straight let me get
this right you you you're worried about
rocking the boat by knocking a 10 year
old phone is that is that what just
happened yeah but i mean this is this is
tradition about not speaking ill of the
dead
and I don't want to do that okay I could
fair enough fair enough Leslie just let
sleeping cynthians lie or a stinking
sport ever seriously I am actually
interested in this new news about any oh
and about HB I think that a little
exclusive on that I think you wrote it
Chris we did we we we blew the the
proverbial doors wide open these two
giant oak indoors where were you know
we're out there and I just blew them I I
put explosives around the base of this
these giant french doors solid oak and I
put pigs I put explosives along the
bottom place was he could have opened
them no I you know for a fact it's a
dramatic thing right so I put put all
this all these explosives around at the
base of these these beautiful French
doors and and wired them to explode
through a you know an Android app and
and then went off with my with my with
my galaxy s3 my mythical galaxy s3 that
I don't actually have and press the
button and these doors flew wide open
kaboom uh is the complete waste of time
I would just wasted like three minutes
of this podcast um yeah so the story is
that a significant portion of the
contributing members of the n yo team at
HP which is sort of a a it isn't core to
open webOS but it is part of the
overarching project and is closely it is
particularly closely related for
developers for the platform but a number
of these these these core players in
that group left to go to Google um which
is interesting on a variety of levels
right because yeah I I think that as I
mentioned in the post even even if you
never were a webos fan I think that you
needed to be kind of impressed by what
they managed to pull off that they were
way ahead of their time in terms of
implementing an entire UI particularly
on that form factor in in html5
effectively and and so to have members
of that crew go off to Google is very
interesting and we don't have
confirmation on what group inside Google
those guys are gonna be working with but
there are two obvious choices right a1
is android of course um you know webos
de android makes a lot of sense with the
other night we think eventually but the
more intriguing possibility is chrome /
chrome OS because I now will be a waste
of resources I don't think so especially
I mean this is not the place to talk
about it but David review David Pierce
reviewed this new Chromebook today along
with aura which by the way I'm extremely
envious of cuz i am one of the three
people in the world who love loves
Chromebooks I absolutely adore them that
yes I use a series 5 basically every day
of my life reason being that it prevents
me from doing a lot of things that would
be a waste of time I'm forced to
concentrate on the task at hand whether
that be writing a document or doing
email because they're just not very
capable devices so it's kind of a very
strange reason to be in love with a
device but so the this new Chromebook is
really awesome device and I think I mean
there's no sign that Google is backing
down from this initiative right so and
and they need to push that story the
story around html5 apps has come very
far you look at something like the
Financial Times app for iOS for the ipad
it blows my mind every time I open it
because you cannot i have yet to find a
way to tell that that is a web app once
its installed on the device I mean it's
to the to the average to the average
iPad buyer you can't I mean that there
probably is a way to figure out that
that you're looking at a web app but I
cannot and so that's really amazing it's
really encouraging for the future of
this of this way of doing things and so
I think that there's a long way to go in
pushing that story forward and people
that are working that we're working on
web West and any one particular
which is the app the underlying
application framework and the developer
tools around that it tab those people
join a group like chrome I think would
be very interesting but again we don't
know they they could be going to Android
which be interesting for entirely
different reasons but we'll see i I'm
sorry subscription but defended I'm
picking up on is first of all ever since
HP announced the weather was to go in
open schools after like that just a way
to avoid saying okay with putting into
the trash so as far as I was concerned
that was the writing on the wall whoever
wears I mean I don't remember anything
coming back from going open source any
piece of software coming back from that
mostly because it's kind of a recent
trend with the you know me go maemo
previously now Tizen different
generations different names for the same
software the stem succeeded samsung I
believe was thinking about open sourcing
bother it's what you do we put software
out to pasture but exactly to say I feel
like people should at least be curious
about webos and its future and to me
this again signals the fact that people
don't see any future in a proper Webber
was going anywhere near the mainstream
market and then moving on to new places
and I think the move to Google is pretty
obvious as far as from as far as my
perspective as an outsider goes in so
far as the edge of joining up with
Matias Duarte who used to be their
leader yeah yeah well there are a lot of
people there are a lot of people from
palm that are now working for google and
other places I mean it the valley is a
small place right like a people keep
crossing paths there but yeah I think
that that this probably signals yeah if
the if the open-source move and the
discontent discontinuation of hardware
last year didn't signal the end of webos
I think this certainly does to have that
have that many people leave at once and
go to a quote unquote competitor is is a
real vote of no confidence and and
replacing replacing staff I mean it's
not
like they can just bring people in and
boom they're back in business right they
need to rant people at first they need
to find good people people that are as
good or better than the people that left
and then they need to they need to train
them and it's it's a whole thing and
there's no sign HP has not since they
made the open-source announcement they
have never once indicated a solid non
wishy-washy commitment to to making uh
to doing anything other than pumping a
few dollars into this open source
initiative there's no sign that we're
getting new hardware which is all I mean
the end of the day that's all anyone
cares about is whether this is going to
be on any device and there's no sign of
that so until somebody says and you know
until HP or somebody else says we're
making a new webos device it's
completely irrelevant even then even if
it's a major OEM introducing a new webos
device then a huge uphill battle because
why are people going to why are people
going to buy this device know when they
didn't buy a better supported device
with more money being thrown at it a
year ago or 18 months ago or two years
ago so it's it's it's not it's not
pretty no it's not it's not i agree i
mean it's a it's a sad state of affairs
but then also i'm reminded of the fact
that when HP took over palm matières
what it was not the only member of the
senior team to leave as soon as that
happened i mean i believe jon rubinstein
might have been the one that held out
the longest but everywhere everybody
else pretty much everybody else from the
senior team jumped right and yeah John
didn't leave until recently but he had
been very very quiet inside HP for you
know a year before that I mean we know
it was inside HP he who couldn't get off
on holiday just you know formalistic Lee
being part of the team it does seem like
HP had some idea which coincided with
absolutely nobody at palm or the
thinking of nobody parm and HP seiko was
evidently pause the word
I come in with the word of antagonistic
is the wrong one but it's it's when you
when you take over a company that
doesn't really want to be taken over by
you I'm sure each people some palms
first choice a lot of disagreements
happened and now maybe you know the
lower members the guys from lower down
the rungs also escaping the ship well I
think that that at the very beginning of
the HP purchase I think that there was
some enthusiasm both inside HP and
inside palm that there might be a way to
make this work and that probably quickly
vanished once the CEOs started you know
you started getting that CEO musical
chair stuff going on Leo came in mark
hurd left Leo came in Leo was forced out
and make a min and you know it's I you
know I I don't think you can say really
anything positive about Leo is here from
it from it from a consumer here is there
a crazy thought about what if Mark Hurd
has stayed around at HP and come through
with whatever initial vision the head
for the palm take over maybe that would
have been a success do you think that is
a viable possibility or am I just
catching the straws it no it's I think
anything's possible you know that the
problem is that there are so many
variables you go back and look at what
happened in the past four years to that
company now not just post HP but PHP
with the you know the fact that they
started with a sprint exclusive and the
fact that uh basically a six-month delay
between announcement release all these
factors uh could have had a really
significantly detrimental effect on the
market performance of these devices and
we don't know what combination of those
decisions and realities ultimately did
the men but it they certainly
contributed right yeah i just realized
that I'm shaking my camera so there's no
earthquake in Chicago I since I've lived
here i moved here in what about ten
years ago
I'm dullahan I vote yes I've only lived
through one earthquake in Chicago which
is extremely rare um and is a it was a i
think a five point 0 in southern
Illinois that we felt all the way in
Chicago so it's just like it was like
six or 630 in the morning and my bed was
just very gently kind of shaking that is
the one and only earthquake I've ever
experienced in this city so when you see
my camera shaking I just want to
apologize you don't have to worry about
my safety or well-being the earth is not
moving it's just me okay and I can
actually distribute I just did it again
so I can figure it a bit of quick trivia
that picked up recently the Richter
scale which is the one the scale for the
magnitude of an earthquake it goes up it
literally in orders of magnitude so
something rated at five is ten times
weaker than something rated at six which
in turn is ten times weaker than
something rated at seven so a magnitude
eight earthquake is something like yes
it's a thousand times stronger than a
magnitude 5 and your honor yeah for
whatever reason I had never been known
that about the wood scale yeah I was
just like go to scale so kind of know
that an eighth and above is pretty crazy
and scary and 506 is pretty tolerable
but now I know yeah if you lived in San
Francisco or Tokyo you would probably
have known that by now potentially it's
just that London is London is not really
a seismic zone as far as I know no we
London is pretty much nowhere near any
Teutonic plate boundaries yes that we're
pretty clever in that respect I don't
have to say all these cities that are
built just erected on tectonic plate
boundaries like San Francisco I just bum
consume me I really love the idea of San
Francisco i think is a great city but
it's in the wrong freaking place but
there are streets which actually spanned
the San Andreas Fault so hey you know
while while the ground
and the knee view the physical element
of which you stand is moving in two
opposing directions you decide that you
will build a cement road on top of that
and expect it to last how long I think
there is a there's a very a deep
sociological study to be done there
around the creation of cities and not
just earthquake zones but in like
disaster zones in general like Miami is
another good example that they're
getting pounded by disastrous of
hurricanes once or twice dear right um
and so yeah I think that there's a whole
that that's a whole that's got to be a
whole like topic of you know why why
civilization has created these wonderful
places in really dangerous areas in your
right san francisco i mean like they had
a you know just a tremendously
devastating earthquake in the early part
of the 1900s but of course chicago yeah
the Great Chicago Fire uh in the 1800s
this is O'Leary's cow that whole story
knocked over a lantern and set the whole
city on fire so you know you don't
necessarily need a natural disaster to
completely destroy a town Chicago came
back to and I'm sure Chris the other
thing is i neva none in london is burnt
more often than gosh I don't know room
stock price but I see when you're there
that's nice that was very very nice and
and the news today with respect to rim
that's squeeze that in is that it's
has halted trading because it has hired
i believe JP Morgan to advise it on a
big strategic reassessment which is
likely to result in a bunch of job cuts
so right things have gotten so dire in
severe that the stock market has decided
not to trade of shares because expect
people might go crazy and just
completely nuke the share price which is
already at a very low level it's
actually really surprised you might say
they're valuing an emergency right now
oh man are you kidding me um if it's
really surprising to me by the way
everyone that was that was dieter bohn
coming to us live from ceasefire lager
there is apparently an earthquake yeah
his fire alarm
um so it's actually really surprising to
me that this kind of setup set off this
firestorm on the stock market because uh
it was known there was that Bloomberg p
i think it was Bloomberg piece that went
around was it to two and a half three
months ago where they were talking about
the fact that they were going to hire
both a Canadian and an international
bank to advise them on what their next
move should be I think that that torsten
talked about it a little bit on list
earnings call so I don't understand why
this is a surprise the fact that they're
bringing outside help to figure out what
to do I don't get it now I'm really
people should have been already
projecting for that I mean I believe two
or three days ago at most I was over the
weekend at this popped up there was
speculation that room is looking to chop
2,000 jobs out of a 6500 the overall
number of employees so that's something
like top set of its whole workforce just
being chopped off so you know that
projection that expectation materializer
can but maybe maybe the market didn't
bind to the rumors until was actually
materialized in this hiring at the
company but then as you say Chris room
has already foreshadowed its own demise
we should look I would have seen would
be I would not quite as hilarious
necessarily but yes yeah I mean to the
Myers Chris I believe we were in
witnessing a demise I I hope for that
for the sake of the market I hope that
you're wrong now because I'm a
particularly big rim fan but because i'm
a fan of competition huh I really angry
i am going to be happy that i don't have
to learn everything about Weber Wesson
whatever rim does with snacks failure
blackberry operating system it's gonna
keep my life simpler to only have to
know about android and iOS but it isn't
as diverse it is in his way windows
phone by the program windows phone ah
well this one is gonna have to prove
itself to me I'm honestly I'm tired
Windows Phone I'm tired of calling in
the 30 who's this by default I'm excited
either step up your game you know make
it 25 percent market share you know step
off
I'm excited for Apollo so other one so
he's magic is this phone I'm the hater
windows for Nokia's actually made some
strides in China right that kind of made
the rounds in the past few it's the fact
they're really kind of gaining some
inroads there and that's not only the
finest particularly high margin record
for them probably but um but that's good
you know those actually there is the
dates about Windows Phone in China
somebody came up with that saying
windows phone is more market share than
a western China and then somebody else I
think much more liable statisticians
show data that it doesn't well look II I
mean we're just gonna go see China we
can say that I'm trying to spin Windows
Phone as hard as I can here I will say
this you know I've been saying but
before the launch of mango I was saying
i can't wait for mango and actually I
could live with mango I could
realistically live with me i'm still
trying to live with mango / tango on the
900 the only big problem is the lack of
a decent gmail client and the fact that
when you go to gmail's mobile view in
mobile internet explorer it doesn't take
it it takes you to the website which is
like such a slap in the face like I
totally get why Google hasn't bothered
to invest the time into making their
gorgeous iOS webview work on Windows
Phone but for goodness sakes I mean like
Google perhaps more than any other
company in the in the world is known for
spending random amounts of money and
time and time on things that aren't
necessarily going to pay off the they
aren't necessarily going to see return
on investment with so you know for the
for the benefit of the the Windows Phone
users out there however few there maybe
please just get that web you working I
would be in hog heaven if if if they got
that working I would be I would finally
be in a situation with mango where I
could use a Windows Phone device for
time and not feel weird or or paralyzed
by it like I do now and so but anyway
back to my original point I was saying I
was really excited about mango mango
came out it didn't it wasn't the
blockbuster that anyone wanted to be
tango of course isn't really anything
and then Apollo I once again I'm saying
oh I'm excited about Apollo but you know
at some point we need to stop being
excited about versions of Windows Phone
and just you know see a really good
platform out there so um yes yeah I
don't know I don't know man like I feel
really weird about it because you there
are enough compelling third party apps
on that platform now so that I really do
have my 900 within a stone's throw of
being usable full time for me gmail is a
killer I can't think of other thought my
head I can't think of any other single
thing on there I guess that I am
experienced isn't great for a variety of
reasons that the multitasking system is
is just one key enough so that doesn't
work very well and you store your
credentials on a remote server that you
don't know anything about but i have i
have google two-step authentication
working with it cuz there's the third
party client that does it just fine um
google voice works great it's so you're
talking yourself into it man it comes to
give you so so many reasons why it's
worth doing it now I mean that you to me
I can't even begin I thought listen two
reasons why i like using android um
while like using it why I feel the need
for it well you're trying to by the way
I think Peters back I'm back now yes
I've having lived through the greatest
nightmare of my entire life that was
horrendous and I'm why fret i letting
some of the audio get through a little
bit um but I'm back it's set up I I
heard Chris's rant about Windows Phone
and I I agree wholeheartedly agree with
what with what side of it that you
should keep trying and failing to make
it your primary main phone until it is
and that Vlad and I can
back and watch you make excuses for why
you're still doing that look we're
latest phone is very very simple
microsoft needs to stop cooking and
serve up something that's actually done
it a no more excuses it's done this is
good you know you know if you can talk
about it's not it's just not done in a
place where we can i use a prison to
just all you is being served ah like but
it's not cooked no guys no no here it is
windows phone is done it's just that
there's they put it on a menu along with
a t-bone steak and lobster but really
it's just turn it up mac and cheese mac
and cheese is delicious actually was
delicious but they should they should
quit selling it like it's gourmet like
its advantages it's not easy that is bad
but a really good analogy for you if you
think back to mwc of this year are you
thinking with me barcelona i am a
lessening anybody else okay okay but
think think about that time when you and
a group of our colleagues really hungry
and you have me as you guide to take you
to place a okay if you remember that
time and how long it actually took me to
find the perfect place for us to eat and
the fact that you nearly killed me and
the way there because i said it was like
two blocks over and I think of something
like 10 des yeah where Microsoft finds
itself right now with Windows Phone it's
it's no you guys seriously slum is one
polk always won't work ogle where is it
no here's the thing okay it and you need
to take this challenge for yourself I
sound like a total Microsoft she'll
right now but it needs to be said but I
challenge you to use a Windows Phone
device and tell me exactly what's
missing I told you exactly what's
missing from my experience I need better
gmail that's it I can't find anything
else that prevents me from using the 900
full-time so so I put it I put it on you
guys to tell me exactly what it is
that's missing from windows phone for
you that prevents you from using it
full-time a proactive using it is a
proper uh
not proper cuz I mean what's proper I
mean really but a more robust back
rounding and multitasking experience you
know even one minute you know that I yep
and an IM app and skype are going to be
able to receive incoming messages when I
come back to them if that if that means
full multitasking great if that means
what iOS does we're like some things are
sort of multitasking but not but at
least there's some really clear defined
boundaries of what is it isn't running
fine if that means all of those apps
actually using Microsoft's currently
defined boundaries because they're just
not doing it right now fine but it's
just it's just not there yet for the the
specific tasks that I need on a phone
and I'm sorry multitasking that's as
good as the multitasking on the One X
that's what you're looking at yeah it's
not much to ask is it no it's not it
really isn't however some alternative
answers for what's missing first of all
there isn't a robust gathering area for
notifications assume who android is the
leader in that respect I feel I always
caught up but still reason is nice and
clean with pulling your notifications
together as Andrew it is and I think
windows phone is behind both of those I
think windows phone is severely missing
a properly usable home screen which is
gonna be controversial but ultimately
I'm whenever we seeing six or eight
tiles on my home screen and we've heard
his tale about lifestyles for ages but I
don't see a much life add action or
activity on my home screen with a
windows phone I don't see any used by
the animations apart from letting me
know that the phone hasn't frozen up I
actually really like the immediate and
glanceable nature of seeing forum ready
emails free miss Cole's two messages etc
but that's that only takes three tires
and you're taking up you know sixty
percent of my screen to do that I don't
like that it's not mature to me like
maybe for some people who only use those
particular things and use them
extensively and really in-depth and
maybe the Facebook integration works
in that respect Facebook messaging may
be worse for them but not for me like I
really like to have a home screen that
can give me access to a whole bunch of
things I like to actually stick to just
one home screen with Android and just
stack it up with folders and icons and
applications and useful things and maybe
have a second everyone for the rare few
witches that i use and that's it and
when it's all over those on on Android
I've got just a mix of like calendar and
contact widgets and you no folders so
yeah your calendars last year's windows
file has a really easy solution to this
give me a pinch to zoom option where the
current view of the home screen can just
be shrunken down so all the tiles can be
shrunken down maybe if I have like a
bunch of contacts that have into my
start menu I don't want to scroll 15
times to get to them I just want to have
be able to see more of a base and and
this also works really well with the
expected increase in resolution for
Windows Phone Apollo right so you raise
the resolution you give people the
option to see more of the home screen
wildlife tiles it's win-win but it
doesn't exist I think that some more
flexibility for the size and shape of
the live tiles is actually in order I'd
like to see some more you know I get
that Metro is all about that the whole
square look and they can still be you
know rectangles you don't need to be
like rhombuses or trapezoids although
that would be cool but but having it you
know hey say you have I think of a good
example the calendar application in
Windows Phone should have a number of
selectable live tiles for size and for
for display for what it looks like for
what it shows for the information that
it shows and right now that yes I don't
think that I've ever seen there might be
a couple weather apps I've seen it in
but by and large you don't have a lot of
configurability for what ends up showing
up in the law of Thailand I've
definitely never seen a Windows Phone
app that has that allows you to choose
between a half with and a full width
live tile I've never seen that
I don't know how this was over to you
how do we get on the dealers robbery
wasn't like treacherous phone I don't
living the nightmare of the 20 minute
lemme show the second whyever it usually
happens that way we talk about God's
break and then we stumble into Windows
Phone everybody have you guys when I was
living that nightmare talked about the
the new iphone back plate I don't have
images that leaked out no we haven't we
should do because I would like to so a
couple images have leaked out a 9to5 mac
they show a slightly elongated iphone
with the headphone jack at the bottom of
the device next to it looks like a
larger area for speakers and the smaller
dock connector and supposedly it will
probably add up to a screen that's the
you know 11 36 x 640 which is just shy
of a 4-inch screen and I gotta say I
it's not a radical new design um but I I
like it better than the straight glass
it looks like they're gonna have some
sort of you know two-tone thing going on
there maybe that's a metal back there I
think it looking every good the one
thing i don't like about it is the the
grill along the bottom it doesn't look
micro drilled the way they do unlike the
macbook or of course like you know HTC
is doing with the 1x the they look like
giant holes and it'll expand it
hopefully that's yeah that's yeah yeah
another thing that i'll point out is
that i the the the new dock connector
looks about the same size as an MHL /
micro USB port I'm sure it's not either
one of those things but it's about the
same size hmm but what I was gonna say
is I'm in agreement with data I think I
think we are getting a really good idea
even if these are not legitimate images
because we've seen of coming from a
couple of different sources and they
seem to corroborate each other of this
elongated the 4-inch ish iphone case
even if they're not legitimate images
there
the shaping up to be showing us where
the next iPhone is going so we're most
likely going to get this four-inch
iphone where the screen has been
stretched vertically I i can offer many
complaints about the appearance of it
but the look of it but it kind of
bothers me that Apple is keeping the
straight edges all around the sides and
once is probably won't have to be
expected because consistent with the
appearance at the a 44 in the oven for
us but I'd still nothing they're good
ergonomically a career Elena like you
like like the iphone / iphone 3g yeah
yeah I mean I I didn't think I did I'm
gonna first time I saw di from poor
design I was like yeah this is a manly
phone this is a phone for me finally now
this fancy shmancy you know curved
iphone nonsense but actually what turns
out is that the devices with the curve
bags are the absolutely most comfortable
once you can have and i do you feel like
a little companies making this trade-off
of going for more angular more rigid
looking phones because they know them
more appealing to people because you
know there was so better there will be
as Chris was saying earlier it'll be
more appealing when you just see them in
the store but actually the ones would
have wrote him back the ones that just
kind of look frumpy I guess are pretty
comfortable ones and this included is I
could say the iphone the early iphone
generations the 3gs it includes the
Nexus S which and Rami does his fellows
running with phones I think completo
galaxy s free oh yeah yeah Madonna but
the galaxy s3 is not the most attractive
phone in the world either exactly and I
know I know that because I've had a lot
of reform I rating for its design yahoo
like no do you do not know what you're
talking about do you have your glasses
on etc etc about his appearance and I
really don't care because when you start
using a phone the only thing you're
looking at is its display the actual
back of it the design of the back of it
doesn't matter when you're using the
phone how it looks does matter are me if
deeply Mets us how it feels in your hand
yeah any fears no just fine so that's
actually the one of the larger screen
like these guys think we're gonna see
something significantly different with
iOS 6 to take advantage of that extra
space or is it just gonna be an extra
icons whatever like yeah me very much
extra row of icons and stretching out
content within apps maybe adding maybe
more menu rose or something but that
would be it I guess I think I think that
they you know um so I think it's a
foregone conclusion that Noah cos six
they're going to do something more with
the the widgets in the pulldown and I
don't think that long-term those widgets
can live in the pulldown alone and it
would make a lot of sense to me that you
would be able to position those widgets
on the home screen you know taking up
the full width of the screen maybe I
don't know but if you could have those
interspersed with icons I don't know how
that would work exactly i'm not a UI
expert but I I hope that they don't
long-term that those widgets don't only
live in that pull down because they're
useful and they're cool and obviously we
want to see developers be able to take
full advantage of those and you don't
want them just buried up in that Kurt
curtain something with that yeah I mean
they'll have to rethink their home
screen experience though because I mean
yeah right now it's just app there's
there no with Android there's a
separation between home screen and app
drawer right i think that apple doesn't
want to have that separation but I mean
how how would you manage widgets you
need some way to do that they're like
they're right up against the ragged edge
of like what they can do with the
current I mean we've talked about this a
bunch right but it seemed like if you're
gonna be a larger screen if they go to
the 4-inch screen and all they do is add
an extra row of icons and you know give
out the api's to like have a stretch tap
area and whatever and that's it I will
be very unhappy because like that extra
you know half inch of the screen space I
think will really show like okay this is
tired compared to what other you eyes
are doing right now so one thing that I
would point out
correct me if I'm wrong but I think that
this is an unusually long amount of time
between the last iOS preview event and
now right like it's been a long time so
I'm sure we'll see that is sure yeah
yeah cuz I think the last event was in
maybe march 2011 Upper Iowa I've
something like that is there about yeah
yeah yeah so they'll obviously show that
at WWDC I'm hopeful that considering the
amount of time that has lapsed since
last iOS event uh that's gonna be kind
of a pretty significant version bump and
we'll see some cool things all they need
to do to make me happy is make the
stupid 72 degree in sunny weather icon
do something else just just show me
crazy that's it just show me the local
weather I will become an iphone user for
life uh especially now that Sparrow is
out like I can make do without without
notifications it's not the end of the
world but the email experience on iOS is
is of course terrible um but then again
like I was saying earlier you have the
web view which is actually very good but
but you know now the of Sparrow give me
live icons I'm good to go never touch
android or or windows phone again that's
not true obviously but um but no I mean
I'm sure I mean look I've owned I've
owned every iphone that has ever come to
market I'm sure all on the next iPhone
and how long I remain on that iphone is
going to depend almost solely on the
software not on the hardware because the
the 4s is still a really fantastic
device the only the only complaint I can
really Lodge it well to complaints one
is lack of LTE into is the small screen
but but either start our deal breakers
to me at the software is perfect um and
and I think I would actually say this
queen is a deal breaker for me at this
point well yeah you can a desktop he's
been five inches but every time you put
it right next to another stuff you kind
of make law why don't I have that bigger
one there's so much more information on
a can read so much more yeah yeah fair
enough does help that there's a no lag
on iOS so like dragging stuff around a
bit more
information you don't have like it's
always you know exactly paper movement
you know with your finger right right
and you thought frame i'm moving and
pretending like i'm scrolling an iphone
it's amazing it's blowing my mind it
makes me want to switch back honestly so
that helps I don't think I think they
need me you know something embarrassing
the third of course is fun about
excitement I cover a couple of retweets
I've seen in my twitter stream
particularly from Steve Tyler Smith
we're from wwc attending developers and
they were actually looking at that Widow
is DC schedule which is Apple's
Worldwide Developer Conference it just
got released the keynote will be on jun
11 it lasts between jun 11 jun 15 and
the thing that they were actually
looking at was how many sessions there
were four developers which were to be
announced because that is actually their
metric for telling how much is going to
be new and exciting and then there are a
bunch apparently so we can look forward
to some new hotness just uh no way I'm
going up in a tree see it's really soon
yeah gene alerts coming right up but
unfortunately blend unfortunately Vlad
I'm gonna have to reach through uh the
the video feed and punch you in the face
for saying new hotness I i draw the line
with that phrase i I just can't get down
with that raise i'm sorry i wish you
you're okay maybe no suit and talking
about Fast and the Furious uh for a half
hour a day but yeah hotness can't no kid
no not not half an hour a day dieter
it's gonna be 90 minutes a week big
difference Oh Chris yeah Chris I am like
20 minutes that'll be terrible i am
going to invoke something many black
free i have been led to believe is in
cinemas over new nine states and there's
a new hotness as everybody knows was
invented by will smith in men in black
one therefore because men in black there
is a mini black movie in its as at the
moment I am technically allowed to use
new hotness without sounding old and
busted
sure I'll let it slide this once okay
well uh oh yes you bought that when I'm
glad I'm uh I'm not I'm not letting it
slide but i'm not letting it slide in
the same way you don't you don't yell at
you know your grandpa for calling
somebody a hepcat you know it's just not
his fault you know okay doesn't am sorry
I think back um and we discussed
everything I mean I was gone for half
the podcast listening to insane fire
alarms is there anything else that you
guys want to hit quick before we sign
off for the yet our first show yes yes I
don't think that we can sign off without
talking about the the renewed facebook
phone rumors um this is this is a so you
know there have been facebook phone
rumors on and off for what 18 months at
least and and I think you know where
there's smoke there's fire I don't think
it's plausible at this point that there
isn't anything going on I think that at
the very least Facebook is exploring
this idea i think that you know famously
over the past few months is they've
they've gone through their IPO they've
been talking a lot about the fact that
like they haven't found a monetization
model for mobile yet and I you know I
it's very easy to believe that Facebook
believes that that creating a smartphone
at the very least a smartphone platform
might be central to that to that
strategy but man getting into the the
smartphone market is not easy just ask
palm just SHP just ask a sprint I mean
ran SRAM in a year yeah yeah so I mean I
just don't know in it you know I know
they're they're riding a wave of of
money and greatness right now but it's
it's gonna be tough for him it really is
best case scenario it's still gonna be
tough for him I think that that a very
likely scenario for those guys is that
they're gonna pull an Amazon right
they'll they'll fork Android and go off
and do whatever with it and of course
facebook you know they already have an
app platform it's very easy to sort of
build in your mind exactly how
this would work but yeah I mean was so
what they're gonna they're gonna launch
exclusively on eighteen t or verizon or
whatever and then what what's what's the
next step after that are they you know
yeah it's an issue and it's also about
in the issue the issue for me is what
defines success for a facebook phone
like if they need to get to like twenty
percent market share in order for this
thing to count as a success they're know
they're in a world of hurt that's gonna
be super hard but if they can you just
get it out there as a way to I don't
know pressure other phone manufacturers
to start you know doing more with
Facebook software and sign up or
partnerships and maybe they can use it
as a way to gain some market share in
certain emerging markets or you know
something targeted where they're not
trying to compete in the same way that
windows phone and android and iOS are
trying to compete then you know that
could be interesting but I just don't
know what that look I'll be really use a
beginner I don't understand how Facebook
would be able to do that what you
suggest either of competing with that
really competing like if you if you
don't you go after the smartphone market
back chris says you have to have a
really really clear idea of what the
hell it is you're going after you know
you can't just be but we're going to
compete with you guys but if you
integrate facebook really deep into your
phones will compete less hard and that
will somehow be okay for Facebook's
bottom line it's going to be really
confused idea I also don't understand
how they're going to do because their
problem is facebook wants to be
ubiquitous on mobile devices I don't
think Facebook can afford to not be on
Android out of income before to not be
on iOS and the same goes for Instagram
which is it's you know prize kappa its
most recent a most expensive piece of
software disk it has captured so you
can't just introduce facebook phone and
say okay you know what we're going to
keep Instagram exclusive to this phone
and this was going to give it a selling
point we're going to keep these Facebook
features of clues to this phone you need
to have your features all across mobile
platforms everybody says about Facebook
and about how it's going to adapt to
people moving to mobile devices
and Facebook's go is ubiquity and yet
the goal with coming out with your own
phone is exactly the opposite is to have
some sort of exclusive special selling
point so how do you do that how do you
have something that's special about your
phone or at the same time trying to have
your platform on every phone right okay
I ain't smokin it could be smoking
mirrors right they could be you know
trying to fake somebody or they might be
hiring some sort of ancillary crew to
support the development of facebook
phone through somebody like HTC or maybe
Apple wants deeper integration and
they're just you know I I think that
there are lots of other explanations
that don't ultimately lead to a
quote-unquote facebook phone Facebook
stranded phone on the market I mean if
that's exactly what happened with the
chacha right they understand the status
that everybody thought that that
Facebook was working on the phone and
then boom all the Sun it turns out it's
just a an ant or you know a
standard-issue HTC android device with a
facebook button on it so who never I
mean it's just this idea of Facebook
going for cell phone um doesn't compute
for me that I mean that Facebook isn't
intent on doing it I just don't see
where the motivation is I don't see the
clear idea and clear go behind it I
don't really think that Facebook's the
ultimate success is accompanying lies in
monetizing the sale of devices whereas
the previous strategy the one that Mark
Zuckerberg has been stating over and
over again is there won't be such a
thing as just one Facebook phone we want
every phone to be a facebook phone which
is nice catch phrase and and that he
wanted to distribute facebook services
as widely as possible like that makes
more sense to me that is more intuitive
to me um but then again like you say
Chris amazon used to be all about that
just being platform agnostic and then
all of a sudden and came out with the
Amazon with the kindle fire rather and
as you know very well Chris there will
be in a mess of smartphone by the end of
the year right oh it's happening it is
it is exit I'm exactly so I wonder you
something about Manhattan I'll stick I'm
not convinced I'm not convinced at this
point that it's gonna be end of year but
we'll see it's definitely I mean one way
or another so it'll be an
if I think that the opportunity is like
in within the Android ecosystem like you
don't have to beat Android you don't
have to beat iOS but you can if you can
be the de facto go to answer within
Android the way that the Kindle Fire
basically is for android tablets within
a smartphone space that's that's a real
opportunity to make some real money and
you don't necessarily that it's a
smaller hill to climb than you know
gaining you know market share just for
your thing and so I think Amazon and
Facebook they be kind of stupid not to
you know see if they can give that a go
because it does actually give them some
leverage to make sure that they get on
other phones because they do those other
phones need to be competitive with the
facebook phone and Facebook's perfectly
happy to be frenemies with these other
companies and say yeah sure we'll make
suffer for your phone while we continue
to make it for our phone um you know
they're happy to do that i would think
unless their phone takes off insanely
and then they're like no not only
facebook you know for our own hardware I
think they'd be stupid to do that though
I wouldn't expect him to write I mean we
need to go Mac this mouthful markets do
that I think back to the Ken which is
it's on one level it's it's it's kind of
easy to see how Facebook would would say
well you know we can do the Kin right
that you you know I could see them
having the hubris to go into that sort
of attitude um and and then I was
thinking to myself well uh that's an
expensive mistake because it costs
Microsoft half a billion by danger and a
half billion to come out with a Ken but
the in reality that's pocket change
these days especially you company like
Facebook i mean if maybe if Facebook
ultimately a tried and failed and it
costs them a billion dollars yeah it
hurt on the quarterly earnings report
but it's not going to uh it's not going
to end the company that's for sure right
but that's alright but then this is
another question which is how is the
facebook phone by Facebook going to
differ from all the facebook phone
service so far cuz okay the most famous
ones uh a HTC was from last year but
let's not forget companies like ink and
some other smaller companies I think why
we might have done some may be no qual
é um but a whole bunch of companies
have tried to tailor their low end
budget phones around the idea of being
Facebook phones so it was the ink cloud
touch last year i believe and there was
another ring phone which really cheap
and affordable and we're really centered
around facebook and what android phones
yeah so my question is um if facebook
wants to approach the market from the
Affordable side of things which kind of
makes sense since you want to have the
Facebook services available to her buddy
it's already been done how is it going
to be different I have the answer they
are going to affect they're going to
perfect the haptic poke uh using using
that the new what is it called that the
new haptics that are unlike the um they
did on that new pantech tablet they're
gonna have that like really advanced
poke haptics its does anybody's the hook
anymore on facebook i don't know that
poking is still done a super poke
whatever the case may be i don't know
what was there a stroke yeah it's a it
was one at one time it was like one of
the most successful facebook apps if not
the most successful so and now it's just
barbell yeah okay see that other thing
is your idea no I they need it needs to
run flash because I need to be able to
