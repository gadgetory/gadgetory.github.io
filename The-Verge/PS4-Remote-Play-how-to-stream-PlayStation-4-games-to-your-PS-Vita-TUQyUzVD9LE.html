this is remote play for the PlayStation
4 which allows you to stream and play
full games from your console to a PS
Vita Remote Play isn't an entirely new
concept it has been around in some way
shape or form since the ps3 days but
until now I'd only worked with a limited
number of games with the PlayStation 4
remote play is supported on the system
level for nearly every game that doesn't
require PlayStation camera for the
launch titles we tried that's pretty
much everything except just dance oh and
Netflix doesn't work either setup is
easy and I'll connect either locally or
via Internet connection when you're too
far away the video will now mirror your
PlayStation 4 screen menu system in all
the controls are basically what you'd
expect with a dual shock force touchpad
map to the Vita's touch screen and with
l2 l3 r2 and r3 mapped to the four
corners of the rear touchpad that was
kind of weird for Killzone that proved
difficult to trigger while for Need for
Speed actually proved far too easy to
get the sirens blazing in the same room
remote play is actually quite responsive
but lag becomes a little more noticeable
the farther you get for some games it
won't really matter for Twitter titles
however those extra milliseconds could
get very frustrating and even some
technically incompatible games won't
work because well it's really tiny text
on a 5-inch screen the best thing we can
say about PlayStation 4 remote play is
that just works and under the right
conditions it works surprisingly well
but the biggest hurdle for many people
might be the Vita itself the tuner
dollar portable can be a hard sell but
even as a luxury accessory for the
PlayStation 4 it's kind of nice to play
a next-gen title while at the same time
freeing up your living room TV it's been
literally only a few hours and Sony
activated the PlayStation Network and
we're just diving into the PlayStation 4
we'll have much more to say in a full
review very soon
