captain of moon shots at X you know I
think people over focus on drones Plus
burritos I just think that that's sort
of missing the point
flying burritos could be a thing of the
future really new video as a researcher
start test every time we have as a
society as a species removed another big
chunk of the friction in how physical
things are moved around in the physical
world boats planes trains horses and the
Pony Express each one of these things
has profoundly changed Society it's easy
for us to see those things looking
backwards because we've become used to
not having the frictions that have been
removed we would never go back
but we're very used to the remaining
friction and how physical things are
moved around in the physical world if
you could just snap your fingers and
have something magically appear in your
hand whenever you wanted it to let's say
it was no cost and it was instantaneous
you have a hammer in your home you
probably have a power drill
you use it one ten-thousandth of the
time maybe one 100,000th of the time if
that hammer was sitting in some central
location it could be shared by thousands
of people really safely making everybody
wealthier functionally because they
would get the hammer when they need it
without having to pay for the hammer and
drain the world's resources by making
all of these hammers that go almost
entirely unused if we could move from an
ownership society to an access society
we're having it now wasn't important
what was important was having it when
you need it it would really dramatically
magically change the world
now how is it going to be possible for
something to appear just when you want
it everyone can imagine harry potter
howell post bringing that hammer to
their home even if they think that
drones are unlikely well we certainly
can't tolerate things being moved to
your home with the carbon footprint and
the sound pollution and the traffic
congestion and the unsafety level of
cars bringing that hammer to your home
why do you have a 4000 pound truck that
has one single four pound piece of food
in it coming across town surely that
factor of a thousand and weight and cost
it doesn't make any sense at all we can
do better than that and when we do we
will look backwards and wonder that we
ever used to have a time when everyone
owned their own hammer it will just seem
bizarre to us
