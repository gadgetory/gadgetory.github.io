I'm here at e3 to check out a new demo
for project Morpheus Sony's virtual
reality headset the demo is called
Street luge and it is exactly what it
sounds like you lay down on a beanbag
chair put on Morpheus and your body is
on a board rolling down hills and
dodging cars it's a fantastic idea and a
great example of what you can do with
only project Morpheus is head tracking
technology because your body really
doesn't move all you're doing is nudging
yourself left and right although you'll
probably look a little ridiculous
jerking your head around you really feel
the sense of vertigo and of trying to
avoid things and it's hands-down the
best thing I've seen from Morpheus
although that's not necessarily saying
much because so far we've seen a couple
of things that have mostly been tech
demos project Morpheus has really only
been around for a few months after being
announced at GDC
and the hardware hasn't much changed
what they're trying to do is figure out
things to do with it they're also
showing off some of the old demos which
use move controllers or just let you
look around but none of those have
really managed to feel as seamless as
the street luge Sony's not the only one
here at e3 trying to figure out what to
do with virtual reality oculus is
actually showing off some new games too
and the overall feel is that if last
year was about trying to understand what
the technology of VR looks like this
year is trying to understand how you can
use that to make games people want to
play sony hasn't given us any more
information about when we might see real
news from project Morpheus but we're
going to be watching it and the oculus
rift very closely over the next year</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
