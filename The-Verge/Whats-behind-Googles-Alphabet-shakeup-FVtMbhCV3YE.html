going to become alphabet yeah alphabet
is this big holding company and Google's
still gonna just inside it with all you
know Gmail search Android everything you
associate with Google but all the
Google's stock is now in the alphabet
stock and it's gonna become part of much
bigger holding company and that holding
company owns Google but also has Auto it
also has calico and all the other
editions own all the Google X stuff got
it
so what does Google get out of this why
does it want to separate out all of its
different pieces yes so one of the
things that's been happening in the
background sort of for the past year and
a half now is Google's been doing
increasingly ambitious projects that are
kind of not really related to the core
things this is the Google X stuff we've
been talking about there's been a lot of
news about these you know contact lenses
they're developing and project loon and
investors have always been sort of
nervous about them they don't really see
how they're gonna make money a lot of
investors would prefer Google just sort
of stick to making money on search the
way it's good at making money and so a
lot of this is about kind of modifying
those investors and saying you know if
you want just the core Google it's here
you can so you can see it's still
profitable and if these other entities
you know if they don't work out if they
implode we can shut them down if they
become wildly successful we can spin
them off independently and also if we
need more funding for them that funding
doesn't necessarily have to come from
Google it can also come from outside you
know outside rounds they can IPO
independently and they'll each have
their own CEO I mean so is there any
sense that Google is doing this like
purely to preempt you know regulatory
issues or all these countries been
looking to potentially break up bits and
pieces of it I don't think so in part
because a lot of if you were gonna break
up Google you you it's still Google that
you would be breaking up right let's
smaller core Google it still has all the
products that people would be looking at
and also I don't think I mean Google's
facing a lot of serious regulatory
fights most notably in Europe with the
right to be forgotten and sort of the
whole track and cookie issue um but
there hasn't really been any serious
issue
to take monopoly action against it you
think you're potentially splitting up
you know Google versus these inner
delivery companies like loon and fibre
does that play into it at all those are
all so tiny though I mean I think the
percentage of people even in the US that
are actually getting Internet through
Google Fiber is so tiny compared to the
whole that it would be very difficult to
I mean I think it would be like you know
saying Amazon's movie studio is it is a
monopoly because they're gonna take over
the film industry which maybe someday
but for now there's still a very small
fish in that particular pond so um I
don't think it's regulatory also you
know a lot of people thought it was tax
like a tax break thing which I think has
not borne out as we look closer at the
at the corporate structure and documents
um I think honestly it's just there has
been this division for a while between
the stuff at Google that has to do with
making money and the stuff that has to
do with the future of the business and
the future of the world and that
divisions been kind of growing more and
more particularly as Larry Page and
Sergey Brin has kind of drifted away
from the day-to-day core businesses and
I think basically what we saw yesterday
and what we're seeing going forward is
that's now a formal division within the
company but it's a loom fiber this
biotech stuff these are the wildly
ambitious ideas that could one day make
a ton of money in the future right so
yeah you know how does Google balance
funding them currently yeah and and
still appeasing investors who are now I
mean they're getting a better idea of
what's going on with them right yeah I
mean the punch line is they're sort of
gonna keep doing whatever they want
this isn't they're still gonna keep
pouring Google money they still have
most of the control here yeah yeah and
so they they're not you know investors
want them to shut down these projects or
a lot of investors do and they're not
doing that they're not gonna stop
pouring profits from search into these
companies because they believe in them
and they still believe in them but the
structure lets them become a little bit
less of a blank cheque so if they need
you know a ton of more money for
self-driving cars and they say well you
know this is gonna become profitable but
we need maybe you know a hundred million
dollars before it becomes profitable
that doesn't necessarily have to come
out of Google itself it can come out of
a separate funding round and all those
projects can be self-directed ok so
who's gonna be able to do a better job
of building up these individual brands
and initiatives that right now are very
disparate throughout Google I guess yeah
and one of the things we've seen that's
been kind of a problem for Google X has
been you know they want okay so for
instance Project loon is we want to make
a balloon that provides Internet access
okay so now you've made the balloon we
have the prototype we know we can do it
what do we do next
do we become an independent company do
we become a Google division how much do
we really need to and there's sort of
this question of how you take the next
so what I'm wondering is loon and fiber
I feel like those tie into Google's core
product that ties into ad revenue if
people are getting Internet it may be a
strainer yeah they're gonna be using
more Google products right or at least
presumably so yeah you know how do they
keep that integration if that's part of
maybe what the business is what is on
there's still all the same company I
mean so I think you will still see
people moving from the core Google to
these other projects you'll still see
technology from Google going back you
know in and out back forth but I also
think to some extent there's this
question of was loon ever actually gonna
help search revenue I mean I think
that's kind of an open question that's
certainly something that shareholders
were told and I think it's something
there and they were sort of intensely
skeptical of and so part of what we're
seeing now is Google something like loon
no longer has to justify itself in terms
of search revenue it has to justify
itself as part of this larger alphabet
organization so where does Google go now
that everything is split up yeah I mean
I think the really interesting thing to
watch here won't be the core Google but
it'll be these outside projects one good
example is nest which was acquired by
Google a couple years ago and you know
its CEO Tony Fadell you know last week
he was CEO of nest and which was owned
by Google and you know once this whole
merger is done he'll still be CEO of
nest as now part of alphabet um but I
think after the restructuring someone
like the Tony Fadell has a lot more
options
suddenly he can raise money outside he
can IPO he can just do a lot of things
that he couldn't when he was still kind
of justifying necess existence to the
core Google profit alphabet can really
treat these like individual businesses
they don't have to be yeah part of
search revenue somehow they could to
speed businesses unto themselves yeah
and I think that's I mean fundamentally
Google hasn't committed to doing
anything with any of these projects but
I think what it means is the independent
entities aren't just sort of under the
Google umbrella anymore now they have a
lot more options about where they can go
and when we start to find out more about
how these different areas of Google or
alphabet are doing yeah I mean I think
when Google decides well when alphabet
decides to tell us about them that's the
weird thing so what they said in the
initial announcement was they're gonna
they're gonna announce Google profits
separately from alphabet product so if
you just subtract the Google numbers
you'll be able to see all the other ones
lumped together and I think something
like nest is a good example of it may
decide to say hey guys we're making all
this money we're gonna we're gonna
report in s profits to be as these
individual companies that's what I think
it's something like I mean we see we saw
this with Apple with you know how many
Apple watches did you really sell and
they decide it for a while like we're
not gonna tell you that yet we'll tell
you that later it's kind of the same
deal where Google may just not tell you
how much money you know the other
alphabet projects are making or
swallowing up but at some point they
could decide to you never know which is
something that was less likely when they
were all just under the umbrella of
Google X so and maybe this is going back
a bit yeah their Google's breaking out
all these companies that are you know
potentially just losing them money is
that not easy I mean I think a lot of
the yeah they're just like throwing
money into it there's this ventures I
mean I think the thinking within Google
has always been these are going to be
one of some of these are gonna be the
core of the company 20 years from now
after search revenue maybe
isn't enough to carry an organization of
this size because the technology
landscape is constantly changing so
these are our longshot bets on the
future of the company and now I think
they're longshot bets on how does it
keep people from being scared that
they're just throwing away money until
that happens that like one day the idea
that these will replace or search or you
know should search dry up yeah well I
think the concern I mean in some sense
they're just a scary project Center and
keeping scary projects I think the
concern for some of it was all of the
money that was ever gonna be poured into
Google's self-driving car project had to
come from Google search revenue and that
was always going to be a drain on
shareholders whereas now that looks like
less of a blank check and making the
commitment of hey guys we're gonna build
a self-driving car because Larry and
Sergey really believe in it that's less
scary to people who are just kind of
there for the search right so you think
this is gonna give Google more
flexibility this is probably a net
positive yeah I mean I think the other
interesting thing will be to see what
happens to what is now Google understand
our pitch high because I think it starts
to look I mean I think it's still a very
ambitious project and I think things
like Android one are still really
exciting it'll be exciting to see where
they go but you have to kind of wonder
you know now they don't have the
excitement of we're gonna build these
huge internet balloons we're gonna be
you know making drone wind turbines and
so how does that company stay exciting
and I think he's got a lot of answers to
that</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
