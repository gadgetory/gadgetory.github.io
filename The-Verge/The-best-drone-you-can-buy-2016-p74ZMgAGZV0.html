basic rule of thumb with drones if you
want the best picture and the most
advanced features you have to go with
something that's expensive and pretty
large now you could get something
smaller and more portable but then
you're sacrificing those advanced
features long range and decent battery
life now obviously everybody wants to
take a drone with them on their vacation
that epic aerial foot is just going to
make those memories so much sweeter but
do you really want to lug around a giant
case that looks like it was designed to
hold the nuclear codes luckily there's a
new breed of drones this year ones that
have figured out how to minimize their
profile and fold up their wings they're
easy to take with you you can't slide
them in your pocket like a smartphone
yet but you can definitely slip them
into a backpack or even a purse all the
drones we tested this year were able to
deliver crisp smooth high-quality
footage and add battery life better than
20 minutes with those things a given
what matters now is a new dimension for
drones portability the clear standout
from this year's crop of drones was DG
eyes pneumatic Pro it's by far the
smallest and the easiest to set up but
it doesn't sacrifice on features it has
all kinds of autonomous navigation and
the best range of any of the drones we
tested the picture it delivers is also
fantastic just as good as the DJI
phantom 4 maybe with a slightly smaller
field of view now one of the things
that's great about the Mavic is that you
can use it with just your phone just the
tiny remote or your phone in the remote
together and while it is small it can go
up to 40 miles an hour meaning you can
pull off some really tricky tracking
shots in some really high octane
environments now there is a downside to
being so small the Maverick has a harder
time standing up to strong winds and
while it's trying to stabilize against
those winds it's burning a lot of
battery if you're a professional looking
for something that's going to hold up in
strong winds rough conditions the Mavic
may not be best for you but for the
average consumer it's the clear choice
it has all the features of a high-end
camera drone in a far more affordable
package the Mavic pro wasn't the only
really portable drone we tested out this
year our runner-up was going to be the
Karma drone from GoPro like the Maverick
it has a cool foldable form factor that
makes it easy to slip into a backpack
and you can also detach the gimbal and
use it as a handheld stabilizer so it's
more flexible than the Mavic if you're
going out on a big adventure in fact you
can also take out the camera and use
that as a waterproof action cam
unfortunately the Karma has been falling
out of the sky some kind of battery
issue maybe and GoPro has decided to
recall the product entirely so until
they get that sorted out we're going to
set this one aside the typhoon H drone
from unique seemed really promising when
we saw it at CES earlier this year but
it's finally here now with all the
promised features and it's too much too
late in the sense that it's just too big
there's no reason to have a six rotor
drone that comes inside of a giant
carrying case anymore
now the footage that you get from a
typhoon H is crisp and smooth and it can
definitely stand up to strong winds so
if you're thinking about going out and
shooting on a regular basis and
punishing conditions this might be the
drone for you it can even lose a rotor
and safely stay on the air and land
itself but in terms of portability this
drone is a joke it comes in a huge case
it takes a long time to set up and it's
definitely not the sort of thing I would
think about bringing on a hike we've
been doing these drone overviews for
three years and the fundamental pillars
remain the same price performance and
ease of use so there's a fourth
dimension to a good drone now
portability with something like the DJI
Mavic pro you have a drone that you can
easily throw into a backpack or a purse
you can even fit it into a big jacket
pocket now the same thing was also true
of the GoPro Karma but unfortunately
that drone isn't on the market right now
still I'm hopeful that other
manufacturers will take up this new form
factor and start designing drones that
are easy to carry not a piece of gear
you have to worry about bringing along
with you in fact I'm hopeful that by
this time next year we'll have a high
quality camera drone that anybody can
slip into their Park
like the Mavic Pro to go yeah okay you
ready like the Mavic Pro the</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
