it's already pretty legislative it's the
intense face while we're waiting is like
me like we're trying to surprise the
audience yeah we need to be on the same
page there's nobody else was gone you
don't either rehearse for that look
hello welcome to the the verge cast for
a week I believe it is the week of July
fifteenth a lot of surprises in store
today not least a which is it this
coaster which I believed was made of
wood actually ceramic who knew you you
know how I've been I've been in the game
too long I thought this was a pad of
like makeup I've been in my game for too
long yeah you know you've been back my
game like literally for that game of
being a talented on cam your talent now
yeah actually did you track your science
with it to get low yeah and it didn't do
anything didn't solve this blemish
didn't solve this bloomin I was like it
rubbing your face in a ceramic disc will
cause more problems of its old lady
that's why probably who is this makeup
oh god it's so abrasive it's terrible um
let me just tell you let me give you an
example of what what we deal with here
at the verge there's an email I just got
you okay you're doing this well I won't
name names and we're change it we're
changing we understand the concern and
we're taking it okay but we wrote a post
today about sugar being used as payment
for weapons this is true we wrote a post
about this thing by North Korea paying
Cuba for weapons with sugar and we used
a photo of they paid in sacks of sugar
used a photo of sacks of sugar and the
sugar company was very mad at us that we
were defaming them by implying that no I
feel like the legitimate you know we
will change the image but it's just one
of those things that you never one of
those emails you never expect to receive
yeah like an angry sugar company
executives what if Korea paid Cuba in
like angry editorials yeah and I used
your editorials hey pretty much Jimmy
there's so
gotcha i really i love i would flatter
knowing that my you have the rage filled
editorials are now premium they're
helping used as currency somewhere in
the world you should introduce yourself
so that I can i yeah hi I'm Nilay Patel
I'm Paul Miller i'm ross miller you
might notice that josh is not here josh
has been murdered hmm and we're looking
for the killer hmm who's hi to get a bag
of sugar uh no Josh Easy's often stuff
he's gonna be good yeah look he's a
company man now he's got company things
he's a josh is at the stock market right
now buying and selling commodities most
likely sugar but not this company's
imagine Josh at the stock market like in
a crowd of people to screaming buy buy
buy sell sell yeah oh yes almost yes I'm
pretty sure that's actually it's really
good Josh within 50 feet of the stock
market that's what he starts doing
instinctively like it's like it's like a
range detector like do you are you near
the stock market right why he doesn't
here's an easy way to check is Josh
yelling bye bye bye it was like take the
train because you might accidentally end
up on a line that's like it's too close
craving it it's a hazard okay what's
well we this is by the way this is the
verge cast this is which my god I hope
you knew that before this began in which
we talked about pretty much anything we
want but occasionally also talked about
tech news culture news the culture of
technology news which is broken quite
frankly in other an assoc economic
issues on you're doing this broke you
got this guy our culture is broken
culture cultures our culture of
knowledge abuse is broken yes but they
the news of technology culture that's
working fine so let's start with broken
technology culture this would be the
AT&amp;amp;T next and the verizon edge phone
upgrade plants mmm-hmm do you want you
to the facts do you want to start
screaming I just want to start going
yeah can I get to a fact real quick you
the facts man alright the facts real no
no I want to do a fact in fact I got a
tmobile phone yeah I got one right here
bro what up here I sent us on them I saw
this on the mobile show a couple days
ago I'm now paying each of the major
carrier so I feel completely justified
bill in just ragging all the way four of
them not all 4 i'm mostly pity sprint so
if you see you see me right a pity
editorial about sprint you know where
thats that's coming from the heart do
you the facts of these I don't want to
talk about that whatever just tell me
what's happening on please product okay
well first and foremost this is all
coincidentally happens just after
t-mobile announced that you can upgrade
your phone every six months yeah you
give the phone back you pay this like
ten dollar months and up subsidy or
whatever you want to know it 18teen
verizon have come back doing something
very similar although the details of
which have you more or less paying for
the phone twice giving the phone back
and biologicals screwed out of your
money just to get a chance of by phone
again and again and again and again
right so look so t-mobile announced jump
rich was so that the the big thing
t-mobile did was we're gonna lower the
price of our plans and we are not going
to give you a device if you wan device
you can like participate in some other
programs it purchases and I so you can
buy the whole thing out front or you can
pay monthly installments and then this
is prior to announcing this is prior to
asking jump then the jump is mobile if
you want to get ahead of the cycle you
can pay ten dollars a month for
insurance and in addition to the
insurance you get to switch your phone
every six months right but your data
plan for your monthly plan you're still
paying the subsidizing that's not on
Team oh I don't know you're right kemo
no so in t-mobile it's like you're
paying it's a lot of different monthly
installments but you know what each of
them is go right all right t-mobile says
this is what you your phone plan is this
is what your installment plan to pay
this for this phone that are you
actually own now right so timo was like
here's your service here's the phone if
you want to accelerate how fast you're
getting a phone you can pay an extra fee
a month right this is what they call
like phase 2 of 3 like t-mobile is a
parent this is phase two seems crazy
with tmobile you could just pay off the
phone because you are paying as if it
was like a credit card you could bail it
off and get another phone so in response
AT&amp;amp;T yes exactly in response ATT and
Verizon did a thing which is I believe
like one of the biggest rip-offs maybe
in history in terms of like wireless
carrier pricing the great mobile swindle
it's a great mobile swindle and what
they're so right now just think just
start with me here because this is
actually contentious and Helen's three
years fila readers keep arguing with me
about this I'm just gonna start doing so
right now if you buy you can go to
verizon or AT&amp;amp;T okay you can buy a
galaxy s4 for one
9 then you can like sign up for a
two-year wireless service deal and at
the end of two years you must sign up
for a new year contra don't you get a
two-hundred-dollar phone yes yeah
whatever but at the end of two years
you've paid what's called seventy or
eighty dollars a month for service from
one of the big two and you have a phone
you've paid no other prices right you've
paid 200 hours the top you fade eighty
dollars for two years you're done now
you have a phone you've gotten the
service somewhere in there verizon is
paid off the phone right right and we
know how much rise in values the phone
because you can buy it up front without
a contract for 680 doll here's the
loaded question do we know how much of
that phone is actually in the monthly
payment so that we don't but it's
obvious to the wort like you can just
look at the numbers right somewhere
verizon is collecting six hundred
dollars from you six hundred yards from
you right you pay 200 dollars up front
and you pay for all the service and get
to keep the phone that means they've
taken they've allocated some amount of
money towards the purchase of the phone
and that's why you get to keep it after
two years exactly right so they've
caught so the best get mean just doing
the math two hundred dollars minus four
hundred eighty dollars divided right
that's how much the difference is 480 /
24 is twenty dollars a month I really
wish we brought a whiteboard in today we
should I should have done like a glenn
beck style I couldn't do it man I'm so
good I'm tense goes I'm saying so good
I'm so mad about this like but that is
obvious and like right before I wrote
the eighteen t piece that's calling next
to rip off I call ATT and yell with them
before I run through verizon piece today
I like straight up was like there is a
subsea like if you look at their sec
filings both companies admit that
somewhere in their prices exists a
subsidy to pay off the phone right right
that this is like not controverted and
and ATT recently switched it from you
could upgrade at like 18 now it's 24 but
now it's 24 so then on top of this so
that's like everybody understands this
right you buy the phone for two hundred
dollars up to two years you get the
phone you're paying the money and your
part in your plan pricing someone by my
math you're about a third of what you're
paying is for the phone but yeah they
won't I mean I've asked them over and
over it just tell me the percentage that
I can really do the math for real we can
make it and they won't do it because
they know that makes them look more evil
than ever right one the men when they
don't give me the number i have to guess
the number and then the argument
can be but you're just guessing the
number they gave me the number be like
you're not guessing the number on BT
dubs they're evil right so they won't
give me the number because that they
want to attack me at you're just
guessing the number which is cool good
tactics I applaud your courage in battle
but I will win this war uh uh okay so
you're gonna win this war when like
their customer base is just keep it up
and growing but your metrics I'm just
gonna get print I'm just gonna keep
yelling dressed up but I want Neal I to
break down so more regiments oh so then
if you add next door edge to this what
they're doing is they're saying you're
going to buy the device you're going to
buy it you're going to pay us six
hundred eighty dollars for the device or
650 or whatever the number is and we're
going to break it into these monthly
payments so over it so the simplest way
to think about is that two-year contract
again so if you are on verizon you sign
up for edge you 24 monthly payments for
that galaxy s4 after after you've paid
fifty percent of the phone you can get a
new one but if you just wait it out just
think about this math under the normal
one you pay two hundred dollars up front
you pay two years of service no
additional fees the end of it you get a
phone with edge after 24 months you've
paid 680 dollars for the phone and
you've been paying this the service fees
it would have gotten you a the rest of
the way there and you get a and you get
you you end up with the phone but you
got you get it you pay two hundred
dollars for a new phone or do you just
get a phone you just get a phone okay
well so that's two hundred dollars off
notes on you phone it's to look look
think about it this way it under the
standard plan okay 200 hours i know i
know not in the grand scheme of things
but I'm saying like at the end of a
normal contract you have to typically
pay no no the end everyone just get the
phone my look yeah right you get to eat
it's your phone right right because you
say I'm saying at the end of a next or
an edge thing you get to keep the phone
you get to keep your phone but do you
pay 200 dollars to get a new phone yes
no no you you start you just start over
so you're not paying up the down payment
at all you don't pay the down paint
you're spreading out the number right
right so they're saying you can pay six
hundred eighty dollars like now we can
break it into chunks but the service
plan fee is always the same now if you
just compare that to the regular way
which is some amount up front and the
service plan at the end of it like
they're just making a huge profit
because it because the money that they
used to take from your plan to put
against the price of the phone now is
just profit right because at some point
that's second month 18 for edge and
about month 12 for next literally
whatever sub seated in calculating
towards the phone in your plan is now
pure profit because you're paying off
the phone like you've gone over the
amount that they would have paid and
like if you're gonna make clear to is
like they're saying if you pay off half
the phone at least for rises you pay off
fifty percent the phones device you can
trade it and get the new one early right
but none of that subsidize payment
you're paying the eighty dollars a month
that doesn't count her at all because we
can't tell you how much look here's my
rule and I put this the end of the
verizon piece today if to figure out
what 18teen verizon are doing you need
an accountant instead of an engineer
you're getting screwed that's it that's
that's like the simpler good at this
they're incredibly good at this and they
have this problem where their
shareholders this is the the word is
called ARPU average revenue per user
their shareholders want to see
increasing our poop this is true now
what's the fastest way to do that the
fastest ways to collect more revenue
from users now you can do that in two
ways you can provide additional services
and charge more money for them because
they're valuable to people or you can
trick people into paying more money for
 they're already receiving they are
clearly like one hundred percent
tricking people into paying more money
because people want new phones faster
and they can play this like three card
monte to get that out of that the big
thing I think about this is the that's
what I was asking earlier it's this is
about getting people to upgrade more
often it's about harnessing that desire
you increase your RP yes yes it is but
I'm saying I'm saying like the reason
this will probably they'll probably make
a lot of money off of this right you if
you I pay attention yeah yeah because
people want to upgrade their phones more
often and right now the the carrier is
the way they've set this up like I don't
have this problem because I've got
t-mobile and I got an iphone 5 but like
yeah you know you don't have you don't
have service across like I'm sure why
it's what I'm saying cut because this
because I've set this up as an
installment plan where I own this phone
at the end of when the iphone 5s comes
out I
can pay this phone off sell it and use
that money towards the iphone 5s so I
have kind of taken the power over being
able to upgrade more great right right
but currently AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon have this
setup where they only get people to buy
new phones every it look here here's the
symptoms like an exciting if you buy
your own if you buy your own phone and
bring it to a regular planet 18t you're
being cheated sure you're straight up
being cheated because everybody
understands that 18 tease plans are
priced to allow you to buy a subsidized
and then everyone understands but our
listeners okay I'm confident that people
who listen to watch the verge cast
understand that right you pay six
hundred eighty dollars from elmont
iphone and go to ATT you're paying some
premium to subsidize somebody else's 200
on our iPhone right right the big trick
here is that eighteen t is getting you
to pay that six hundred eighty dollars
without the benefit of owning the phone
yourself because when you trade it in at
12 months you're literally get attacked
they're trying to create more of you
they're going to try to create more
suckers like you and Josh who do buy
iphones and bring them too great I know
that's the thing that's why I'm react
Lisa strongly dislike but I'm well aware
that I'm being cheated like one hundred
percent of where I don't like it because
i don't want to pay that premium for a
subsidized phone i never by now
harnessing like people want to but
here's what you should do a tnt you
should stop selling phones you should
stop charging people at premium you
should allow anybody to bring whatever
phone they want to your service and want
the phone makers compete to bring down
the price of phone but just like laptop
makers competed to bring down the price
of laptops tablet makers have competed
to bring down the price of tablets and
every other market in the world competes
to bring down prices for consumers are
raising the value of the products but
not to call you a hippie but here's what
you're saying 18 capitalist thing I
could say it's make less money with what
you're doing do this is a way for them
to make more money no one's gonna
realize they want this plan and they're
grandfathered in this is a test of how
committed you are to your terrible
relationship but yeah you don't a choice
what do you mean take this phone you
sent six dollars on good oh you
can't write right you like you are
literally locked into one of these two
it they know that they have the biggest
and best networks you know
which one of them is bigger or better
and they do that constantly I'll tell
you verizon is bigger and better but I
don't use them because their devices are
more locked technologically than any
other device and I will not pay for that
except for my ipad which i pay for
because i feel like i'm obligated to pay
for all these services or I'm going to
criticize them as heavily I do so you're
welcome verizon for my thirty dollars a
month please just died I'm very angry
obviously obviously like it's just such
a con it's their take their literally
making you pay twice for these phones in
the end of two years you will paid twice
for that for that gal yes it's okay so
it's a total con it's totally terrible
right they're gonna make a lot of money
and what are we gonna do about it I
think you look if edge and next work you
will watch these carriers to profits
with sore because I there are you will
soaring and parcel shot to go buy it
unlocked phone and bring it to them
because they're winning yeah in verizon
today reported earnings they added a
million subscribers right there is a lot
of like in no ways about whether or not
the iphone was going to sell well and
like they actually sold more iphones and
they anticipated 3.9 million 3.9 set 3.5
said iphones doing fine everybody loves
iphones good for us yeah where's the
water on them for free right now which a
great game very visible very addicting
where's my water where's my wallet yeah
it's funny cuz uh Brook Lopez who's the
center on the Nets once told me about it
I was like I'm not playing that game and
now it's free and I'm completely diff
that is the biggest name-drop I think
I've ever heard you did that literally
happened I use like a video I did when
we did the Barclays center has told me
to get this app but I'm poor but i have
used to play baldur's i would pay for I
until it was free on the on the on the
app store this is true happy it's the
Barclays Center video as she was like I
was like what's yours i know that i was
like what sir ok i was like what's your
favorite out and he's like when I used
my galaxy s4 like it was a very like is
that I love where's my water and I was
like that's dumb and not participating
in your in your you know endorsement
lifestyle yes we have the video look I'd
like to point out the brook lopez makes
me look incredibly short and fat so he
won that battle but man that hair I mean
are we just looking at it still without
you know that's all we got to the
picture I mean okay fine no nor picture
okay oh man oh no but like so I mean
Verizon's continue to gain almost
million customers a quarter they're fine
they're making a lot of money
make a lot of money and the thing is
like these networks these devices and
these services are not like luxury items
they're like necessities to be alive
this Paul will tell you right as Poland
definitely tell you um do you think this
is is um like t-mobile has good ideas
and these carriers like hmm t-mobile
might be getting an edge on us or like
they saw the way t-mobile was doing is
like we could tweak that and we can make
so much more money yeah you don't think
it's not early anyway threat what I saw
treats from from from Sascha Segan when
they when 18 he rolled out next and is
like 18 TS and pretty good accountants
because like it just adds if you just do
the math a tad like ATT is collecting
the full money for a phone that they're
already charging you for like it is a
price like it's in their sec for so
smart they are air they know their plans
include some research the wrong line of
work I tell you I should definitely I
will be joining 18t is and you see ya
I'm gonna join the nets as the new
center who I'm just gonna stay what
Brooke where's your water now yeah all
right what's the next and I we don't
have to rage about this look I don't
know if look t-mobile might suck it
sucks I love I don't want to rage about
this wait a second well yes a legacy
models great like I so I'm like living
the my money is where my mind right now
I spent 650 doll or six hundred dollars
on unlock google play one which is like
the thing that I've been wanting forever
right right right whatever phone i want
with stock i bought t-mobile's plan like
no subsidy about the plant exact thing
that i wanted which was thirty dollars a
month for unlimited data in 100 minutes
you have LTE coverage movies sometimes
ten percent of the time in New York
today also in a second I go home or I go
to Becky's house nothing I have this
luxury of like because I spend that year
without the internet anytime I have the
internets like oh this is really cool i
have the internet mm-hmm you know and so
like an tmobile is that sort of service
where you look at your phone this is
cool i have the internet right now yeah
because like it's anywhere between edge
or 4G or LTE within like two blocks
right and so um I'm fine with it I'm
loving it and i love the price and I'm
and I feel so I've always wanted to be
on tmobile just to be
able to say i want t mobile I'm for
years I'm so proud to be a mobile the
network to have when it for a year and
now it seems like a knowing myself baby
before i left the internet and like how
frustrating it is when you can't get
connection and you want one it I mean I
just I I've learned to be okay with not
having the internet but t-mobile is your
year a full year so everyone wants to go
offline for a full year what you can do
you'll be ready really she a tmobile but
they're also they are expanding their
LTE towers though that's it looked you
know has a lot of work to do i also i
will say John Legere keeps our keeps
retweeting me so I'm hoping like that
this flirtation will end an interview
the basically ask him on a date for like
two months yeah the vignetting we got
word I got t-mobile and I they were
still not quite there just run rolling
out their LTE towers but I was at a
friend's house we're gonna watch a movie
on the roof but her wife I didn't go up
to the roof he told me sorry oh I did
and so we tethered to my t-mo phone
which is on 4g it wasn't an LTE okay and
and it uh were fortunate i got me here
we go luckily it um and we watched a
movie off of amazon prime yeah full
bitrate so 2000 kilobits not a single
stutter the whole time oh look i'm gonna
phone oh yeah you sure you're saying
your t-mobile works here yes surely I've
got three bars of 4g you need to take
that I got remind me she does not need
to take the call ha I got four bars of
Wi-Fi let me turn this off what's the
next thing we're talking the Hyperloop
ooh that's fun yes Oh Hyperloop a few
bars of LTE bio it isn't do you know how
much taught what I heard about hyper
let's explain what the Hyperloop is for
everybody could get Elon Musk you do
that why i run the speed test said that
that um he could figure out a way to
make make a commuter thing between LA
and san francisco and a half an hour
right which it works out to about 600
miles per hour he would be something
that wouldn't be quite like a train
because you could hop on at any time you
want to be like it would it be a
scheduled thing
and it pretty much and that it could be
powered with like maybe solar panels
along the the the train track or
whatever but they key has he's just a
big teeth yeah cuz he's like basically
defying most of physics and he's tratas
really trying he he wants to be Tesla he
does this is he where he's like here's
my thing that does have a castle masla
never let s like here's my thing where I
will promise you a thing that will that
conspiracy theorists decades from now
can I just prefer back I'd you watch for
a moment ha t-mobile here in the studio
two bars of lto now we're down to h plus
network communications issue crash speed
test app which by the way is a totally
Jack app on Android about two bars in
okla should be Okla first of all come on
buchla and then totally ashamed of this
app in android because it's garbage
that's your problem but yet so but uh
1.2 down on LTE when I had it which I no
longer have and faster on h plus now 2.8
town and then 18t totally smoked it for
down on LTE Wow I will say the Euclid
speed test app on the iPhone choice good
work koukla choice I know like like
everybody everybody basically assumes
the Nikola Tesla like came up with like
some sort of free energy levitate all
sorts of things that the government has
suppressed right and I feel like which
they did this is one of those things
that Elon Musk will sort out like
disappear like man like we'll never see
him again handsome never see him again
this is elaborate decades from now will
say man he figured out a way to travel
here's guns look up no obvious i can
lobbyist was trying to get some
high-speed rail saying let me say a
suppressor one-eyed that picture looking
at I took it was at D in May well you
drew I saw I was no I was very free as
the live logging solo so right i was
drooling but only out of panic because
that's the worst uh and he is one of the
most charismatic like like obvious
visionary people that I've ever heard
speak he's alright like you
you believe it right he everything that
he's done is like people like that'll
never work and he just does it like we
just did a big a big thing about
Hyperloop because there's people have
been conceiving of ways to do this sort
of travel and his promises are a little
bit beyond anybody's like theoretical
projections like even like theoretically
if you could just clear out all the way
in between these things and build
whatever you want with all the money
could you do this his is argue on a
little high on the estimates of well
right feed and cost but he it's not
physically possible in defy the laws of
physics right totally well just years
just to what the bestop like it's a
summary is like I wouldn't believe this
if it wasn't him saying right and so but
so just just the scientists the fact the
hyper and Russell to the piece which you
read which is amazing the basic
challenge right is it's like 320 350
miles from LA to San Francisco right so
to do that in half an hour the thing has
to go 600 miles an hour right because
there's some acceleration and
deceleration the top and bottom right so
something like 600 miles an hour which
is twice as fast as the current fastest
train so there's like there's the math
like and you've got to do twice as good
as what we can already do and if they're
important I have to reduce air friction
so a lot of people think it's some sort
of like closed loop try and evaluate
them so the air is like the air from the
previous car pushes the next car or
something bright people don't know well
then we know it's like you get really
Air drag by creating it in a vacuum
which is nothing but eat musk is like
this is amazing because like literally
we have a diagram from a fan it's like
set in comic sans like in our report is
all we did like this is the best guess
are made in comic sans everything look
if you're a scientist you're not using
Comic Sans you're not a real scientist
this is like a Banaszak this is want to
make the science friendly this is Jetson
stuff like this is the Jets an elevator
on a horizontal plane sure like what was
that in a vacuum can I can I tell you I
want it to work how you want to work yes
you know hot wheel they put you in a
giant gun fire the guy Oh hot wheels
haha Hot Wheels jumps work I am where
you have a Hot Wheel track and it like
shoots you out and you go up and you
jump on the track but then the landing
thing is like it's wider yes I too oops
sorry to just for my nars and the car
lands on that yeah so so you have a
lander that's wide wide mouth lander on
each White House wonder how wide by
planner at his side shoot the Hot Wheel
car my favorite kind of fish I think
it's go so you're saying magnets I just
I just want to point this out so you
want it to work in the hot wheel style
which by the way generally ends with
like the car like sideways flipped over
no maybe if you don't know how to do
your hot wheels right no I'm you saying
I'm so they doing when you're when
you're when you're talking wide enough
Lander yeah I'm like I'm gonna drive I
don't know my step know if any part of
this journey involves a widemouth later
pick up that Ferrari spin each wheel
they need to have the same you know you
can't like you can't use a bum hot wheel
on a sweet track little wide mouth led
by the way I will tell you this and I'm
gonna say this and I know them gonna
make some people very angry go for it
hot wheels or drank matchbox is where
it's at you were such a restoring pasta
wait are you still recovering you saying
that's like deep dish pizzas are you
kidding me okay hey deepa cheese is
better it is I don't know what the hell
you're sorry it is me hot wheels are
made like crap and match boxes like the
real I was no I was just in the
chicago airport and there was this side
driving Hot Wheels everywhere first also
the ladies Thank You thing that is
exactly exactly what this Hyperloop
still don't see there's even a loop wait
there wasn't there's a Hot Wheels out
that was a loop-de-loop on a highway if
anyone in the boot can find it just look
up hop hi there was a sign is life in
the chicago airport at a restaurant i
was at that said it's like bad manners
to put ketchup on your hot dog in the
city chicago city limits on each card
that's the sort of bad thought processes
and life decisions that people from
chicago made anything Christians like
using match racing or do you think it's
time that you moved to New York just
putting it out there on the broadcast
there and if you'd like chris taylor to
move to New York
now would be an excellent time to tweet
at sea power and ask him when he's
moving to New York no I'm gonna I'm
gonna do is do it right now I'm going to
pause to allow our listeners to do such
thing don't worry we'll wait why wish my
kennel hot dog sacrilege oh whoa are you
kidding hey Chicago thing uh matchbox
just clearly better than hot wheels I
don't understand what world you put
ketchup on your matchbooks Clark's
magical yes please please put ketchup on
all the matchbooks in your home Superman
 got everything we just want the
Grusha cago fire right ever since then
we're using her ketchup only to prevent
fires a pitch a fresh face to be it's a
profitable ever since a great catch of
famine of two thousand uh oh poor Kris
for Christmas hate to interrupt this
with a tech news but uh breaking news
just happened Microsoft of course
releasing their quarterly earnings right
now and uh turns out they took a 900
million dollar hit on the surface RT
this quarter well they announced it yes
so they just cut the price of the
surface right it did yes by 3i like it's
like 300 hours now it's ya less'n not
even a thing but ya know it's somewhere
on there microsoft just announced
earnings for its fiscal quarter for 2013
and while the company posted strong
results guess what results show a 900
million dollar lost through the surface
RT quote inventory adjustments which
means no one is buying the damn thing
yeah well and they they cut the they cut
the price too but this is like be cut
the price recently like most others
reflects on a projected loss that's a
loss that's a loss hmm that's a loss
that's uh we've talked at length about
the service I mean just at length I mean
yeah I think the RT is like a product
without a customer right I think it's a
really good idea literally yeah well I
mean this is I can quantify it now it's
like you've been in fillers and like I
know the Microsoft people are gonna tell
me and I tweeted this last week but I
now believe this is true and I don't
know why it is I want to find out so
like when I piss off the Apple people
like they're mad in there like angry and
like they have charts and graphs show
how everything I say is wrong because
Apple like does well every quarter right
so like shut up you idiot they're
selling more iphones than ever it's like
okay that doesn't negate any criticism
like that's not how criticism works but
you're very loud and you have a graph
and the graduates in your favor so
there's no arguing with you google
people are just like super mean like
they're like I'm gonna come to your
house and knife you in the back because
you don't love open source mm-hmm and
that's like when you irritate the Google
people when irritate the Microsoft
people there so sad that they're like
why don't you support our cause why why
you don't understand anything about
Microsoft you don't understand our pain
you don't say how Microsoft has changed
when it's like why are you trying to
convince me that I've betrayed you
mm-hmm because that's how I feel like
I'm sorry the the product is bad and
that nobody wants to buy a surface RT I
really am but just saying it is not an
act of betrayal it's just a statement of
fact and now i have my own chart and
graph and i'd like to present it to you
now we don't actually have a chart do it
hey i got a chart graph yeah it's a bar
chart graph it's the shape of service
you know what it's a hard out so there's
my chart graph for Microsoft is
beautiful but in terms like Microsoft
full quarter results I'm just saying I'm
sorry that I betrayed you with facts are
you I'm sorry that the truth continually
betrays you surface RT fanboys hey hey
I'm gonna do bootcamp on my macbook air
are you Norman is 8 that's really
excited you know why I mean I don't know
about when did the screen swiping hey
we'll do some screen swiping he's just
for a game so I don't think I need to do
when to say mmm that probably
shouldn't do windows why not no just you
talking about when it I want it because
this leads right into Intel and I think
that's really fascinating to right
that's the Big Sur let's get to some of
the other numbers Microsoft move on to
the RT in general Microsoft earned four
point nine seven billion off of nineteen
point nine billion revenue for quarter
for it's actually better year-over-year
of course entertainment devices division
rested soul this whole thing's been read
by is obviously the biggest moneymaker
for Microsoft always has well not always
has been but it's we do have very pretty
charts the other Microsoft quarterly
dues at the verge calm it's a very nice
but I chart can I Evans or demand work
make it so okay nope didn't work
okay Evan it doesn't no no no go Evan
also not me oh it works there you go
this is by division you seen the rights
uh yeah no sorry my bad business of
course yeah the most intimate of ice to
De least next to online cuz
entertainment vegetable eat at least no
no I'm online in the least yeah I'm on
always was at least but like area
devices may be other did the least so
online is like other online services
Reinert a min device is obviously the
xbox it used to be the xbox in the zune
God rest his soul haha and akin and
let's not forget the connect meditating
devices was always a series of failures
and the xbox and now it's just the xbox
with obviously their sales are falling
because there's about to be a new xbox
right and the cycle and then there's
windows and applications res xbox live
gold entertainment devices or is that
going to today I don't know yeah I'm
sure so much why it doesn't much like
this is like this divisions like change
now right this is like this is nice it's
cute but it's a new Microsoft right
there's a whole new Microsoft in like
they're there now functionally organized
right they're going to do they're gonna
have an operating systems group and like
mm-hmm an xbox reopen like it's our
hardware and services group or a
hardware in devices group on which is
all great but like ultimately the the
thing how many reorg have they had in
the past five this is no this is this is
the big one is the one but one the one
Microsoft one microsoft and I won't
believe they're organizing like Apple
now but like what is like needs to be
understood about the surface thing in
these revenues in the 900 million dollar
Lawson or T is that flat out their
attempt to compete with the ipad has
failed yes right this first shot got it
coming at the ipad his leg utterly
failed now but they have a really good
job competing with the apple TV they're
doing an amazing job for you um it was
your shirt right the xbox is good the
xbox one yeah well we'll see dude i was
so oh my gosh what on the podcast
everybody's all like the xbox yeah all
the podcast being you me and josh you
ain't the person you're talking to I
don't know like we don't i don't i'm not
on pod guys very often now anymore so I
don't know what I told you my area that
you're unstuck in time have I mentioned
this to you that's
right I think you like you like blip in
and then like you're here and like you
say awesome things and I clip out nobody
knows where you are and you like put
back in mm-hmm that is true sometimes
you're in the future sometimes in the
past mm-hmm many times you're in a
firefight and rents it Preston that's
literally the yeah i know i'm just a lot
not mad I'm just very happy I'm doing a
lot of like a tray you work and never
even the story yeah okay what were you
saying on the blog about the icebox well
no I'm just saying like day they went
too far non-gamer and it's fighting them
in the ass well the only hardcore gamer
non gamer in general but yeah but I mean
but you know after e3 man i'm i am way
out unstuck of time but uh way too late
for this analysis so we can move on we
should move on okay so this is like
leads us right into Intel right look um
the xbox one will probably great but
ultimately it's gonna do fine the next
Vadhu great christmas is coming ways
give me happy everyone will be everyone
will be happy nobody will write it in
christmas is coming by the way the most
ominous thing you can say the most
positive way mm-hmm anyway um they'll be
fine but this iPad thing the surface RT
thing is a bad like they can't sell them
there's nobody who wants to buy a
Windows computer that isn't windows
right it isn't the whole deal so windows
8 1 is out brought some stuff back I
think the the that will be where they
focus their efforts because that should
be where they focus their efforts and on
top of that intel announced earnings was
yesterday did before and their CEO is
like we're gonna focus all of our
efforts on the mobile now which is like
five years later Intel's like Oh things
that move around mmm right that's the
one that's a so you talked about Haswell
bunch obviously but they're bad about
that for so long but no but their bet
now I think with Haswell in particular
is why convertible laptop e tablet
things which I'm not a two-way but I I
didn't see one that's good i will do
want to say thank you intel for this
thing is that you had a new one this is
the new macbook air 11-inch 11 inch I
run so much starcraft so much Diablo I
can't even run like some windows games
in wine and I'm going to put friggin
boot came out
here I can run do you ever run it's here
I don't know maybe like a word processor
an email client that connects you with
your co work nope just around let me
look at my dog I've got notes at
messages reminders but i'll put her i'll
put a robot maybe the lovers you wanna
know how that book is coming yeah i got
a reminder to pick up the Garland's burn
do you never forgot you know you don't
poke burn and unstuck in time it's jimmy
book a book Joe did bug burn the ass yes
you have a professional website now I
made a website did is it the vertical
space ranger it's a it's so if you like
not explained here if you're listening
this an audio by the way Chris has no
idea why hundreds of people have asked
me moved to New York which is amazing
I'm good we should all just go again
yeah well we're time full weight so he
sees tweeting his confusion which is
amazing Paul what yeah what do you think
Microsoft should do I just get Microsoft
and Intel her like they're obviously
like in the weeds right I well I think
um I guess we're probably going to talk
about this in a bit but like by the way
that comment was like a little please
don't email me about how Microsoft is in
the weeds I know that they're doing fine
i know that many of their businesses
will succeed I know that you're gonna
call me epithets regarding my gender my
sexuality my personal hygiene all these
things I've been questioned by you all
of them are the true jerks who view this
program then read my writing but let me
tell you man ipad doing really well
microsoft stuff yeah and like just deal
with it like they've got to solve that
problem I don't know how they're gonna
solve that problem maybe you like their
products maybe you don't I don't I think
they should solve that problem how are
they gonna solve that problem I think
they need to make a new kind of product
think about right right now right now
Microsoft's biggest success that I think
the reason why the xbox one could still
probably do super well despite all this
bad PR while everybody realizes like it
yeah is xbox live yeah right which was a
new super innovative super incredible
really well done thing microsoft hasn't
done the big new thing in a long time
they've been doing you know they've been
imitating trying to play catch-up and I
don't think when you're up against
people like you know say if your Samsung
and Apple you're knocking them you know
you're not going to imitate and play
catch up faster than Samsung and Apple
we can make what they're going to make
right and I think Samsung is winning and
phones because they are new thing was we
are going to make phones that are too
large and people will somehow like that
right and and you know Apple is
obviously pretty famous for its various
new things and microsoft needs a new
interesting thing i think you know i
think it's probably wearables but you
know I've talked about this a million
times but Microsoft has a research
division that has some really
interesting stuff that they don't
utilize and they need to like they need
to go all in on it and really really you
know do something that's it they need to
invest heavily in something you don't
think that that that's why they're so
heavily focused on like the Xbox one
like I mean cuz they really are right
that's where like they're putting a nice
show much emphasis on xbox now I think
there is enough technology in the xbox
one to do some really interesting things
that people haven't been able to do
before in their home like like be able
to you know the even the fact that it's
always listening being able to like you
know we should I talk about that to say
something and how do you feel about that
happens is it as a strident
anti-government activist yeah there is
that I'm finally know if any personal
bird chef is gonna like leave the grade
and become a survivalist it's Paul it's
not because I'm scared of the government
I'm scared of what's inside but you know
with the new kinect there's too much
rage with the new connection see exactly
what is inside you hello uh-uh it's okay
I would never rage against another
Miller or what I would rage against
Russia Oh
but yeah it's like the connect though I
mean it does like it's more powerful
it's always there for any living room oh
let's say on the couch oh my god digna
new Moto X always listening that's all
in your pocket all these things need
yeah all they need is you go settings
preferences I think you can turn bad
always on then you're fine but that's
like there's an option but what everyone
is like don't share my chit with the
government right like that's like turn
off again in like maybe like a secondary
option it's like stay on but leave and I
say no but if you read the contract like
thee will you know they will trump right
if need to know so we have the same
problem so somebody wrote me an email in
Lauren Fisher our general counsel email
and it was like hey I read your terms
and conditions it was great and you
should do that yes please go read our
privacy policy and there's a line in
there that's like what do we do with
your data it's like we take these
jealously protect your data we take all
the precautions or security right but if
the government comes calling like sadly
one of the prices of being a business is
that you have to comply with the law and
the law says you have to do stuff right
so it's like will protect your data up
until we have to like that we have two
is like a big deal and that big deal
it's like not and I get it so like
Microsoft has the same problem google
has the same song saying even if
Microsoft was totally goody-goody about
this they are capturing data that you
really don't want to cover right be and
there's like a and there's like a real
possibility that one of the things I
could do is be like well Mike you know
like well the xbox is sitting there in
your living rooms connected to Microsoft
server system always listening all right
that's like just turn over here's what
you don't like it but here's the big if
the big benefit having always if there's
like it's like a cost-benefit analysis
right it's like I don't want to be spied
on but if I turn this on with them spy
on me or like turn it on let Microsoft
listen everything happens or like Google
with everything this happens i get x y&amp;amp;z
benefit from those benefits are going to
start to stack up right like having a
phone that's always listening to you
would be really useful right I think
that's awesome also but but what I mean
what's like that was a future right now
start our buddies not create features
that could you know theoretically be you
know
I think I think if you're gonna start I
think they like the our government and
society needs to catch up with reality
of voice so I weird like I want to trust
Google which whatever maybe I don't I
want to trust Microsoft which whatever
maybe you don't same with Apple Facebook
whatever what I don't want to do is take
my trust of those companies and then
have it imputed into some trust of the
government well I so I think this is a
policy issue and I think if you have any
you shouldn't build the stuff that out
races the policy like I know that's in
danger no no no well here's you should
build a bill but like I don't acts like
a huge danger because you can't like
when we asked a question like can the
NSA use your xbox one camera to watch
you all the time like nobody knows the
answer so we don't know right we
definitely could if that bothers you and
and I difference between will they and
could use like yes really shake if if if
could they or will they if either we get
a quick quote clip of Ian Malcolm if
either of those don't talking about I
went Jurassic Park yeah that's what I
want can we play that right now for the
people if either of those really bother
you should not you should turn this set
this thing off all right really and I
but you I can ask I don't like you can't
be like you can't present to the normal
let's stop talking look at all these
benefits stop talking about the the
world and normals and consumers I Paul
Miller survivalist survivalist what my
xbox one bit like my phone to be
listening to me so that I can ask him
questions and to because I'm alone in
the woods all the times as I pop in and
out of time I would just like to know
where I am I don't want to hold down the
button on my iphone to activate Syria I
just want to pick up my phone and talk
to it I want to like do those things and
those are cool interesting features and
and from that capability will come a lot
of time instead of innovation agree with
you so so like I do company should not
stop doing this they should probably
very we made a way to exhibit I think
they're doing the right now or maybe
where they're like we can't talk about
this we'd love to talk about it we can't
talk about it like if you're gonna build
the camera that's always listening to
you being clear you need to straight-up
be like I agree with and then like we
will we will fight the government when
the NSA guys calling they are not
like they're kind of sort of saying it
they're like we're gonna file a lawsuit
or like you know but they need a
straight-on night when able puts out the
phone and good like these are companies
that I mean it's kind of hilarious like
Microsoft is like literally running like
the scroogled campaign about how Google
is always watching you and I'm gonna
camera in your home that's always
listening to you that's kind of the
internet like Google has enough problems
with like how much data could look like
they're about to put out a phone that's
literally always listening and
broadcasting information at Google like
if they're gonna do that they need to
preemptively say we're gonna we're
gonna fight to make sure this data stays
with us now there's some point at which
you want the bat like great bad guys
have a connect I would love I love for
lawmakers to be able to flip on the
camera and watch the bad guys they're
all right bad guys have a cell phone
there should probably some be some way
for the cops like monitor that guy but
all of that stuff has to happen in like
very clear very transparent very like
this is what we did there was a judge
involved the government had to argue
like stuff this stuff that you're used
to I do not have that stop it saturday
is important but i do not want them to
stop the innovation right so i mean it
also just as a whole more reading if you
wanna check out this later sean
hollister was a great piece about why
we're arguing over this can the NSA use
microsoft expects want to spy on you the
evidence being or the the reason we
talked a talk to us in the first place
was because we found out the government
was probably using skype video private
skype video sessions or we're tapping
into those so if Microsoft has given
them that or like if they've got into
that somehow could the same thing
happens is always on connect yes so you
really check out the piece it's a great
piece you should okay he's informed I'm
gonna stop yelling the next thing I'm
gonna be happy about Detroit has filed
for bankruptcy now Roy we're not we need
to talk about this but other choice but
have you be mad at me like are you happy
the Detroit overrated madam I never so
today bad um Danny Detroit Wow let's
talk about one place where Microsoft
could innovate Paul you mention this
earlier talk about Microsoft allegedly
testing a quote translucent aluminum
SmartWatch sir that's impossible because
aluminum is not trying to did say quote
that means one else I did not mean don't
get mad at me when I say quote all right
I'm completely absolved to blame maybe
it's a translucent / aluminum well
translucent
/ aluminum just be safe yeah if we just
say punctuation out loud we're okay
that's right right that's the same thing
like if you if you if you're talking to
your xbox one out loud right and you
insert some JavaScript inject code to
mess up the NSA servers then you're safe
for whatever you want to say after that
yes Xbox pseudo let me watch Netflix
alone sudo make me stay was there so
there's there to wearable stories one is
the surface washer the one I came out
today was Apple secret i watch team uh
there were some rumors about who was
being staffed on it us obviously small
device and fitness experts this seems
kind of obvious to me yeah like they're
all gonna make a watch this is me right
so obvious to me for a long time to
watch will always be watching you I'm
really excited who will watch the watch
watchmen they already a night I'm so
sorry I'm tired steer from yeah you
really and you should really go I really
should uh no look they're all gonna make
watch an Apple Google Microsoft right
and like that's great I think these
rumors are right now ever that it's this
is the thing that can make I think
they're all they're all trying to do TV
stuff I've said this 100 times yeah well
trying to do TV stuff they can't because
there are TV companies TV companies suck
right but they there are no TV companies
in the watch business but it's also like
it's awesome like consumers like they
don't buy TVs that often but they'll buy
watches and at least the idea is like
you can probably get someone to buy come
on or watch very often I think this is a
similar moment to like coming out with
the ipod I mean I think you're in this
ipod I think you're in this the same
sort of moment where there are there are
a few the ipod a few horrible mp3
players out there and they're really
Jenky and i've got these weird and menus
that you have to use like d pads on and
it's real you know real pain and then
you can come out with something that's
at actually really elegant solution and
really beautiful and really easy to use
in a ton of people I maybe not at the
scale of the ipod ipod because you have
a lot of these kiddos already in your
phone here's years i think here's there
is going to be so here's the major
difference when the ipod came out the
competitors were like the rio create
if the nomads no but they were junk yep
okay another where's uh this is this is
a great product I'm so proud of them
this is the other pebble I can like
Tetris great goodness I mean but this
this is a real equivalent to what a
knowledge they have been Rio equivalents
this is actually like a so much better
it could be better oh you do what it
just missing what the pebble is missing
is like software support right when iOS
7 comes out the pebbles going to get way
better like straight up like they
dripped a lot of the stuff in iOS 7 when
the next version of pebble app for
Android comes out or Google builds in
the deportees Android and no offense I
think this is great but this is going to
look like the creative Rio compared to
the next generation of smart watches so
here's what i've heard about the apple
one is it right now it has battery life
problems because they're trying to like
make it run a full operating system with
like a full color screen which is why
the pebble has an e-ink screen now I'm
not saying Apple can't solve those
problems they they certainly do not with
the iphone 5 but they've made other
products with good battery life but like
that's like the trade-off like you can
only build a battery so big and a device
that small right I don't disagree that
all of the products from big
manufacturers will like be nicer be
built better this one's a good at that's
this is what that was quite good a new
innovative thing like as great as
Kickstarter's gotten you and you have a
company that can put billions of dollars
behind rd on something yeah you can get
pretty awesome stuff it's true i mean
like that that's the famous ipod nano
story of getting that you know real
sourcing that really small hard drive to
all of a sudden you know or ipod mini
what's right you know I think I said
maybe maybe I'm wrong maybe I'm using
old think for how companies are able to
innovate maybe Kickstarter is the answer
but I really believe that that you know
these three companies have a chance to
make something really amazing that's
going to be pretty steep for companies
really Samsung no I look I think this is
like I agree with you this is like did
there I mean it's like the ipod in that
there are products that exist none of
them are good enough for the mainstream
but the products it existed in the ipod
moment were like a universally garbage
right
her but they were garbage like I had a
lot of them like that what was the no
ma'am you know that was a literal like
they took a double spin shell the hard
drive in it and like super glued it shut
do the not agree oh that's what it looks
so good I enjoy how to Rio a the Rio had
a nekkid by 64 megabyte backpack that
was it was quite literally slid off it
only cost like four hundred dollars oh
there we go screen that's Apple slide
from the screen and I could like that
mean that's a slide of garbage my one
per second pearl jam mp3 is I got from
limewire these sound it's still good on
that god I had a lot of really bad mp3's
yeah there's a reason I went to law
school I want a nap sure I don't want to
listen to all my music via mini disc I
love it if we deliver these players is
not like a slashed alternate reality
where everything happens on mini disc
there's an episode of seaquest dsv do
remember this way like what the ticket
and was no no fuss find it internet just
my next you know it sucks wow we got a
couple options you can I to do and I'll
leave it to you choose your own room the
one mini the myford lawsuit or Netflix
and the Emmys well let's talk about
those netflix is simple yes Lex was
nominated for a bunch of Emmys for house
of cards and rest development right
listen cards is super notable cuz it's
all it's obviously it and it's a Netflix
show right three no no they got 99
promise for house a car clean the big
ones which is best drama just Actor Best
Actress like these are the ones like
yeah every drama like goes for this is
the first time an online-only show has
been nominated and they got three of
them Hemlock Grove verse development in
house of cards right into the
nominations big deal for netflix not the
biggest channel of course Fox as 19
everyone else is like 40 hundred
whatever 40 a hundred i think uh HP i
was like a hundred seven yeah 44 you
look if you look at like the other
companies a game CZ yeah it's like that
make sense dozens if not hundreds of
dollars and then like Kevin Spacey Owen
best factor I don't know um up against
he's up against who was it i think jon
hamm bryan cranston's ruff ruff well
actually if you want to like wandering
out for saying I think Bryan Cranston
not this year because then thanks for
long well no cuz the next season's could
be the finale yeah make sense so they'll
be the next Emmys I don't know I mean
maybe tough it was good though I liked I
liked the house of cards did you like it
I did I thought it got a little silly I
still don't understand the episode where
they went back to school you know where
they say her as a musical I've said
where they let him back to school they
thought about math know when they are in
his college like I don't understand that
that was a weird it felt like they had a
lot of really good ideas and then they
just they were a little because they
didn't have to present ever every
episode is like a right thing because
they knew there was rewatchable I felt
this way about a rush development too
yeah kind of like the rest development
works better way better the second time
around actually Aaron Aaron Sorkin this
is not like it is really to Netflix
problems from something else with
newsroom like he finished season one
before the first episode aired and I was
like well it kind of sucks then like
some places but I can't fix it now right
and Netflix that's always gonna be the
problem because it relieves everything
at once everything has to be done before
it looks at him with most TV the
wreckage on linear yeah yeah okay I
think it's great i think boosters are
great like a rest development i watched
through the first time and I was like
yeah and then I watched the second time
like oh this I I get it there's like a
thousand jokes here for me to see right
but i understand that retinol is only
good on the second watch like you can't
make people commit to 60 hours i know
why man the first time through right
maybe I have a typology is great I think
you watch house of cards like it's great
and they're re watches are even better
cuz you see all the pieces like mmm I
feel like there's too much TV right now
yeah I feel like the movie box you much
good stuff the movie box office is
pretty easy tanger Pacific rain you
should still got like one or two there's
a one or two movies you could maybe want
any week what one move you have to see a
month right everyone talked about
there's too much Tino Jeter said box
office made me think of fact like oh you
don't leave I went on ax 3d I take lost
twenty dollars dollars is this a
chilling vision of a near future if that
future is movies that make no sense that
we all believe are good then yes dude it
was awesome it was on over first of all
it was awesome in a sense that it was a
movie about robots punching dinosaurs
yes and the literally it's at one point
they like Betty retcon dinosaurs into
the movie no these monsters they were
the dinosaurs like
also spoiler thank you it's that is this
far okay so let me clear by the way I
spoil pacific rim by saying it was
robots punching dinosaurs which is all
that happens in neutral i betray myself
I warn you with us for the first 10
minutes tells the entire story and goes
okay you know the story yeah beer either
of you there's review the new time what
was it there's a yogi thurs com well
there was that review and it was good
review but there is review in the New
York Times I remember where was uh but
it was like that first part of the movie
would have been an awesome movie we're
like monsters attack the world and you
have to figure out how to stop them run
a solution is giant robots and like in
Pacific Rim they're like and that's over
now here the credits it's 50 years later
and the robots didn't work and it's like
oh that sucks what about the cool movie
we had to build the robot I think if he
made that movie it would have been
terrible you know why okay what is it
around two-thirds or that movie like you
know we need we humanoid android robot
scientist or say we just like the
inventor and the base bag we punch a
lizard yes you need the inventor in the
base when he was like i have the i have
the plan the solution was there all I
was like a German which is why they call
john yaegar in ya writings like if you
want to kill a monster you have to build
a monster I mean that would have been an
awesome first movie and this movie
could've been like the fifth movie I'm
right okay your stuff it's like you try
to a second of all you're trying to add
storage too fast and furious this is
what you're trying to do I always like
okay so here's my second quibble Pacific
Rim and I just to point this out if you
think about pacific rim for even 30
seconds okay you're like wait a minute
there's a hole in the ocean that spits
out monsters wait why that's the truth
like that's the there's a hole in the
ocean spits on monster that's not a
spoiler that's in a trailer okay so
here's the peaceful verbal here's what
they decided to do quibble here's how
they decided to handle the whole me oh
 there's good people go get really
far away from it robots you need big let
me just ask you a question just if your
solution to solving the whole that spits
out Monsters is to build a wall mmhmm
yeah where should you build that wall
your issue don't swallow you close to
the monster hole or far away from the
monster hole you're
are you you should build it as close to
the monster hole as possible so that if
the monsters get through the wall then
you have some like notice baby you have
another wall is good we'll just build it
right off the coast of Hong Kong York
that way if the monsters get you it'll
be fine when ripped off half of the
screen at my movie theater that's the
only sort of complaint you can level at
a robot movie you know robots versus
lawyers what you need large you need
large problems yeah somebody punched me
in the face when I sat down to watch
this movie yeah or like around a strip
and she see it the highway was dressing
me sepia tone sierra you're hoe does
horo did not when he was mapping out the
part of this movie he was like part of
it will be well decommission the robots
to build a wall he should have thought
to himself what would that what would
people do there's a hole with monstrous
where should be the wall close to the
closer to what monster ho far away if
the monster hole I would argue that nine
out of ten dentist would agree that you
should build a wall close to the monster
hole okay so if it fails you're still
like you're like square one not like the
wall fail that now Sydney is gone can we
just start this trail that you love
spoiling this little horsy that satisfy
you you want me wholesale I'm telling
you sorry you were going to pacific rim
for the plot you were doing it wrong i'm
telling you that's that's definitely not
a spoiler yeah hundred percent not a
spoiler just not a spoiler don't worry
about it this is what going to this year
here's a ears of Pacific Rim spoiler I
don't know if I can ever see at the end
of the robots win or do you think what
what what else you should go see it you
should see in 3ds you may all the money
in the beginning okay so let's talk
about then something very small the HTC

Pacific Rim just blatantly steals from
top gun over and over again it is very
homoerotic at times well there's there's
that there's also the like do mean it's
literally it's like it's it's like they
on they understood that the the Rio and
top gun wasn't like as important to
people right so i will make that guy as
important by connecting their brains you
know it's like that's like what happened
yeah that was like a popgun man Betsy
the trailer Betsy the trailer you're
back online you see trailers look all
I'm saying to you just look pacific rim
is Top Gun only goose and maverick
sprains are connected all right the more

paths of life you see if you're not

path of light you're slowly created a
composite image I can wish I removed

keep throwing paint at it so now you can
see it yeah they were saying look here's
