the verge mobile show this is episode
number 73 not that you I mean does
anybody care what episode number it is
it's it's 73 whatever as we gits number
16 2013 I am a very laggy dieter bohn I
have that said oh I'm dan seifert my
name is chris sigler and this is most
likely going to be our final mobile show
of the year and maybe ever because
whatever that's not true we will we will
do it again at some point someday we
feel like it maybe maybe CES it might be
that long maybe full of us could get a
couch like you I I want to say that you
know it may be that long CES is
literally two weeks away and yeah so
it's a test impressing gotta be more
than that two and a half oh we can we
fly out into a half weeks of thing yeah
guys you realize that being like oh like
dreading Vegas and dreading CES is a
completely played out trope like getting
excited about CES is the new hotness
look and that looks ready yet look Chris
just because it sucked or just because
people said said it sucked for years
doesn't make it not suck no actually
actually we just had this conversation
today here in London well that happening
things are happening I'm so going to zen
our former intern in the UK and this was
a conversation we had and the fact is CS
does actually kind of suck for those of
us who are there because we eats a ton
of really shitty food and we don't sleep
and we crush into event values and all
of these things but on the other hand CS
is exciting for the audience which is
get the nice clean announcements of new
products and new fun bit so yeah I mean
see just amazing look it think of it
it's like
it's a week of like just insanity and
everybody needs a week of insanity a
year and that is our Week insanity and
that's okay and it's it's the best kind
of insanity because you're surrounded by
you know robots that you're never going
to see again in the entire life and
weird plastic things that will never
appear in stores so your only
opportunity to play with these things is
and the beautiful shining diamond in the
desert Las Vegas Nevada I look I just I
just I dont les plus plus carrot top and
Gallagher carrot top who gets more
ripped each and every year I'm just
wondering as DJs that carrot top going
to be part of the WWE press conference
that's happening at all CS I hope I'm
signed up for that one I will be there
I'll be covering it live you know you're
actually not the biggest WWE fan at the
verge no no that's true Casey Newton is
6 foot we might be revealing his secret
shame right now live on the air I don't
know if he wants that we have I mean I
think Casey Casey Newton holds down the
west coast side of things for the WWE
representation but there are at least
one maybe even more very hardcore WWE
fans in New York us look I'm I've been
to New York I've met people in New York
I have seen everybody's desk in New York
and none of them have a championship WWE
replica belt on their desk what no but
Chris we gotta get have a special yeah
Chris was the previous bunk Logan poster
on his desk so I I would say that he is
at least a par with with Casey and on
the WWE front so while talking about
people that you've never met is totally
fun welcome to The Verge mobile show
where we talk about ces and wrestling
wait wait wait wait wait wait man come
on I was totally gonna start talking
about phones wait one second wait but I
just put up this I feel like this is
relevant enough to our our viewership
and our listenership so that I should
get this out there I'm pretty proud of
it i just got this amazing life hack and
our forums i figure now you it is a life
hack cat don't blow up my spot can you
do it from a phone or a tablet no you do
it from your PC well then why are we
talking about it because people are
ordering phones from amazon just hear me
out so if you go to amazon our producers
with me by the way Evan he's he's
shaking his head I don't care what evan
has to say on the subject of Amazon
because the dude owns like his main
phone is like a signage in mod G two or
so I don't know what it is at this point
uh look just go to Amazon it's an hd2
yes this may see it probably wanting
sailfish so if you go to amazon and this
time of year they quite frequently
prevent you from selecting overnight
shipping or same day shipping and
presumably that's just because they're
slammed and they don't want people
selecting those options but if you order
something and then immediately go to
your orders and then find your order in
that list there's a button next to it
that says change shipping speed and if
you click on that there you can change
the shipping speed overnighter same day
which I've done success successfully
twice this week so i know it works
that's way now you then talk about
packet hacking the amazon can you can
you act moto maker in the same way to
actually get the wooden the bamboo Moto
X free transition was what transition
transition through that again for the
audio listeners of the show I just want
to say you're welcome for a second we
just saw Chris Eagle just raise the roof
it was not sure look it was a good
transition I was just celebrating it ok
wasn't it wasn't good it was glorious I
just kind of want to say that i bought a
moto x with my own money a week ago izod
now they're gonna buy not an option and
you're gonna buy it again so the deal is
it's just
bamboo and uh they haven't actually set
a ship date for yet correct now there
are blog post on it says january
delivery but doesn t like specific i
think if you i've heard if you order one
it says january six is when it's
expected to deliver what I want to know
is why is it so hard for them to bring
the engraving option back are the eight
gravy option is back dude oh is it can
you gave the wood I don't know I haven't
actually gone through the whole process
you can engrave the wood yourself as
well cuz it's would you get one of those
kits that you use in like the wood
burning kit yes I totally burned the
hell actually that would be a pretty
killer like little cottage industry for
these if these things become popular if
like you know how dieter got his orange
iphone 5 from ha me that or what is that
other company that's been painting
phones for years the like polar ware has
been painting phones right yes ano style
right right right but like you know the
same concept except you could get like
you know something burned into the back
of the would that be crazy it's a
hundred bucks more that seems a little
bit out of bounds to me and six bone
where else you can get a wood phone bro
let me how much company LJ how much
would you pay for a good wood case for
say an iphone you probably pay like 70
200 bucks right I guess for a really
good one also can I just say that I'm
pretty sure the reason that the
engraving option was originally removed
was because josh successfully ordered a
moto x with the engraving powered by
webos me to this day he has that phone
which is amazing um yeah I don't know
what there's nothing else to say you can
get the Moto X in bamboo no George Tenet
to say oh alright you can get the Moto X
in bamboo in the United States the rest
of the world is bummed about that right
hey man have fun with your Moto G you
can get the g all day long well you got
that on us yeah well I know I think I
think we could order the jhino too yeah
I was going to I was just contemplating
burning you guys about the fact that you
can't get Moto G deliveries in
States because every little gust of wind
gets a name in the United States and
things get shut down but I guess I just
did that anyway yeah but why'd you can
get like the galaxy mega you can
probably get like eight or ten different
mid-range galaxies like you have that on
it's so so I'm actually um sprint and
t-mobile I want to point out I asked on
Twitter what we should talk about on the
show because there wasn't a ton of news
and you know a bunch of suggestions and
we might touch on some of them but the
the main thing I want to say is a core
component of the show is uh strolling
each other and we got nothing on our
listeners you guys are amazing no no no
no no they're great no I'm a main
component of the show is you guys all
trolling me Oh everybody calling each
other stop making it sound like it's
equal give-and-take around here it's not
know whose are these I can't tell if
they're legit or not legit trolls like
somebody's just we talked about the dots
holiday theme which I have feelings
about it's those things down it's a bit
harder to see but the main thing is I
have no longer have the high score on
the dots move mode the 32 moves mode I
had the high score I'd beat Chris but
now somebody else is higher than me i'm
very unhappy about it the damn checker
no it is Scott Callum oh so um oh okay
there's a rumor that sprint is thinking
about putting in a bid to buy team
weight as Rooney's my virtual show where
I don't allow leader to ever move on to
the next topic ever hello come on human
cares okay I've got to make something on
the topic about galaxy Mega's and what
note there's a new galaxy advanced hyper
something whatever which is sounds like
that sorry fighter no seriously it's a
samsung galaxy advance and then some
other now that it sounds galaxy advanced
the movie the game turbo yeah inspired
by the book and it's a 4.7 inch WVGA
display complete beautiful apart from
the fact that it has a side-mounted
voice recorder button so I just wanted
to let our listeners know that this
thing exists so now it can bury it and
move on without what was the pricing no
I'm actually genuinely curious how does
the pricing on that device compared to
the Moto G which if i'm not mistaken as
a qHD display go moto G is 720p yeah
720p twill even better so what's the
pricing and I would total price if
something actually did comprehensive
press releases which they absolutely do
not believe it's against their religion
now so they give you the spec sheet for
every single aspect of the phone but
actual distribution markets and pricing
is forbidden week so I mean look what
the thing is they actually pitched his
phone as something for people who are
not used to touch screens which is just
completely not announces to be because
if I'm used to pressing buttons at the
front of a device a side-mounted button
is going to do absolutely nothing for me
and just for voice recording right yeah
and we also have a camera button and
volume rocker whatever did you guys kick
start that that Android a headphone jack
button what phone Pressey it's
compressing yeah so it's a thing it's a
little it's basically literally just a
headphone jack with a little tiny rubber
button on the top and you slap it into
your headphone jack and then you just
got a little extra button that you can
like do stuff with it'll hook up to task
or launch an app or whatever it's kind
of cool okay so see what did you
recognize not yet buggy into the
headphone jack and then reacts is that
what's happening yeah just did you know
listens I guess um dieter didn't go it
because I want to put my headphones on
yeah that that's the issue Welch dude
bluetooth headphones that's where it's
at everybody loves bluetooth headphones
to 2002 the worst actually no no all
kidding aside I used to hate I hate
basically all bluetooth stereo bluetooth
headphones but the s11 HD is like
genuinely good it doesn't yeah it
doesn't have the range issues that have
had with every other pair I've ever
tried it sounds a decent it's sweat
proof yeah there's there's
on one scenario where i think bluetooth
headphones make sense and that's like
when you're running at the gym or you
know whatever wherever you actually run
and you don't want a wire take later my
jam when I commuted on my bike was I
used a plantronics voyager a huge
battery life and it would only go in one
ear but it would still play stereo so I
could actually hear to hear traffic and
stuff around me and I could listen to
music while I was riding into work that
was pretty cool and I would have to deal
with cables like tucking you in my shirt
and whatever doesn't that have one of
those like boom mics too yeah it's
actually really awesome wow I could see
how that could work really well for like
podcasts music I don't know if I'd want
to listen to in 11 year but no I mean I
think I think I was um okay so
apparently softbank okay so we've got
foreign powers like trying to do stuff
to the US wireless in Sri softbank who's
their CEO what's his name mazda yoshi
son saw i was just about called
something else entirely apparently he
now that he's got sprint is interested
in like increasing power and buying up
t-mobile meanwhile this is from a wsj
report meanwhile we've known that
deutsche telekom is really not that
interested in hanging out in the US
market so they might be interested
unloading it so there's this speculation
that sprint is looking to buy out
t-mobile and man there's a lot of issues
to talk about here uh I don't even know
where to start I will start with like
competitively speaking my feeling on it
is at first it seems oh yeah a stronger
third player would actually give
competition to the other two but my I
really don't think that would happen I
think that we instead of having a
duopoly we'd have a try opoly and
there'd be no pressure and we feel like
that is I feel like t-mobile has
actually managed to change some things
by acting like everybody's wild crazy
uncle you know we've got 80 at least
like giving a little bit of credit to
the idea that you shouldn't pay your
full subsidy price even after you paid
your phone off
we've got these jump and next plans and
yes they're a hassle but the mobile
plans seem to be shaken up a little bit
and I feel like t-mobile deserves at
least some of the credit for it and I I
don't have any kind of faith that a
combined Sprint and t-mobile would have
that same kind of wild crazy uncle John
Legere impact not to not to mention that
a combined Sprint and t-mobile is still
not as big as verizon or AT&amp;amp;T right but
yeah but I think ultimately so yes
indeed right I mean I totally agree with
you I think that if you were looking at
this merger two years to go there's a
good chance to regulators who would have
smiled warmly upon it or at least the
idea of it but things have changed
significantly since since the 18 TD
LaFell through and believe it or not I
think what I think one of the biggest
nails in the coffin for this deal if it
does come to fruition sprint tries to
pull it off one of the biggest sticking
points is going to be the fact that
sprint itself launched one up in direct
response to t-mobile and Sprint is going
to try mean sprin is going to do they
will lay out the same arguments that
AT&amp;amp;T laid out and you remember that ATT
put out this long list of like they
publish like a hundred page document or
something of reasons why why t-mobile
couldn't survive on its own and why it
wasn't competitive in the marketplace
and they didn't offer any good
smartphones blah blah blah and now you
have this this you know this situation
where sprint was forced not force but
like they did respond to what t-mobile
is doing in the marketplace so sprint
tries to argue that t-mobile alone is
not competitive in the marketplace
they're going to have a very very hard
time making that argument right well on
top of that like you would think that
sprint would have enough work on its
hands dealing with the spectrum issues
that it has now Yeah right like they've
got this whole thing they've got this
whole spark plan a three-tiered system
they finally are like you know getting
nextels band spectrum in there
and this huge mess that they've had with
the different ways they're trying to
cobble together a nationwide LTE network
and like all the different equipment
they've tried and yada yada yada yada I
mean throwing t-mobile's assets into the
mix I mean it puts them another like
four or five years out from having a
coherent network at best doesn't it in a
way yes I mean the I in my opinion and
Sasha stian that pc magazine has written
some good stuff on this past couple days
too but in my opinion the biggest
challenge they face if they were to try
to combine technically is the fact that
they are running voice on two bands and
two technologies they would be running
voice on cdma and they'd be running
voice on GSM UMTS and I'm not so worried
about them having it sounds ridiculous
even going back two or three years to
just think about this but nowadays the
fact that they would have a combined
total of four bands and four distinct
network technologies from a handset
perspective is actually not that big of
a deal if you look at the Nexus 5
believe it or not it supports literally
every single one of that theoretical
combined organizations bands and
technologies it even supports td-lte
which brand but if you and I didn't
realize this one I was writing my report
on Friday the common are pointed it out
but if you look at Sprint's press
release for the Nexus 5 they actually
call out the Nexus 5 as being a sprint
spark compatible support its tri-band
and of course Claire wires running
td-lte and 2.6 so it's it's like it's
kind of insane actually like it blew my
mind when I read that sprint has also
released updated versions of other
phones yeah be sparking bevels so like
the galaxy s4 has been updated to be
smart compatible if you bought an older
galaxy s4 tough nuggies but if you buy
one I think probably I think starting
now or going forward it will be
compatible with spark and if it has all
the spark bands there's I haven't looked
into it but there's a good chance that
it also support the necessary bannister
t-mobile you know interestingly galaxy
nuggies is the next version of their
tablet and then there's galaxy tough
nuggies which is ruggedized
version uh you know it's funny you
should say that dieter because there was
a rumor this week that sprint would be
announcing I think a total for tablets
between CES numba mwc so it means that
Chris what did I say sprint brain yes
Samsung excuse me oh you say between do
you mean combined or in between those
two events okay although with Samsung
you never know yeah but I suspect we're
gonna see some tablets at CES from them
and we're going to see if I remember
correctly they announced the Galaxy Note
8 at MW Steve this year that's so I I
imagine that they will refresh that at
MWC 2014 I would just like to point this
out in advance before Samson reaches out
to us to do like embargo briefings and
whatever i'm gonna be busy at that time
hey I just don't want any part of this
samsung refreshes it's mediocre tablets
that nobody in the right mind should be
buying is all the note 8 is actually
legitimately interesting for a number of
reasons I don't really want to get into
a whole debate about it right now but I
could see why somebody would choose to
buy a no date ribbit because it has me
repeat like a phone no because it's like
it actually has software that takes
advantage of the fact that it's a big
tablet or a bigger than a smartphone and
it's got the stylus that works well for
note-taking and you can get it with LTE
and a couple other reasons I can also
think of just as many if not more
reasons not to buy it or to buy
something else but I could okay so many
questions that I the no D I can see why
fair enough but the question for me and
it's actually an interesting one because
I haven't spent that much time going to
notate because it's a I've been dodging
tablets that experience is a desert say
you got a nexus 7 available now and
you've got the google play edition of
the g pad 8.3 which we just reviewed and
as it turns out shockingly the google
play edition is so much better than so
LG skin versions well my question is if
you have the google play edition jeep at
ebook free and the nexus 7 doesn't note
8 make sense so so it's funny because I
talked to David
this is quite a bit while we were
discussing and working on this review
and honestly the note 8 is a compelling
alternative to the G pad 8.3 the GPI 8.3
is a very solid device in a vacuum and
it's a really great tablet in a vacuum
by itself but when you open up to what's
available in that price range and from
competitors it's a hard sell in my
opinion yeah i actually i think the g
pad 8.3 and either its google play or
its LG skin edition like dan says it's
fine on its own but i would much be much
more likely to recommend a nexus 7 or a
no date right like you could get a nexus
7 euless or just because the Nexus 7 is
a little bit smaller and the next I mean
the nexus 7 for these hot it's been all
over this holiday season you've been
able to get it for like 180 bucks for
the 16 gigabyte version which is almost
almost half of what the equivalent
storage size option on the 8.3 is so
it's like 180 bucks for nexus 7 or 350
bucks for the note 8.3 which is arguably
just giving you a bigger screen and
slightly nicer build quality but many of
us felt that the nexus 7 feels better to
hold onto cuz its soft touch and a
little bit smaller and stuff like that
so you know the i think that if you're
going for the no date you're going for
the no date for very specific reasons
and they make sense that's my specific
reasons you mean the stylus right yeah
and also the Nexus 7 is available in
white that's the x-factor 0 the white
one is really bad no not a fan of it
white everything everything should be
white no it's just like the white Nexus
5 the the soft touch has got a slightly
different feel to it this way a harder
plastic and I'm not a fan of it well
today I actually managed to finally get
my hands on a black Nexus 5 and I get
where you guys are getting at it's got a
more rubbery texture on the back in okay
in the hand it feels better but I'm
still a fan of the white one
particularly because it really goes
nicely with my white pebble yeah I mean
those two things I've said it before but
those two things is just made for each
other with the white and black contrast
so I actually removed the the stickers
in the word you can't see this in the
camera
I remove the stickers inside the word
Nexus and the LG logo so it's no longer
reflective black it's just straight dark
matte death all the way across the back
of the phone I'm pretty happy with it I
will be it's a good-looking phone uh oh
I am this close to switching back to the
iphone right now because of the Twitter
app yeah didn't you enter twitter app is
yeah it is it broke a workflow that I
had when I was checking things you know
how you could swipe between mentions and
yeah yeah to the danger it dries dude
out a time and now I was good oui oui
ranted about this at length on the verge
cast so I don't necessarily want to
recapitulate it other than to say that I
still believe it is a dumpster fire of a
redesign and everybody there should be
ashamed if you just started a Twitter
yesterday you should be ashamed that you
went to work for a company that produced
this if you have been on the beta where
were you know the beta group where
they've been like testing this and you
didn't go out and protest in front of
Twitter with picket signs you also
should be ashamed I am mad at literally
the entire planet over the SAP redesign
I can't even handle it but what
expectation do you seriously have buying
an android phone that the apps are going
to be complete pylos it occurs those
rest dude they regressed they went yet
went from terrible I went from okay to
terrible uh like yeah it's bad what's
killing me is that it's it's the same
design concept used on iOS but it's
executed so much better than iOS like
that well I'd aesthetics are the same
and things like that but the reason it's
executed better on iOS is one they have
this crazy idea in their head that they
need to put their like UI elements at
the top which is like stop trying to
follow hollow but still screwing it up
to the reason it works on iOS is you can
do the swiping between its what is a
timeline discover and activity but on
iOS like nobody cares about discover or
activity and learn under it and right
but but at but
just three little dots on iOS you've got
this giant tab bar like they actually
matter but they don't or on Android I
did ah but the worst part of it is and I
wasn't going to do this but like you
can't in in the tabs in a home
discovered activity you can tap the top
of the tab to scroll to the top but when
you go into your notifications you can't
do that because when you try and tap the
top it takes you back so you just have
to sit there and scroll and scroll and
scroll and scroll okay yeah yeah but I
need to pull us back from the brink hit
because one thing I comments as if
you're noticing is that we're actually
spending about the night instead of a
time complaint learning things yeah
that's fair wish I and that's something
what are we yes yes I mean listen I want
to say your phone I'm happy that the one
mode of moto X's is no available we're
soon to be available however you want
and like yeah it's so hard for us to be
happy about don't you yeah I need to do
some push-ups you know get some
positivity back in me so I'm just gonna
do imaginary ones but listen seriously
do twitter app on Android wasn't just
decently or happy so that was very happy
with it um the new one is a downgrade
but you know what i was going to say and
so fat i was good tweet was i would
complain about this twitter redesign but
then i have to face it i'm going to be
using it anyway so I might as well just
do the fact that it kind of sucks and
ultimately I'm gonna get used to it then
they're gonna tweak it again and figure
out the right path etc so that's not a
quitter recommended tweedle to me and
it's really good in fact it would be my
only twitter app in a heartbeat because
it's so good except that Twitter doesn't
make it easy for Twitter specific
features like notification alerts from
specific users and seeing your full
activity or your full notifications
timeline including like retweets in
faves to third party clown files right
detect the kinect time the kinect
timeline doesn't isn't isn't an open API
for developers so that it comes to just
like so what I'm doing is I'm using
Twitter for incoming alert
and then i'm using tweedle for like all
of my reading and it works tweedle
doesn't refresh in the background though
there's like no option to have it
refresh every hour which is nothing that
I wish you had I mean I think the
options there just doesn't work well it
doesn't either way you have to pull the
refresh every time you open it so yeah
yeah okay so Twitter is kind of sort of
a little bit evil but i have to take
issue with Chris's point saying how are
you going to pick up an android phone
and expect the apps not suck I mean
that's not fair anymore it is it is
absolutely fair no it's very unfair for
third third party apps that also have
iOS components I can't think of a single
one that the iOS app is a inferior
version unless it's like Google's own
apps that they make sure they're better
on it yeah yeah i mean i would say that
well i mean i'm gonna I don't know like
there are a few apps like any do stuff I
think works a little bit better on
Android I need you started on Android if
I'm not mistaken that's right and for
whatever reason I feel like pocket casts
is better on Android but that I don't
know why I feel that fully but I do
there's a couple others but there's
definitely examples where it's worse
there's there's a lot more examples of
where it's worse than there are words
better that's totally fair but it's like
it is night and day from what it was
even like a year ago a year ago was it
was like god they're terrible but now
like things are starting to catch up a
little bit yeah okay can we do like a
two-minute embargo where we use no
negative adjectives and just see if we
have anything to say I'm gonna double
down on that challenge you ready talk
about four minutes let's talk about
Windows Phone yeah no I look I'm always
I tweeted about this yesterday i'm
always super bullish with every single
windows phone update that's rumored or
announced i'm a super bullish this is
the version that is going to not only
save windows phone but but reignite my
passion for windows phone 8.1 8.1 is
notes
saving it doesn't need saving it's it's
just it's it's not like wildly popular
but it's not falling out but like so
we're expecting an 8.1 that there's
going to be a proper notification center
and there's really a serie competitor
which Microsoft has smart I'll Cortana
which i think is like really clever like
that that that's the right thing to do
well they can't possibly be the the
actual god I should come on man they
gotta do it they'll be so awesome yeah
it's not gonna happen they're gonna call
it like i christen they're going to call
it like Windows Phone 8.1 voice live
action's well I hope it's not I hope
it's not the same engineering group that
is working on making the xbox one turn
on when you say Xbox on as so here's
here's they are there they're in a world
of trouble you guys know that we're
supposed to be in the happy zone right
when our two minutes hey I didn't use
any negative adjectives I I'm just
saying that they they could be in some
trouble if those engineering groups are
related Christian decision to denounce
because I I am i am a well-documented
noun transition ER this is a problem for
me look I'm just saying I have to scream
xbox on at my at my TV like ten times
now wait you were just like hit a button
like how often okay this picture I just
picture Chris it is living room like
like getting really red in the face like
being starting to bulge out as you
screaming xbox on instead of just
hitting the controller that's in his
hand well the end that that's kind of
what it boils down to that's not far off
and i'm usually not wearing pants when
that happens but anyway back to windows
phone yeah I I do think that this closes
a really important feature gap you know
it is the same thing we say with every
version windows phone I don't know if
they're I don't even know what did to
get to it to what you were saying dieter
I don't even know what Windows Phones
problems are per say at this point we've
heard some talk from Microsoft that they
feel that ten percent market share is a
golden number for them yeah globally and
uh but but I don't know if people I
don't know if like the
plebes with their smartphones are saying
are saying to themselves I would I i
would use Windows Phone if only it had a
notification center I don't know people
are saying that especially when you
consider that I phone's notification
center is perhaps the worst thing about
iOS yeah so um yeah I don't know can I I
mean I think there's some app issues in
both times third party and then also
like Metro is starting like we've
started at the limits of what like feels
awesome about metro but I want to
actually like talk about something and
god damn it I'm gonna do it I'm gonna
bring up webos sorry the the rumor is
that the Notification Center in Windows
Phone is going to come down from the top
and that there is going to be something
at the bottom right I thought like like
a maybe not am I crazy I thought you
could swipe up from the bottom to get
like controls because I however give iOS
7 now I'm definitely thinking about
seven I thought I read something but
maybe not anyway notifications at the
top I actually think like I i kind of am
sad that both Android and iOS have like
do it that way especially iOS where the
controls are at the bottom because
conceptually to me it makes way more
sense to have like your random controls
up the top because that's like an
extension of the nerdy crap that's
already in your menu bar so right and
then notifications at the bottom you
access that stuff way more often and
that's just easier to get to than the
top and so I think I really wish that we
would just flip those things and have
notification stuff slide up from the
bottom and have utility craps slide down
from the menu bar which conceptually
makes perfect sense so I think that
could maybe work if you had like a
permanent bar like like how Android is
today it's got its permanent bar at the
top of the screen and the icons pop in
when you have notifications I know that
you're thinking of what webos did and
how the screen like shrink up but with
virtual keyboards that throws off the
layout of the keyboard or the position
of the keys yeah we worked on webos
because all the devices that actually
made it to market head hardware
keyboards but uh if somebody had like a
permanent thing there but the thing is
then also you
typing right and maybe tapping your
notifications or you're not seeing them
because your fingers are in the way yeah
so the way windows phone does it is it's
actually going to be reportedly a quick
swipe a short swipe will bring up your
settings and a long swipe will give you
your notifications that that sounds
problematic to me okay problematic I
mean it is I mean the way android does
it is it's a is a single swipe for
notification then you tap over to get
your settings or you guys have my
fingers or the two finger thing which I
mean who does that I do it all the time
really but there is also but first of
all distance an ajumma but I think it's
part of some other customization the
option to if you if you swipe down from
the top right or top left corner you get
directly into particular settings menu
but I just find that complicates and
probably frustrate spokespeople the
complicates matters interest rates more
people that actually helps that's a real
power user feature but with specific to
the Notification Center support or
addition in windows folder but Chris was
saying is it being a must-have feature
obviously it is like nobody's going in
there and asking for it by name but I
feel like if it's implemented correctly
if it helps you use experience it makes
for a better experience for the end user
and that ultimately is constructed and
again it leads to a stronger you know
stronger OS strong potential for the
future Who am I recommended rather than
say oh I really hated the experience of
using that cetera et cetera my biggest
issue actually is I've just been hanging
out with someone and I've seen the
valley that's your biggest issue that
you've been hanging out with Tom Warren
yes there's problems well I mean he is
Britain's premiere pro he can represent
the country in the Olympics in the
traveling Olympics but I mean I've uses
Lumia 1520 for a little bit first of all
the display in that thing is just
gorgeous it's amazing a second of all
this the screen size is stupid it
doesn't make any sense but the third
figures when you look at his home screen
with Odie's
yeah most small squares big squares and
tiles and animations and things
happening it is just so confusing like
it's stressing me out just to look at it
and is right to say that we customize it
to your own preferences you develop a
memory and you get things to be really
accessible but I'm finding all of this
customization all of these Styles going
out of the home screen actually too busy
and whoa but if you want I mean you can
just make all of your your home screen
tiles the biggest size and then it looks
like we just found seven right yeah well
I'm on the 1520 the biggest size is only
two columns so you still have like a
third column to deal with I mean I guess
you can make them large medium but right
was it I mean that would just buy my
immediate impression of the kinetic with
all those tiles and I then my wish is
that Microsoft doesn't push into this
let's have a ton of styles all over the
place thing and they need to keep the
simplicity because that was the point of
Metro's simplicity was pushing figs out
of the way whereas if you have
everything animated and kind of
manifesting information in front of you
then you get information overload and
that's my fear and then the Notification
Center becomes kind of redundant as well
yeah well you know it would be you could
have the Notification Center for your
notifications and you would have to go
hunting around on your home screen you
could just have the tiles it's right
there and then like if some of them
animate in a way that you like then like
you know if they're not there is like
giving you essential information it's
just sort of a nice ambient effect which
is how I think it ought to be I think
that would be great yeah totally right
and another x factor for Microsoft which
really hasn't paid dividends in the way
that I kind of thought it might that
Nokia is still making arguably the most
attractive and best feeling smart phone
hardware in the industry today I mean
they're certainly they're doing things
with plastic that no one would have
considered possible three or four years
ago so you know I it's the same story
each and every time like I will without
question try very hard to make Windows
Phone 8.1 one device my
primary phone and will you know we'll
see if I can finally get past the the
pain of you know the lack of apps and
software weirdness maybe this is the the
time when everything is coming together
for them you know they have Instagram
out now they have you know vine the all
important design it's it's funny how
much of that pain is uh caused by Google
not cooperating with Microsoft yeah yeah
because like you know at least for our
art we all for our work emails all based
on gmail and you know III I don't know
anyone other than Tom that doesn't use
Gmail for their personal email uh and
that kind of just really sucks with
Windows Phone still and Microsoft can
try and try and try but if Google
doesn't offer the access or offer the
keys or whatever it needs to to make it
work well it's it's not going to be an
easy thing for them there are some
actual third-party gmail apps in the
Windows Phone store now that give you
label support and starring and archiving
and all that all the fold gmail
compliments that you might expect but
there's third party and not everyone is
comfortable with a third party app stuff
like that yeah that my concern with that
is that you know one of the things that
has always been a problem for the
Windows Phone app store is that you have
all these developers that you've never
heard of and some of the apps sound cool
or intriguing but you don't know if
they've been vetted and you know the
question becomes are you comfortable
storing your gmail authentication uh you
know in some developers cloud that
you've never heard of for do read two
reasons one there's the security concern
but then also there's the concern that
this guy could disappear at any moment
and just you know take excuse me tickle
your email with them so well not take
all your email with them but like take
the app with him so yeah that the Google
challenges is a very very real one for
Microsoft uh so part of speaking I don't
know I forget it there was gonna be a
transition ears to be great and I lost
it android is free and apparently
Windows is thinking about giving away
Windows Phone and Windows RT away for
free to manufacturers
um which like honestly fine like I don't
I don't think it's going to like
radically change things for them I don't
think that the cost the licensing costs
for windows phone was the primary reason
people i think i think it was important
yeah i think we may we may have
underestimated because really I mean I
me what one phone manufacturer discuss
that with me and I was saying they could
never match androids of contract pricing
wood windows phone because of the
licensing costs no but that's the
royalties that are paid the microsoft
and every android phone that that is
sold nearly I mean Microsoft is never
publicized the licensing terms but is
believed that it's it's about a wash
between windows phone and Android by the
time you pay there were all the
royalties right but Microsoft ones is
not android it wants its own OS and its
own platform in his many hands as
possible this is the thing I mean Google
was the first company that said we're
going to business money in developing
the so as cetera cetera but then our
focus is not going to be making money
out of it is getting people to use the
device so we can distribute the stuff
that does make us money which is a
browser our ads our email client maps
youtube cetera et cetera and how goo who
is in that leading position Apple
realize the same thing and made a whole
bunch of software free recently and I'm
Microsoft is coming around to the same
point of view and I mean we've talked
about this it's a better of platforms
nowadays and the reason I mean I tweeted
about this morning and everybody was
like you're crazy flat which is fair
enough for probably an and I asked why
is Microsoft trying to get youtube or
mother's phone instead of building its
own video service and you know first of
all people raised point Microsoft
already try to fail but the major point
everybody raises that I can't argue with
it is that YouTube just has such a vast
advantage over everybody it says
popularity awareness and content already
on it that you just can't catch up and I
will try to do maps and it still trying
to do it takes
years to catch up on these things you
know so Google has the advantage so if
Microsoft starts losing money by selling
Windows Phones relative to like if an
Android sales turns into Windows Phone
say when I actually ends up losing money
for Microsoft and short-term I don't
think anybody cares I mean that's got a
bit trifling amount relative to max of
getting people to actually you know use
endorse windows phone as their primary
OS so let me let me give you something
to put on your pipe and then you can
decide whether or not you want to smoke
it what if Microsoft can make licensing
Windows Phone cheaper than Android
because they're giving it away they say
we will handle licensing fees and oh by
the way if you do android you've got to
pay us royalties and so they could
literally undercut the free operating
system yeah I mean it doesn't it still
doesn't matter anyway because nokia is
the only licensee that matters right
like at the end of the day like they
need to get companies like Samsung and
LG and sony to commit to building a
competitive windows phone hardware and
they don't I mean yeah and that there's
going to be the biggest challenge I
don't think anybody would he took an HTC
Samsung or any of the other OEMs is
particularly and rapture with Microsoft
at the moment I fear I think you know my
feeling is that everybody saw nokia
being treated as the favorite child
among all the companies then look it got
bought out well it's in the process of
doing so and it's going to be
Microsoft's own hardware Microsoft's
already screwed everybody with Windows
RT tablet which is why within a year the
surface was the only windows RT tablet
on the market because everybody could
have compete with the aggressive pricing
and design so you have a track record
which tells you if you stop building
windows phones microsoft itself is going
to be competing with you really
aggressively so perhaps the only guys
who might be interested in this I got is
like ziti and Huawei who might be doing
the really
entry-level devices and device for
emerging markets and that could be
something that grows and some bit of
develops you know essentially but that's
the only real you know market
development that I see for the company
otherwise my myself is going to be
building its own high-end stuff yeah the
problem here is like there's just no
like like Chris Evans valves a lot of
saying there's no space for anything on
the high end other than nokia I mean I'm
I remember the HTC 8x a little over a
year yes yeah it was a joke people but
every month it looked way better than
virtually anything else around windows
one of the market it was easily
competitive with the stuff that Nokia
was putting out at that time it was the
signature device okay lots of colors so
there was lots of like brand synergies
with what Microsoft was trying to do
from branding Windows Phone they were
working together and I mean you know it
didn't flop but it sure didn't do that
good and like if that kind of phone that
looks good that feels good that performs
well and that has got like perfectly
aligned like marketing strategies from
both Microsoft and the manufacturer if
that phone can't like make a dent and
certainly didn't help HTC and didn't do
anything for Windows Phone like why
would anybody take a flyer on windows
phone right now especially now that
they've bought nokia is so it's it's
like they're in a really tough spot to
drive the platform anywhere and the
high-end except with their own stuff
they might get lucky on the low end and
get like you said ZTE or hallway or
whoever to to buy in but even then like
are they going to be are those companies
going to believe that they can do better
than 10 key is doing look with the the
510 the 520 their low-end stuff is
really really good right not to mention
Nokia's android phone which okay I
talked about here because it it was
happening during the last mobile show so
as we celebrate this transition please
uh well I already raised the roof on the
roof can only be raised once per show
I'm sorry Wow there's one called the the
threshold right yes you replay
maybe maybe you shy what is what is the
other dances what is this one transition
transition transition I don't know what
that was dinner left eNOS third put the
dealer literally left and he's just gone
um that's a joke okay no wonder what
were we sessioning to I've totally lost
it huh I was looking at Twitter and we
were already trying to talk we were
trying to talk about nokia's Anna yeah
the lady garbage I hope they build it
it's gonna be garbage no look I I think
I I really think what's happening here
and you know no key needs to do this so
there were apparently rumors that
Microsoft attempted and ultimately
decided not to kill the 2520 for obvious
reason dancing over it there is because
the 2520 you know cannibalizes the the
surface obviously and they ultimately
decided not to kill it because of that
would look weird from a regulatory
perspective they're not one company yet
I think that I think there's a lot of
factors going into that I think that
they had probably had deals with the
carriers to pick that to stock it
already because remember the 2520 is a
LTE device only and the right I need to
correct myself real quick before you
finish your point I call it threshold
that's actually a windows rumor this is
the Normandy that we're discussing right
now the low-end potential android phone
yes now continue yep so I what I think
this is is just nokia doing it you know
they're playing out their game plan
assuming very smartly that the deal will
not go through it so that they aren't
completely screwed in case it does fall
through I different you know for a
business reason or for regulatory reason
I see absolutely no reason why Microsoft
would sell this product if the if the
deal completes though well my guess is
that unless they have a an ironclad
carry agreement that they can't get out
of they will
all of this project the moment the deal
completes this is how it's going to go
down it's going to be the deal is the
Microsoft deal is going to go through
they're going to buy Nokia and then like
a contingent of Nokia engineers are
going to be laid off and then they're
going to start their own company and
they're going to put out an android
phone that looks just like the Normandy
I wish you were wrong or kidding but
you're not yeah I mean it whose are
talking to like oh I think it was you
Chris that like there there has to be
like one of the reasons this is still
going on is there has to be a sort of
pride within nokia that they can still
make their own stuff and make and and
that like there's a but there must got
to be a group of people that are still
there that are like yeah windows phone
is fine but we believe that we can do
something awesome with software on our
own we're going to keep pushing it and
they ad space on android or whatever and
like that sort of grit and determination
is what's keeping this thing alive even
on the low end but yeah well yeah that
you just said it on the low end this
isn't it to be clear this isn't designed
to compete with the 1020 right this is a
this is a device that slot somewhere
between the the aria and voluma right
asha asha rescue me asha the aria was an
HTC phone on 18 the aria is also my mind
is on CES aria is a hotel in in las
vegas where i will be spending at least
part of my week i'm not a fan of the
aria hotel I links and I like that the
whole thing about this Normandy leak is
like man look at look at this phone and
you know it's a low-end phone but like
look at it if Nokia made ant-man if they
made no Android hardware like for really
real they'd gone that direction so the
rumor is that this is not this is going
to be a would be a forked version of
Android much like Amazon does with the
kindle fires and like you know if they
end up doing that or did do that or
whatever its you're going to be the same
side bummer face that you're making now
because it's going to be like oh this
really cool hardware runs
but oh you can tomorrow I I do find it
hilarious I do find it hilarious that
Nokia is apparently working to secure
BBM for this device like it is so messed
up on so many levels well I got your
Microsoft division i can tell you
working back library to secure bbm for
Android like you talking about that i
can tell you exactly why they're doing
that look at the markets where bbm is
growing and BBM is still extremely
popular low end markets in asia and
that's where this like nice to be sold
from a business perspective it makes
perfect sense I'm just saying it's it
messes with your mind to think about
what's actually happening there but yes
I agree it makes sense uh so the thing
about Amazon the Amazon comparison is
fair but with amazon they played it very
smartly right they spend a long time
building up and preparing their own
market so that they could fork in a
result way and okay it has not done that
day I have no android market right right
I wasn't knocking Amazon's per se but I
was saying like you know Nokia's going
to do this thing that's going to be not
it's going to be Android but not android
so it's it's you're still going to be a
super super bummed out by it i mean
amazon can do with some things it's got
like the world's largest content store
or whatever and you know and it doesn't
it sells the things that cost
practically so it does really care if it
sells a lot or a few or any it's just a
window into the Amazon store the Nokia
Store is not the same thing right I mean
think think of how much good android has
done blackberry right no good yeah but
listen guys if you are in a hurry and
you can't wait for nokia to release this
federal rival device you can already go
and get the yola because that's
essentially what we're talking about it
nokia developers working getting android
apps onto a forked different arrests on
a linux place OS and with the ola you
get the Y and X store on there yay right
85,000 apps of dubious quality and hilly
5,000 where's
actually on on on the ola it's it's
pronounced years with a why I see what
you did there it took me a second to
process yandex store says years I get it
and yes they're very ups look she has
good they should just do that you know
just customize everything and just make
it really cutesy and fanciful but the
direction I would love to have like the
conversation like I'm having with like
their market a marketing person at this
company and their PR person and I'm like
so how many apps are they do you have it
and they're like well we like to say
that we have between 10 to 15,000 yaps
and they like just like subtly correct
me to yaps every time i say apps but you
realize they'd be doing that with a
Russian accent I just makes it even
better I'm threatening just a little bit
we love you Russia we do not kill us i'm
not sure if i should be offended by
proxy yeah Alice like but you know the
thing is I actually and I was reminded
by reader about this I wrote wishful
love letter sometime in like twenty
eleven i think the 2012 about a nokia
nexus and i was saying if nokia would
just do a stock android device how be in
heaven it would brilliant you'll be
awesome and you know obviously i was
talking about a high-end nokia device
and i was around the time that we have
the n9 and gloomy 800 and the kid all
that great for with this phone which
they are really looking all that much
better today but you know since then
what I thought about is you kind of have
to realize that if Nokia had got the
android root we might have had potential
even the best android phone full stop
right no matter had the best combination
of hardware software camera design
everything right yeah but that would
have been a short-term thing
you'll be sure to benefit I think
exactly the point at chris raise nokia
has some of the best Hardware designers
and has some best camera people on his
staff those guys shouldn't be in the
Android ecosystem because most of the
really good designers and hardware guys
well probably ninety nine percent of
them are either in Android or working
for apple with the iphone and we need
that third party microsoft is the
company that has the financial muscle to
survive as the third option as soon as i
pick a CEO yeah which will happen next
year but the nexus you're the point is
if talking about gone with android we
might have had better phones over the
past couple of years but ultimately the
competition would have been driven down
and we would you know we would have felt
that the rough part of that over the
next few years whereas the fact that we
now have a great design team working for
microsoft and windows phone a great
bunch of design teams working on Android
and you know apples uncontested design
chops with the iphone it gives us free
and note 3 is greater than to say yay
it's one more no it's a fair point it's
true three percent better in its it's a
fair point though like a world with only
two viable smartphone platforms is a
very depressing world indeed and the
thing that or any money about that is
like not only are we shift we're heading
towards a world with only two smartphone
platforms but we're really heading
towards a world with really only two
successful smartphone makers because
Samsung's the only android one that's
making money and obviously Apple makes
buttloads of money so if money Sony
makes a tiny little bit of money but you
know it's Samsung makes the dominant is
definitely by far the dominant Android
maker and there it's two manufacturers
on to the say uh one of each platform so
you know everything you're saying is is
very fun and it there needs to be more
competition differentiation options
actually I'm not going to try it I want
to go back
carrier stuff because uh the ctia the
carrier lobbying group that represents
the biggest carriers in the US has
agreed on six policies for allowing
consumers to unlock their cell phones
and uh it's still it's not clear if
you're allowed to unlock it when you're
under contract but they're required to
let you do it after a year or two
they're required to give you the unlock
within two days when you after you asked
for it and they're required to unlock
phones for deploying military personnel
and this is my favorite one they're
required to provide notice that you are
now eligible to have your phone unlocked
I'm sure that I'm sure that caused a lot
of gear grinding in the ctia when when
Tom wheeler came down with that
requirement yeah be the well I think
that the the most ambiguous thing at
this point and I don't think it's ever
been clarified is just what you're
saying dieter with regards to the
contract that I believe this the
specific verbiage they use is you have
to fulfill your contract in order to
qualify for unlocking and so the
question is does paying the ETF
constitute a fulfillment of the contract
or breaking of the or or if you buy a
phone at full retail and never actually
sign a contract uh well no I I think I
think that with the verbiage the way it
is now that would make you instantly
eligible for unlocking but yeah they're
not there are so many questions that are
left unanswered it almost feels like
apart from the for the military rule and
things like that it almost feels like a
symbolic victory here because verizon
already offers a lot of its phones
international unlock if you're traveling
you could buy them right away they're
unlocked for international use I think
Rick does a lot of the same thing it's
really 9018 not just AT&amp;amp;T ATT iphone
yeah it's that's really what it comes
down to yeah yeah it's it's 18 to you
who's been too stubborn one with the
unlocking but if you fulfill your
contract with them and you don't happen
to have an exclusive device they'll
unlock your phone if you call them ya
own they won't even if you're out of
contract
I don't think so maybe that policy
changed more recently but for many many
years that was like the one phone that
they held precious like that they won
well I know they are very precious about
like devices that are their exclusive so
like if you try to go unlock a lubia
1020 you're probably going to run into a
lot of brick walls um but you know the
exclusives are becoming fewer and fewer
far between these days so right but I
mean otherwise it's a good thing to have
it down as a policy and in writing yeah
but so now like that's one small step
the next step is to actually have a
network of carriers that are competitive
that you could actually switch your
phone between easily and right now you
gots t mobile and you got AT&amp;amp;T and
that's about it until we'd like I don't
know move to an LTE only world then
maybe we could start talking about being
able to switch beautiful well
unfortunately and for the phones like
the Nexus 5 which support like all these
ridiculous technologies and bands that
that's a step in the right direction but
we're going to run into I think another
technical lock between carriers when
everybody transitions to volte because
right know what I don't think that any
carrier has agreed in the US is agreed
on how they're volte is going to work
they haven't even read within carriers I
still remember the map that sprint
showed for their volte roadmap and the
first step was it would work like in the
Pacific Northwest and in the north east
and the south but this is the the
network equipment wasn't compatible with
each other you had to like it only work
if he were both in those same geographic
regions to start and they figure out
compatibility between them later now
that was HD Voice was Nick I was that HD
voice I think I why am I trying to
provide analysis I mean I've obviously
no but I mean that the point is still
good I mean like right these guys are
totally fragmented with volte nobody has
figured out how do I mean the fact that
verizon has delay their bolte deployment
like 18 times now and still hasn't
rolled out speaks volumes I mean we
first saw friesendm Oh volte in 2011 on
an LG revolution yeah Wow I think that
CES might have been ctia that year but
uh and and it's still not here and
that's because they're having you know
that I don't think they fully detailed
the kinds of problems they're having one
concern is battery life I know um but
yeah see what happens it's not a
memorization man that phone look like
car it looked like a muscle car it was I
don't know if I'd use that terminology
it lasted about as long as a muscle car
as well I was like Hello LT done yeah
pretty much I have to say Chris Oh
throughout your rant about the
fragmentation of American networks it
just so heartening to me because it just
reminds me of how glorious it is in
Europe so if you making what whatever
man like as you posted have you used
have used a single LTE network in the UK
yet Chris all I gotta say is look at the
OECD date a man that that's my
high-level trash talk for today look at
what data OECD and what are you talking
about oecd this is this is like a
multi-level troll glad just totally made
up an acronym this is some like UN
garbage what what is this what kind of
troll is this this is like eighth grade
levels too high for a troll why do you
need to cut you need to kick it down a
notch okay like just just make a comment
about my face or my mom like Chicago
yeah Chicago don't try OECD I don't know
what this means I'm closing it tab
closed um oh my god tap close didn't
read what was that was that tumblow
something what tap close didn't read
uh-oh yen know that that is that is a
very very common meme yeah the time I
was just reminded about it um I think
that's I mean I'm not going to talk
about resins the wireless charging
things no i will say that i am using
wireless chargers now i got whatever
nokia standard puck is I was looking at
their pocket just so does that work with
the next
because it never wanted to work with the
nexus for it it works better with the
nexus 5 into the nexus 4 for a while I
thought I was like causing it to
overheat but I think that was just the
nexus 5 but I love it and so I'm like
I've put a bunch of different wireless
chargers on my Christmas list because I
think it's great this accent oh yeah
that the neck that Nokia like decoupled
wireless charging from the phones was a
major blow for the foreleg wireless
charging a general i think is they were
like the biggest champions of it right
yeah i think verizon this is the biggest
champion of wireless charging yeah yeah
they at some point out is it still true
but when they first started selling LTE
phones they had a requirement that every
LTE phone they sold if it didn't ship
with Chi needed to have a chi back
accessory available so is like yes so
there's Chi and others this new one and
whatever I mean I hope that they can get
this stuff like defragmented relative
yeah like what was wrong with Chi like
is it really that much like is there so
much money in this untapped wireless
charging market that we need to fragment
in 18 different directions before we
arrive at a standard why can't everybody
say yeah okay now it exists the standard
exists everybody make accessories for
that cuz it's ridiculous yoga chi Donnie
some it'll get paid for chi and some
people don't well there's also the
offense people get cheated that was I'm
not that there's the offensively bad
branding resins which I don't even want
to discuss like everything it takes two
rackets and then attach them with a
lightning bolt yeah it's is it's the
worst and and meanwhile it mark my words
wireless charging is the next NFC like
the only way wale is charging the only
way where L is charging is ever going to
happen is when it doesn't involve a pad
it's just like through the air which is
a technology that you know different
company has been working on for a few
years now like if I could just walk into
a room and things start charging yes
I'll probably Amelia cancer but if
everything that is on my person starts
charging it's worth it is understating
as a portmanteau of resin
in essence and I find that amazing it's
the worst is what it is of course she
isn't any better but it's just pretty
cheap yeah then stop trying the Chi puns
are not going to happen they just
dropped on us like two mega bombs of
footage I a dad and just rehi
hampshire's ahead of CES I guess you
could say I'm achieving new levels funds
that merge whole show I want to thank
you so much for listening and or
watching if if you want to follow us on
twitter you can i am back on dan is chi
glad sad there's a power we are all at
verge and as we mentioned the top of the
show we're probably to be taking a
hiatus for a couple of weeks or maybe
not we might surprise you and have a New
Year's Eve crazy wild time or not but we
will let you know on the website when
that happens in the meantime or we won't
please comment hi well I I was I was I
would I'm trying to drag this out to
cope with cheap out of my own and I
can't do it so well cheat you later oh
my god just leave it to the pros dieter
that's it and the show</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
