colonize Mars and now he's taking a big
first step toward making that dream a
reality
his company SpaceX announced that it
plans to start sending spacecraft to the
Red Planet as early as 2018
that means SpaceX could be the first
private company to land Hardware on
another planet
the idea is to test out how to land
large payloads on the Martian surface to
do that SpaceX will be sitting over its
red dragon vehicle it's a modified
version of the dragon cargo capsule that
SpaceX uses to deliver supplies to the
International Space Station
the red dragon has eight super Draco
engines embedded in its hull during the
descent to Mars the engines will fire
allowing the spacecraft to land gently
and in a controlled manner it's a
technique known as propulsive landing
and it's similar to how SpaceX lands its
Falcon 9 but landing a spacecraft on
Mars is a lot harder than landing one on
earth the Martian atmosphere is 100 the
density of Earth's atmosphere so
provides less cushion for incoming
spacecraft that means really heavy
objects from the risk of slamming into
the Martian surface if they aren't
slowed down enough right now
NASA only knows how to land 2,000 pounds
on Mars but with propulsive landings
even more weight could get to the
surface safely SpaceX is red dragon
would be five to ten times larger than
anything ever landed on Mars there's
still a lot to do before the red dragon
missions can happen though SpaceX plans
to transport the spacecraft to Mars
using its Falcon Heavy a souped up
version of the Falcon 9 the Falcon Heavy
is still in development though so it has
yet to fly the Spacek says the Rockets
first flight is supposed to happen in
November of this year also SpaceX has
never landed the dragon using the super
Draco's before it's used the engines to
make the vehicle ascend and even hover
but never land spacex will try to
propulsively land a dragon cargo capsule
on earth first after it turns from a
station supply run the red dragon
missions are all privately funded but
SpaceX is still getting some help from
NASA
the space agency said it will provide
technical support to the company in
exchange for data regarding the dragons
landing attempts meanwhile NASA is still
hoping to send its own astronauts to
Mars in the mid 2030s
but with SpaceX in
the private company may be closer to
doing it first want to learn more about
how SpaceX lands its rockets check out
our video on how they pulled it off or
if you need an even more ambitious space
exploration goal check out our video on
star shot which involves sending a
spacecraft to Alpha Centauri with a
laser okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
