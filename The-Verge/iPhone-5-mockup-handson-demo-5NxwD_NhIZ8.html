ready for 2012 in Berlin and we're
taking a look at something pretty
special it is an iPhone 5 mock-up here
we have an iPhone 4s or a size
comparison as you can see this looks
very much like all the leaks that have
come out previously we've got a to tap
to tone back cover here and flipping it
around to the front you've got what
looks to match the four inch leaks and
rumors that we heard of the iPhones
display going vertically higher so this
is the original iPhone 4s and this is
how big how tall the new iPhone display
would be assuming that this mock-up is
actually legitimate we have gotten a
hold of this from one of the case
manufacturers here in Berlin which is
chosen to remain nameless in order not
to upset a certain company what we have
been led to believe however is that case
manufacturers are very confident about
this new design and are starting to
produce cases in volume in order to ship
them in next week as soon as next week
to retailers so here are the changes the
dock connector at the bottom has been
shrunken exactly as we've seen still got
screws on the side of it right there you
have openings for speakers on the
original iPhone 4 and 4s only one of the
openings is a speaker presumably the
same with this new one and you have the
headphone port which is usually on the
top when I go the design but is now here
at the bottom flipping this iPhone 5
back up to the top now you only really
have power / lock button nothing else on
the top looking at the left side nothing
seems to really change
it doesn't have that colored label we've
seen some leagues that do have the
colored label and you might also notice
that beyond the metal the metals around
there is still a little layer for the
display which matches this one but this
is notably thinner than the iPhone 4 and
iPhone 4s design the home buttons look
to be pretty much identical and they
operated pretty pretty much the same way
one of the notable missions from this
iPhone 5 mock-up is that you don't have
the little dots for opening up what we
presume is a micro-sim slot tray and
just to flip it around to the back you
still got the camera in the top left
hand corner looking at the phone in this
position put an LED flash near it and
you have a whole bunch of FCC and other
iPhone levels at the bottom notably the
iPhone font doesn't seem to match Apple
styling but again this is just a mock-up
and come around to the front perhaps the
biggest change is the move of the
front-facing camera from the side of the
APS
for you to talk so that's really it it
really seems to look exactly as other
leagues who suggested that it would look
from five in is thinner it is Torah in
the iPhone 4 and 4s and we really just
have to wait to see how the software
works how much of a difference that
makes in day-to-day use so that's it a
quick glimpse at an iPhone 5 mock-up
here in Eva 2012 in Berlin</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
