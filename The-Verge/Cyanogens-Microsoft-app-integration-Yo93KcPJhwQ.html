we're looking at cyanogen OS this isn't
just the regular OS that we used to know
such a got a lot of the Microsoft apps
integrated into it and so we saw this
announced last year and this is
basically the first time that we've seen
it in action so sitting at this home
screen here if I just say hey Cortana
take a selfie I'm gonna take a selfie as
you'd expect of the max suite and then
this is a good example of the
integration just that voice integration
but once we're in the camera here you
can also do other types of integrations
so you see that I've just switched to a
Moute there's a mode button down the
bottom here and that allows me to select
a bunch of different apps and within
here so you can see that much less
hyperlapse apps is also integrated in
here so immediately bring you into the
hyperlapse interface so you can quickly
shoot a high plateau video real
interesting one and they go you can
speed it up and down what you'd expect
if you went into the actual app this is
actually integrated into the camera
interface now back on the home screen
you can see that there's the dialer app
here there's also integration here and
so you got Skype at the moment and you
can see the skype icon next to Derek
there if I tap on there it will
immediately start a video call and then
it'll take you straight into the Skype
interface and your boss to be able to to
have that video cool and in the actual
call as well and you'll get like OneNote
integration where you can do notes and
another Skype integration what's really
interesting about this is obviously this
is all the Mike's of the integration
we've seen we've heard about and we're
seeing today but it also extends to
third parties so CyanogenMod platform
that we're announcing today and as you
can see from the lock screen here we've
got Instagram integrating on the
lockscreen
that's the best account the verge
account is the one you want to follow
this is going to extend beyond just the
Microsoft apps so that solves the
Instagram we'll probably see Twitter
other sort of popular apps if you wanna
see anything more from Mobile Congress
and follow the verge on youtube so it's
youtube.com/ full slash the verge</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
