interesting options could involve
microsoft reuters also says the company
has approached rim about switching over
to Windows Phone it's all rumor at this
point but one thing's for certain rim is
likely considering some pretty dire
solutions to what is clearly a very dire
situation speaking of Microsoft HP is
confirmed that it will not be selling
arm-based Windows RT tablets when
windows 8 launches later this year
instead it'll focus on tablets with
Intel's x86 platform the company says
that's due in part to a larger ask the
ecosystem since Intel tablets will work
with any Windows software while
arm-based Windows RT can only run the
new Metro platform so far the only
confirmed Windows RT tablets include a
Seuss's tablet 600 and Microsoft's own
surface in Google News this week we sat
down with Android UX director matias

review of the sous nexus 7 calling it
the best android tablet yet for two
hundred dollars it's also a great Buy
