we're taking a look at the newest
version of Google's Chrome OS running on
two new Samsung devices a series five
Chromebook laptop and a series three
chrome box desktop as I mentioned though
Chrome OS is the real story here it's
been completely revamped and improved in
a huge way it actually feels like a real
legitimate operating system kind of for
the first time everything you do is
still in a chrome window but Google made
the whole user experience a lot more
like Windows or Mac OS there's a much
better when doing experience you can
open things as tabs or as standalone
windows that basically just look like
apps so Gmail starts to feel like a
native app rather than just another tab
in a Chrome window there's also a real
desktop now with the wallpaper you can
change and a taskbar that looks like a
mix between the dock in Mac OS and the
windows taskbar and there are quick
launch settings on the right side kind
of like what you'd get an Android 4.0
the basic paradigm hasn't changed though
apps are still websites and everything
still happens in a Chrome window it's
just managed better now instead of
having tons of tabs in a single window
you can manage it more like you would
native apps it's much faster and more
stable now to previous versions had some
problems just with basic tasks and now
it just works much more fluidly and much
better the biggest problem is that there
are still some things you just can't do
in a web browser Chrome OS doesn't have
apps like Skype and even some chat
clients or Twitter apps or photo editing
apps leave a lot to be desired it's also
tough to do things like listen to music
in the background if you want to pause
your music so you can watch a video you
have to switch to the correct tab and
pause the music and then go back and
it's just a little slower to do a lot of
things that you'd normally do with
native apps also since apps are still
just bookmarks if you click on an icon
it won't know that there's already a
window open and will actually open
another instance and once you have ten
different windows of your email open it
starts to get a little messy at this
point with Chrome OS there's really not
a lot you can't do using a browser but a
lot of things are still slower and
clunkier than having separate native
apps that the operating system
recognizes as distinct things so next
there's the new hardware first there's
the samsung series 5 chromebook laptop
which hasn't changed much from last
year's model it's still light it weighs
3.3 pounds and it's very clean and
minimal it's available in a silver color
and it's good looking but it's not quite
as sleek as the all-black cr-48 or the
white and black series 5 from last year
it's largely the same hardware but has
a few Newports which is nice there are
two USB 2.0 ports an SD card slot a
headphone jack an Ethernet port and a
display port it has a good keyboard with
chiclet style keys that feel a little
cheap but work relatively well and there
are a lot of function keys designed
specifically for Chrome OS there are
keys specific to searching or switching
windows or going back and forth within
the browser and it just makes navigating
around the OS really easy the trackpad
is also really excellent it has two
finger scrolling which works really well
and it's just much more responsive and
smooth than we're used to even from
desktop computers the Chromebook has a
12.1 inch 1280 by 800 matte display and
since it's matte and not glossy it can
actually be used outdoors which is
really great the screens not perfect it
mutes colors a little bit and washes out
when you get off the vertical axis but
it works pretty well in general that
performs the computers really really
solid most of that is due to the OS
itself being much better but the new 1.3
gigahertz dual-core Intel Celeron
processor and four gigs of ram work well
and I never had any performance issues
with the Chromebook at all the
Chromebook was generally really fast
really stable even with intensive games
or flash heavy sights it really never
broke down boot and resume times are
also insanely fast it takes about 6
seconds to turn on and connect to the
Internet and two seconds to resume from
sleep which is just crazy the Chromebook
also gets really great battery life
you'll get a solid full day of use out
of it seven or eight hours and we got
consistently above that on our battery
tests the device starts at $449 but for
549 you can get one with a Verizon radio
inside and it actually comes with a
hundred megabytes of free data per month
then there's the chrome box it's kind of
like the Mac Mini and it's basically a
bunch of ports plus Chrome OS it has six
USB ports to display ports an Ethernet
port DVI and a headphone jack google
says it can power screens up to 30
inches but it worked well on big TVs
that we tested as well it has the same
performance as a Chromebook it works
really well it's really stable has 4
gigs of RAM plus a 1.9 gigahertz
dual-core Intel processor and caus'd
just again no problems in our test but
that's largely due to Chrome OS being
far better than it was so in all this is
a huge leap forward for Chrome OS it's
some of the best hardware we've seen yet
and the operating system is far more
stable and far more useful than ever
before the problem is that I'm not sure
we're ready for an operating system and
a computer that live completely online
and until Google is able to really make
offline access work well
I'm not sure anyone will be at $329 for
the chromebox and for 49 for the
Chromebook you can easily buy a tablet
or even a cheap Windows computer and
you'd still have a more versatile and
more useful device in all situations
Chrome OS is definitely on its way but
I'm not sure it's there yet</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
