Jobs his desk they'd be fired I'm Walt
Mossberg I have been reviewing tech
gadgets since the early 90s and
collecting them since the 80s and I
wanted to show you some of my collection
so this is a real milestone product in
consumer technology it's the first
successful eReader
it's the Amazon Kindle the very first
one there were many tries at e-readers
before Kindles and I was quite
interested in it so I reviewed them all
and they all had huge problems either in
terms of acquiring the books or reading
the books or battery life or whatever
the Kindle was the first thing that had
I think a really terrific reading and
buying experience within a few pages you
completely forget that you're reading on
a Kindle and that was our top design
requirement it's an incredible way to
get books you can you know one push of a
button and you have whatever new book
you wanted I will say that it is one of
the worst and ugliest industrial designs
it can't be a flashing device it's
really not that well designed it was
clumsy it was very easy to accidentally
turn the page or this huge button here
which was also where you held it and if
you hit this button the page returned so
you were constantly turning the page
when you weren't ready to turn the page
it had a physical keyboard that was
really funky it the keys were kind of at
strange angles to scroll use this little
wheel and then what looked like an old
mercury thermometer would have some kind
of indicator that went up and down in
this little tiny window I mean it was
just awful
I think what's carried forward from this
is the idea that
and it's still controversial among some
people but the idea that you carry
around many many books in one fairly
small device they built Kindle apps that
ran on other people's platforms and
worked seamlessly with these devices or
even if you didn't know in these devices
so they created a massive ecosystem
around this and that has been an
enduring legacy of this what went away
was all this almost crippled around it
look it was a first shot at something
that was really important and became
important when you think of eReader as
you think of Kindle it's just it's like
Kleenex and that's really a testament to
what they did here</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
