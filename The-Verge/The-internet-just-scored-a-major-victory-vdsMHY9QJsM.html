majority of this commission as we vote
for a fast fair and open Internet so
today was a big day we saw title 2 as
the new Authority for an open Internet
municipal broadband cannot be banned by
local legislators and the FCC has really
great taste in funk music today was
pretty incredible we got to watch the
FCC debate its new rules for the open
Internet and I cleaned out my entire
email inbox during the two lengthy and
very detailed tie rates given by the
Republican members yeah they knew they
had no chance here it was already
decided and so they really took their
time in explaining why they did not like
net neutrality but I was fine because
the rest of the Commission gave much
briefer speeches kind of outlining the
reasons that we've heard over the past
you know year about how important and
neutrality is to protecting economic
opportunities and diversity of voices in
the internet yeah it felt to me like the
breakup talk you know if you know it's
coming but you want to make sure you
hide your say they really just needed to
get it off their chest and then Tom
wheeler could not stop banging that
gavel ya know there was a lot of
excitement when he finally said the eyes
have it and now the rules were in place
the you know the room broke into
applause which probably doesn't happen
all that often at FCC meetings yeah it
was a funky start and a really great
finish I thought the rules of the
professor this month are now official
they're going to go in place establishes
really important that neutrality rules a
lot of what advocates have been pushing
for we've got internet providers and not
allowed to block websites or apps or
services and I'll have to throttle any
of those either and there's no paid fast
lanes the boogieman of you know this
internet where the ISPs are controlling
what you see or what arrives at your
home is it better to access as easier
access as faster access is now off the
table we didn't have that to a huge
extent right now but there were signs of
companies doing this stuff
and this is going to prevent any of that
from happening in a major way and the
Federal Communications Commission now
has the tools it needs to prevent
companies from doing those things when
or should they try to do this right so
the Democrats talked about this in terms
of the Internet has been this great
economic engine we invented it it's like
a point of pride and we're going to
protect it and the Republicans basically
said the opposite
yeah the Republican said this is
government overreach etc etc new taxes
yeah this is gonna go awful for the
internet no business members right you
can pretty much guess what they said and
the reality is the FCC has done its part
now the ISPs are probably going to get
them back in court they'll file some
lawsuits just like we saw before with
Comcast and AT&amp;amp;T and Congress is also
going to start working on its own sort
of update to the Telecommunications Act
kind of put themselves into play yes so
those are the expectations the FCC
definitely is going to have you know a
big court issue ahead of it itself once
wonder fight or another you know
challenges these rules there are a lot
of different issues that they have to
bring up and some of their arguments
seem better than others we'll definitely
have to wait and see how those pan out
to me the chances look pretty good for
the Communications Commission but you
know I'm also not a legal expert right
so disclaimer neither of us is a lawyer
so there's been a lot of posturing from
Congress that this is actually Obama's
plan not the FCC's plan that he kind of
big-footed them by going out in public
and saying how he thought that they
should vote and so now they would like
to insert themselves into this process
if they feel the FCC has been
compromised
Congress will step up to the plate and
write some new more modern
telecommunications laws that will govern
how you know broadband providers can and
can't act right and the problem
potentially is that a Republican
legislation might give the FCC less
ability to actually do its job and
enforce you know rules that promote
an open broadband network but again we
still have to see how that plays out now
there are rules in place or that there
are going to be rules in place you know
the issue may be less of a hot topic
right I mean another thing that happened
today which was kind of a subset of the
big picture was municipal broadband so
the FCC decided that small cities and
towns that would like to build their own
fiber can and this has been an issue in
some states you know local government
has basically passed laws restricting
them from competing with private
enterprise and so I believe that for now
this only takes effect in the two cities
or the two municipalities that had
petitioned the FCC to you know preempt
the state laws are preventing them but
this is a big deal and this is gonna
really start to help with the issue of
competition and you know that is the
other big battle with the internet right
now there's no competition among wired
internet providers and wireless internet
providers are not exactly an alternative
that's diradical e more expensive in
most cases right it's incredible because
we've seen these small towns and places
providing gigabit service to their
citizens and that is at the very high
end of what's being offered in the
supposedly you know competitive
broadband space right and so now we see
the FCC saying you know season towns
should be able to do this this is going
to help broadband deployment this is
going to help people get better access
there's no reason that they shouldn't be
able to do this right I mean the crazy
thing to me about the whole discussion
around what the FCC is doing is we were
trying to ward off this boogeyman that
people could start blocking or
throttling services but that hasn't
really been happening it's not a
widespread problem it's a potential
problem and now the shoe is kind of on
the other foot the FCC has weighed in
with its new rules and Republicans are
saying the sky is falling there'll be
new taxes and businesses will shut down
so we're gonna wait and see if that
boogieman yeah it's absolutely true and
I mean it seems like a slightly absurd
proposal that's suddenly some new
Commissioner is going to come into the
FCC and go totally crazy and just
absolutely ruin
you know internet providers he has that
power she has that power it is true they
may well be able to you know but again
that is you know the new spook that
everybody is agreeing about okay so six
months from now we'll check back in will
we have to pay Internet taxes where do I
pay my internet taxes is the internet
dead in the water exactly
six months from now the new rules are
gonna be in place and probably
everything's going to be exactly the
same right except there's going to be a
court challenge okay status quo thanks
