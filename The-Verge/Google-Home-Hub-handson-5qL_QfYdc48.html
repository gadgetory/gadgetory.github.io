at the new Google Home Hub it's new
Google home product it's got the
seven-inch display in the front first
you want tell you is it's really small
it's a 7 inch display but it's a lot
smaller than you would expect it comes
in four colors white black pink this
really cool blue that I've got here it's
really cute it's got front firing
speakers and if you just tap on it
you'll see there's not really like an
interface or a homescreen it's just a
list of actions you can take and you can
obviously talk to Google assistant and
the big feature is if you swipe down you
get the control center for your home
it's called home view and you can just
go into rooms I can turn the lights off
in here I can tap on the rooms here we
are in the bedroom I can swipe back
again I can pick the lights it's
integrated with the he lights in this
room so I can set the brightness I can
change the color if you're using a
different kind of lights like with X
lights that actually show you all the
color options this all just gets set up
in the Google home app but this is kind
of the big features this home view where
you can control your entire smart home
in here there's a nest thermostat over
there I can obviously screw at that I
can also obviously it's Google assistant
I can just cast videos using ants I can
say hey Google play the pixel to review
from the verge on the bedroom TV
honestly big round smart speakers is
discoverability so you just swipe over
you can see explore more things for an
assistant to do this is pretty neat like
the echo shown other smart displays like
this don't really do this so you can say
control lighting you can tap on it it'll
show you all the things you can say but
then you can also just hit the button
and do it so you get kind of a touch
interface for your home and other things
Google system do the Google Home Hub
also has something called ambient EQ
which is basically a light sensor you
can see here we have a print photo on
the Left we have the Home Hub on the
right as the light changes color you can
see the display on the home of changes
to look exactly like a print photo
reflecting the light that's pretty cool
is very similar to other ambient light
technologies
an iphone with true tone but here it's
about an amazing queue it's something
Google home hub to other things I can't
show you one because it's actually not
here there's no camera on the home of
Google says they did add a camera
because they want you to be able to put
it in your bedroom and other private
areas without worrying about it that's a
big decision it's very different than
the echo show or the Facebook portal
that just came out there's also parental
controls which I can't show you because
you have to set them up in the app but
you can lock this out you can set up Do
Not Disturb and there's a mode where it
won't even respond to you during down
time which is the Home Hub can also
integrate with video doorbells here when
you ring the nest doorbell you can see
the video popup on the home of right
away and you can also talk back to the
person waiting Google Home Hub is $149 a
super aggressive price great price
actually comes out October 27th retail
you can pre-order it right now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
