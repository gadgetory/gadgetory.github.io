entertainment editor for The Verge and I
am in LA with yacht yacht is John about
taupe and Claire Evan and they make
really fun futuristic dance music and
their new album is called I thought the
future would be cooler and it sort of
themed around outdated technology just
different older visions of the future
that haven't really quite come to pass
so I thought it would be perfect if we
hung around LA and looked at some of the
more interesting lost visions of the
future that still exists around the city
so we are here at the theme building at
LAX LAX being the major airport of the
Los Angeles area it's a pretty
recognizable structure anytime anybody's
flying in or out of Los Angeles that's
pretty much the identifier of where you
are but it's a place that not a lot of
people go to and it's kind of been in
disuse for a while now it's true well it
was originally supposed to be the
central ticketing building of the entire
airport when the store was designed in
the sixties like it was supposed to be
this massive central glass dome under
which all the terminals will connect and
people would come in and this would be
like a atrium interchange especially
with all the green the greenery in here
like it's sort of it's a metaphor for
Los Angeles as a whole this protected
glass dome where everything's green they
began construction 59 and they finished
it in 61 that's and how long was it
actually used before
zero zero amount of time by the time
this building was like dedicated it
wasn't serving a central function at all
it was just as I want to say decorative
it seems like the wrong word but it was
kind of more like a symbolic building it
was supposed to represent like a lady's
vision of itself as a city of the future
so in addition to the theme building
kind of being a symbol of Los Angeles
and the symbol of LAX it's kind of this
symbol of how travel used to be this
sort of glamorous thing or this
aspirational thing yes and I guess
that's sort of why I've I've never come
here before because now when you travel
it's a hassle and you're just trying to
get from point A to B as painlessly as
possible way more stressful than a yeah
well yeah I mean it's less of like a
novel
like let's put on our nice clothes to go
on a trip she doesn't smoke a cigarette
on the plane well we have our yeah
totally yeah it's true now I know it's
just like brutalist you know in and out
that's impossible you have to pay to
have the luxuries that you once had for
free
the Bonaventure hotel Bonaventure hotel
the Bonaventure hotel Bonaventure man
event rolls out the Bonaventure hotel
this place was built in 1976 and it
feels like 1976 like 1976 is dreams 1976
is aesthetic aspirations it's like all
crazy concrete and pods and mirrored
pools and clear elevators and I think it
was originally designed to be like you
know an indoor retail hotel public space
but I don't know and I think in Los
Angeles people are not very receptive to
the idea of manufactured interior space
like this it was kind of bound to fail
like it wants to be a pedestrian place
it wants to be like a public place but
it's completely in zero conversation
with the rest of the city yeah it's hard
to get to on foot from other parts of
downtown it's kind of like this weird
pod and it has this kind of like weirdly
utopian idea of how people would use
public space in the city like there's
this running track you know no one's
gonna no one's running on that except
for you in 2004 consider yeah this is
like the biggest hotel in LA and we are
in a massive metropolitan city like it's
empty you know what I mean like these
are all these retail spaces are empty
which is weird I mean it's totally
underused in that way and it's that
thing again and again of people using
modernist buildings to stand in for the
future like this confusion of modernism
like a very specific period of time or
postmodern as my guess is living a
postmodern to stand in for tomorrow when
buildings in the future are never gonna
look like this I know everywhere we look
we see a million miles away further than
a dream here we are in the shadow of the
Tri for you
it's six stories 60 tons no one likes it
no one ever liked it
no one ever liked this but this was kind
of like his big utopian dream this
sculptor which was supposed to light up
at night and play music on a series of
glass bells who was supposed to be
reactive it would react to people's
footsteps in the pedestrian mall down
underneath us what's the word Polly
photo kinetic you got it as soon as they
opened it I mean as soon as it was
unveiled the computer broke they called
it a lot of names I mean like they
called it like free wish free wish burns
in search of a turkey and like the
psychedelic Nickelodeon and then the
Trifield Laurie yeah it's I don't know
it's always seems like it was very a
beautiful aspiration they would release
let's have laser beams shooting into
space yeah yeah it was really ahead of
its time I mean the thing that's super
tragic about this piece of art for me is
that like we have technology now that
could very easily just do what this
sculpture and urgently intended to do so
I guess in its own way this sculpture
kind of asks a lot of questions about
sound that a band has to ask itself in
2015 where it goes how to make it the
most enjoyable and accessible you guys
play around I think you you're pretty
experimental as far as where your music
is used and and and how it gets out
there we kind of see our music is like a
platform for us to do a bunch of stuff
so I mean it's not like the music is not
important it's hugely important but it's
number one it's number one but then
there's all this other stuff that
surrounds music especially now that are
all opportunities to do interesting
things you know it's like there's got to
be some visual component there's got to
be some video
there's got to be language around it
there's got to be like the way it is
disseminated like it's pretty much
expected at this point that if you're
gonna put out a single that needs to be
a second piece of news you know ready to
be something stunned or something around
it you're creating a whole experience a
band is an experience this is it all of
Los Angeles is water right here right
now fun fact about this water people
complain about the water at the
department water power keeping this
water here cuz it seems wasteful and a
drought but apparently a it's recycled
water see they all the LA DWP servers
are in this building and so ostensibly
if there's a power outage then this
water will be drained out and used to
cool the server room this building has
two amazing things about it one it's
surrounded by water and two at night it
lights up like crazy so it's like this
huge excess of both water and power just
to show us this is shows that they have
it because water and power is is power
in Los Angeles water especially is power
in love in great soil great Sun no water
add water great place but not
sustainable in any real way people are
always fearing some kind of disaster in
LA I mean you guys identified as as a
Los Angeles and as a California Vance
would there be anything that could ever
get you guys to want to completely
reconsider we're going down with the
ship yeah down with the ship for sure I
can't imagine I mean I really cannot
imagine another place but it would like
excite me intellectually and personally
as much as Los Angeles to us especially
right now I mean I think the way that
people in this city are like bending
together to make a sustainable city like
I mean it's a little late and our
infrastructure is certainly not
supporting it but you know there are
efforts that are being made and they're
like these grand utopian plans that are
being made about the future of LA that I
haven't like seen those kinds of things
since like similar plans in the 60s like
right all these buildings that we've
seen today like I have this kind of
aspirational quality to them and I think
that that is coming back into the
language yeah
no I think it's I think it's exciting no
matter what having lived in both LA and
New York
I do think it's exciting to be in a
place where it's not all the way figured
out yet</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
