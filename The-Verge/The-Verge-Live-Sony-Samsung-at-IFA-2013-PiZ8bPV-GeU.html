your host ross miller joining me is dr.
chaos right here hello hello dr. chaos
I'm here so here's a tap so let's talk
about our guys are at Aoife in Germany
that's what's happening today and it's
probably the biggest trade show outside
of cs definitely at least for technology
and Samsung and Sony in these two
companies in particular are throwing out
all the stops because Apple is next week
yes so Samsung's big sure I mean that
just that it's just a huge parade of
products from both companies today and
also be clear late last year dzifa too I
think happened just before samsung or
before an apple event a lot of time
announcements there yeah we've really
made this trade show something to go for
just months before see us and with the
watch with the gear I think the I think
Samsung really wanted to beat Apple yes
because they're xtina obviously was
expecting Apple to make a watch nobody
knows why people should wear these
watches I mean I have a lot of ideas I
have a lot of thoughts about why a
SmartWatch should be good i think the
pedal is the pebble is a really good
proving ground yeah the kickstarter
phenom pebble like it's great I mean but
Samsung's coming out I like phenom it's
a good word uh but Samsung's coming in
like about a year before we're expecting
Apple dude we're not thinking we're not
thing as much here yeah I don't think
one night they coming up next week
though not I really would be very
surprised no this is they're getting out
this is like that kind of creation or
like the industry it's a watershed
moment first SmartWatch we've been
talking about it for a full year this is
the first major company no offense to
Sony that's actually really doing this
you haven't sony has one see but they
were so Sony SmartWatch day was like and
a watch that's kind of here it's from
last year do it o generations Samsung's
product the gear is a full-fledged like
Andy I device has like 70 apps okay so
where I think we're ready again with the
hands on let's try that one more time
yeah hey guys have leveled a ver charity
for Berlin and we take a look at
samsung's new galaxy gear smartwatch
this is a smartphone accessory the
company is just introduced can take an
our first look at it unlike other
smartwatches this one actually comes
with a
embedded camera it's 1.9 megapixel
camera it also has a speaker so it has
this metal buckle and a speaker and it
has a metal case it has multiple watch
faces as you might expect from
smartwatches has notifications it has
your contact you can take voice memos s
voice activation you can do quite a few
things that relate to your galaxy device
Samsung describes this is perfect
companion for the new Galaxy Note 3
which it's increased today fortunately
the speaker seems to be rather quiet so
if you actually want to carry out a call
you want to do it in a quiet location
because you'll do the kind of futuristic
thing of holding this up to your head
and having a phone call that way if you
swipe down from top you should be able
to access the camera and you can record
up to 10 second videos at 720p
resolution and you can take quick
snapshots Sampson has a number of
applications dedicated to this he has a
pedometer right here and it is working
on other apps from other developers it
actually has more than 70 applications
as of September 2013 and says it's
working really hard with developers to
try and get some more the display on
here is a 1.6 63 inch display 320 x 320
resolution Super AMOLED the processor on
board is an 800 megahertz Exynos single
core processor from Samsung and the
price should be somewhere around three
hundred dollars Samson says 299 when it
launches in early October in the United
States it would actually have a global
launch a little earlier than that by the
end of September so this is a very first
look at the samsung galaxy gear to use
here at Aoife Berlin 2013
all right that is nowhere near as likely
as like let me just let me just stop
okay stop you back to 99 not look I've
paid two hundred dollars for watch
before yes it's been done like this like
a fashion washed like a fashionable
right cool how much was this this one no
no actually either i'm in thia the metal
chains right this one is this mystery
this one was like I don't know I got
this one it's like 80 uh what's it but
yeah all right yeah it's old this is
priceless is what I'm saying look I paid
a lot of money for watch people pay a
lot of money for watches but if you're
gonna try to go into market of like the
kids who don't have watches and this is
the major accessory for your phone I
don't think three hundred dollars is way
right to be anything as a watch as a
fashion accessory it's not something you
replace often but the SmartWatch itself
that's probably going to get upgraded
every couple years you're gonna want to
keep buying this and for three hundred
dollars that's not an option right well
it may be so the big and the other
problem is Vlad has it in his written
review or is written report on a on the
gear and not so much the video but he
says it's really lagging right it looked
a little bit especially with ya when he
was swiping up you can see it's like
really slow so it's three hundred
dollars for an 800 my cards prostitutes
lying you for battery life that is
quoted at about a day I just I'm excited
about the idea of storm watches I really
am I think that I think they're gonna be
cool I don't know if I don't know if
racing the beat Apple by making a small
crappy smartphone that has a battery
life throughout a day is like the way to
go no here's a couple other things that
is worth mentioning because it is a big
announcement for smartwatch but it's
limited in functionality it's a little
slow and for now it's only compatible
with the galaxy note 3 in the galaxy
note 10.1 which were also just announced
no other android phones certainly not an
iphone or anything like that you need to
buy brand new samsung devices with they
said they're going to upgrade the s for
the note 2 and then so i think that a
lot of speculation is that like they
need to add android or a bluetooth 4.3
support the low-energy sport so that is
like part of i'm sorry bluetooth smart
which is part of android 4.3 so they've
got to upgrade these phones android 4.3
so like there's just a lot right by the
time the thing comes out i wouldn't
expect there's no way they're gonna put
the single market without
compatible if they ask for hopefully not
and but the thing is also like this is
like such an early thing like it does
feel almost prototype ish in the way
it's like so limited in scope I mean I
think it's cool it was really cool way
no wrong but let's be on a prototype
write it so it's a finished product
they've got the app support right we
just got a press release web pocket for
the phone yeah evernote what you have
evernote glimpse path myfitnesspal and
RunKeeper which obviously very important
for this trip it and pocket to it just
gets great yeah it's great manulife look
at it here to flood alert that's awesome
all the ideas are there and i think
actually where Samsung has succeeded in
sort of like beating Apple of the punch
is that they have an idea of what this
product should be yes it is flushed out
beyond we're Samsung we just made a
bunch of stuff right like it's it's it's
at least like a complete idea of my
father but Samsung's forte is selling to
the masses and this is not a device for
the masses this is early adopter like
you're paying a pretty penny it's
limited compatibility you must really
want a SmartWatch and really trust
Samsung before you get this project and
that second piece of trusting samsung is
a big deal I mean Samsung does not have
a super terrific history of supporting
these products that don't succeed so you
have to believe it this thing is going
to succeed to the point where Samsung's
going to keep releasing updates for it
or they're not going to put out a new 18
months from now and like forget about
that which they do I mean they do it all
lastly this does feel like I don't like
I hate to make an apple compares it
feels like the first generation macbook
air it's crummy it's early adopter but a
year later they finally fix it like
figure out what to do those people first
shy macbook airs like crap yeah no look
it's very exciting people are freaking
out about and I can't imagine people
aren't gonna buy it in droves oh no I'm
probably to buy one too well I see I
can't write because I have a one well so
I guess yesterday I would have to buy a
note 3 which by the way if we're in talk
just really quickly about that before
get back to watch is five point seven
inches it's actually bigger than the
note 2 which was five point three inches
like they're just making that phablet
thing where they want to call it like so
much bigger now it's at the point of it
that's exactly it's now to the point
where I don't know if it'll fit my
pocket I certainly never want to pull it
out so I need like you have to have the
watch if you're going to get this so
actually that's why another question so
you can pair the watch with the note
10.1
the other note and then soon the s4
right which one do you pick I so it was
very clearly an accessory right it's not
it's not a primary computing device it's
not a primary mobile but it was like you
know why would you pair it to a 10 inch
tablet what do you do with your phone
half the time you look for notifications
now I don't have to actually pull it out
to do that what do you put why would you
pair it to a 10 inch tablet know what I
mean that's like AI just slightly a why
not situation we have it but that's
that's samsung samsung samsung why not
Ivan at school like you got to respect
them for just always doing that writing
like and we made a watch you compare it
to this 10 inch tablet with a pen
samsung why not that's good I just I
don't understand like um where they
think the real market for this product
is beyond the market of people who hate
apple and want to say they had a
SmartWatch before Apple which is a
hungry market it's a big market and if
they get huge one if they get that they
can fund the next one that is for the
masses it's not quite google glass
what's that same kind of strategy like
we're getting people out there not
limiting it but God knows how many but
weren't going to buy it 300 watch with a
brand-new 23 nadal or device the two
things i think that are really awesome
at it are a camera in the wristband
which is silly and I have a theory about
this okay and the speaker and the thing
which is flat says just too quiet but
the only you can make it sounds like
this yeah that's all I can't wait to
like walk around going oh yeah literally
they just yes I don't she was just do
this for no reason so this is cool if
they make this work that's the best this
is like classic camera my thriller and I
think this comes down this is what the
Sony lens too I think we're at the dawn
of a new age of creep shot in it like
that's basically what I'm seeing here is
like recognize this are about ready
reinvest in like so you can I hide this
this thing is like this this one that
takes ultra this is Sony's new yeah
music video recorder I'm gonna drop this
past test two of them in the world you
can just like oh look it's just that's
great I'm just listening to you and
they're very like it's very thin it's
real anxious hello hello roster Noah
hello how's it going so big brother I'm
paltrow per side we can talk about these
later yeah telling a new age of creep
shot innovation is
that is that is the catchphrase the day
the Amaze creep shot what why would you
want a camera near a span just feel like
which i think is it look I actually
think it's kind of cute with the one
exception that it looks like a giant
boar you imagine like just think I'm CA
ladies and clasping like now yeah is
that time time is oh you won't know what
time it is Croucher pretty high look I I
don't mean maybe the camera and then the
speaker are like the things that
appealed to me because they're the least
they're the ones that take a watch
beyond just being a watch okay right
like a smart wat like everything else
about it's like sort of expected well be
like well it's expected but it's never
been done well like a watches glanceable
information needs to be just what time
is it now it's who the front you know
who is emailing me at two in the morning
in apps I mean I want to see what these
apps do we have any screenshots of this
I don't think we do yet if we do i'm
sure they'll pop the screen but i am
curious about Evernote for example it's
alert pocket I'm not gonna read on what
is a one-point 63-inch 320 by 3 20 ml
LED screen I'm not going to read that
like a full book on that right or an
article so the pocket things weird I'm
glad it's there but again it's all just
because kind of thing kudos really Suzie
kudos pocket for doing that good luck
can you change the band's I don't think
so because the cameras on there yeah but
I mean maybe it's connected in some way
some kind of we have all these colors I
think the colors are cool the colors are
cool the names are ridiculous gah wild
orange yeah rose gold which none of us
read or goal of that point it's like a
reddish the rose rose rose rose color
gold rose gold jet black mocha gray
oatmeal beige which is the most
unattractive adjectives you could add to
this color and lime green of course so I
mean if I could change them if I could
get all the bands of the van spray cost
$100 I'm sure something like that I just
here's what I but I'm trying to get out
of the gear right now is they made it I
think it's cool i think if i had an s4 I
probably get one instantly as soon as we
know when it's gonna be compatible
whatever you know what we just wanted to
come out october so it comes out in a
hundred and 49 countries September 25th
the US and everyone else early
no exact date so 140 on all the other
country like such a small country he was
at in the Weinberg in band so not summer
2010 I just like when it comes out it's
compatible ps4 I'm not a big fan of the
s4 I'm not a big fan of TouchWiz right
but I am so intrigued by the idea of a
SmartWatch they'll switch the s for a
little bit just to try it out it it does
have a good camera right and I'll say is
what the the Moto X which I still love
I've been using this for a lot it
doesn't have a good camera yeah and the
thing I use the most is just this act of
notification right if I can replace that
with a watch and like it's a compelling
case agnostic of how much money I'm
gonna be spending to make this a lot of
money and actually that's the other
problem I think that limiting it to and
I know Samsung makes the most phones but
limiting it to just just the same side
that small list of Samsung devices s4
included that's tough let's tie like it
I think there are a lot of people with
android phones and a lot of people with
iphones who would love them to get a
watch and I you know I know Apple is
gonna lock their stand to like i get i
get it right but when it's samsung it's
a little bit different like I don't want
to live in a samsung ecosystem I i don't
and i do not know buddy buddy else no
Apple specification is another in the
software Samsung's like s world seco
system for psycho porsche you got it cuz
they're a watchmaker to you on top of
everything else god uh no look I just I
don't I don't think that that is Samsung
strength I don't accept but building an
ecosystem is samsung samsung is great at
building devices that plug into any
ecosystem you want to live in Samsung's
created building pretty much anything
you can think of at any moment in time
and then like which is blowing an eye on
don't think they have like we have a
dart board that's different inches of a
device and at some point they're just
like once a week they're like we're
gonna throw it to it when do you think
the next screen size the watch comes out
so it's 1.63 it's a very particular
number yeah i'm waiting for the 1.65
galaxy gear s2 yeah a lot i'm sure and
i'm sure someone to sams to Nikita's
budget yes I actually i will say this i
do think it looks very handsome I do
like it it's not an ex looks better than
the pebble yeah pebble has a distinctly
cheap look I mean I'm a big fan of the
pebble and you know any time I give
anything a really good
you I get a pebble really good review
right you always have this fear that
you're completely wrong yes uh
especially the devices so unproven like
the pebble and I think the pebble has
like born it out I think people have a
peddler very happy with not to mention
there's been a lot more developer
support with it as time has gone on get
a pebble now which is by the only a
hundred fifty dollars yeah compatible
with all your Android device is
compatible with iOS right you can do a
lot more when I right now yeah the word
on the street is iOS 7 will increase the
compatibility right because some of the
things we saw like that was in the Iowa
7 build note right so that mean the
pebble is like people are really happy
with it's still really nerdy it's still
really geeky you still off like hack
away at it to make it work right I don't
know three hundred dollars i don't think
the gear has to be buy it you take it
out of the box you turn it on it starts
doing awesome stuff in that part to me
has not been demonstrated yet either
yeah for a company like an apple or a
sonar even sometimes a google to say
here's a lot of requirements to make
this work but once you do it's awesome
yeah I get that but for samsung to do
that which is like it's out of character
for them I don't know I don't think I
for whatever say here's a lot of
requirements to make it work I think
after that was gonna be like ipod one
you must have a macbook or an ibook nah
that's like but their requirement was
like you must have itunes on your
computer right and then you plug in this
thing and then it works right now like
with the iphone and so you must have it
machos you must have ATT but those are
pretty those are just threshold
requirements right right for the pebble
it's you must want to like figure out
how to cover workers right and then you
must do all these things you have to
install this app and do all the setup
and like what the pebble app have your
imap so your email information so can
download look there's a lot of steps
right right I Samsung with this watch I
think they have to get beyond here's all
these steps to you take out the box and
you must have them you must have a
galaxy s4 is like a totally valid
environment and then those things will
somehow automatically be like magical
together and this time next year when
every phone coming out has bluetooth
like smarts like it's a moot point but
then again it this time next year
everyone can have a smartphone or
SmartWatch so about that look I mean I'm
again I'm very high in smart watches are
very high of the idea of the gear I just
and I'm very yeah I'm pleased with
Samsung for having what appears to be a
focused idea mm-hmm that's a first yeah
good on this I mean in the dolls
thanks to this what what the sudden the
event was a think tank Samsung has it
some think tank where he came up with
this yeah and kudos kudos I think tank
is sitting there reading Apple Insider
every day just waiting to see what the
next rumors are you know they're gonna
build a TV oh god be amazing if it's out
of the thing tank they were like should
build a TV how they crane so nuts at
Samsung's week we are well sorry Sam
some thanks for the cookies these devil
sir oh yeah we got one too i love it i
mean but like the competition
smartwatches is going to get fierce its
pebble now it's kind of sony is pebble
competition for any i don't think it is
I think I think pebble is out there
they're gonna like you know they're
gonna they're going to validate the
market right people want them they have
validated yet absolute least for the
small subset of people who are into
pebbles that Google just bought whim
which was a super nerdy product that i
read that Chris gave a really bad
reviews here you can tell you know and
I've heard a lot of a google and
motorola like building a watch together
obviously that the apple rumors are out
there right samsung it's great they beat
everybody to the market with this thing
I just think three hundred dollars for
what appears to be laggy product that
only works with a tiny subset of Android
devices out there not a tiny subset but
just I mean they there are more galaxy
s3s in our galaxy s4's right and it
doesn't support the s4 yet you know I
mean look the thing is I'm excited for
it I will probably get it because that's
just I'm a definitional of nerd that's
fine I accept that I would never
recommend anyone else because it's we're
compatibility so unless unless you're
buying something like brand-new also but
this time next year like I think it's a
much different story yeah and this first
years can be very interesting to see how
people adopt it cuz the note one was a
surprise success also write and actually
we should talk about the note a little
bit because you know until we get the
watch who knows I i I'm going on what I
will be talking about and Tom about item
and we've talked about and talked about
it too did that video which we saw you
know so it's great I just think 300 RSS
watches it's a tough sell for what
appears to be kind of an early version
of this product right um but let's talk
about the note so then you're right so
the first note was panned all over the
place yeah but it's so well did so well
people love it I see note 2's everywhere
uh and I was like man that is a big
screen actually I use the no 2 for a
month I loved it like I really like I
would walk around like little using
snowed sorry yes no I don't understand
that at all um it just it was good for
taking notes like it had a commuter but
do we ever know three oz on I think we
do um I'm sure I'll start playing over
us there we are there we go with its
faux leather back into this I dollars
this is like they ran out of ideas so I
the note one was like really big right
people loved it the note to like tighten
it all up in that way that Sam you can
like make a bezel smaller and the
components get smaller it gets its
smaller in the note 3 it's like we're
gonna make the screen bigger or make
everything bigger an industrial design
wise fake leather well okay it's way
better I haven't played with it yet but
I'm much happier seeing this than I am
the galaxy s4's the idea I don't wanna
call it slippery it's time in a plastic
these are fake plastic stitches but if I
don't like feel disgusting after
touching it I think it's a step up from
the s4 I feel dirty because I when I
like touch that I feel I don't feel
dirty it's shameful after touching your
problem you get if you get a case for
the s4 it's fine be like out of the case
whatever look I the no.3 is it
befuddling product I just like really do
not understand every time I see what I'm
like man what a big screen and I will
say of that caliber of devices with that
size screen I won't say the word but you
know what I'm thinking yeah the note is
obviously the best one and I think that
just speaks to how bad everyone else on
only one what's what's another one LG
makes a gigantic one right Sony's gonna
make a gigantic one sure we've heard
about HTC like right now it's really
samsung and LG break like the big huge
and i just know that i'm not saying the
word and it's just the state of android
skins is so bad that once samsung has
the best skin right on that size device
i mean i think the other arguments like
people today own smartphones and tablets
you largely the same thing with few
exceptions if you have a watch why not
have a bigger phone that you don't have
to check as much and it almost replaced
the tile like I never get a note device
and a tablet it would serve both
function I can read comfortably on that
I totally I mean I understand so I'm a
big iPad that's fine
I like the ipad mini just like sits
around Mike I guess that's cool and I
love the ipad for the apps like yeah
hardware it's great beautiful but like
it's really cuz the app ecosystem is
still so much better since seven uh oh I
had it I had I fly fly with a couple
years a couple months um I got bored
with it yeah I guess you have I kept
forwarding but you have a little phone I
do have a little phone I can check my
calendar is from saying it so the note 3
is like I'm sure it will be a huge
success the same way the fresh two notes
for a huge success I'm sure that it's
like feature list is great I'm sure
people are gonna freak out over S Pen
because who doesn't love it they're
gonna take s memos and snow time ya know
that the tagline is every day made
easier with s-pen I don't understand you
know it's not easier is writing with a
pen on things like it there's a reason
we move the whole world move to
keyboards well I mean there's something
we you don't use a like actual pen and
paper ever you like there are very
limited times than that okay so maybe
not in all seriousness I use whenever
taking like dude meetings like I'd use
paper and pen that's still the most
natural way for me to take care of it
you're going to pull out a galaxy net
now consider it if it's now it's five
point seven inches i have a little more
space people who love the Galaxy Note
will very much love the Gaussian three I
think that's obvious which is not
presently big market you have huge
people I'm just mash I'm not a big
person and I like I i got the only
person with smaller wrist on the staff
is vlad savov who of course did our
galaxy gear smartwatch hands on I'm just
saying every time I see one on a subway
like man that is a yes and I'm like
drawn to it I'm like man maybe god i
wish this screen was bigger but that's
it like there's no there's nothing else
beyond it because you know it is it's a
giant samsung phone yeah running giant
samsung software at what joint samsung
people that's like that no you're right
but at what point does is that note too
big and we have to call a tablet again i
think when it stops being as soon as it
hits six inches so we and there are six
inch friends out there in the world but
i think as soon as you hit six inches
you've got to stop lying to yourself so
cuz it's like it's true just like don't
stop buying like
there are 7 inch tablets in the world
like you're almost there like it's a
tablet so I mean it's a really small
tablet is not no longer a really big
site completely believe the next year
the note 4 will be five point nine eight
inches and that will be that will be the
limit I mean you know if I like to get
smaller they'll they'll find some other
way to make the body smaller they'll do
whatever though you know where they'll
put two smaller notes together they'll
click them together multiplayer just
surprised samsung there's a free idea
for you to just randomly build for no
reason connect two phones together like
one big string you can call it as string
s double screen screen that's the any
other big samsung announcements we
should talk about very quickly is the
note 10.1 2014 edition is what they're
calling you soon look any better ah we
have a picture i think is the note 10.1
i will say it was one of the ugliest
products it looked like a wii u
controller um sorry that's a rather than
i can say um may give a picture it does
what he's doing that it has 2560 by 1600
resolution the same as the nexus 10
that's spectacular which is great cuz
you know this will be much more mass
market ball because it's not a Nexus
device right we'll probably have a ton
of OS apps I see what they're doing here
that's a little bit better it's a little
bit less ugly well Brody we had to weigh
pictures of this at all we can you know
it is definitely it looks like it there
we go it looks like a gigantic galaxy s4
yeah it does is still ugly but less ugly
than the previous note template so
coming I hope the back isn't is nasty I
wonder how this thing does Versailles
like I really do like question who buys
this product because we know the ipad
dominates tablet market oh it's same
leatherback thing oh yeah same faux
leather so this is samsung's new move
they went from slimy plastic to fake
plastic love I think that's an
improvement I'm very excited for that
it's like it's like they're slowly it's
like they're going through the water
making process with you yeah oh my god
this slimy animal hide and next thing
out we've turned it into fake plastic
leather I mean it's just uh Samsung Oh
Samsung
i I'm not mad it's just I it i don't
know why they think that the s4 design
language is the one that they should
like a run with because i do not think
the s4 is particularly handsome phone
know which itself like it's a very ish
ds3 but yesterday was I thought better
looking I thought was a wide yesterday
better-looking me ask for I don't know
what they did to change that and if you
fear that thang tank please fix this I
mean so thanks to think I have all my
boss go the sales like a whirl can we
know what the name of the think tank is
uh I think they just call it the samsung
think tank in the way it is my
assumption that their lot they're like
hermetically but if they're actually in
a tank is that correct I think there's
no windows and they're just in there
alone Mike like damn and like a bunch of
tablets but they can look at the outside
world yeah and they're constantly
drawing on snow snow it's I mean that
honestly have an S design what I'm sure
look I'm sure it's a very nice glass and
steel building with lots of Windows free
food only few looks like my TV wall
coats screen sizes biometrics and I bet
there's a button in every office in
samsung where you can just call up the
screen size 4.3 is little like I before
you just hit a lever like it's expensive
it's like 3.6 all right we got this yeah
its casino slot is there anything else
when you talk about samsung I don't
think that I needed that was big I mean
it's I think what's important is like
EFA's become big because you can now
announce a product in September and
release it in time for holidays yes like
years ago CES is like this is where all
the announcers going to happen for the
full year and now the turn around time
the manufacturing time is so much faster
and this is a really the last big
creature of the year so of course it's
gonna be the biggest one going for it
now look I think these I think to what
the watch is clearly Samsung's focal
point arrest here we're going to hear a
lot about this watch what they're doing
with a watch how they beat Apple to the
watch I mean that's the narrative
samsung wants right and i think what
they don't quite realize is that the big
market of human beings in the world is
going to wait for Apple to come out with
this watch yes because at three hundred
dollars they don't have a story and they
don't have apples marketing and brand
muscle yet right we're getting there I
just don't think they have they can I
don't think he can like take this thing
and put it on the Today Show
like 300 or watch is open today show I
think I mean like you know but you know
what I'm saying like I don't think they
have it they haven't told me a
compelling general you story beyond like
i'm a huge nerd and I want a one and a
half inch AMOLED display in my wrist and
so I'm going to spend 30 dollars here's
the thing for the next 12 months they
don't have to because there is no
competition we can work out all the
kinks get public opinion they love you
know designing around this public about
it yeah yes five mega gear ultra active
with Bluetooth really smart I know it
was like they have a full year to work
out the kinks so when apple SmartWatch
does come out one they have brand
recognition already people know what
galaxy Gear's even if they never
considered buying why why do the prices
drop I'm much better device I also i
don't think apple's gonna do their watch
in September next week with the eyes oh
god no absolutely not well Apple
definitely has another event in October
you really think you're gonna see some
kind of Apple wearable device even a
hint of it this year they could they
could but I mean there's a reason that
the rumors spun up like ultimately it's
Apple couldn't do the TV right too many
challenges too many hurdles we talked
about the link that's why the watch
rumors have spun up all right I I think
Apple has to put out some sort of new
product line this year I think they feel
the pressure very hard right I there's a
chance we could see it sooner in that
try you know there's ostomy I i put it
5050 it could be next year we heard a
lot more rumors about it like last
February's to last favor eyes when the
New York Times The Wall Street on both
reported curved glass with her Johnny
I've israeli / take taken to it the last
we heard was Tim Cook Tim Cook wrist is
a profound opportunity yes but the last
thing last rumor we heard i think was
Bob Mansfield's overseeing it adobe CTO
Kevin Lynch is a major player in this um
and so that that's all great exciting to
Stephen Elop is trying to watch burger
rice amazing they brought why not heir
apparent to every company technology
Stephen Elop well join Apple plummet the
price and give them up with Microsoft
know that's a conspiracy theory I really
don't believe that but God Internet's
mean I digress someone just told me the
samsung think tank should be called the
S attack or stank the step
pretty good all rights on what side
let's talk about something so if you
have more samsung questions believe me
tweet them at us lead us work we're
still answering to the best of my
ability yes or with tropes you never
know what I'm gonna do uh yeah so this
is the fun part because we actually have
it in studio there was three big Sony
announcements the flagship xperia z1
which I'm actually excited about so the
z1 has like a huge sensor net right on
20.7 megapixel biggest except for lumia
right I mean that's that that's like
stabbing to me but it means also not a
numbers game to the pictures they showed
look good we'll see when we tried
ourselves in hours well yeah we haven't
played dried play with one I don't know
fly play with Xperia Z I think you did I
think you did we were reckoned roll the
tape there's a tape back there I don't
know if you know this we run the holster
yo ty glad I think the first thing you
might notice that's new about the
experience did one is the design you've
just seen the aluminium frame and the
solid aluminium block it comes from here
it is crafted around the edge of the
device the familiar aluminium on and off
button now a hard camera key and a
beautiful al-amin design around the
outside and your headphone jack is now
exposed whereas previously you had a
flat one headphone jack is now exposed
but the device is waterproof so you can
still drop the experience it one into up
to 1.5 meters of water leave it there
for 30 minutes if you like and take it
out happily the water jack will simply
fill up the spigot the audio jack was
simply fill up with water but will still
work all right and did a big new
improvements you have the new triluminos
display technology which introduced with
your bravia tvs exactly so that 5-inch
full-hd 1080p screen now is a triluminos
display straight from a bravia
technologies that gives you the best
color ever a wide arrange it so that's
that and with the ex reality is better
anyway it looks like the Xperia Z shop
right in front of Italy it just has a
good camera yeah it's got the different
aluminum frame lemoore rugged it's
actually fully waterproof is what
they're calling us at a water-resistant
yeah and there's no more slot on the
headphone jack it's just open and so
water what yeah I'm sorry I forgot about
that I'm gonna buy it I'm gonna buy this
phone uh 5-inch 1.7 megapixel camera but
any like the on-screen buttons no but
hide on-screen buttons
let me use the rest of the screen but
why would you take that away from me I
mean they could have just not had it on
there in the first place just put that
give me a button why would you take the
screen away from me you're you have
plenty of buttons on the site at the
volume button oh you it's great or the
home button under the space bar at every
app that's a cool idea so mad I just why
do I get it I understand google had to
make a choice because manufacturers are
doing stupid button things put the
buttons on the screen so he can control
them because we're Google we need to but
with some consistency basket and your
lens on here you know that's way better
I'm actually I will say this with the
one I've come around to this stupid
button and I still think it's stupid but
at least I understand there's really two
buttons what was there to understand
they didn't pack the home button under
the space bar okay so a capacitive home
button under the space bar is a bad idea
I agree and I don't mean whatever I know
you can like rom it up rom it down or
like change issues we love it like like
I don't miss the H key anymore the
virtual keyboard like you can just find
your way I love you sir are you from
asking when you're like trying to no
kidding me it's a phone I'm all states
every every every color of the rainbow
all right I'm stopped let's talk about
this let's let's talk about this this is
God rumored and leaked all over the
place Tony was not happy about this so
this is the lens G this is I think so
that DX one next one what's what's
called the qx10 no the phone is it oh
this xperia z 1 z 1 ok anyway the z1 is
i think is very cool it is very much
however the Xperia Z with a very nice
camera right and I think Sony is really
leaning in to their camera stuff there
they're good at it very good and they
put out a new next camera today which
was very interesting oh really and that
is 5 are our next Phi T which is very
cool they put out an SLR style body the
alpha a3000 okay which uses next lenses
the next sensor like just cool camera
stuff all the way around from sony and
then they're there you know i think they
thought long and hard about how they
should how they can continue selling
cameras to people using smartphones and
i came up with this so this is the sony
smart lens qx10 okay and this has an 18
megapixel sensor in it it's
clear like this thing right here is not
needed it's not necessary if you want to
use the camera no it's not at all so
this is just a clip okay which I'm going
to take off I've got a connected HTC one
here so this just clips on to a phone
and then I can just like do it I can
just now my phone has a gigantic lens
attached to it congratulations and
because it's FC the reason I have it
works a little bit better with Android
than iOS it works with both of them but
it works a little better with Android
especially he have NFC on your phone so
gonna just unlock who've and you open
the Sony PlayMemories app and it just
it's just going to figure it out like it
just found it it's connecting it okay
this is all a bit slow I think everybody
should recognize this is this is not
like I'm gonna take a bunch of pictures
you're a good time every time you turn
on the app it does this yeah it's got to
connect so this thing is creating a
Wi-Fi network okay this the app connects
to the Wi-Fi network and then here we go
I've got it just sort of live doing
stuff okay and I can just like look at
you I already took this picture put on
the internet a show you picture Ross and
it's going to transfer to the camera off
great so this takes a full rest picture
it has a micro XD the other thing is
that a size of camera it's got an xt
slot and it's got an a memory stick mini
micro whatever the smallest ones are
because this thing literally was it's
been leaked forever but I got it my
hands like an hour ago so it saves it
saves the full res to its internal
memory you can transfer to the phone it
saves a 2 megapixel picture so the
people who saw me tweeted photo/ross
earlier the reason that looked didn't
look great is because that was the
smaller 2 megapixel file that I was just
screwing with so if you have a camera
like the one so here's the thing i think
the iphone 5 takes great photos yes i
think using this with an iphone 5 is
great playmemories app works just the
same the clip actually you can tell that
this was designed to like fit on the
back of my phone it's because it looks
lat it looks far more perfect than an
iphone the be on the other phone so this
looks great on iphone it works great the
app works great
but i think the iphone is a totally fine
camera if you have a phone like the one
where I think cameras a little bit more
middling right this is amazing accessory
so I think you know this is a one google
play edition i think the camera app is
not not so great it over exposes
everything all the time take it over
that going um did you just connect you
need the passcode so yeah this thing is
just making a Wi-Fi network okay things
can connect to it did I tap it with an f
state would that work yeah there's NFC I
think it's turned off this one okay yeah
so if you have NFC Sony's really big on
NFC they're planning to have something
like a hundred NFC accessories for their
phone minnesota it is the on but if is
why would you because it's useless so I
mean Sony's really into NFC they wants
you uh there's a button God nope that's
the off look so this thing is 250
there's another one and it's basically a
point-and-shoot caliber lens except like
assembly in there and sensor they have
another one in qx100 which is basically
Sony's rx100 mark 2 it's a lot bigger
it's way more expensive it's five
hundred dollars right but what Vlad said
which interested me is like he said it
was the quality of the rx100 m2 which is
it's the same camera yeah it's like the
best point street that I've seen yes
gorgeous so people love it so it's very
much the same camera has a way faster
lens as a as an f 1.8 lens mm-hmm carl
zeiss too yes I mean like I'm gonna buy
that one it's five hundred dollars when
I buy it because I actually am intrigued
by the idea of taking these pictures
directly to my phone whereas you could
buy the rx100 more too but that's six
hundred fifty dollars so you can save a
little bit of money and like have the
thing integrated directly with your
phone right that's awesome like this
middle of the ground though it's a it's
a nice testing like middle that like
area like this is good pictures it's
certainly better than this yeah but the
setup is what's bothering me like what
you needed the password once I don't
know if you do with some of the initial
setup and it's taking a long time to
connect so I think Sony like I noticed
that with the day at Xperia Z's there
with the experience he was a little bit
faster a little bit a little more sense
right it's all again NFC tup so like you
know you can just do stuff like you can
just tap it and go okay so made a little
bit more sense but this
what we're experiencing right here was
trying to connect to this wireless
network we're just switching phones here
that's problematic and I think right
that's probably the only sticking point
with the product because other than that
it's if you could just turn it on and
shoot pictures from a better lens a
better sensor and having money on your
phone it's a killer proposition no it's
great umm I have to ask like once this
is hooked up cuz like it still took a 30
seconds on there you can't do knee-jerk
reaction shots you have to plan the
stuff out yes are you waiting you can't
go from cold to shooting right Superman
like again with the iphone it's like I'm
gonna take a picture and then phone fell
asleep i'm taking a picture it's done it
was done that was you cannot do what I
just did with my iphone with that oh
well like but it is a full camera could
just like take a picture here you could
if that thing had a memory card in it
you could just use this camera like that
hey could I just transfer later like oh
you shut your site on yeah you can like
a look at it if it had a card in there
if it had a car so the planner is and
again what's interesting about this is
also nice other Wi-Fi cameras like the
rx100 more to you can do exactly the
same things right the experience is just
being shrunk into this lens and clipping
onto the back of the camera right that's
not it still hasn't connected no no but
i just wanted to start looking good on
it I'm just saying it's I mean this
stuff is all new it's not out yet it
comes out end of the month and then the
qx100 comes out i think the end of
october okay and so you know well
obviously get them improve you son he's
very nice little like let me i was very
excited so you let me see let me steal
one basically for me event i look i
think this is a great idea I think there
is like all things there are some
execution questions that remain in
David's uh David Pierce is a yelling at
me and Chad saying it is faster with an
F say so that's that's good to know it
is definitely faster so this yeah this
has NFC and I can just some turn it on I
can just open up right play matter I'm
super good at Android yeah so this is
going to connect and like one second
here there's still taking like a while
yeah yep there it connected so the one
thing about this is now it's on here
it's taking pictures away but like Ross
was saying you don't need to have this
attached to the camera so you see this
they're all this you can go run
that so now I'm just like pointing at
stuff is Ross I can just like take a
picture and it just worked so it's about
15 about 15 feet they say it works from
and try to roll away this is quite a UH
you've gotta hit back mmm oh oh right
yeah yeah there we go so I can try to
take a picture of this is super meta
yeah Jordan you got this all right good
yeah we got drunk so you could mean this
is already like I said a new new age of
creep shots it is a pond absolutely wait
you guys I can attest no way no it's
really nice to see you yeah can you turn
that sound off speaking of creep shots I
don't know okay but I'm gonna find a way
just gonna tear it open where's that
audio I mean like this isn't a camera
this is just a circle yeah I just have a
design a Cirque it's a very sensitive
coaster don't it does make a super
conical loud sound so it also has a
lense Matt like it's funny how much of a
oh my god so this is like super
hilarious and wonderful and so we can
just control from here yeah that's great
oh sweet yeah right yeah um look I think
it's cool i think for 250 bucks as a toy
for people who have phones that maybe
don't have the best cameras right it's
great i I would there are a lot of
people I would say to get that instead
of a point shoot right if I want to like
a very dark concert like I don't mind
taking that around as opposed to that
plus a point shoot well against a good
test case it's a good test case I mean I
think here's here's how I've been
thinking about it um my wife is like
super an Instagram okay and she's always
like I want to get a newer better camera
she's iphone 5 and I can't think of but
short of seven hundred dollars like what
camera to get her that a has like better
image quality and B won't require her to
like take out a memory card and I put in
the computer right and like she's not
honest she's not going to send those
things to Instagram then so like there's
so I'm like I can get you whatever
camera you want are you ever going to
take the memory card out and put in your
computer interest like no I want to
right this is and I think that's why
these are popular right they combine
shooting editing sharing on one thing
and the play memory is like does that go
straight to Instagram where's go to the
camera roll and then go there camera
okay I mean it's great just a camera app
like a fundamental into camera app that
connects to these products and I think
having like for sony to say we're really
good at imaging which is what they're
doing all over the place we're putting
it directly into our phones or phones
have great cameras and then we're going
to let everybody else with camera with
phones get a piece of our great camera
and yes it's expensive but it's designed
to be used with a phone and not some
like we're not making some totally
separate gadget I think that's strong
especially for 250 and is this a that
video as well see video I don't think
you shoots video it does Jordan is the
blimpie 30 p let's see I have it written
up that's the one thing I actually
haven't ride to do because I've just
been so happy for us to put your ad
button again that again they gave us to
us just moments ago yeah this is this is
kind of us figuring out on the fly
that's why you're here mm-hmm you're a
pedo movie sorry okay they can't hear
drop the control room and John is
telling your iphone app had a movie but
um hey that's sure I don't know if if it
supports it on every platform no um
either way I I mean I think they're
gonna sell a lot of these I real
absolutely I think these are like
tremendous like I can I hope to do I
really liked the idea and they just have
to get faster I think like this nonsense
where mode oh yeah there we go movie
exciting television it's a great
television I'm taking a movie uh ok turd
out of me oh it doesn't have so here's
what I just discovered it'll let you
shoot videos you won't let you transfer
in real time you'd have a card in here
ok so that's it needs a card got it but
once your card I'll shouldn't be just
fine I'm just saying I think they're
gonna saw a lot of them I think people
are gonna be intrigued by the product
and the idea that a successful you have
to market o'connell equip a better
camera onto your phone and make it work
mm-hmm that's that's right and I've
loved the fact that like sony and
samsung both came out that these are
bizarre products like these are not
things that you've seen before the watch
kind of have but this brand new and also
sounding i will say yes that's sony
you know Sonny's strength in this world
is hardware design yes not in there
getting slowly better at software design
their strength is always been hardware
design if you look at this product I
think you look at their phone they're
starting to understand they need to do
hardware design a better way and they're
starting to make some really beautiful
products yes so I wouldn't call this
necessarily beautiful I mean in like a
classic design sense it's but as a piece
of like engineering it's really well
done and it makes a lot of sense this is
Sony's movie camera they're new if they
literally call you in a music video
recorder okay it's just a pocket cam
it's there's nothing social gospel
recording kid Scott to what they're
calling high precision microphones okay
and the only reason I wanted to show it
off um because it's pretty I mean that's
it it's it's super pretty it like you
know it has this interface it's really
gadgety there we have stopped in many
ways covering gadgets right like we we
cover phones then we cover the world of
things around phones including the
galaxy gear right which is right a phone
accessory this is just a standalone
gadget right and Sony's just making it
happen and it looks beautiful it's
expensive it's 299 I think the people
who want this thing are gonna pay for it
right so he's like we've been showing it
off and it looks to me Kurt me wrong it
looks like you would take this to a
concert and get a good this is his on
probably you can't cause there's no
doubt my absolute 0 NE thinks you're
gonna like you're actually gonna do this
at a concert and like we're just
recording this is your move for all
sneak cams it's like this is my creep
shot maybe this okay so I don't mind
this I don't that this is not my move
this is where hey guys guys it looks
 medical device oh it does yeah
hello Ross bubble brass you can't love
anymore I'm sorry you'll never love
again oh I just think so nice i will say
this i think i saw sonia soul
presentation New York today the both
both Samsung and Sony just so you know
they had presentations in Berlin and
they had simultaneous presentations in
New York so david pearson i went to the
sony one dan seifert once the samsung
one so you know I step through Sony's
whole thing today and I don't think i've
ever seen sony as confident about what
they're designing what they're making
have been recently I think they're
they're designing beautiful things
though they are like David actually send
their you know their new vios today
which are like pretty there was Sony I
think makes questionable material
choices with with some of their
computers but David said to me in the
middle of savent like Sony's making
beautiful things just because they can
they're no longer feeling like they have
to compete they like settled into what
they're going to do and they've started
to make beautiful products and in those
areas and that's cool I'm into that and
I think that mean this is I'm never
gonna buy this I'm not gonna buy this so
i have no need for this I don't mean
again New Age of creep shots is a
promise but I'm gonna use that it's this
great video this is creepy these high
precision creep creep audio but I just
think there are very few companies that
actually care about design for like
gadgets and hardware the way its Tony
does right and it's exciting to see them
peddling into it no I don't you know
well I'm not gonna buy their phone no
cuz I had their son I i do i'm curious
how well lakes for as he did like so
does well yeah so nice in third place
right over all right and especially in
Europe than you really well um so I
don't know I mean they're they're really
you know psyched about how waterproof
their things are ok it's actually weird
to go to sunny event now that doesn't
feature water and somewhere like
everything's very aquatic was there
water at today's event it now not the
one in New York but there was they
definitely had models in like a giant
champagne glass in in Berlin yeah
everything it sounds like very aquatic
right now they're like look it's
waterproof you know you don't believe us
allow these beautiful people to splash
themselves caught selling point they're
gonna get the rights to bring a shark to
an event Oh that'd be amazing and like
just look at the shark will bite the
phone uh I am the happy that a flexure
device will weather bad conditions no
pun intended but like I soapy water tank
it looks if I'm so he's very I just
think like what Sony's doing we've seen
so many they're like reeks centric
events i'm not surprised I'm actually a
happy right there being kind of crazy
well particularly the Yeti fuh there's
like a lot of weirdness if they're just
always traditionally it's it's look at
sproul in ya know I went last year it
was a it was a hunter esting but you
know I just think like it's week it's
weird that like well this is calendars
that's just pretty don't worry about
that but it's weird that I think the two
most interesting products release today
were smart phone accessories yeah but
it's a lot it's a wash of the camera and
then a camera what else release and
we're talking about like a ubiquitous
device now smartphones all look the same
it's a rectangle with a screen that does
internet that is huge that is HUGE like
that's not interesting anymore and like
what is interesting is like what we do
in addition to that with just these
complementary devices these watches
these headsets these right but not
things well night those aren't as
interesting what I think this is very
much response to do that most most funds
have been cameras yeah and I think
they're getting better and I think that
you know we've watched the phone
industry chase its sale for years being
like a good camera will sell this phone
yeah which is has yet to be true like a
good camera helps but most people don't
buy a great a phone because of the
camera which is upsetting because I I
want nothing more than an Android device
with a really good camera yeah but so we
we have one last night advice we even
talked about really quickly it's
bringing full circle is the SmartWatch
to which I forgot is a second treasure
smoosh they've been doing this for a
while such a smart watches is super lame
like I'm sorry like no no it's great
they made it it's great that made it
early didn't mention all the press
conference even didn't even talk about
yeah they like blasted through it it's
great to watch right in its cool it's a
bat it took a pebble with a better
screen but it's ultra limited it's it
doesn't do the things you expect it to
do it does not like an app platform um
it's just to watch like it's a watch
that connects to your phone and has some
has media controls I'm just surprised
Sony's not really like jumping into this
much harder I don't think they know they
can't compete with this thing I'm sure
they're gonna make one I'm sure they're
gonna get out there but this product is
not not it like you know the original
sony smartwatch was so bad and I think
we didn't review it no we saw it we
looked at it we acknowledged it existed
in it ya know and then you know the
great this product is a little bit
faster you know it's probably a little
bit makes a little more sense the
original sunny spot where should have a
touch screen it was like this constant
like but oh that's right so like my god
right but it's not on for sony to go up
against the gear with this i think
no I agree okay so that's a we should
wrap up I guess so that was the big
announcer Aoife that obviously is still
going on dress the week we will be there
yeah but it's you know that's the big
news we've had so far the biggest thing
coming up next course is Apple which
will be doing this again next week next

tell you about a rose gold iPhone what's
that case we know it's actually more
golden rose but I mean is this what you
