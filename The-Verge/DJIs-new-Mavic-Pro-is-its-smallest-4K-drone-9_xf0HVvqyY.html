I'm checking out DG is latest drone the
Mavic the big deal with this one
obviously is the size and weight it
feels almost like an iPhone 7 plus I can
not quite fit it into my pocket maybe if
I was wearing my janko's today but it's
definitely the smallest most portable
drone DJI has ever made this thing is
about 700 grams and this tiny remote is
about half that you could fly with just
the remote it gives you some telemetry
information like your height your
orientation can give you warnings if
there's too much wind or if you've gone
too far away
you could also fly with just the phone
using the DJI app or you can combine the
two so that you have the stick
controllers and the video feed from the
drone itself this drone has a lot of the
sensors that you find on the Phantom 4
so it has optical flow sensors on the
bottom that allow it to sell land and to
see if there's obstacles down there the
optical flow sensors also give it the
ability to judge changing height so if
you're flying uphill
it can even auto follow you uphill it
has the sense and avoid package on the
front so you can fly it comfortably
knowing it won't crash as long as you're
headed in a forward direction and it has
all kinds of autonomous modes it can
follow you it can orbit it can track a
point of interest GGI also says it has
some really fancy computer vision it has
the same subject tracking where you can
drag a box around somebody and it will
understand that that is the subject can
automatically follow it did you I says
it also has gesture recognition although
that wasn't working on this prototype
unit but you can simply wave your hands
if you want it to track you throw them
up in a big Y if you want it to start
filming and then put your hands up like
a camera and it will automatically take
a droney focusing on you and flying out
did you guys says that this new unit
will start shipping in a few weeks and
will probably cost around a thousand
bucks which is less than a brand new
phantom fact it's less than the complete
package if you get GoPros new karma
drone with the camera now the drone is
smaller but it has a 4k camera the image
sensor is the same it just doesn't have
quite as wide a field of view the remote
control isn't quite as big and it
doesn't have quite as many features if
you want to customize your flying but
even though it's half the size the Mavic
is nearly as fast as the inspire 4
because 40 miles an hour in sport mode
instead of 45 so what's really
interesting is that over the last year
the drone industry
has gone in a new direction before it
was making bigger more advance more
powerful copters now people are trying
to make them smaller and more portable
more accessible I think was really
interesting about the Mavic is that DGI
has made what is probably the smallest
and most portable of the high-end
copters and they've done it without
sacrificing any of the advanced features
that you would get on their more
expensive drones</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
