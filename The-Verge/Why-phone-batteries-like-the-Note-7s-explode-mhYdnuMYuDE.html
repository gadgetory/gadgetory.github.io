suddenly exploding
Daniels look bad for Samsung right now
the company recalled the new Galaxy Note
7 last month because some of them were
bursting to play send out replacements
so far so good but now the replacement
phones the ones that said we're safe
have exploded too now the company is
stopping production of the Galaxy Note 7
entirely the problem isn't about it's
the battery most electronics use a
lithium-ion battery the thing is used
because it's light but can store a lot
of energy but because lithium can store
a lot of energy it's in its nature the
unstable you've already achieved almost
90% of the maximum battery life even
possible from these lithium-ion
batteries but that doesn't stop people
from wanting batteries that charge
faster batteries that last longer this
creates an arms race as manufacturers
push the limits for really small games
and the more you push the battery the
more likely it is to explode we're
carrying around little bombs of energy
and we're pushing them to put the same
ion batteries are actually pretty simple
there are two electrodes for electrical
conductors on opposite sides this is
just like a standard battery one
electrode is positively charged and it's
called the cathode the opposite
electrode is called the anode and it's
negatively charged during charging
lithium ions move from one side to the
other when you use the battery the
lithium moves in the opposite direction
in between are these chemicals called
electrolytes and they hope the ions move
more easily they're crucial to make sure
the battery works but they're also
pretty volatile lithium ions need to
move from one side or the other remember
so the ions have to go back and forth
but the anode and the cathode on the
sides should never touch because the
redirect energy to the electrolytes in
the middle to keep this from happening
battery makers and serve separators in
between in Samsung's case the original
problem with the separator flawed and
that the two electrodes touch then all
the energy being pumped in the battery
goes directly to the electrolytes in the
middle it catches fire and explodes
there are other things that caused that
explosion one wave overcharging
this is like filling a glass with too
much water it doesn't matter how slowly
you go kick with you poured too much the
glass can overflow overcharging happens
when too much lithium goes in two months
luckily most batteries are designed to
automatically prevent overcharging then
there's charging too much or too fast
this leads to something called pleading
think of it like putting change in the
piggy bait if you add one point at a
time at a steady pace you don't have any
box you try to drop in all you change at
once it'll pile up and out sides we're
doesn't belong
this forms these needle-like structures
called dendrites that can internally
short out the battery but this can be
avoided by making sure that the charger
and the battery are compatible exposed
to look together finally sometimes
companies try to make battery store more
power by increasing voltage which is a
way of measuring force higher the
voltage the more power there is so they
try to pump this up by adding these
other elements like nickel you looking
but again
the higher the voltages the more likely
the electrolytes are to combine in a way
that makes them catch fire some
scientists are trying to develop a kind
of electrolyte that won't burst into
flames as easily these are called ionic
liquids and they need a lot more heat to
form this flammable gas so it's a good
idea
they're often much safer but there could
be challenges with battery life and of
course they tend to be more expensive
lithium-ion batteries are the best we
have for now and honestly they're a good
solution they really do get the job done
as long as we don't demand more than
they can safely offer over charging it
happens when we chose yellow so pretty</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
