has finally produced a fully new M
series camera the m10 the $6,500 m10
comes with a host of new things
including better image quality wireless
connectivity and improved functionality
over its predecessor but at the same
time the m10 brings back many qualities
of like as old film cameras making it
the most film like digital camera that
company has ever made buying and
shooting a Leica is a unique experience
driven more by romance and nostalgia
than value or performance
it's not about feeds and speeds is OS or
megapixels it's about feel and other
entirely subjective qualities like that
even has a German phrase to describe
this das recently je which basically
means the essentials it starts with the
design the m10 is slimmer than earlier
digital lamps giving it the same
footprint as the film versions it has
fewer buttons on the back and it doesn't
record video of any sort the controls
have been designed so that all of your
shooting parameters aperture shutter ISO
can be set without having a look at the
screen it's a distillation of the needs
of a still photographer without any
superfluous functions getting in the way
das recently J four decades before they
became exorbitantly expensive toys for
the well-heeled Leica cameras were the
workhorses of choice for journalists
street photographers and travel
photographers because of their compact
size discreet functionality and
bulletproof build quality the m10
carries more of those qualities over to
the digital world than any prior like us
you can have a similar experience to
someone shooting a 50 year old m3
without having to give up the
conveniences of digital now don't get me
wrong the m10 is still incredibly
expensive a kit like the one I have here
running well over ten thousand dollars
it's also incredibly hard to shoot with
especially if you use the modern
conveniences like autofocus matrix
metering and close focusing distances
the m10 is not good for capturing fast
action and if you're shooting subjects
like kids or pets most of your shots
won't likely to be out of focus it could
take years to get proficient with the
M's range Rider focusing and metering
system as a result the m10 is best for
the same disciplines that classic Leica
cameras were always good at street
photography reportage landscapes and
other low-speed scenarios now compared
to its immediate predecessors the M type
240 and type 262 it can shoot in much
higher ISO s making it possible to shoot
pictures in very low light
it has better dynamic range and a
brighter viewfinder to make it slightly
easier to compose and focus in low-light
now if you've never shot with a
rangefinder picking up and shooting with
the m10 it's going to be daunting the
focusing system is entirely manual and
requires you to line up two small boxes
in the middle of the frame to get focus
it can take a lot of practice to get
right and if you're shooting a wide
apertures like the f-14 I have on this
lens it can be very difficult to nail
the focus and since the focusing is all
done in the center of the frame it can
lead to some very boring composure if
you don't remember to recompose after
focusing like this basic metering system
also presents challenges if you're not
prepared to handle it it's basically a
center-weighted system that works okay
most of the time but gets thrown for a
loop whenever there's a bright source of
light in the frame like the Sun or lamps
or street lights it takes patience to
learn how to shoot well with a Leica and
then patience to get the shot right once
you've figured it all out but for fans
of Leica cameras those that are bought
into the romance of it all these
limitations are all part of the charm
though the m10 is a fully modern sensor
and can hold its own in terms of image
quality with the best full-frame DSLR as
you can buy the rest of it is decidedly
low-tech even though it costs a lot more
than other cameras that means that if
you're thinking about getting a Leica
you really need to be in love with it
all right down to the essentials das
recently CEI of photography thank you
constantly like hold the camera up see
what I have charm at and then get my
focus then I have to worry about is my
subject always in the center which it is
because I'm bad at this and then I can
finally snap my photo</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
