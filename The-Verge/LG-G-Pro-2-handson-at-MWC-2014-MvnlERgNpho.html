world congress 2014 in barcelona and
take a look at LG G pro 2 there's a 5.9
inch 1080p device which the company is
unapologetically describing as a phablet
and it wants to give you the ultimate
phablet experience it follows up from
the LG G flex which is a six inch device
it's roughly the same size and it has
pretty similar specs it also has a
quad-core Snapdragon processor inside it
physically it's very similar in terms of
dimensions though obviously it lacks the
curvature but also the Tunis the two
devices come with new features one of
them is called NOC code which is being
simulated here in the G flex which is
essentially a way to unlock your phone
while the screen is off with a pattern
of taps or as LG describes and knocks
you can see a demonstration that right
here under the new G pro two it's quite
it's quite a neat little feature and
aside from that you really do don't get
many buttons a lot of it is screen
interaction you just get the power
button and the volume rocker in the back
as is typical with LG's t-series at the
moment a couple of other new features of
companies added is a split screen view
so when you hold the back button you get
to split screen between two apps so you
can have the internet browser up top and
let's say YouTube down at the bottom if
you want to look at it two side-by-side
and then you can adjust which one gets
more screen real estate another thing is
if the 5.9 inch size is too big for you
you can actually swipe and shrink it
down to a mini give which you can then
resize and expand to your preference
also LG has put a 1 watt set of speakers
in here it describes a Miss HiFi sound
so that's an upgrade there it also has a
new set of camera applications and
camera features which includes
and you mode which lets you adjust focus
after you take a photo this is pretty
much the same thing as nokia has with
its Lumia cameras where you take a
series of photos and then you can select
your focus distance after the shoulders
taken as you can actually see from this
demonstration there is a time delay
between the photos obviously because
they take them one after the other but
it does give you the option to focus
further or closer after you've taken the
shot which is more flexible than just
taking one single picture aside from
those new features this is still pretty
much a relatively standard phablets it's
quite large but as I would you point out
it has even thinner bezels around the
sides then on the company's flagship
smartphone the g2 and it's relatively
compact pretty nice in the hands for
such a large device suicide from those
extra added features that LG has put
into the software this is still pretty
much a standard android phablet the
likes of which we've seen for both HTC
and samsung and even Sony there isn't
that much to distinguish it but LG hopes
that good performance an extra few
features will give people a reason to
buy
