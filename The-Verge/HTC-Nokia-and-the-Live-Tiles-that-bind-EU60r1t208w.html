I'm here in New York City where HTC and
Microsoft have just unveiled the Windows
Phone 8 X and Windows Phone 8 s
smartphones the 8x and the 8's represent
a new effort from HTC to produce
compelling Windows Phone devices that
aren't just recycled versions of its
existing Android minor without a doubt
these devices are impressive especially
in the case of the windows phone 8x the
8x feature is some great hardware and
some great design and also has some
cutting-edge specs as well the new
phones names Windows Phone 8 X and
Windows Phone 8 s aren't an accident in
fact they're the result of a close
relationship between Microsoft and HTC
to produce new signature phones for the
Windows Phone 8 line as the story goes
HTC CEO Peter Chou asked the team to
design a new phone from scratch inspired
by Windows Phone the end result in press
microsoft so much that they partner for
what HTC president jason mackenzie
called a quote integrated campaign
microsoft CEO steve ballmer said the new
branding initiative was a big deal and
should be great for consumers we knew
that at the end of the day consumers are
not buying an operating system the phone
is what's emotional that's what's going
to drive the emotional purchase and
because that's what you live with every
day and so we knew we needed to do is
really establish a piece of hardware
beautiful design that consumers would
associate with the best of Windows Phone
but it also brings up an interesting
question about Microsoft's other big
partner for windows phone nokia until
this point Nokia's Lumia line has been
synonymous with Windows Phone but now
it's clear that Microsoft isn't putting
all of its eggs in Nokia's basket in
fact just minutes after HTC's event
Nokia quickly released a statement
calling the move a tactical rebranding
and no key executive Chris Webber CH we
did that it takes more than matching
color to match the innovations of the
Lumia 920 we think it's clear that Nokia
feels threatened threatened by HTC's
renewed relationship with Microsoft
these new devices and HTC's
traditionally strong relationship with
US carriers an area that nokia has
struggled with in the past despite HTC's
apparent advantages with carriers it's
actually in the same boat as noget here
with Windows Phone 8 both companies have
to rely on a yet proven platform despite
Microsoft's promises of grandeur we have
yet to see what Windows Phone 8 actually
looks like or how it will perform in the
end it doesn't matter how combative the
two companies are or how they try to
differentiate themselves from each other
it's an unproven platform and it's a
risk that both companies equally share</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
