announcing two things Windows Phone 8.1
and our Windows 8.1 update we believe
that Windows Phone is the world's most
personal smartphone so we're going to
come up here and pull down from the top
and show you our new Action Center in
Windows Phone 8.1 now the second thing
we've done to make Windows Phone feel
even more personal is a feature that
lets you greatly personalize your
lockscreen of course we've evolved the
heart and soul of Windows Phone the
Start screen one of the things that we
spent a lot of effort on this past year
a new feature that makes Windows Phone
very personal in an incredibly useful
way
hi I'm Cortana it's certainly a lot
catchier than Microsoft personal
assistant v1 service pack 2 she can make
phone calls or send text or schedule
appointments or take a note give you a
reminder she's also good at learning
helping you learn things she can do
searches tell you what music is playing
she knows the places you frequent and so
on and so on
here's Cortana's notebook this is the
transparent way of putting the user in
control of their relationship with
Cortana you might notice down here on
the very bottom Cortana is prompting me
with information that's new Wow look at
that Microsoft is announcing Windows
Phone 8.1 Cortana on the phone gets to
know you with your permission it goes in
the notebook and then the service can be
helpful proactively
here are 10 Mexican restaurants in Palo
Alto that are 4 stars
call the second one sure thing would you
like to call well there you go our first
little demo bug with my nervous voice
sorry about that actually that's a good
segue to mention that as you notice in
the upper right we're launching Cortana
as a beta ordinarily she would recognize
when I get home and you would see right
there home I converted that temperature
to Celsius no that's not what I want I
got a 2 I'm gonna try that one again
there are 105 calories in a serving of
banana the big health and fitness app
gets this data as a means of Cortana
being extended to apps and then when I
use that app the banana is then added
and I can keep track of those calories I
might talk to my sister on the phone or
I might have a chat string with her or I
might have an email conversation and in
all those cases Cortana will now remind
me when I'm in the context of talking to
my sister to talk to her about her new
puppy Cortana can be extended via
third-party apps Hulu add deadbeat to my
queue and so the app runs the service
recognizes the data adding don't be too
cute there it is Cortana is the first
truly personal digital assistant you
thought talking to Cortana was risky
this is terrible I have sweaty hands and
now I'm gonna type as fast as I can
you ready
Windows Phone 8.1 is gonna start rolling
out to consumers as an update in the
next few months so now I'm gonna change
gears and talk to you about Windows 8.1
if you are a Windows user that's been a
Windows user for a long time you
probably have a deep and intimate
relationship with the taskbar so if I
move down here to the bottom of the
screen the taskbar will pop up and I can
use that to switch between modern apps
there's mail there's Facebook or I can
switch back to a win32 a plate will be
available to all windows 8 and 8.1 users
via Windows Update starting April 8 well
it's my pleasure to introduce Universal
windows apps your customers can buy the
app one time and it works on both phone
and PC and PC they don't need to buy a
different app for the phone in the PC so
what I wanna do is give you a look at
some of the work we're doing to build
Touch first versions of office for this
modern Windows platform and I want to
show you this same application that I
was just working on on the tablet also
works on the phone your Universal
Windows applications running on the Xbox
can't just make it work with a
controller you really need to think
about how you're gonna take advantage of
connect and so I'm pretty excited today
to announce connect for b2 for Windows
so I want to announce today that we're
giving a free Xbox one to everyone in
the audience here
we are gonna enable your app with
Universal windows applications to run in
a window and we're gonna enable your
users to find discover and run your
Windows applications with the new Start
menu we will bring Windows Phone 8.1 to
all Lumia Windows Phone 8 devices
offered in an over-the-air update coming
this summer we are also excited to
introduce the next generation of Lumia
devices the Nokia Lumia 930 the Lumia
930 offers unprecedented images and
videos it's got optical image
stabilization so as that gentleman's
shaking his hand with a competing device
I will get the clearer picture you're
getting the blurry picture you can
capture and relive your videos with
complete surround sound capabilities
right from this device now we'll start
selling the Lumia 930 globally in June
we will start in Europe and then move
through Asia India and the Middle East
I'd like to introduce you to two new
Lumia products the Nokia Lumia 630
and the Nokia Lumia 635 the 6:30 and 635
have a sleek design they come in five
stunning colors with changeable shells
and that will be in the month of May
we'll start the rollout in Asia move
through India the Middle East South
America and Europe and we'll be here in
the US broadly with our partners
starting in July the Lumia 630 3G single
sim will be priced around a hundred and
fifty nine dollars if it's a dual SIM
device it'll be a hundred and sixty-nine
dollars and if it's a 635 4G version
it'll be a hundred and eighty-nine
dollars all before taxes and local
subsidies here in the US of course the
pricing is quite different based on the
operators that is going to be more
ubiquitous computing everywhere and
there's going to be ambient intelligence
every
okay your presentation is ending now

fantastic time of the rest period of our
constant thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
