has created a real laptop this time so
they've obviously create the surface
book before this is a true laptops
clamshell design you open it up there's
no special tricks the screen isn't get
into touch there's no kickstand or
anything like that that you normally see
on on the surface devices this is a real
laptop and it's running on Windows 10 s
which is the company's new operating
system that's designed to only run
perhaps from the Windows Store as you
can see it's a premium design this isn't
a cheap device it's 999 dollars as a
starting price and inside michael hasn't
really cut corners with this laptop
there's an Intel Core i5 processor the
full one it's not panelist Core M that
we might seen on other laptops and so
it's fully powered a four gig of ram on
the base model and 128 gig SSD and the
design am so you're an aluminum finish
all around the sort clamshell outside
the device and then interestingly much
stuff to use the Italian fabric
Alcantara which they've used on this
surface pro for a limited edition
keyboard and that's actually fabric
across the keyboard here and right
background by the fat pad and in terms
of the keyboard and it's about one half
mil travel so it feels pretty good it
doesn't feel like I'm that good people
like the regular 12-inch MacBook and it
feels pretty responsive and you've got a
scoop a touchscreen you get on any
surface devices and it works from the
surface again as well some of the really
interesting things that most of has done
with the session of devices they
integrate the speaker's underneath the
keyboard and you'll see that there's no
speakers up here you don't really see a
hinge and there's no real grilles or any
piece of ugliness and you might expect
from a Windows laptop the actual fan
vents are just out the back here is kind
of inked pictures just out of the way
on the side you've got the surface
connector so the same one that's on a
slippery slope or on a surface book and
also on the other side you've got a
regular USB a mini display port and a
headphone jack there's no USB type-c
here I think that's probably the only
disappointing thing from this and having
holding it in my hand it just feels it
feels great like it feels like the
surface laptop that I've kind of always
wanted myself to do so Microsoft's
reasoning from really introducing this
surface laptop is to boost its Windows
10s effort which is new operating system
that's designed just to run apps there
in the Windows Store that doesn't mean
it's not gonna run desktop apps but
it'll need to be packaged as a special
way and on the Windows Store for this
device to support them because this is a
competitor to Google's print book pixel
that's kind of the hero device that's
meant to show off what these devices can
do there's also going to be low end
devices from PC makers and such as Dell
and HP in order s this is really the
hero devices to show if Windows 10 us
and Microsoft is promising 14 and a half
hours battery life on this new surface
laptop we have to see if that holds up
in the review but if it does and it's a
pretty good battery life for a device
like this the only thing I'd say is
could they could have maybe made the
bezels a little bit smaller on this
display and you've also got the 13-point
inch
PixelSense display and so you're getting
all that surface goodness do you
normally get from the other devices so
you might notice these odd-looking lines
on the side of the surface laptop it's
actually by design it's the antenna line
so like you would have on an iPhone 7 or
some sort of device like that all the
Wi-Fi and the Bluetooth and that stuff
is coming out of these on either side
the surface laptop so kind of spoils the
design but muscle to move these antennas
to the side of the device so they can
wedge the keyboard right up against the
display so it doesn't look like it has a
hinge okay so it's a real quick look at
Mike's s new surface laptop to be
available on June 15 for 999 dollars and
for that you're going to get a Core i5
processor 4 gig of ram and 128 gig of
storage and basically I think this is
the surface that sort of pretty much
everyone has been looking for especially
myself and we feel
really lightweight it's beautifully
designed it's just yeah I can't wait to
review this in sort see exactly how it
runs in the course we get most of
declaiming 14 and a half hours of
battery life so if that holds up then
this is going to be a pretty awesome
laptop to use every day alright thanks a
lot for watching and don't forget to
subscribe on youtube we're really
excited about reviewing this and we're
kind of hoping that this was the windows
laptop we've all been looking for</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
