and welcome to the verge cast for the
week of March 25th
I'm Josh Topolsky I'm Nilay Patel I'm
Ross Miller and we're back for you and
only for you Joe you're this is your
cast the Joe cast and yeah we're back on
the verge cast when we discuss the week
in technology culture internet culture
and culture culture which is which is uh
currently developing there you go it's
always developing it's always developing
and and we had a big week interesting
week crazy week
sexy week yeah a week of a week I would
say drenched in sex yes
yeah and love yeah and also in other
things unrelated to either of those yeah
what'swhat's what do we whoa time on
this week well I was celebrating the
Lord smiting the Egyptian people with
plagues I had a Passover sorry I was
gonna talk about this a little bit then
we'll get ya back home for Passover for
a Passover Seder which is the
traditional Passover dinner which look
goes on for 15 hours straight and and I
have to say you know I really enjoyed
there's a part of the of the Seder where
you list off the plagues that were
visited upon the houses of Egypt yeah
you know it's like locusts famine death
of the firstborn of course is the most
important moment yes the wings feed you
got a phone you got a Windows Phone that
only one can be upgraded to 7.8
you're a woman on the internet that's
one of the plagues it's just an
interesting thing that to do like it's a
very morbid I mean a lot of the Jewish
holidays are very and by the way I'm an
atheist I'm not really I'm not a
practicing Jew I was raised so I got you
know my parents could give me a big
guilt trip if I don't participate but
it's just a morbid holiday full of
horrible stories and and you know Kenny
bread right it's not the best yeah I did
get pretty drunk though yeah that's my
flip side drunk on we drink we drink a
type of a type of alcohol called
slivovitz which is like a family
tradition it's a I think it's a plum
brandy yeah it is disgusting they will
burn your inside definitely sounds like
you to drink enough of it to stop forget
that yep and dream we also my father my
brother out I just had a terrible pain
in my leg for no repair that was
incredible this is pain as it's going on
to know my father my brother made a
horseradish yeah okay Lorraine as it's
known yeah and I talked heard it a
little because it tasted really bad when
they finish with it horseradish well you
put a little vinegar and salt in it to
give it a little bit of flavor because
otherwise it's just like burns it's just
burning just a burning sensation I'm
gonna stretch it out I'm gonna you know
what I was driving yesterday so maybe I
did something I don't know what what
Helen was like the trip like six hours
yeah six and a half would do it I don't
know yeah that's weird I get a shot of
slimovitz yeah this is totally unrelated
to anything that we're supposed drunk is
related to our first story it is do it
or potentially related oh I would say so
I would say the news of the week without
question yeah was t-mobile's relaunch of
itself bullshit bullshit bullshit and
nothing about the news of its relaunch
was actually news yeah they announced
that the pricing plans were available
that you know the iPhone 5 is like great
another carrier at the iPhone 5 yeah
they'd set a bunch of this stuff at CES
what was news about it was their
incredibly aggressive like marketing
around it and then the CEO the new CEO
of t-mobile John Legere oh it's Legere
was yeah very sexy
came onto stage and just begin ranting
about the wireless industry and actually
said at one point we have to stop the
bullshit yeah he swore a lot he said he
said that the the way you know how
carriers are nice to you is a crock of
shit and and it was very very I was very
wrong I was very raw very unkind of
unprecedented in this industry yeah we
have a little bit we have a little bit
of a supersuit yeah we have a supercut
of this take a look at take a look at
what he was up to on stage any second
there we go we're unleashing everything
we're gonna talk about this today but
please stop the bullshit sorry I
promised myself I wasn't gonna swear
today Elizabeth wherever you are your
father didn't mean that I've been at
this business for about 33 years but I
don't have wireless industry experience
and after a while I went home and I said
to myself holy shit I don't have
wireless industry experience what am I
gonna do and it suddenly dawned on me
there's not a god damn person in the
world besides a wireless industry person
that would understand why the hell this
mess works this way and the worst fear
of the wireless industry is that
somebody from outside AHS comes in and
starts looking at their industry I've
already told you about the spaceship and
the aliens coming in it doesn't make
sense
unbelievable high prices how the hell
can that cost that much unless you're
gonna drive it I mean come on that nasty
guy on the end that's print and you you
got to see that the day you go in that
store they love you it's like you know
oh you got to have this phone we're
gonna be so good to you here's a free
t-shirts and balloons by the way need a
back rub maybe that's just me you who
pay so much for your phones it's
incredible
everybody's blogging holy crap I can't
believe you just said that oh he said
shit that's how I lost the family pool I
bet he'd only swear five times the it
was very spirited very good stuff
unfortunately here's the thing and we
did some math and I did some personal
math because I was like this is I'm
fired up yes I got LTE they're expanding
their network they have these new
pricing plans they're selling the iPhone
for a hundred bucks
they're selling that one which I'm using
for a hundred bucks this is great I'm
switching yeah and then I went and I did
some math and it's actually would be
more expensive to for me to switch
because you have because you have a
family plan no I have a regular a single
regular cool bachelor plan me it's you
know there's four people on my family
Brian yeah multiple device you know I
don't i pads and all kinds of stuff no
but if you get it if you get a if you
get an iphone it's like you know the
unlimited plan is seventy bucks
yeah plus twenty four having an iPhone
right there playing now plus twenty four
having their 4G service that here's the
thing that plus twenty traveling the
often that's that's the big thing that
they're doing is they're saying we're no
longer just pricing in the subsidy for
the phone it's the price of the plan
right because 18t you pay however much
per month for the service yeah and it
there's a subsidy built in to that
always okay right t-mobile saying you
can either pay the twenty eight bucks a
month for us to subsidize your phone or
you cannot pay it and if you don't pay
it but that's $600 well right but if you
already have a phone okay sure right or
if you get to the end of two years yeah
you're all the way paid off or you're
like you find a hundred you're in this
you're about the same as Verizon and
middle ground people come and don't have
a phone right they're not bringing a
phone it's like I want to get new
service and I need a new phone I think
what t-mobile's here is like they're not
trying to be cheaper they're calling
themselves cheaper because everyone does
that but I've always been cheaper no
it's pretty close so I mean it's just
more transparent yeah I know what I'm
paying for like what's the deal so
haunted so I get an eigen iPhone right I
pay $100 to the phone upfront am i
paying the twenty dollar subsidy fee yes
I'm paying the seventy dollars unlimited
everything
yeah I'm paying the other 20 there's
another $20 for like their 4G service
for the hotspot yeah no no they turn for
the hotspot for four gigs of hotspot
which is which is lower than cheaper
than what you pay it but for some how it
still worked out to more money for me
because I don't need unlimited minutes
unlimited messages that not a trick okay
what I really want it's like 900 minutes
and a thousand messages because I'm not
ever going to use them right but they
don't do that so it ends up being more
expensive because you think you're get
any more but long as sure it is I'm on
two months I'm on t-mobile I hate it
yeah I'm like I don't want this anymore
what happens you don't have a contract
so that ends yeah and then you have to
give your phone back to them okay and
they give you a fair market credit for
it which they refuse to explain how
that's gonna work right and you're on
the hook for whatever the difference is
you do give the phone back to them yep
and then you pay for the phone you have
to pay for whatever the difference
between the remaining in the end you pay
five seventy nine for the phone right by
I get my iPhone ice after two months I'm
like I hate this I'm out of here
right I say I you can have the phone
back yep they're like give me $500 well
no no no you'll get you'll get they'll
give you some credit which are calling a
fair market value credit huh so that's a
mystery imagine what for what credit oh
of what for like your phone
yeah but the phone is your only only
paid for it but what you're giving them
the property back right yeah so then you
are yeah yeah you only owe them what
they're saying the difference between
the market value of the phone is from
the 500 that you have but they're giving
you money is what you're saying
no you're just paying them less money
you're giving them some money yes right
so you're sipping them four hundred
dollars instead of six hundred you give
them the phone back yeah you still have
to pay it off you have to pay about some
amount but they're not clear doesn't
sound a great deal to me that doesn't
sound like you're getting out scot-free
you have to pay for the amount that
you've used the phone right I mean like
the phone's value has decreased I guess
so was different so they're gonna let me
have a phone to do whatever I wanted
with it and I but I think this is
interesting because the ultimate goal
here is that you buy a phone the other
way you buy a laptop yeah you decouple
ud comment you want to de couple the
phone purchase from the from the service
part right and I can't take that you
know they can't do that straight away
all right because
can't say our phones cost $539 right
that they would suicide but I can so
they have to provide some sort of path
they want people like me who have a one
I'm like you know I'm getting off 18 see
a service in the iPhone guy phones are
going to work across 18 teen t-mobile
assume you can get unlock you know if
you have an iPhone an 18 teen you get
unlocking you know used on t-mobile
they're like scrambling to make part of
a network compatible if 18 TS 4G and LTE
yeah
so there's when do we when do we see
like a viable new network from t-mobile
like how far off I feel like that's
we're 2014 maybe you have a t-mobile
network that can compete right so what
they're saying is it's a hundred million
customers that will have LT access or
these like kinda million citizens yes
that could have it my first half of the
year two hundred million by the end of
the year I mean here's the thing I have
a TTL to either services their coverage
is pretty bad it's bad like like you you
go a few seconds outside of any major
metropolitan area I was outside it was
10:00 in midtown Manhattan
yeah I walked ten minutes away from the
office for an errand today and I had 4G
the whole way it's like what do you mean
4G fake fortune yeah you know I mean I
have in in my neighborhood I get 4G when
I'm going over the bridge and stuff it's
just like it's gone yeah and and and
even a little bit further out into the
neighborhood it's gone so so in Verizon
is amazing I mean Verizon's network is
their penetration is amazing right
so t-mobile I feel like is so far off
they they can say 100 million but they
mean like a hundred many people who
might drive through a certain area well
I get for ours if cars on your market so
I mean look they've got a long ways to
go I think what's really interesting
about this whole story from the
beginning is not there's no way for them
to win now right but I think whose years
like put himself on the map like he's
famous now yeah he stood on stage and
called all of his competitors
he literally called bullshit and all of
a the only problems that he didn't back
it up with a really any kind of
astounding saving I think what would
have been amazing is he said like look
you're gonna save a thousand dollars
over two years but you're not in some
cases you might but overall it's the
savings are like a couple hundred bucks
well I think if you're the sort of
person who buys who wants a new phone
every year and I think a lot of people
think this podcast but I want to buy
every year I think there is some
built-in there for you because you get
to give the phone back and you don't
have to pay the $700 feed you know the
off-contract that's true yeah I think
service you have to deal with t-mobile
I mean I don't know anybody who's like I
love I mean I see people all the time
tweeted me t-mobile so great I love it
it's awesome in my area but all the
people that I know people who live in
New York people who are in our industry
I've never heard anybody really say
anything
a few civil because they put out the
Nexus 4 dollars per month anymore right
and I feel like the Google campus
they've got just like towers everywhere
and they're just going for it and they
it's like literally a bubble is foreign
and it was like it's really free time is
great I get 21 down it's like yeah on
the Google campus mhm
which is like almost literally a bubble
yeah you know there's no real world it's
like one yeah not terrible I mean like
the you know they they brag about this
42 down but it's not there yeah yeah I
don't I've never seen anything room but
I think it's a baby stuff you know I'm
like this is what Google has been trying
to do with the Nexus program they've
Auto really failed to do it because
they're not a carrier it makes sense
what Google couldn't do it and t-mobile
can do it but the idea that you will buy
a phone and the age of the custom
high-end phone is like kind of over
right it's no longer AT&amp;amp;T captivate
Verizon fascinate it's just the g18
Verizon which whose phones are littered
with AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon yeah the only army
only for AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon right like the
Droid DNA well yeah but that has to come
to an end does it not a Verizon AT&amp;amp;T
stay on top I mean but their phones are
the same the GS 4 is the same the iPhone
is obviously the same it's the same like
you can't buy one is the same everywhere
except for for a isin of course let's
let's define like sound like the chance
for is gonna have different radios for
the verizon model you won't be able to
take it to AT&amp;amp;T
right but with this this age of like I
you can only get certain phones on
certain carriers at least from the the
perspective of the average consumer you
gets it it's already been decoupled a
little I mean what we need to do is just
come up with you know real prices for
phones and just say this is what it's
gonna be so I think that consumers won't
buy
first if you get an iPhone for free or
$99 you're not gonna buy an iPhone for
$500 right you're always gonna take this
you look at least in this country I
can't speak to everywhere else but I
think this is a country that loves
credit right we love being on credit we
love getting like pay
buy now pay later right I decided up for
this PayPal service it's called pay
later you know it's like if the whole
idea is like don't you know it's pay for
it now yeah we got you got you covered
yeah I I don't even know why I didn't
have to sign up for it I just wanted to
know all right now I want to not give
any much money for time it's a kind of a
procrastination thing I like long walks
on the beach yeah I love ice cream and I
love paying later yeah pain later that's
my thing but I just think like it tell
people to break themselves of that habit
yeah it's but it's also tough you know
it's a lot of money for money if you
actually get people to pay which you
create a market yeah once you create a
market price for it at 250 so what it is
the pig is 215 somebody just say
something yeah no 300 the aim is 300 to
$40 to me am i whispering in her ear
okay
what's it yeah it's way cheaper than a
600 or $700 if you look at Verizon the
droid DNA is almost like $700 oh it's on
track yeah but here's so here's the
thing with that is you have to get
consumers to act in their own
self-interest you're basically trick
them in doing it and a teen teen Verizon
are really good at tricking you into
acting against your interest by saying
the phone is free just sign this to your
contract and we've baked in these huge
subsidies I'm always I'm always wonder
why people don't act on their own
self-interest like when people vote for
Republicans no I'm like I think I think
why are you doing this year why do you
want to have it worse do you want to
just say that there are a lot of let's
just say across the political landscape
there are many politicians Democrat and
Republican who will you know people are
like I'm voting for this guy because you
know this weird thing that they really
want and it's like that issue is
actually really bad for you and they're
like I don't care I just he said it's
good so I mean this is
baselet email try I'm coming back yes
please you don't know my deep hatred for
all Republicans but so if you look at
just listen I loved all people in
America all outside of America get out
of my face
not interested sorry I played bioshock
infinite like for hours like let's just
say it's about America yeah and only
America we're doing a my mind from that
game though yeah okay the the state of
America you know the first Bioshock that
I bought or so math like now ten dollars
on Amazon you've not played the original
BioShock it's a great it's not one of
the greatest videos I meant to play I
haven't played any of them anyway
it is so good you should play it yes if
you go like so we have Topshop coming up
after the show right yes wandering
wandering wandering on New York talking
people about their cell plans for top
shelf and I ran and one guy who's from
from London I was like how much she pay
for your service and I was like would
you would you switch for cheaper service
he's like yeah I pay $10 a month for my
cell service it's unlimited every hey
London is like the size Rhode Island
what is the size of Rhode Island but
it's because they buy the service
separately from the phone actually the
whole really he's like I love this phone
it's totally sold out all through the UK
well I just crazy I guess Microsoft is
right well that's actually interesting
right I mean that that's part of this is
Microsoft would have an easier time he
found the market the Lumia that's really
interesting I mean it was really easy to
find him it was like bright blue yeah
from England
yeah huh I thought that was like kind of
an AT&amp;amp;T thing it was awesome I think it
literally we saw him like all of us
Jordan and Iraq walking around or like
that one so I wonder like how much did
he pay for that loom you you full price
but like okay what is that for 5500 me
14 pounds I don't know there's a
competition for those devices as well so
like Carphone Warehouse in the UK sells
a cheaper than like Tesco that's enough
competition iPhone even like because the
carriers are in pricing competition
against each
because people can just swap the device
TVs and computers
you mean like every other player like
everything that we buy like ours right
from a different price from a different
dealer right for different like
everything else but it's funny because
the the cell carrier I mean we've been
ranting on this forever they've
completely insulated themselves in this
realm it's so boring
yeah I mean all the FCC needs to do is
just smash this whole thing just say
like we can do you can't do this anymore
Julius is that man yeah I know who's
gonna step in to fix it some some
lobbyists former Verizon heard miss
Sigler FCC chair I would support that
and I believe you know though his his
background is riddled with drug abuse I
think that overall he would be a great
candidate just don't don't ask him about
that incident like 1996 don't ask the
whole year yeah anyhow he won't remember
anyway I do think the t-mobile thing is
a good sign it's babies we should wrap
this up but I think the mobile thing is
a good sign
to recap it could be better but I think
it's a step in the right direction I
don't I don't have a problem with
Republicans although I do I do
I do have a problem some of their
policies this policies of the Republican
Party and and I love all Americans and I
hate everybody who's not in America okay
all right you can either talk about the
cows keys mooing Netflix is next new
series or you can talk about some crazy
dystopian drone stuff let's do it with
cows keys okay this is all right so the
story as it is actually bout six months
ago with cows keys in the Babylon 5
crater J Michael specific we set the
stage in case you don't know who the
Wachowski czar they directed them he
made the matrix and then Speed Racer
thing exactly just made the matrix the
matrix one creators are doing their
second movie ever
this is it their final they're fine the
only Matrix movie yes with a project
with never with a 10-episode series
called since eight we have no idea what
it's about
Oh
the future yes in like four years a
clock is back yeah so if we heard a
digital I can turn it around see the
insides of the clock don't blink feed so
six months ago they were shopping
surround for like TV networks that's how
the story goes yeah
the settles not on TV to settle on
Netflix so it's coming out next year
some point all 10 episodes of course at
once and this is I think it's be ninth
or tenth Netflix original series by the
time it comes out so they've got they
did house of cards well don't forget
they started with Lillehammer
Lillehammer which is not good I want I
mean was okay was I didn't want to keep
watching it house of cards cards
Arrested Development before that Eli
Roth's Hemlock Grove that comes out next
mode you have lock Grove which is which
is based on a book mm-hmm which is
written and it takes place and I was
this a trailer for it
mm-hmm this is Hemlock Grove this is so
this is um so this is actually based on
a book written by I think a guy from
Pittsburgh or who went to school in
Pittsburgh and it takes place outside of
Pittsburgh so this is what Pittsburgh's
like I've never his like okay here this
is it by only hesitation is from
director Eli Roth right yeah right am i
right yeah it also seems like just like
an ultra violent like a werewolf toilet
it's not it's not to Twilight man trust
me all right I mean no I'll take your
word for it I'll see it it's not enough
you want to read the book now I started
really I bought the book to read and
then Laura took it and read it instead
of me but you like this is like this is
the thing that like Reed Hastings has
been talking about the Netflix CD nudity
here in this trailer it's just a but
yeah a but is new to me I think even
even the word bot is new today you were
like NYPD Blue start doing butts doing
bye
advise you to see David Cruz's but notes
but both their bucks also also who is
partner like the bigger guy his bot was
also super what Sipowicz was the
character's name his bot was it all its
but okay they're like this Thursday
Sipowicz his ass all over your TV we're
really watched story let's try Hemlock
Grove rest of developments in May yeah
there's a bunch like anime series
science fiction comedies are coming out
huge deal it's like there's there's
seven shows happening in 2003 Kowski
said we're not gonna take this to
network we're not gonna take it HBO or
Showtime we haven't talked about that
directly which is like six months ago
they're doing anyway they're doing it
with no long yeah so we don't know
anything about it other than entire
story that's pretty much the entire this
is a horrible topic we don't get say
anything about it no maybe it does it
does show like you know Netflix still
attracting huge talent well I'm making
the matrix and then the other two majors
is and then Speed Racer and then
something else no no they just made the
matrix oh oh
didn't they do they did they were
co-directors of Cloud Atlas Cloud Atlas
a great hit another a successful product
no but I'm just saying like they they
kind of like you know no they didn't
there's one of you watch all of house of
cards not yet okay is it good I just
finished it amazing I will say that it
was very strange to watch that much that
much of a show that tried so hard at the
beginning to not be a TV show yeah and
then so thoroughly turned into a TV TV
show right but like they want the first
three episodes are like this is not a TV
show I think that's why I'm gonna watch
for the environment rubble watching it I
hear the first couple of episodes are
very slow and then it kind of picks up a
little bit yeah I mean it's like nine
episodes of exposition okay please no
not for me not spoiling yeah but I
marathon that thing in three days yeah
fraid someone's gonna spoil it yeah and
then I don't know who's seen it who's
not okay he was spoiling for me I had to
stop following or was Retta really yeah
for parts are out
boilers all over the place I'm Loretta
please yeah I started to follow you
because I thought we'd have something
special going on on Twitter and now
you're ruining house of cards room we
have this was this is like so this is a
thing you know I I think Netflix has a
problem let's like everyone's the only
thing you can say about house of cards
is like have you seen house of cards yet
yeah because I don't know like yeah I
know Netflix is like this is everybody
has to watch everybody alive has to
watch house of cards
no spoilers right I mean that's you know
Twitter just means like a spoiler alert
button yeah right
they're like the blackout text mm-hmm
yeah but it needs to be like I'm gonna
do a spoiler so you know your text won't
be vids you don't say I got to click on
this to see it right I also found myself
wondering our house of cards as intro
credits because it's like I'm watching
all of these to watch maybe you're gonna
revisit an episode
maybe they'll syndicated maybe you know
the amazing totally totally possible
that somebody would want to pick it up
to for syndication I mean that's not the
craziest idea is it mm-hmm
it's kind of the craziest I mean that
completely goes against Netflix is I
mean in five years
somebody might they've you know say to
here you can't staple the credits on
then why don't we gotta watch them now
I think the whole point is you binge
watch the show that's right I don't know
you're right I don't have a good answer
for the first time ever either the music
is really good drones talking about yeah
okay so did you did you hear bloom
Brooks quote from over the weekend yes
okay get used to it Mayor Bloomberg it's
very like I guess I like Bloomberg
basically but I'm not sold on his get
used there's some of these quotes we
reran the piece what's the difference
and I it's funny because you can tell
Bloomberg doesn't quite know what he's
talking about what's the difference
whether the drone is up in the air or on
the building why would she presumably
means are not a drone fighter man
everyone's one can chase you down one
can follow you to your house we're going
into a different world uncharted you
can't keep the tide from coming in the
tide by the way being pervasive
surveillance by the stage that's like an
army of drones like going through
traffic it's not a question of whether
it's good or bad
I just don't see how you can stop them
no really leaders to say it may be
terrible but it's really nothing I could
do about it
so just let it happen to you that's a
great like action movie taglines it's
not a question of whether it's good or
bad he actually followed up the what's
difference wanted runner something
around the building with I mean
intellectually I have trouble making
that distinction saying look there's
CCTVs which by the way are not they're
not owned by the state the city they're
not monitored in a vast network of
elected network of ok better on so I
think what he's saying is like look CCTV
cameras are watching you these things
will be watching you private eyes are
watching you I'm not doing it the line
either hmm that's the next one thank you
it's it's what is it they're watching
your I don't think it's watching your
every move I think it's like making your
every move or take taking your every
move it's not well there why well the
next prize yes that's for sure but I
think he's basically like stupidly they
see well ok so whatever productions have
oh he knows ha but he's saying he's
saying he's saying look cameras on you
get used to it ok fine I get used to it
but but you know I'm gonna get less used
to the camera that flies through the air
and can follow me mhm everywhere then I
am to the one that stationary on a
building
yeah like or in a business I get that
like I can I can I'm not I'm not loving
it but I also think that they're very
helpful I mean there's no question that
CCTV in maybe harm they harm slightly in
terms of our privacy but they do tend to
be very effective when a bank gets
robbed and they're trying to identify in
New York and this might have explained
Chris Josh cops team would definitely
argue that it robbed banks
so in New York the police department
runs a system called the domain
awareness system which is three thousand
cameras on the street in Manhattan yeah
so they already have they already
networked yeah they're all there
watching zarina where that's like one of
the lost bumpers with the yeah all the
cameras and this joystick and they have
that they have that thing and there's
one guy just like do I say enhance now
but he has an enhanced button and they
can precise weights I mean there's all
kinds of we've been running stories
after stories on this about like there's
the the Argos global awareness system
that can like track you up to six inches
on the ground from the sky yeah so like
we just hit this and we just hit this
lidar system the city scan yeah which is
taking laser mappings of a city yeah and
then knowing if you're anything's out of
two centimeters out of place yeah which
is definitely the end the end times yeah
I mean it's it's crazy so I think the
idea that the mayor of New York is like
screw it it's over there's nothing you
can do about it is a little bit
terrifying I mean you want I think into
Josh's point about the thing that you
should read it
Josh cops team wrote a piece today that
is a published piece today that is Mayor
Bloomberg's What is the title Mayor
Bloomberg's vision of a drone field city
doesn't fly or why it doesn't fly and
it's really good it kind of makes this
argument you know he wrote this piece a
while ago that some it's not okay for
Congress to not know how the internet
works and this is like to me very much
in the same it's like we need smarter
politicians like I'm sorry but you're
supposed to be the smartest guys in the
room you supposed to be the most
informed guys in the room like it
shouldn't be up to other people to have
to explain this stuff to you you're
supposed to go like I need to know this
issue because it affects the people in
my city or in my state or in my country
and I'm gonna learn about it I'm gonna
figure it out and I'm gonna be able to
speak about it intelligently if you
can't do that if you're like that CCTV
and drone basically the same thing yeah
that's your attitude it's time for a new
mayor and the mayor should be young
maybe have a beard I'm thinking glasses
tall maybe a why on the end of his name
last name I'm running for mayor
vote for me whatever your whatever in
the next phase of the versions you as
mayor whatever
your criticism ACG elected new york
that's the year I'm running next I will
say house of cards has made me want to
run for Congress in a really weird way
he'd be great in Congress yeah cuz I
would definitely kill that dude for now
hey hey did you just boil something he
didn't spoil anything now also I don't
think you should make threats about
people in Congress my campaign for mayor
begins now okay here here my here's what
I'll do for you the city of New York one
I will tell you I will learn about how
drones work I will tell you I will be
able to tell you I will be able to tell
you by the way am I in this camera the
one that I that I was in originally I
just want to make sure I will tell you
if a dry if there's a if it's a drone or
a CCTV camera I'd be able to distinguish
between those two things
okay that's my first promise to you my
second promise is that the city that the
skies of the city will be blacked out
with swarms of drones we want you do at
all times and no sunlight shall break
through my drone swarm this world Bush
will be on you like white on rice
mister boss you have a question yes mr.
mayor mr. berry have a question yeah
these guys like reporters like a press
thing those really quick could we get
from so real quick Kenna Kenna large
drone give me a really big large soda
well I of course will allow all sizes of
sodas and I will actually have a law
that there has to be more sugar in them
so people are you know more awake and
ready for action because of the drone
swarms you gotta be on your toes in
those things oh that my drones will be
armed and they will also have claws
yeah they'll be armed with with with
guns as well as sharp claws and the
drugs will be making sure that you're
drinking sugar will actually deliver the
sugary drinks New York will be hand
delivered drone delivered claw delivered
actually the claws will have a look like
little syringes and the drones we
painted to look like weird hawks they'll
be like we have like lots of extra metal
yeah yeah yeah be preventing and yeah
that's the thing that I can promise to
you as that I will do as mayor
we're Hawk drones that that can kill and
serve you a drink
that blackouts is the blot out the Sun
and that I can also tell you which one
is a drone and which one is not hold on
one second so I just I just know
something I didn't see before
someone in the booth apparently did it
Josh Topolsky for mayor oh okay yeah you
2014 is gonna be our year yeah also free
Wi-Fi everywhere in New York oh good
provided by drones that's right throw
net okay I like that maybe it could be
on the cabinet I'll be your speech right
okay good great Ellis will be because
the drones will murder that's right
drugs are impervious to copyright and
patent law I do know about drones so
wait these Alice Hamburg are gonna come
in Allison hey we're gonna play a clip
this is a big setup yeah they'll set up
yeah so Ellis did this great report this
week on iCloud how it just you know it
doesn't just work so we were bring him
in here that's what you're saying iCloud
should just work it should just work
with quote yes it doesn't mm-hmm and in
LFO a piece he talked too much
developers that like basically it
doesn't like here's what's wrong with it
so we have a clip with a clip from Steve
Jobs introducing iCloud yeah and then
when we come back I won't be here I'll
be gone you'll never see me well you'll
just be wearing a Nellis hamburger suit
yes I'll be wearing a hamburger scuse me
can we call it iCloud now iCloud stores
your content in the cloud and wirelessly
pushes it to all your devices so it
automatically uploads it stores it and
automatically pushes it to all your
other devices but also it's completely
integrated with your apps and so
everything happens
automatically and there's nothing new to
learn it just all works it just works
now you might ask why should I believe
them they're the ones that brought me
mobile me
it wasn't our finest hour let me just
say that both yeah so so funny at the
time
Oh Alice by the way here's Ella's
hamburger I just teleported right in and
just teleported in in place of Ross
Miller so so obviously you know Steve
Jobs was very bullish about right
iCloud why would you believe us we're
the ones are made mobile we're the ones
who maybe we figured it out this time
and it's not it's not that it's there's
a different set of problems it's not the
same kind of like consumer facing
problems that I mean it ultimately rolls
down to ends up being a consumer facing
issue but explaining that explain the
issue with iCloud right now so the
problem is is Steve Jobs says it just
works for everybody and so people expect
all their apps to tie in perfectly with
iCloud and two years later customers are
angry because their favorite apps
haven't rolled out I cloud integration
everybody's leaving bad reviews in the
App Store and these developers are upset
mmm I've been hearing so much over the
last year saying hey if we want to do
anything more complex than just sinking
a list of files or - duze apple's way to
do it is horribly borked and just
completely do they actually use the
phrase horrible abort that was me okay
but apparently totally blew it yeah and
so developers are angry yeah about the
implementation yeah and the problems
that Apple doesn't provide any support
apparently I've heard that they only
have four guys working on core data
which is how Apple wants you to store
your data in iCloud for complicated apps
so I switch be clear here iCloud is a
marketing term for consumers we're
encompasses like 50 things yeah right
everything from like you can redownload
your songs and iTunes to when you put an
app on your phone it shows up on the
iPad and that stuff is like very simple
right yeah and a lot of people assume
hey plug into iCloud rights as easy is
adding some of these other iCloud
features right yeah it's there I make a
change in my document on my phone and it
automatically shows up over here in my
iPad or my Mac that's thought it doesn't
work across any apps except really
apples right mm-hmm right which which we
can assume our augmented in some way
not just this is not just or built for
whatever their exchanges and that's what
I've heard is that a lot of the Apple
apps like let's say keynote are using
the document based syncing just like a
list of files with changes right and
that apparently works really well
especially as of the last couple months
but they don't use core data which is
for databases and that's what a lot of
developers were most looking forward to
about iCloud now and they don't even use
it except for their trailers app which
doesn't work too well I think it's
interesting to the juxtaposition between
Google's strategy here and and even
Microsoft in some way where where they
really are providing like this gateway
this this you know it's not all in the
background essentially you know the yes
the data singing is in the background
and ultimately you're syncing you're
syncing content back and forth between
devices but but in many cases you're
looking at web views where the data is
in one place to begin with you know
right but like you know uh well Google
is an obvious example but on Drive or
Google Docs right you know that data
when you open it up on your app on your
Android phone that data is as far as I
know is a some web view of the data that
you're dealing with it I don't know all
the details of it but but there's not it
doesn't feel like there's this push-pull
situation which happens with iCloud
which makes it I think more complex
seems to make it more complex for
developers to plug into they're not
saying like you know cook up a webview
and that will be displayed in both
places they're saying exchange data back
and forth between three different places
right now take it from one platform to
up to the cloud sound so what's
interesting is I've been reading some of
the follow ups from Alice's piece and
it's developers saying well hey this
doesn't work and B what are the benefits
of doing all this engineering work to
lock myself into Apple sync ecosystem
yeah because what if I do want to build
that webview I can't do it with Apple
system what if I ask it's really popular
and I want to go get the Android
audience definitely can't do that with
apples ecosystem right so there's this
like it also means you can't use it from
a buddy's computer internet well it just
seems it seems like what what Apple
really wants to do is or what they
should be doing is standardizing around
some I'm sorry not standardized but
using some standards that pre-existing
standards here and opening that saying
like hey look there's all this stuff
about like in a way like what they did
with Safari and WebKit where they're
like hey and so there's web I thought
where they do do that work
right so like the calendar syncing is
Kal that's right works well right that
contact syncing is going carddav right
people also know how that stuff works
those are open standards and these are
things that they couldn't be couldn't be
less transparent about I mean it took
them a year to even offer sample code do
you think there's any is there any did
you get any sense here that this is a
competitive issue alongside being just a
kind of technical issue or a manpower
issue like is there an is there
something here where apples kind of like
hey we don't want the open or not open
office what is the UM what is the UH
popular office app quick office quick
office we don't want these guys to have
you know the same kind of access that
are are that pages has or you know
numbers has do you sense that there's
anything there or is it really just a
question of like they're not throwing
enough manpower and they don't have
their like technical side of stuff you
know they're ducks in a row there I
think that's exactly it
I mean they don't have their ducks in a
row they announce this as a feature
Steve Jobs said it's going to be easy to
tie your absent it's so weird years
later it just sucks it's kind of like
facetimes there's a little bit
reminiscent of face time when they made
a big deal I mean I thought they made a
pretty big deal of a7 now they're like
yeah we're gonna open this up it's gonna
be a standard if you want to make I mean
somebody I think specifically asked
somebody at Apple if I want to make an
Android app I think they maybe maybe
jobs even set it on stage if I'm in QA
or something yeah a tune it was like no
it was like yeah if you want yeah you
know in the EEPROM sure said something
about how horrible Android is in you
know why would anybody do that but but
the point is that it's like one of these
things where Apple saying like hey we're
creating the standard and we're gonna
open it up to people and it can be easy
to use because we're app only now to do
this stuff and they're not you know I
don't want to like beat them up any more
than necessary but I think for
developers this is becoming you know the
clout you know it's funny and I go but
we've talked about this before where job
said you know it's not just a hard drive
in the sky it's not just a yeah you know
your files don't just go up and then
come back down but like weirdly iCloud
seems most like that out of all of the
services that exist you know it just
seems like the least easy to plug into
it as a real cloud as a real cloud
service suite I mean I've to this day
people write what is iCloud I'm like I
don't know this was a vague it's like
iTunes Match is part of iCloud right
it's like my app what is our
it's a marketing term yeah I mean that's
to market what to market that's the
question like cuz I automatic solution
for music movies you know documents in
the cloud
yeah iTunes in the cloud like I find
like the photos thing totally daunting
you know it's so I will say photo stream
works well photo stream works okay but
he requires that you does this thing
where like you think that there would be
a process somewhere that pops open every
once in a while in the background and
downloads your your photo stream photos
to iPhoto but it doesn't you can't see
your photo stream photos until you open
iPhoto and watch them download yeah and
it's like I'm so used now to I take
pictures on my phone they get
automatically uploaded to Google Plus
which is Picasa into a private folder
and they're just there one on when I'm
done you know the process doesn't seem
like there's a more of there's much less
of a seamless process and managing
you're like what are these today you
know what did I hit a limit I don't it's
just weird to me like it doesn't feel as
cohesive as they sold in I and I think
that like they're butting up against
their kind of apples has had a lot of
problems with the internet yes like the
internet they like their apps and that's
what one developer named Greg from agile
tortoise told me and I said us agile
tourists they make that app drafts
that's really great and so what he said
was with Apple there is no truth in the
cloud like you find with Google there's
not like one server that holds all this
stuff the job yeah he said that right
and that hasn't been that way it's like
if you want to send that stuff to Google
that's fine but photostream for example
it's like they need to hold it for you
and then push it down to this app
effectively which is a whole other
challenge yeah that they just have I
think this is part of the untangle
enough like I'm very interested see what
happens at WWDC because I think this
will be part of it I also think that
just the untangling of interaction in
the OS in iOS is one of the things that
is like their biggest challenge right
now you know it's like how do you
untangle the interaction for an app
developer when they want them to be able
to you know effectively move a file here
there or move data here there or share
something to another app or open with
another app or do this kind of like the
stuff that has become so weirdly fluid
and easy on Android when it's like hey
you can do this with three different
things which one do you want to do it
with like do you always want to use that
app word you want to use something else
and it just like you just get into a
oh of use some of these developers are
telling me they're like that's one of
the things about iOS is that all the
apps are sandboxed yeah there's not one
file system you can really look at
unless you're gonna plug it into your
computer or jailbreak and that's
something you get on Android that is in
a lot of ways really nice I mean I think
that I think that they you know Apple
had a lot of runway because they revered
so very deeply revolutionized mobile
computing and now they've like you know
they kind of started way high up and
have and haven't stayed there in that
but now stuff has risen and gone beyond
it in terms of like ease of use and and
data portability and I think that and
and don't cross system functionality
right I just made that term up by the
way I'm pretty excited about it and I
think that and I think that now it's
like time for them to meet those
challenges like a light in an 80s movie
when you like turn on a robot and like
cross system functionalities I'd like to
see the meet at WWC or whenever they
announce the next version of iOS I mean
they really there does seem to be this
like big ball of confusion from
developers from users you know I'd like
to take some accountability yeah I mean
there's been these developers that I
mean the way that they put it is we have
to throw our bugs into the radar black
hole is what they say and you know these
guys aren't brats it's like yeah this is
a free service but they were all so
geeked about it when Apple talked right
the syncing databases is really tough
but you ever try and sync your iPhoto
with Dropbox your computer is purring
right until you shut I thought you want
you want I mean it's good ostensibly
would be a good thing for developers for
them to be able to easily plug into this
I've known doubt that that's the case
and I'm sure that this frustration I
mean and what you wrote I think you see
that frustration is about hey you built
something kind of half-assed it's not
really working and our customers expect
it yeah and you promised it and like
what's going on I mean that's totally
reasonable to me that seems like not
unreasonable at all yeah these guys
really their only opportunity is at WWDC
and Apple won't talk about it
I mean Apple won't address it i mean
Apple doesn't address stuff until it's
absolutely
the worst possible situation right until
your beacon type in a URL and steal
someone's password right no I mean it is
but it is like you know it's stuff like
antenna gate you know it was like had to
get really to a fever pitch before Apple
address and and boy did they address it
well ish they were like we have a free
bumper we got a body on these and now a
little bit less money we're still gonna
make more money than ever be a corner
like the maps they I mean like the maps
you know I mean Maps the maps one was a
little rare where they but it did take
an enormous amount of noise for Tim Cook
to say hey we messed up we could do
better on maps I don't know if that's
happened yet I used maps the other day
and it was not good it's not it's not
good it was not good but anyhow but they
the Internet data in the Internet is
like something that Apple needs
definitely compute well now so here's my
theory I'll get there in a relationship
I'm just gonna keep saying this until
it's not sure anybody but I think Apple
they made a little computer but it's
like the little computer they wanted to
make and they never wanted to have apps
on it and they you know Steve Jobs
original idea was some web apps and like
don't worry about it shut up and it it's
like the App Store actually surprised
them
did you really no way you really think
their plan was not to have apps yeah
I've talked I mean that's a line in the
book right in a Walter Isaacson book
where he's like the the board member
from Genentech who I want to call Arthur
Clark oh that's not his name whoever the
board member from Genentech was like
begging Steve Jobs to put apps on the
iPhone I feel like there was always kind
of a maybe it was a skunkworks thing or
maybe it was just brewing kind of down
in the background but III can't imagine
that the plan was to not do native apps
for the maybe not as fast as they did
but I think that's the thing not
third-party yeah why maybe now in there
cuz you know they're still catching up
to the reality of what they made which
is it's not just a little computer right
like it's not a map where no you know I
think it's actually really interesting
that they've never made a Mac with an
integrated data card in it like they've
never they've never been like we're
gonna put the internet right in the damn
thing right whenever gonna you can't buy
a Mac with like a 4G modem in it or an
LT mode a minute
in the evening the MacBook break a
MacBook yeah I was really amazed about
why you would want to have LTE and
you're like home computer why not think
of why no because it's in your house
yeah but like if you fine whatever like
it yes that Wow no no I see what you're
saying though never they've never liked
integrated I always took that as more of
a I'm not wanting to deal with carriers
in any material what they do with their
other product I think things like they
they were like we built a computer and
that it's here's our iPhone as a little
computer yeah and Google's like we're
building a platform that is like
designed put I mean I think there was a
sign to give you view think there was
this idea that like hey it's great for
getting on the internet it's great for
getting on the internet in your web
browser it's a really really amazing
mobile web browser still to this day the
best yank didn't that enough yeah you
can get on pages I'm interested to see
you cuz Apple and Google have such
different approaches if you look at
something like a Chromebook it's like
the opposite yeah yeah iPhone yeah you
need you need the internet for
everything you're looking to the
internet for everything whereas Apple is
thus far been very comfortable with
these local apps yeah look outward I
think it's kind of outdated I think
local local app functionality is
absolutely needed and necessary for a
lot of this stuff I mean but there has
to be some material fluid back like data
back-end into the internet and off to
what you like if something doesn't sync
for me if it's data related if it's not
like a clear syncing situation
I mean I'm bouncing back and forth
through my phone and a tablet and my
laptop all day long depending on where I
am and what I'm doing and like to see
the seamless syncing between something
like Gmail on gmail particularly when
you see the seamless syncing where it's
maybe a few seconds here there yeah but
it's like you know what you do on the
phone is absolutely related to and part
of what is happening when you're on your
in your browser that to me is the sense
of confidence that it builds is huge you
know same thing for same same thing for
Google Docs and even Microsoft has
gotten the message with this stuff you
know with a lot of what they're doing I
mean they're running around like pimping
their
web services for iOS yeah I mean they're
telling developers our data solution in
the cloud is better than I just saw and
I just saw an ad that's like all about
that kind of like cross-platform singing
and it is they do kind of get it better
right you know and it's like Apple needs
to take a hard look at itself here I
mean there's also some security to I
mean you you know that Gmail is gonna
have your stuff you know even if your
app there's still this management of
contacts the way they do it seems so
hopelessly outdated to me now like I
never think about my contacts anymore
Google has gotten so good at just kind
of like figuring out who I contact like
adding the things I mean I add I do hand
ad people you know when necessary you
know getting rid of duplicates dealing
with email address multiple email
addresses and phone numbers I never
think about anymore the only time I ever
think about is if I ever have to open
address book on my computer which I sync
to Google and this creates all of these
like annoying sync problems and it's
like it really me needs to just work
more than it than it then it just works
I think Apple needs to become an
Internet company this is what this WWDC
should be about yes there have been a
very good computer company they've been
a really profitable computer company I
think the next stage of evolution and
the computing industry is about the
internet they've got on tangle the web
yeah it's kind of crazy if you look at
icloud.com they've got untangle the web
Ellis yeah if you look at iCloud comm
and you see the icons for those apps
yeah you're like am I looking at the
internet right now you know they try to
make iCloud feel and act and look like a
desktop app right and and that's like
the craziest mistake of all is that is
that thinking that that what's happening
in your at this moment at least what's
happening inside of your browser should
just be 100% the same as what happens on
your native apps you know I think that I
think yeah look and feel is fine but it
shouldn't be all about like trying to
trick people into thinking that they're
using a native app it should be like
what's best for that environment what
makes the most sense you know and I
think that um that's a minor issue
that's a design issue I have much less
of an issue with there you know it's
funny we're talking with this earlier
but people say apples design you know
there's an article in the journal of I
think about them doing more flat design
or Johnny I've it's like I'm not you
know the stitch leather is annoying and
stupid and in the stuff where it's like
you know the skew
that's killer a mutt as much as the the
function so frustrating this is Google's
happen iOS but it's there there's
nothing more frustrating to me than when
I get the Gmail notification on my phone
and then I open Gmail and it just sits
there loading yeah and I'm like I know I
can read half of this email a
notification center and I'm waiting for
this app to like to load it I mean why
didn't what it's not that the
notifications look bad that they're they
interfere with the top of your yeah
display this is our number one pet well
that's what it's one that I find
incredibly this is I think it's crazy
bizarre know about there a notification
it's that and it's also that's right and
also you know things like they're
sharing panel that they had created yes
it is ugly but what's more frustrating
is that it doesn't share the way I want
to write you know it's like adding a
photo to an email is still a
ridiculously silly process right you
know it's like it's like it's not so
much that your stuff looks bad I think
it looks fine honestly keep it the way
it looks make it work better like make
the function this is the to the iCloud
thing it's like the apps look fine the
service is at its fundamental at a
fundamental level
it's basically good ideas mm-hmm and it
looks fine it just doesn't work the way
you want it to work that its way should
work developers and customers I think
that's what's the fix else what I got to
do and we got a wrap up because we're
doing I'm hearing from the developers is
that one they want some communication
from Apple hey are you guys actually
fixing this or is this something that
you're kind of leaving over here if
people want to use it you're gonna let
it be or and they're saying oh if you're
not doing anything get rid of it you
know get rid of it like you got rid of
RSS or iWeb just yeah you know leave it
out of the picture because if it's in
the picture our users will demand it
right right and or they could step it up
and double their team I mean they have
billions of dollars to hire another guy
yeah higher to
what he's he's really really good you
know these developers they love Apple
and they want this all to work so badly
and you know I mean when you look at the
support forums it's a lot of people
complaining and it's a lot of developers
helping fellow developers yeah and like
they want to make it work
devs helping devs devs look at that look
now you use so much passion and and
emotion talking about these developers
what he's been hearing their pain I know
you know you can tell he really loves
these guys he really feels for their for
their plight I do and I do through you I
also feel for them I feel from nothing
please help please help these guys Apple
just help them out they're drowning yeah
you and your shoveling water onto them
and you know what's not too bad but they
they don't treat the developers like
they treat us but it's something similar
it's something like we can't really talk
about that or due to you know stay tuned
or something like that right and they
get a share information with developers
see you'd think they might in a little
way and terms of the underlying framing
worse about for many years I would not
think that they would share information
with anybody or just be like I mean
there's they're very they keep it you
know they like to keep it under lock and
keep so they're ready to talk about it
yeah yeah which is understandable but
but for developers you would want a
little more transparency a problem right
mm-hmm
do we've any other topics we're done
that's it intent really short traffic we
should have at least one other thing to
talk about then something else happen
