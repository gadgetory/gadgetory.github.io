are looking at the razor stargazer
which is a webcam you don't see many
people do separate webcams these days
this one's kind of cool and so it's
using the intel realsense 3d camera
which is a set of cameras at the top
here and for gamers obviously this razor
so for gamers this is kind of key and so
you can see there's an outline behind me
and if I move around it sort of clips
out of the background and to do that at
the moment you kind of need software if
you're going to do a twitch stream or
some of that the realsense camera does
that automatically does all the
processing on the chip so it does all
the processing for taking away this this
background behind me just on the actual
unit itself and so it doesn't take away
anything too much from your CPU or GPU
which is obviously key to gamers and the
other stuff this does is you're going to
be able to use gestures so because it's
a real sense camera and Rayce is able to
do some cool software tricks with it and
one of them is gestures so if I raise my
hand up in the air like this you'll see
that doter will start launching and
there's a bunch of different gestures
for that so you can launch games and
stuff I think in the future they're
probably gonna be looking towards
integrating this within the actual games
themselves so you could write if you've
got different loadouts for characters or
a bit to wave your hands around and load
mob stuff it's cool it's a neat little
trick and we'll see where it goes</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
