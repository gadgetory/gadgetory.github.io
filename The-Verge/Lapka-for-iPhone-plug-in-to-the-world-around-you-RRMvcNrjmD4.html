checking out Lepke launching on December
11th it's a personal environment monitor
for your iPhone that helps you see
things like radiation around you or how
organic piece of fruit is in real human
ways and not in hard to understand
scientific numbers
Lepke comes with a free app from the app
store that lets you measure all the
different kinds of things you can check
out around you so the first thing you
can do is plug it in using the headphone
jack just like you're using a square
card reader and as soon as you plug it
in we plugged in the radiation meter to
begin with you can actually see the
different presets for like what might be
comfortable for you know on a plane
where you might see a lot of radiation
or for a baby where you might want even
less radiation so you can actually see
this animation at the bottom shows an
actual representation of the radiation
around you so we're in the clear here
with green but you know if you were in
bad shape it would be red the next
census we're going to look at is the
humidity and temperature meter which
aims to show you if you are in a
comfortable location to be working or
sleeping or have your have your baby in
a comfortable room so you can select
between Celsius and Fahrenheit so we'll
pick Fahrenheit here so once again you
have these presets for different types
of places you might want to be and you
tap this to start measuring once the
reading is complete you can see we're at
29% relative humidity and the
temperature is 70 degrees Fahrenheit up
here so it's pretty comfortable if you
swipe to the side here you also have
your exact location of where you are so
you can keep track and create a map the
next census we're going to look at
measures how organic your food is based
on the electrical conductivity which
heavenly measures the amount of nitrogen
in the food that comes from cheap
fertilizers and stuff like that so
ideally there'd be no electrical
conductivity but there might be so you
pop that off which is a nice little
magnetic clasp and you are going to
straight up pierce the Apple right here
so the results are in we have eight
point one milligrams per liter of
nitrogen in this Apple which is pretty
good if you want to share your results
you can use this little arrow right here
to mail your findings to a friend
once they click this link they can see
that exact animation and your exact
measurements that you found right there
on their computer
the last sensor we're checking out
detects electromagnetic fields high
frequency and low frequency around you
so you plug it in it instantly pops up
and here's the meter right here so based
on where you hold this you're gonna get
different results right now you can see
the electromagnetic fields are pretty
low but if you do something like hold
this out the window where there cell
signals and all sorts of stuff flying
around it's gonna be a lot higher so
while the electromagnetic fields might
not be that strong over in the office
how about in front of the microwave
let's give it a shot and just like that
Lepke knows once you start measuring
your surroundings every day or every few
days lab code captures all this stuff so
you can look at it again and share it so
you can swipe through your days like
this and the name of the day is actually
depending on the types of results you're
getting Lepke launches today in the
United States for two hundred and twenty
dollars and soon elsewhere it starts
with these four sensors but the company
is hoping to expand to other things like
measuring your air quality to make your
life a little bit more fun and
scientific in an accessible way</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
