and I'm here with John from BlueStacks
and he's gonna talk was through Android
on a Windows 8 so as you can see here
we've got the Windows 8 Metro UI and
Android apps inside of it this is coming
out later this year and the announcement
today from BlueStacks is that we've
cracked running Android apps in the
Windows ecosystem so we're bringing
400,000 apps to Windows 8 which is a big
improvement over I guess where it is at
least this moment so here we're in drag
racing very popular Android app so you
know 1.3 billion pcs out there no one's
ever played drag racing bigger than just
big on a phone so it's pretty big
implications there as you can see you
know touch is really responsive and
Windows 8 and we're not only touched you
know like I said all in ones desktops
ultrabooks
there you go so that's drag racing our
compatibility in our beta which is
coming out in February right now our
alpha is available for download the beta
is coming out in February compatibility
for beta is way high it's around 90% a
lot of the things that don't work are
like you know things that are built for
a phone specifically you having to do
with dialing and ringtones and stuff
like that even accelerometer we have a
you know something where it shows you
the sort of angle of your device and you
can actually play accelerometer apps
really nicely and it's gonna come in the
window still in favor yes there will be
something in the Windows Store and in
the main kind of channel that people
download bluestacks it is a Windows
program and installs like any other
Windows program and will in Windows 8 as
well is via our website BlueStacks comm
we're also announcing a relationship
with in-home which is a Taiwanese om
they have an ultrabook coming out a
Windows 7 ultra book in March and a
Windows 8 older book late in the year
that will come pre-loaded with
BlueStacks and we're talking with a lot
of the bigger players right now about
pre-loading this that when you get your
your win 7 or win 8 all-in-one ultrabook
whatnot tablet it's just got everything
there as you can see even in the Windows
7 look right there's much our UI and
there's Windows 7 you'll have an Android
apps folder you know the big thing for
us when the beta comes out in February
and by the time our Windows 8 edition of
BlueStacks comes out it's just making it
really easy to understand for the
average user non-techie who doesn't want
to setup you know fancy emulator it's
very intuitive so you can just open your
Android apps folder and there they are
just like Windows programs ok so is it
gonna be a way for you to sync apps
absolutely that's a really critical part
of this so we have something on
BlueStacks Cloud Connect well and it's
an Android app you can get it in the
Android Market you know and whether you
have an Android tablet or phone and you
can actually do this now with our alpha
version but it'll be even easier in our
beta in February and on 1-8 you just
download the app and it says ok Tom here
are the apps on your Android device
which ones do you want to use in
BlueStacks on your PC you tick the boxes
are the ones you want you hit sync
that's all there is to it when you get
to your PC you know right in front of
you or thousand miles away
your pc which has moose tax installed as
a normal Windows program gets that and a
little thing comes up in your sister
that says Angry Birds has been installed
cut the ropes and install and you can
just play them and later in the year
we'll be able to even sync the data
between so if you're halfway through cut
the rope on the plane and you get home
your Windows PC interns Yuma you build a
resume in full-screen absolutely</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
