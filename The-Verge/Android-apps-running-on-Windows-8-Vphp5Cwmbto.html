I'm here with John from BlueStacks and
he's going to talk was free Android on a
Windows 8 so as you can see here we've
got the windows 8 metro UI and Android
apps inside of it this is coming out
later this year and the announcement
today from BlueStacks is that we've
cracked running Android apps in the
windows ecosystem so we're bringing
400,000 apps to Windows 8 which is a big
improvement over I guess where it is at
least this moment so here we're in drag
racing very popular Android app so you
know 1.3 billion pcs out there no one's
ever played drag racing bigger than few
inches big on a farm so it's pretty big
implications there as you can see you
know touch is really responsive and
windows 8 and we're not only touched you
know like i said all-in-ones desktops
ultrabooks
there you go so that's drag racing our
compatibility in our beta which is
coming out in February right now our
alpha is available for download the beta
is coming out in February compatibility
for beta is way high it's around ninety
percent a lot of the things that don't
work are like you know things that are
built for a phone specifically having to
do with dialing and ringtones and stuff
like that even accelerometer we have a
you know something where it shows you
the sort of angle of your device that
you can actually play accelerometer apps
really nicely and it's going to come in
the window still in favor yes there will
be something in the Windows Store and in
the main kind of channel that people
download bluestacks it is a windows
program installs like any other windows
program and will in Windows 8 as well is
via our website BlueStacks com we're
also announcing a relationship with
in-home which is a Taiwanese OEM they
have an ultrabook coming out a windows 7
ultrabook in March and a Windows 8
ultrabook late in the year that will
come pre-loaded with BlueStacks and
we're talking with a lot of the bigger
players right now about preloading this
so that when you get your your win seven
or win 8 all-in-one ultrabook whatnot
tablet it's just got everything there as
you can see even in the windows 7 look
right there's much are you I and there's
windows 7 you'll have an android apps
folder you know the big thing for us
when the beta comes out in February and
by the time our windows 8 edition of
BlueStacks comes out it's just making it
really easy to understand for the
average user non-techie who doesn't want
to set up you know fancy emulator it's
very intuitive so you can just open your
Android apps folder and there they are
just like Windows programs okay so is it
going to be a way for you to sync apps
absolutely that's a really critical part
of this so we have something on
BlueStacks Cloud Connect and it's an
android app you can get it in the
android market you and whether you have
an Android tablet or phone and you can
actually do this now with our alpha
version but it'll be even easier in our
beta in February and on 18 you just
download the app and it says okay Tom
here are the apps on your Android device
which ones do you want to use in
BlueStacks on your PC you tick the boxes
of the ones you want you hit sink that's
all there is to it when you get to your
PC you know right
on the newer thousand miles away your pc
which has boo stacks installed as a
normal windows program gets that and a
little thing comes up in your sister
that says Angry Birds has been installed
cut the ropes been installed and you
could just play them and later in the
year will be able to even sync the data
between so if you're halfway through cut
the rope on the plane and you get home
your Windows PC it's resumen you'll be
able to resume it full screen absolutely</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
