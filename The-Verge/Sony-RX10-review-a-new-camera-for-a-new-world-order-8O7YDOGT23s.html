sony rx10 it's hard to describe what
this camera is on one hand it's a lot
like a DSLR it looks like one with a big
grip a big lens and a viewfinder at
$1,299 it's priced like one two but it
doesn't have interchangeable lenses or a
big sensor or dials and buttons
everywhere but it doesn't matter it's
fantastic it has a carl zeiss lens with
a 24 to 200 millimeter equivalent zoom
at a bright f 2.8 the whole way I've
never seen a lens quite like this and
it's well-suited to shooting everything
from portraits to sports the only
trouble it ever caused me was trying to
quickly zoom in and out since it's all
done electronically it's a little slow
to shift even if you use the manual zoom
ring but it has really solid macro
performance it's sharp across the entire
image and it allows for a really
spectacular range of shots it's become
my go-to camera for letting people who
don't know anything about photography
the rx10 almost never takes a bad
picture it occasionally over exposes
shots but it has beautiful colors
accurate lighting and metering and
produces genuinely gorgeous photos
nearly every time its ability to take
shots in low-light with soft backgrounds
and with high dynamic range is
completely unlike any point-and-shoot
I've ever used other than Sony's own rx
100 which actually has the same 1-inch
20.2 megapixel sensor as the rx 10 it's
able to shoot comfortably up to ISO 3200
and even higher if you're putting your
photos on Facebook and not a billboard
there's some software noise reduction
happening here and I wound up with some
really soft photos in really terrible
light but the fast by ons X processor
mostly helps a lot I had to work hard to
find a shot the RX 10 couldn't handle
its autofocus is its only real problem
most of the time it's really fast but it
often hunts too much or just completely
guesses wrong and takes a blurry shot
it's especially bad when it's fully
zoomed in and it did cost me a few great
pictures but luckily only a few I should
say that the RX 10 is really not
comparable to even a mid-range DSLR the
cheaper Canon t5i with the right lens
will take sharper pictures and do better
in low light and a camera like that
gives you so much more room to grow into
photography as well
this camera is what it is but for some
people that's a good thing for people
who want that the size of the rx 10 is
going to be its only real drawback the
weatherized leathery magnesium body
weighs almost two pounds and it's almost
six inches thick with the huge lens
retracted this camera is not fitting in
your pocket that's what the rx100 is for
but what you get in return is that
you zoom range and enough manual control
that you can definitely make the rx10 do
exactly what you want there's a 3-inch
LCD on the back which tilts up or down
and lets you shoot from either above
your head or below your waist an
electronic viewfinder with all the same
advantages you can see lots of
information without taking your eye away
and disadvantages it's just not as
accurate as an optical viewfinder as any
other but I'm coming around to evey F's
and Sony's really is one of the best
there's also a dedicated button for
recording video which you can do with
one tap from anywhere on the camera
video looks great and sounds great too
though it does take a slightly finer
touch you can shoot 1080p up to 60
frames per second and everything is
clear and sharp but the cameras noise
cancellation and image stabilization can
both be kind of rough the zoom is super
smooth though and does a nice job of
keeping focus as you go there are little
nods to convenience everywhere
Sony knows exactly who's going to buy
this camera dr extend charges via micro
USB and does so a little slower than I'd
like but it means you'll never have
trouble finding a charging cable for the
camera there's a built-in flash an
easily accessible SD card slot and a
standard hotshoe even the interface is
simple burying all but the most common
settings where they can't possibly hurt
you it turns on in less than three
seconds has almost no shutter lag and
shoots about two shots per second in
standard mode many of the people
upgrading to the rx 10 will be coming
from cell phone cameras so Sony built
Wi-Fi and NFC into the camera itself you
can control the shutter share pictures
and change settings right from your
phone that's nice but the implementation
here is rough Sony's PlayMemories app is
ugly and overly simple and it just
doesn't work that well but that doesn't
really matter because everything else
about the RX 10 works so well it takes
great pictures whether you're insanely
close up or incredibly far away it takes
great video - and it does it all without
you needing to do much of anything
except point-and-shoot the really killer
thing is that it's so expensive at
twelve hundred nine dollars it's really
only going to work for photographers
looking for a versatile second camera or
people who don't know or want to know
anything about photography but have some
money to burn but Sony knows that most
people who buy DSLRs never take off the
kit lens and many of those people would
be much happier with in rx 10 and while
point-and-shoot cameras may deserve to
be dying cameras like the RX 10 first
little shooters that take great pictures
in auto and even better with some effort
might just be the future
