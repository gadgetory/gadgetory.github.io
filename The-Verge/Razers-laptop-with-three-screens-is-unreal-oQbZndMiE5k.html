probably the biggest reason why we come
to CES is to see some hints of the
future even if it's a completely
unrealistic and unfathomable product
today and one of those at CES 2017 is
raised as a project Valarie prototype
it's a 17 inch laptop which also happens
to have a second 17 inch screen and fill
at 17 inch screen because why how now
this takes the 17 inch razor blade Pro
which is a three thousand six hundred
dollar laptop and adds two extra 17-inch
displays with its own suspects this is
literally the razor blade Pro that was
introduced late last year you have the
latest in two CPU in there you have the
latest Nvidia graphics card in there
it's all K of resolution perfectly fluid
frame rates it is just a prototype from
Razer they're collecting feedback from
people and in fact this one that I'm
playing on right now isn't really the
final look of it it's just the
functional prototype to show that it
does actually work
what razor tells me is that once you
open up the laptop if we can pull out a
laptop the two displays will articulate
automatically to the side and then it
just pop out like this and if you want
to angle them in so you have kind of
like a curved monitor look you can do
that if you want to have them flat like
this you can also do that so playing
around in battlefield I'll do find that
all of my attention is focused on the
center screen as it would usually be and
I have to essentially force myself to
use the left and the right screens I'm
not yet feeling any battlefield
advantage to having those but I think it
also might be a matter of habit
what I can say is in a game like doctor
2 which is my favorite game you would
get literally an unfair advantage by
being able to so much more of the map a
couple of things I've noticed one is
that the keyboard gets super hot when
you get into playing because after what
we did is driving such a high resolution
and has
all of those chips and performance
inside so you probably wanted a sternal
keyboard you will want a sternal Mouse
for that being said from the Razer play
Pro you still get this really gorgeous
mechanical keyboard with this thing if
you're not somebody who's into
battlefield one this is - a pretty
kick-ass setup if you want to do some
sort of manspreading at your local
Starbucks you know I use a whole bunch
of desktops on my macbook well here I
have three desktops I don't need to
switch between them at all just imagine
having an Excel spreadsheet open across
all of this you just have column and
column and column and which is zero
scrolling so frankly this is a great
business machine as well as a gaming
machine now I say that I'm using the
present tense that it is but as far as
I'm concerned this doesn't really exist
yet
my bracelet isn't announcing a new
release date is announcing any price for
this so this one works and outside
behind glass Razer has one that shows
how it's supposed to look but the look
and the engineering haven't yet really
come together
so again excels pressure enthusiasts
battlefield enthusiasts people who want
free desktops without having to toggle
between them get in touch with racers
tell them to make this because Ray's the
CEO is a gaming enthusiast at heart he
likes to give people what they want even
if it's ten thousand twenty thousand
dollar laptop such as this creation so
there's enough interest Razer will build
it
no no need it is that's our board oh
that's the point</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
