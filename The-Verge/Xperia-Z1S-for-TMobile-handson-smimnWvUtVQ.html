and this is the Sony Xperia z1s for
tmobile the Xperia z1s is pretty much
the US version of the Xperia z1 that was
launched internationally a couple of
months ago it features a 5-inch 1080p
display it's powered by Snapdragon 800
quad-core processor and it runs Android
4.3 with Sony's custom software on top
of that it's got a very similar design
to the Xperia Z which was released in
2013 but it's a little bit more refined
and it's a little bit more rounded and
bit more comfortable to hold and it's
ever so slightly larger than the earlier
model it still has so many signature
things like the power button here in the
volume rocker on the side the z1s also
has a dedicated camera key and the new
headphone jack is now waterproof so you
don't need a cover on top of it if you
get the phone wet the waterproofing is a
little bit better as well it's ip58
rated so you can go about four and a
half feet deep and still be able to use
the phone to its full functions what's
really interesting about the z1s is its
new camera it's got a 20 megapixel
camera sensor and a new sony g lens as
the f 2 point 0 aperture and sony claims
it's the best camera on any waterproof
phone on the market it's the same camera
as on the z1 but it's still a
significant upgrade over the Xperia z1
of the new camera apps is called
background defocus it lets you take a
picture of a close-up object and
artificially blur the background using
software Sony and TMO will be launching
this on january twenty seconds but
pre-sales will be going on about a week
earlier than that and that was a look at
the sony xperia z1s for t-mobile
