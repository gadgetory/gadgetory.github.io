Patel and this will be 90 seconds of
personal disruption with five by five
Stan Benjamin okay Japan's third largest
wireless carrier Softbank is in advanced
talks to buy the US as third largest
carrier sprint according to Reuters the
discussions involved softbank purchasing
majority stake more than twelve point
eight billion dollars tanya is
interesting is sprint is rumored to be
making a counteroffer from MetroPCS
which is currently in talks to merge
with t-mobile USA it's a really weird
time for US carriers Samsung's Galaxy s3
mini is now official it's also
officially the completely wrong name
though smaller than the s3 proper the
mini still has a 4-inch screen
everything about the phone feels dated
in fact the specs are decidedly last gen
the cameras are downgraded most
surprisingly evolved it lacks any LTE
support there's no price there's no
release date and honestly there's no
reason to care finally a google is
updated over a quarter million miles of
Street View Road images the company is
calling it the largest ever upgrade to
the service increasing coverage in the
US Great Britain Italy Sweden and others
apple just updated its highly criticized
maps as well so it's increased
competition is only gonna be good for
consumers that's it for today's top
stories tune in tomorrow when this
disturbing nightmare finally comes to an
end okay so it's a whole party that's
happening right how's it going man do
you want to do this last one dude you
stand right there everybody all right
ready</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
