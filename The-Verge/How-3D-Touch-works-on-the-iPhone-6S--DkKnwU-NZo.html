this is the all-new iPhone 6s and the
most important feature on the iPhone
success to me is this new thing called
3d touch and basically what it means is
that the screen on the iPhone is now
pressure sensitive which gives you a
bunch of options to do cool weird things
so for example in the messaging app you
can press a little bit hard on a link
and it will pop up a little preview
window of the webpage and then you can
just lift your finger off and it goes
away you can do the same thing with an
address and it pops up a little preview
of maps or you can press harder in and
it actually opens up the maps app so
that's called peek and pop you can peek
at the thing that's being linked to or
you can pop into the full thing the same
idea works in say email so if I'm
looking at my inbox I can peek at an
email address by pressing a little bit
and then I can pop into the email the
other thing that you can do is you can
peek at a thing and then you can slide
up to see a bunch of options so on this
email I can reply I can forward or I can
like flag the email for later so let's
peek and pop but there are a few other
things that you can do so for example in
photos if you take a photo it will
actually show you a second of movement
before and after if you hard press on
the photo so here's just a picture of
Jake but if I hard press on it there's a
little moment before and after I took
the photo which is kind of fun it also
works with live wallpapers so you can
have your wallpaper and if you push down
on it you can see this fish move which
is kind of fun and there's a few other
random spots so if you're in a text
entry field you can hard press on the
keyboard and all of a sudden it the
keyboard goes away and you have a cursor
and you can move the cursor around and
place it exactly where you want so you
don't have to try and get it exactly
right with your finger and then I guess
the last thing is if you like swipe over
from the left hand side of the screen
and you do it really hard it'll actually
jump you into multitasking which makes
it you know a little bit more - to jump
around there but one of my favorite
features is 3d touch on the home screen
you can hard press on the icons and get
shortcuts inside the app so if a hard
press on Safari I can go straight to my
reading list but hard press on the
camera I can take a selfie because
obviously I want to do that
and you can even hard press on messages
to get a direct link into a conversation
with somebody that you just talked to so
let's basically it right now for 3d
touch and it's a lot and what I like
about it is it's consistent when you
press on something you peek at it and
then you can push it harder to see it
and it's consistent across messages and
email and so on the thing we don't know
is if it will be consistent when
third-party apps start supporting it I
hope they do because the idea of peek
and pop is a really intuitive and it
really makes a phone feel a lot better</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
