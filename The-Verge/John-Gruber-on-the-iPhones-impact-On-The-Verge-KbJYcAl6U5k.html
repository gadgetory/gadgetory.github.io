everybody says and I think what we've
seen over the last however many years I
mean since he's been back at Apple it
does seem that he was if not the sole
person responsible for many of these
amazing devices the iPad the iPhone he
was a real driving force right I mean he
was he was putting pieces together that
other people weren't putting together do
you agree or disagree with that yeah I
think he I think he saw the world
differently and I don't think anybody no
can really understand that especially
you know where he saw a technology going
and he was right about a lot of things
he really was I mean and sometimes it's
arrogant and obviously you know he had
this binary view of everything was
either Qui Qui swear sure all right
everything was either shit or the best
thing ever
right there's a total shit or it's the
best thing ever and there was like no
ground in between it was like somebody's
great or they're a bozo it's blowing
right and so like for example like when
he said in 2007 at the iPhone
introduction that were five years ahead
of everybody else I I was blown away I
was in the audience and I still it was
it was that one there's tears no but I
was I was the one was anybody there near
you crying no no but people people were
having fits right I mean no yeah it's a
really good intro yeah if you have you
if the people if anybody here has not
seen Steve Jobs introducing the first
iPhone it is kind of amazing yeah if you
want to see how to introduce a product
this is like it may never get better
than it it's the one product
introduction that Apple did that
actually was the one that everybody
wants them to do every time where they
blow your mind away right and everyone
else about that everyone before that you
know was not like that and everyone
since then I think you've been like he
wasn't like that yeah or even the iPad
which you know is arguably just as
important to Apple going forward as the
iPhone the iPad launch was actually kind
of weird yeah somber yeah and there was
a period where Jobs was I don't know if
you guys remember but in the iPad the
first iPad launch he sat down and he was
just browsing right and there was a long
period where he's like now I'm gonna go
check out the New York Times it
loke out I'm gonna look at Flickr right
it was tap and go just like that like
him just talking about what he was doing
and he was just browsing yeah it was it
was look it was it went on like the
reaction afterwards was there was an
awful lot of that's it it's just a big
iPod touch yeah right or its yet whereas
nobody was disappointed by the iPhone I
mean yeah the thing was nobody was
disappointed everybody was like holy
crap you know and famously that the rim
had a meeting like two days later where
they like went over and they're like
they must be lying that's not possible
right I mean that's well there's a
somebody who worked at rim claimed that
they had but the reactions from the
industry from other people in the
industry around that launch were
hilarious right Palme was like in the
guide called it was like you're not just
gonna come in here and make a phone
we've been working on this for you
everybody was like huh beef you guys
aren't just gonna the right come right
in everybody's attitude in the industry
who is making phones acted like we're
not worried about this at all right and
then he did a couple of years everybody
was like are we are now going out of
business thanks to the iPhone right well
just looking quote it's one of my
all-time favorites but probably the most
quoted thing I've done repeatedly just I
should reblog it right now shake oh wow
your son here the but that the it was
right before like a month before I was
like December 2006 like a month before
the iPhone comes out nobody knew what
the iPhone was like but the fever-pitch
of Apple is going to do a phone was at
that point we were saying well they've
got to do it now right and Ed Colligan
that was then the CEO of Palm said peace
we're not worried PC guys aren't just
gonna come right in and whatever but
it's kind of in it because he was so
wrong so wrong but the most interesting
is that he was wrong in a very important
way which is that the way phones have
evolved since that day is that they're
now computers right there's no denying
it that that all the top phones are
computers there's computers that are
more powerful than our laptops from
maybe eight years ago eight nine years
ago
yeah and so you've got to be a PC guys
it's like it's the could not have been
it was wrong not just that Apple was
going to do well but wrong about what it
was gonna mean to make up but they were
always going to be these siloed devices
that were meant to do one thing
not to do all this alright</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
