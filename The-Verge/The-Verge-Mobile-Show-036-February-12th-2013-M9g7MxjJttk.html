dan seifert as always this is episode 35
for the week of februari 11th and here
we are that's how and I love my base
compare it I thought I'd give it a more
traditional you're just supposed to do
your name now you throughout my whole
cadence I'm not a similar I it to be
fair I throughout the whole cadence by
saying my name before anything else yeah
that that's you know that's never going
to get the openers right you're not a
seasoned opener veteran like dieter is
who is not with us this week this is
true yeah for Chase who's done it
perfectly so far as theta just by being
essence yeah dieter is a covering an
event today so unfortunately he's not
with us strut it we have us three and
we're going to talk about lots of fun
things like how cold it is and the fact
that it's like the middle would turn
really over it yes I would like to point
out that i am wearing two hoodies today
put one right here good another one
right there and I know these message
Sony headphones what's up it just women
isn't London whether a lot like Pacific
Northwest whether it's kind of like it
never gets super cold in the winter
right and you don't get a ton of snow
right but if you live in long enough
temperatures like zero degrees do you
tend to feel soon go to you anyway right
zero Celsius not freedom units 0 0
degree commie units yeah it's like 41
freedom units here today so it's
actually pretty warm but I'm still
freezing for whatever reason that's 29
here and and somebody is moving out of
my building so like you know the door in
the lobby has been open all day and
there's just this continual blast of 30
degree air coming into my unit through
the cracks in the door so if I if I
either die or
or start shivering uncontrollably during
the episode that's why how do you don't
wear it like every single every single
door that leads out of my apartment I've
covered up with towels oh yeah wait I
thought they were called flats there
what's the difference between a flat in
an apartment the difference is me cheesy
woods okay thank you oh there's no
there's no technical difference it's
Vlad's mood yeah no no difference
whatsoever the other thing is that
there's a split-level flats so slow and
technically just flat piece of property
oh so do you know what amazing it is I'm
not familiar with a Wyland I know what
raises an aunt a raisinet yeah I've had
raised notes before now amazing
maisonette no I've not had amazing that
I'm sure mispronouncing it it's is when
you have your own entrance to the street
into your apartment wait flat well mazen
is French for house right yeah amazing
and being like a small house a little
house a little house and there's your
French lesson for the day there is
you're pressing for the day here's a
question how do you say mobo in French
uh yeah it's not handy that's German a
lameo lead I don't say I'd say let's ask
our chat room but sigh accurately no
more chats I indeed um so uh I guess
let's talk about the news ah what little
news there is and yeah we're in this
like no man's land right now I think
I've said this the past couple episode
35 s that you know we're in between
major events there aren't really any
major announcements that are happening
because everyone saving it for their own
event or for mwc or whatever so it's
like these this kind of rumor land that
we live in uh and you know let's get
right off with it with rumors uh this
week we saw another m7
come out which I don't know if we wrote
about it but it is very similar to the
first alleged m7 device that we saw hit
the internet a few weeks ago which looks
very similar to an iphone 5 and it's got
a two grills on the front of it that
appear to be speakers of some sort all
right and it completely contradicts the
second set of pictures that looks more
like an HTC 8x so there's kind of like
some drama going on here right with
these rumors you know I have to say you
mentioned the first rumour / leaked
looking like a an iphone 5 and I thought
so at first as well but then Josh said
hey that looks kind of like a z10 and I
totally see it now that I cuz I've seen
I've seen pictures of the white z10 and
I totally see it yeah idea right a lot
of people say the z10 look like the
iphone 5 thing at this point I think
we're kind of way way over analyzing
this like their big slabs of course
weights of plastic or metal walls
monitor is around side I mean I find
this the one with big fence or the big
openings at front speaker holes or
whatever they are fascinating because
usually you can have those big ones for
the earpiece yes most of the time you
only like a small space for the ETS but
HTC particular those would be like a
horizontal bar yeah perforations but
having that at the top and at the bottom
of the phone puzzle makes a kind of more
symmetrical which might not be a good
thing for recognizing which ways up but
then also is like quite weird random I
mean what are we looking at it is this
going to be like the stereo speakers set
up big multimedia device uh yeah I don't
know um only somebody just mirror
the top in Photoshop I still think
there's at least a chance that it's
going to end up looking like the the
second I mean who knows like well there
you know many of our listeners are
probably familiar with this Twitter
account of leaks which has established
itself as one of the the predominant
leakers of phones on the internet and
and that account is saying that the the
original image is accurate it's just
it's so weird to me like it's it's such
a dramatic departure from what I'm used
to HTC devices looking like whereas the
other one is less of a departure so but
hey I mean after Santa funds google home
for you Chris it is after Samsung's uh
intentional very intentional deception
leading up to the launch of the gs3 I
would believe anything at this point yes
that's true which we showed you romaji
Samson's launch of the galaxy free this
was you know perhaps the best kept
secret so the Android pleasure devices
for a long time get accessory and then
in the action or event equine actually
had people walking around with the phone
in their hands trying to be discreet but
still you know carrying the girls
history around at the launch event
before they've announced it which to me
was just such a dumb move because legacy
Chris I can't remember the
misinformation being spread so nicely
and so well is Sam something with
against it's free but we had at least
three borderline credible looks for a
new state or so you know again a big
slab of course which plastic or metal
around the sides of it and we're just
being jaded they use the code will make
it whatever it is but I'm with that feel
like this is such an underwhelming
period in our lives
hadn't I like nothing is hurting or
exciting what do you want a phone to
look like glad do you want it to be like
the beats logo do you want HTC make like
a giant be with that would that be would
that satisfy you nobody yeah he's a good
example for me which is the novo that
hybrid device whose names case with the
moment um but you've got it another yoga
it's a tablet that plugs in it becomes a
laptop and you can essentially slot in
the tablet one way and select top slot
it in the other way then it's really
thick tablet we can't work with people
with it was suddenly they showed up at
CES again hybrid devices we've had them
before and we'll see things over yoga
and the sous Tai Chi which is one of
those things that was announced like
eight or nine months ago we vector
context I'll see it was really on sale
anywhere so we've got all of these
hybrid devices without tops and yet this
the helix that's one think I need us and
yet the helix still feels very much
fresh it is doing something rigid it
isn't something holding you and I really
enjoyed it like I'm not sure that you
would necessarily improve my life over
that much but I just enjoyed the novelty
of it so and that's the other thing you
asked me how do you expect the phone
look well there's nothing inherent in a
phone where Ruby smartphone or any other
mobile device that says it needs to have
a screen or any several master screen or
needs to be dominated by screen like you
could use the free inch screen and do
something else with the rest of it then
you video comedy but you would have like
a blackberry from 2006 well I didn't say
stick of freaking keyboard on it but
like when what else would you do if you
I mean like even I just agree that a
blackberry from 2006 a blackberry from
2012 no difference there's no quitting I
exciting and Oh David you say you could
shrink the screen down and even
like to like three inches or something
absurd like I would love to see somebody
smarter than I come up with a smartphone
form factor that isn't just you know a
giant screen wrapped in plastic or metal
um I don't know what that would look
like it'd be kind of weird anyway
obviously uh you know the the form of
these things are the the necessity to
have a display like that kind of
dictates uh how much you can do with the
design and the fact that people want to
thin and light and you know such and
such but um I think they're the last
design that like really was like blew me
away is like just a design was when uh
in nokia release en9 and then they've
been using that design language for the
lumia series since then uh that was the
last you know hardware design was like
whoa that's some really awesome hardware
design that's actually looks different
it feels different it's just a different
experience you know what blew me away
was the Sony Tablet P which I i just
googled and it amazon is selling it
right now for 275 bucks man that's a
deal I know right like that that's not
much more than a nexus 7 and you're
running like honeycomb it's running 3.2
yeah okay there was such a hot potro I
think we should justify sex right now
give another system nothing has been up
swell of desire for people to hear us
talk about fast six well I mean what is
there to say I mean you like just sit
back how r said traitor and a movie
right uh well I pretty much know inside
scripts and maybe we can flake in not
good inconsequential as it is Vlad
you're looking at it completely wrong I
mean if you're looking for you know
great dialogue and a great script and a
non predictable storyline I mean you're
not looking at FS six but if you're
looking just like for a great movie
that's going to be like awesome on
the other level and have explosions and
and the rock or vin diesel like driving
out of an aircraft carrier or some sort
uh then you know fast six where it's at
dan i would challenge you on the on the
like not like interesting or complicated
plot thing i think that this is actually
going to be one of the most intellectual
movies of 2013 for and i'll tell you why
i'll tell you why because when you when
you watch them like a hook a cable like
they're driving along right and they
like hook a cable or something from the
car to the the giant cargo aircraft and
so and like somehow pull the wing down
and like cause it to crash and then Vin
Diesel of course comes out of the front
of the plane like breaking down the
physics of exactly how this car was able
to to cause this aircraft to crash is
going to take physicists generations to
compute in this there's going to be
major thesis papers written on exactly
the physics used in fast six examine I
love that justification like Essex is
going to stimulate scientific progress
yes Brenda purified policies for how the
hell they managed to make those thongs
happen yes finally you guys see it my
way that mean he doesn't make me sad and
I will say I hadn't seen complain about
fifth one Fast and the Furious Five
France viable then we got Sparkle yeah
that's why which is that Vin Diesel is
aging out and he hasn't actually had a
shirt off in a movie for a very long
time and he's not the same you know
imposing presence that he was back to
the base pitch black in his pee he
bulked up for the sixth one like if you
if you look at regular he's not he's up
clean d bhakta he's like yeah he's still
like hat he still like half the size of
the rock but buddy he's pretty big great
to me it's kind of like it's kind of
cheap because the rock is kept in shape
and you're like okay he thought he goes
and find somebody I can credit that and
expects of fireworks but yeah I think we
sound like well i'm just still keeping
big i'm sooo filling out of here
i'm hoping you guys do remember when I
was fit look all I'm saying is that if
you encountered Vin Diesel in a bar and
any took a beer bottle and and cracked
it on on the bar and came at you you
will get a weapon yes i will be afraid
you know with his bare even with his
bare hands you would probably wet wet
yourself is my guess I would I never
would stop joking very intensively the
opposite direction well there you go uh
yeah I look I'm just saying that that I
think that all of our viewers should see
this movie I think it's a very important
movie and it's and frankly this movie
that we're going to discuss a lot over
the coming weeks yes you know it's a
really important movie in the Canon of
you know our culture and you know our
time I think it's yeah really grab that
and speak to us and speak to the yes
exactly I over with you guys as soon as
we do episode 36 is when we start
talking about but is that my just
anticipated but right so for for our
viewers who are trying to catch up with
the series I do my standard
recommendation is that you watch one two
four and five and then save tokyo drift
for a separate viewing and i can't i
can't tell you why that's important
without spoiling anything but just just
know that like you want to watch Tokyo
Drift last and as yeah 1245 and then
watch six and then go back and watch
Tokyo Drift I think yell the very
positive fast and furious experience
like I keep thinking this is a joke and
increase
it's all I can see I can tell you this
if you do the as Chris recommended 1245
and you watch 3 afterwards that jump
from two to four you're not going to be
lost when you get to movie for because
you haven't seen a Tokyo Drift yet so
nice as long as I can go to the races
the narrative depth and the character
depth on format challenging this is no
use that instead of the challenge
business I should bring it back we're
just talking about form factors and
innovation LG today release the specs
for its new Optimus L Series to running
such exciting division but I managed to
track down some photos and they have
like a rainbow color around the home
screen and it could be rainbow we will
basically have any of you guys around
the hot button that's what I'm from say
so you can have like a rainbow pattern
you can read a yellow whatever else so
that's the Optimus L Series to coming to
them that we see it's exciting stuff
yeah it's guys just I just want to say
right now I don't want to be the guy
who's like take photos and present to be
excited about these things at mwc well
you know I think we've kind of had a few
discussions about this among members of
the team of the past few days the fact
that I think that this mwc with its kind
of going in the same direction at CES
right there all these men even the
premier me the premier manufacturers
want to have their own events to launch
their flagship devices if we're seeing
HTC do it later this month samsung
obviously is going to do X sleep it last
year and so so that they kind of opens
the door at mwc for interesting new
trends to emerge at CES one of those
trends was the emergence of a Chinese
players like hisense who are really
trying to break in to the US market and
my suspicion is that we're going to see
a lot more than
at at mwc I'm sure that huawei and ZTE
are going to factor prominently into the
narrative there we'll see I just don't
see it as being a show for for
traditional flagship launches anymore
totally agree yeah I feel like well wins
is a tea in trying to establish
themselves sticking to the same pattern
the one that this has a history and a
track record which is again hit the baby
shows hidden we bigger stuff so you know
CSM FPC etc but absolutely the big
brands the ones that feel confident in
their own name and their own ability to
attract press attention a breaking of I
mean HTC the boss he is the maid mwc its
absolute main event of the year fact it
just come to the VC in the strongest
possible fashion brought its finest
devices it was the droid incredible to
believe what the incredible 22 years ago
and the HTC Flyer those are too weak
devices I was just going to say I could
I couldn't remember what was to pick up
let's understand why people do you know
so bad but fire like I think he was a
big old chunky thing but it was super
robust I know because I dropped it a few
times it scratched it okay okay I mean
fact I think we know that you know
robustness does not make for a great
tablet experience that's like what are
the smallest factors when when that
launched didn't it launched with like
2.3 yeah yeah I'm pretty sure did it you
didn't have a honeycomb pain and anytime
so innocent who were back then any time
when WC two years ago we thought
honeycomb was the tablet OS to have well
outside of platform busy but it was like
if you want android on sample you have
to get high on the advocate for you yeah
you're not even you're not even in the
conversation without her name which is
laughable to think about yeah where is
uh we just discussed empathy right
very heavy phone so so we don't have
that one set up for it aside from I have
the fortunes of those divisive gun yes
each sees breaking off and now I'll be
Brent we really have so many 80 g hang
it up and LG is doing and the thing with
pre-announced again pre-empting itself
so glad Simon don't we see rose around
everything you know geez what is going
to be out in the open so already head is
I guess French bread you know guys like
Mozilla were doing keynote and maybe
we'll see something on firefox OS made
on that front yeah that's the thing over
the next 12 to 18 months we're going to
see this new a tidal wave of of players
who want to break into the smartphone
market in in weird or interesting waves
right we have we have Firefox OS we have
sailfish we have ubuntu and dividend
selfish what happened with those guys
they're there in the mix right there it
makes please just just kind of nervously
because we saw them have their launch
event you can go to build buzz and zip
silence is that I don't know haven't
might be parts of the face of yeah we're
just kind of well they have a trip to
ship the product yeah right Portia right
well not any fights have none of these
guys ever is so that's what I'm saying I
think that we're gonna see I don't even
know I have no concept of how this is
going to play out because it's kind of
unprecedented in the mobile business are
we have we have blackberry and and and
Windows Phone fighting for third place
but then right beneath them we have this
this entire ground swell of of companies
who are established and are doing
interesting things in other spaces who
want to break into the smartphone market
and they're doing it with a business
model that is fairly different from the
bigger guys right because all of these
all three of those platforms are are
very open and very free and so I think I
think that those are problem I guess is
that those are probably the biggest
threat to Android which is as popular as
it is globally only because
is it's free so it'll be very
interesting to see what percentage of
that end of the market those new players
can steal in the next couple years and
and you know which of them will survive
side out that all three will you know a
few carriers will throw their weight
behind one or two of them and then the
rest will fall by the wayside we've seen
Firefox let's get some traction with I
think telefonica and a bun to I'm sure
is going to get some pick up sailfish is
probably the the one that's on the
bubble right yeah and there's also Tizen
Tizen yeah i think you know Tizen of all
of them probably has the most support
from carriers and I know Samsung's been
spoken of Tyson as well so yeah but but
but the reason why Tyson has so much
carrier support is because it isn't it
isn't an operating system design for
consumers it's not bringing system
that's designed for carriers it's it's
in in many ways it's the successor to
the Lima foundation or limo or however
you pronounce it where it's you know
it's it's more about the infrastructure
underpinning the phone and then carriers
can do whatever the heck they want on
top of it and really the only
commonality between devices on different
carriers is the fact that they can all
run the same apps but the presentation
of the phone the capabilities of the
phone it very completely from carrier to
carrier and you'll you know you'll just
go to Vodafone and you'll get a you know
a phone that's running Vodafone OS but
really it's running Tizen Tizen isn't
even I mean they're not even looking at
tyson as being like a brand that
consumers are going to write that be
expected recognize yeah right because
but with these day shows CSM wcd the
only invitations were getting from tyson
is like come be our executives well are
you guys there and stuff but yeah
there's no event there's no major
announcement exactly chris says i don't
think they care to make a good super
facing pitch and to help the super
patient brand which to me is usually
seals the fate of this entire piece of
software because in the grand history of
mobile phones which includes epic such
as snake and
sake a precipice software mobile phone
ever day has never been a good piece of
carrier customization so well it's funny
because career customized OS this this
Tyson thing makes me think of what
Verizon used to do with its feature
phones and they all like you would buy a
phone from verizon and every single
photon the shelf rhian the same exact
operating system that was like any was
garbage it was well as terrible yeah and
it was roughly like right those were
flashlight yeah yeah I mean you probably
know better than I do it so like what
was actually running on them but like it
was like you could just drop one phone
and pick up another and yeah saxy menu
enough it is a nightmare it is terrible
yeah so it just makes me think that a
carrier is going to do that but would
like a line of smartphones it just right
kind of glad that I there is it at least
one exception to what you said I largely
agree with you most carrier
customization is complete garbage but
the one thing that I've always enjoyed
and t-mobile has never been keen on
pushing it is t is t mobile's you ma
whether you know you can just you know
it pretty much any phone in their lineup
I don't this is still the case but at
one time you could buy pretty much any
phone in the lineup and Blackberry
Android whatever and connect to Wi-Fi
and then you'd be making receiving calls
with your number over the Wi-Fi network
and not not using minutes and you know
you don't agree but reception and it's
great yeah I'm assuming that still the
case I I honestly haven't tried it I i
think it was on a per device basis it
wasn't every device that supported it
but it was like the you know the larger
or more popular models and I know they
pushed it on the blackberry models a lot
for whatever reason that is a very good
and very valid rebuttal Chris absolutely
that's about the only example I can
think of it as an assignment that I just
thought I just want to point any I don't
to return to the previous decade a bad
exactly 10 years ago and all I can say
is just as color screens are starting to
come in
we here in the UK when treated to some
of the most appalling software from
these carriers it was things like you
put up the phone and then you have to go
through this 15 second animation where
you get one frame a second of the o2
bubbles bubbling up it was like you do
it good this I mean and and Vodafone
like well it's there's still like that
you know like every time I'm in a movie
theater and it's a big theater and it's
packed and like you hear people start to
turn off their phones and I hate to
generalize it this way but it's
generally older people who might be in
the movie theater turning off their non
smartphones and you hear this light like
noise that's like obnoxiously loud and
you know their screen is like lit up
with some like bar animation from AT&amp;amp;T
as it shuts down on a prepaid phone and
it I don't know I don't know if we have
any Tim and Eric fans listening but
there there is an episode of awesome
show that is about the shutdown
animation and sound on cell phones where
Tim dies and eric is speaking at his
funeral and he goes to shut off his his
Cinco cell phone and it like it takes
like a minute and a half to shut down
and it's this ridiculous song it's it's
great but I'm guessing most of you have
no idea what I'm talking about so
nevermind I'm on your beat I'm on your
wavelength there is a this is the season
for us who got nothing to do is to NBC
comes around well I can tell you what
I'm doing I'm waiting for my nexus for
charging orb to arrive because I
actually had the ability to buy one this
week which is like amazing out of the
blue came out of nowhere Google throws
this thing up for sale for 59 99 yeah
cause like a billion dollars what why
after shipping and tax it cost me $71
which is insane because it's generally
like a magnetic puck that transfers
power to my phone but its widest right
yeah I mean it has to be plugged into
something but the connection to my phone
is Wireless
yeah and I guess I guess compared to the
the touchstone from Palm was like 70
bucks at retail but quickly went on the
clearance shelf so that's when I bought
mine but I guess it's a comparable price
I don't know it's comparable to other qi
wireless chargers i guess but just well
it still just really bothers me that
that Nokia's main uh she charging pad
that they that they started selling in
concert with the Lumia 820 and 920 isn't
like really compatible with the nexus 4
um like and and Tom recently discovered
this I believe may be watching the show
right now but it tom has a nexus 4 and
he probably as many of these charging
pants actually and they did they they
aren't really compatible with one
another and and I she I mean that's not
it's no longer standard right now the
whole point supposed to be a standard
yeah and the great thing about those no
keypads is that they're pretty cheap I
want to say that they're 39 bucks and
for a long time I know if it is still
the case before long time you get one
for free if you bought a Lumia 920 on
AT&amp;amp;T now correct me if I'm wrong the
Nokia pads don't have any magnets in
them right like you can't just put it
your device on and it just stays there
it doesn't get held in place or anything
but you could get that they they offered
them with a um what's that pillow
company there's like a thing looks like
a pillow that you could put it inside
and then the phone rests on the pillow
is it called fat boy is that it yes yes
yes right I recall this you I think you
you put the standards run a show to pad
I think they should soak to those we
chat for a discharging foods incident no
it's uh no because I got sent the the
fat boy and the the pad and like one end
of the bat boy is velcro and you open it
up and slide the the the charger in I
mean maybe they sell it as a bundle but
it's just the regular pad okay so with
without the magnets it's like it kills
the best application I could think of
for a wireless charging thing which is
in my car like when I had a palm pre I
actually in mounted a touchstone charger
in my car's dash so I would just get in
my car died popped my phone on it and it
would be held in place by the magnets in
charge while i was driving it was the
best thing ever yeah I think dieter
would agree with you on that yeah he has
talked about that that use case on many
occasions shows not agree with any of
that because I don't drive coupe how do
you take the tube man like every time
I'm in London like I go to get on on the
tube and like that it pulls up to the
station and people are like pressed up
against the glass and like and and and
half of the trains I mean like every
morning every line has a different kind
of train and like some of the trains on
some of the lines are like only four
feet tall I guess maybe because British
people are tiny I don't know but like so
people are like kind of like like bet
over and like pressed up against the
glass and it's like you you have to if
you're if you're claustrophobic you
would point literally die on these
trains and even if you aren't you might
suffocate so I don't know what you
should find out why you have your face
pressed up against the window that
person has a newspaper in front of their
face so it doesn't matter how busy it is
somebody whipper and you sleep hey will
be like a high-class bro she like God
you I can nice Pig 7-under Financial
Times something worth your time oh
you'll be the metro it will be just the
freedom it on the way you and I just be
like this and then the top of the
newspaper will poke into the back person
in front of it and the person in front
of them will get elevated by a soup
pumpkin to back with it because i'm
pretty sure complain about it and that
anxiety and thanks is going to build up
in them and then are going to move down
with space opens up in the middle so
then what you find is you get these
clusters of people because completely
jammed packed like sardines right next
to the doors
Watson you know jackass in the middle
with his arms spread wide up with my
dears just I'm doing this love jus
experience oh joy the reason why you
don't drive in London is because there's
just too many bodies too many people
here it's too much sure also there's the
the congestion fee right yeah but you
know we're rich people we meet Joey
don't worry about that here we're all
wealthy yeah we were we're a world
empire at one point yeah I was so
explosive that in some fashion or
another I don't know what I'm just
thinking we I'm go Gary I just the last
time I was in London I must list almost
missed my flight out of town because as
in Canary Wharf and I I kept waiting for
for trains to Paddington and like
everywhere I had to connect I can't
remember but yeah trains kept going by
and every single one was like that it
was like it was like a saturday morning
at like 8am or something like where are
you people going like you should be
sleeping right now wait and they might
even a full match because I said oh when
things get pretty close it up just
before we bring it back to some more
sane topics I would just like to point
out a major major flaw with the iphone 5
and any other devices using metal they
feel like absolute hell were you trying
to use them in the code because of the
pic of the same temperature and you pick
up the phone and you're like I just want
to get something that I'm really quickly
and put it back down because otherwise
you have to a little tucked in under you
sure and warm them up with somebody walk
for something I'm really put up using
guys on fire bro now because of his
freaking metal surround and your three
filament happening Lumia 920 you could
wear gloves exactly that's yeah that is
true I I have tried to swipe the iphone
week comes on a couple of times over the
past week or so and just yeah needed one
of those little jig was like huh
oh you need to get those a capacitive
gloves man yeah it's a capacitive fibers
I do have a pair of those but there i
mean the problem is that you don't have
the resolution on your gloved fingers to
relate to anything anyway you know well
i mean i went so banging out emails with
it but you can answer the phone and
right I I I didn't tell you guys I drop
some serious knowledge on GM last week I
I was at an event a press event for the
cadillac ELR which is their new extended
range electric it's like basically not
scalable coupe and it wasn't the event
was in Chicago and one of the
journalists there asked the question can
you use the touchscreen with gloves and
and that the chief engineer said we'll
know it's a capacitive touchscreen you
can't get means to detect iron in the
hands wait Cameron we sense um and then
I actually piped in like I couldn't I I
couldn't resist I pipe them like
actually well guys synaptics has a
touchscreen technology employed in the
Lumia 920 that allows you to use it with
gloves and they're like a you know but
but the the long and the short of it is
that I think I drop some serious
knowledge on GM just wonderfully and
you'll never be invited to a GM thing a
very good hey whatever if I'm gonna drop
knowledge I mean don't they want me
there like maybe they would have never
found out about these love compatible
capacitive touchscreens had I not been
at this event and now they know and so
now when the next generation cadillac
ELR has a glove compatible touchscreen
you have me to thank i would like to
point out a resistive touchscreen
sighting I think we should keep track of
those I addressed this since they're
just completely go to the dumps ever
since monkey abandoned them and finally
caught up to the curve at capacitive
bandwagon but I did discover one
resistance of screen and it took me
about five minutes to realize it was
resisting
it is like it's going to be such an
ancient technology that you keep trying
to treat it is like a capacitive or an
optical touchscreen and you keep trying
to give it your full finger and flesh
whatever but no it was released it and
the place where it was is in idea and
love them so like here yeah I reviewed a
sony camera a couple months ago I guess
now that actually had a resistive
touchscreen on the back and what was
weird was the prior model of the same
camera the prior version of a had a
capacitive screen and then the newer
version had a resistive screen and I was
writing about how it was much less
responsive without realizing that it was
actually a resistive screen until later
on nice I don't know why Sony did that
but they do well that's soon for you
nokia 5800 xpressmusic long live long
live the 5800 is it to find about I
tried to use it as my personal phone for
an hour or two that's gonna say that
gonna lesson love it early survive did
you have the white and purple one from
t-mobile no no I had I think it was all
black and he was a you know an
international unit yeah oh oh there's a
better viewing and yeah so we can
actually use that as a really good segue
into locate moving past it's always
because this week yesterday fact number
februari was the two-year anniversary of
monkey Microsoft hooking up officially
I'm not be officiating to Windows Phone
so do have any any thoughts of how this
fun what were your well you're telling
me is that it was two years ago that
Stephen Elop jumped off the platform and
he's still treading water hoping the
world come and and pull him out that's
what's happening right now he's probably
getting a little cold he's running out
of protein bars you know he's worried
about the sharks that are circling and
also there is still the burning plant
form that could collapse at any second
on top of them so things are not looking
very good mr. Elop yeah I mean obviously
they solve a long way to go if they want
to survive you know we're starting to
hear about this catwalk code name
catwalk which is supposedly the the
replacement for the 920 although we're
starting to hear some conflicting
information catwalk is definitely a code
name for next generation nokia device
the only question is what is going to be
we're also hearing about this this
tablet which seems an inevitability at
this point that might be something we
see at mwc actually yeah so yeah they
have a few things going on but there's
still no sign of what's going to be that
blockbuster device that pulls them out
of the the decline and really gives them
something to rally around my focus is a
vocalist advice is always the next one
right that's exactly right yeah it's
exactly right everything else everything
else is a holdover until the next one
yeah and you know Microsoft tom has
talked about this many times Microsoft
used to really kind of bizarre marketing
and retail strategy for the surface that
may have given nokian opening if they
can do something if they can come out
with like a really compelling looking
device and sell it in all the right
channels which I'm not convinced they
can do but you know maybe that's an
opening for them but but yeah they need
to I mean hey that like excuse me like I
said last week they saw the stake in
inver too and they're doing interesting
things interesting is one way to put it
but if you're not you're looking for
another way to put it is 10,000 others
for and you doesn't think you don't boy
like you don't blend in like in a 10,000
units bulk shipments that's one live us
with a WVGA display look man look man
I'm just saying Nokia's debt or I guess
vertu i should say is definitely turning
a profit on each one of these that it
sells and
and and nokia does still own a small
percentage of virtue so so maybe they'll
they'll get some some benefit from this
but hey I you know what we talked about
vertu I the last week of the week before
and this story remains the same i mean
at two vertues point the the typical
virtue customer is not looking for a
bleeding edge device they don't care
about specs they just want something
that that has some bling to it and costs
a lot of money and virtue is happy to
oblige oh and there's a concierge button
that we talked about the the very
important concierge button yeah that
that takes up like 9,000 of the ten
thousand dollars right you press the
button you can ask for quite literally
anything and they will including the
weather help you the including the
weather the ultimate weather app you
know but it but if you're in midtown
Manhattan and you you know you want to
ride an elephant to your flight at
LaGuardia I'm sure that the the
concierge would be happy to yeah you
don't you don't need ogre no you don't
need nucor if you're if you're a baller
you will ride an elephant by the way I
just I literally just got an email from
Microsoft that says fall for your
Windows Phone all over again which I'm
assuming is a reference to Valentine's
Day I'm not sure they say that parents
and kids love it discover new apps
including chimp act and dictionary com
those are the absolute they are letting
chimp act chimp act and discovery not a
Spotify which recently hit no there's
Wiz tiles photofunia chimp act AE coin
mania the path of Cara sleepbug and
soundhound are the highlighted app so
this is um this is actually some really
handy consumer advice right now it is
because you i would have never heard of
CH impacts had it not been
and then there are a couple videos
highlighting features were like you know
you can tap the phones together to
exchange information and you can get a
Bing lock screen so lots of exciting
that news in the world of windows phone
right now yay that's very exciting but
actually I want to slink back to virtue
so I can get a really nice segue okay
because Kris was just saying about the
idea of virtue owners be people who just
want something exclusive something that
other people don't have something that
you can go to your local starbucks and
put it down table and feel comfortable
that you won't see a menu alc sable
because nobody else is Nicholas II don't
as you ah but oh well we here in thumb
really worth it that's us that
university logo not logo but motto for
the dumb end or will be i don't think i
would pick that up for me but it's fine
and my Segway is actually we can bring
this in to mailbox for iphone because
there is this caricature of iphone
owners being somewhat elitist which was
brought to life quite literally with
instagram situation when it's going to
android look people freaked out were
like oh no now the unwashed android
users the joining our exclusive little
communities etc so if this latest group
those are actually exist discouraged did
those actually exist mailbox is a
perfect aplin because it has a massive
waiting list at the moment which is
reach something like three quarters of a
million ah yeah this sucks where you
guys still in it huh whatever man i I
badly I don't know yet I I am in the
cool club now uh and so I believe I got
it yesterday morning my ticket finally
came up so is it awesome ah so as far as
an appt goes it's very well designed and
it's very fast as far as an email
processing thing
I don't know if I agree with everything
that is trying to do and it does this a
lot of weird things that are like you
know you if you're a gmail user
generally are using gmail for a couple
of reasons one of them originally was
threaded conversations great spam
reporting and then later on you know
everybody or anybody with a brain
adopted labels and muting and labels and
muting are not supported in mailbox
which drives me nuts because I label the
crap out of things like every time that
I get an email in thats related to mwc I
give it an mwc label and I put it in
that label and then I can go look at
those later and see all my mwc stuff
together well I think the prompt my
guess is that it's not that they don't
want to support labels but i don't think
that labels are exposed in any way ah no
because like Sparrow the old gmail app
that everybody used to use before it got
you know put out to sea supported labels
no issue oh so yeah I mean that that
supports full label so I can probably
have an issue in the supporting label
colors and here's a no as I am right the
point the point was that i could look at
an email in my inbox i could label it
properly and then archive it and get it
in my inbox right box and yeah it
doesn't give me that option i can just
get it out of my inbox i can they have
like like mailbox has its own separate
set of labels that it creates and i can
give it one of those ah but i can't give
it one that i'm using for my account for
other things which is which is kind of
crazy um otherwise it does like a lot of
really smart things with your
conversation view and it's you know it
smartly removes all of like signatures
and all of the others crap that comes in
an email these days so when you're
looking at on your phone you're only
seeing the message itself which makes it
easy but i don't know if it'll be
something that i can use in the long
term unless you know these features get
added a future just clarify what i said
its perilous for colors for labels but
it doesn't immediately pick up the
colors you already have when your gmail
working which is one of the things
that's a little bit about it but hey
Sparrow is not part of Geno itself so
we're gonna experience the benefits of
those things yeah I mean
if Google doesn't like take the basis of
Sparrow and turn it into gmail for iOS I
don't know what what they're high on
because you know as great as the gmail
app is now has been updated with lots of
new features and things like that and
supports a lot of functions like
multiple accounts or whatever it's still
a pretty crappy web app that reloads all
of your data every single time and it
just kind of feels janky doesn't feel
like a native app where a sparrow felt
great and was fast and all that other
stuff so which in mailboxes and mailbox
has no push notifications which is
awesome well if I think that's fair
enough but i'll actually grown used to
the gmail app on iOS and i know it has
italian promise that he can add and some
of areas where you can improve which is
the same thing said a different way but
you know you sooner i'm using a daily
basis and leg that says I feel like
little things that mailbox does just a
bit too much like I had to trust yet too
much at I had me on the part of cool
club but I saw Ellis's excessive
hands-on with the application and those
things like when you send it off we
doing a set aside leave oh you can set
aside let's say until tonight or until
next week or until such a sub States and
then essentially free delivers that
email when you're ready to deal with it
handle it which is fine i guess but it's
also imposes on your paradigm behind the
email on you so you either have to fall
in love with it and really supports it
all you have to go in the four other
senses are thankful what's also just
kicking the can down the road i mean at
the end of the day you know yeah you
need to deal with with email that the
thing that I don't like about these
these mobile email apps that are trying
to do like you know innovative things
with email handling is that that
experience is not consistent across
you're not just accessing your email on
your phone you're accessing it on your
desktop your left your laptop your
tablet where
ever and and then you know if you get
used to say sparrow or mailbox or
whatever then you you go back to gmail
on the web and it's you know half of
those features aren't there so that's
something to consider I i don't know
that i will say this i think that these
mailbox guys missed a key opportunity to
charge say ten dollars to jump the line
i I think he's charged ten dollars for
the app I think people would have bought
it up hand over fist word that's that's
true that's very true Hey Ya charge ten
dollars for the app and then another
tend to jump the line and it had a
winner um but then we would all be
complaining about the cost of mailbox
okay they can't really win I actually
totally rude Krista that would be and
hey i don't think that opportunity is
gone i need to do right now and just
keep patting out a number like make it
joining make it fit see thing you want
to jump off a million spots fix books
this is the books yeah and the fact that
matter is there will be people who yeah
I'm perhaps to do that and join that in
the cool club hey as I am the famous iOS
app I am rich sold like 10 copies and
that was a thousand but so certainly an
app that actually does something for
fifty bucks with would solve you get
these hey so did you buy one of those
Chris did it die by um did I am rich no
uh no I know I would not do that oh I
remember watching the video of of
crackberry Kevin buying like that
there's there's a blackberry app world
equivalent time rich I camera what's
called it was a is a clock app that was
like five hundred dollars oh that's
right yeah I remember watching the video
of him buying it and I was like oh Kevin
don't do it there's so many other one
just give me the five hundred bucks yeah
like just donate it to charity do
something but other than buying us at
please but no you bought it see the
thing with the the thing with the
blackberry app is you could buy it with
your Porsche p whatever black Murray and
then you have the ultimate
wasted money very very soon Portia yes
yeah porsche a porsche owner would
literally clock you in the face for
saying Porsche I haven't had this I
don't you know what I I'm not really too
worried about Portia owners uh just
because I'm not isn't generally not
worried about I mean they're not the vin
diesel's of the world that you know it's
still fear into me know so it is your
Porsche ona think we shouldn't be
worried about you anyway yeah you did
pretty well it's true but what if the
rock drives a Porsche I don't know if
the I don't know if the rock would
really fit in most Porsches except for
the big goofy SUV so yeah that yeah the
Cayenne yes and and people who drive the
Chi and don't know the difference
between pronouncing a Porsche Porsche
this is true you're here making some
very valid points right now I think that
is really through this free easy this is
not the first time you said it's like
it's like when I think when I think it's
pathetic because you know there's some
really great portion vehicles that are
made and they're really awesome cards
but what I think of is I think of the
guy going through a midlife crisis you
just got divorced and it's kids are in
college and he's driving a freakin
boxster which is like you know for sixty
thousand dollars or whatever it costs to
buy that thing there's so many other
vehicles that you could buy that perform
better maybe look better and are just
like you know you're you're paying for
that just that label that's all they're
not for the performance of the vehicle
or even even the Cayman is a better car
hey then then a Boxster yeah I leave her
I mean I've heard my niece is that the
tesla model s smokes a Boxster like it
is so hey I'm shutting up at that Segway
was so good i'm just gonna shut up i'm a
pre-soak about tomorrow s doesn't want
to hear about it uh well you guys should
have watched my spellbinding QA earlier
today which was also hosted in a google
hangout yeah it was it was cool the the
only thing I can think of to really tie
this into mobile is the fact that
they're using an AT&amp;amp;T 3g connection in
in the car which is okay except
predictably failed on you when you were
in the mountains yeah yeah well yeah
first of all it's not LTE but then
second well once we got into Big Sur
which is no man's land uh all of our
phones died nobody had any service and
the the cars connection died and once
that happened the navigation started
kind of failing out like it we still had
a route that we could follow but then we
pulled over the side of the road and
turn the car off and we went back in our
route was gone and we couldn't get
anything back and that the basemap was
gon sit wasn't cashed so he had no
navigation which is insane to me like
the fact that they didn't plan for the
possibility that maybe your connection
isn't going to work once in a while so
that was a bummer but but otherwise it
worked pretty well and and obviously
that the notion of having alive like
continuously updating Google Maps
instead of like the old school like DVD
that you buy once here for two hundred
dollars from your car company and then
install in your car like it's it's a
no-brainer is this isn't one of us also
one of those calls within message
19-inch dash we would take for a free
inside days on that yep it's a Tegra 3
in the center console and then a taper
to powering the the instrument cluster
is my understanding and the data you
needed able to process without the
instrument cluster well these are the
cluster is just a big screen right that
yeah yeah it's an it's an eight-inch
tits I think it's eight it's an eight
inch display in the the Senate for the
instrument cluster and then ascend just
find that really wasteful and electric
raw I i know i think the chips so
they're using the so you got a engine 19
inch or whatever display yeah second
down power which is also shortening your
ring right it's a totally valid point um
yeah you know i need to bring that point
up because in the united states if you
don't talk about your age you pretty
much weight electric cars you pretty
much get in prison right
nice talk about that it was keep up the
old petrol guzzling industry going hey
man too big to fail I feel as though
Vlad has been personally wronged by the
petroleum the Detroit industry hey
nothing personal wrong but but you you
live you live in the country of BP which
is one of the largest corporations in
the world you didn't grew it and ruined
our beaches mind you yeah five years ago
for whatever y'all do if you're going to
indirectly accuse me for every single
crime the British Empire this is a
really long podcast uh yeah well so so
interestingly the the Tegra 3 was not
sufficient to power the the center
console the there there is for whatever
reason a full web browser built into the
car and it really choked on the verge
and other sites and the browser just
wasn't that great i I think they
probably could have fixed it through
software tweaks alone and the software
is still very early and they can do
software updates over the air with the
car so it you know I'm sure it's going
to improve over time but the other
solutions just throw more hardware at it
so this is I mean that begs the question
and I believe you brought this up in
your in your report on it you know why
is the browser there to begin with and
yeah if the cars in I guess there's no
there's no gearing in this based on on
what you were saying in your report you
just get in and go so you don't put the
car in park or drive or whatever but the
browser is always functional so while
the car is moving why why I had the
browser bill well there there is a park
and drive but it's kind of like it's
almost like what sort I'm looking for
it's it's like a psychological thing
almost like it's there just because you
know you're used to having park and
drive and a car but you don't you know
you don't really need it but so so
because of that I mean they can you know
they could do it so that like you have
to physically put the car into park
there's like a little stock on the on
the steering wheel column
that's like a transmission shifter and
you can put in the park and then I guess
you could have the the browser work
which would be great for Jordan one of
our video guys who spent most of the
journey from LA to San Francisco looking
at advice mallards on reddit in the
center console the car which is
distracting now connect a lie but I do
agree in general that that should be
locked out I mean it's already illegal
not mistaken in the US it's legal for
any display built into the car to show a
movie while the cars in motion I don't
think it's legal in Europe but it's
legal in the US so I think this is just
a case and I mentioned this in the QA
this morning I think it's just a case of
regulations not keeping up with where
the car companies are at specifically
Tesla I think that you know it's just a
matter of time for someone at the d.o.t
wakes up and they're like oh that's not
cool and then they'll ban it and it'll
be gone but until they like even on a
more most basic much more basic function
my personal vehicle if the car is like
moving or out of its park mode I can't
even pair my bluetooth phone with a dash
like I have to be in park and staying
still before I set up the Bluetooth
phone I can't do that driving stuff like
that yeah yeah and I also mentioned that
in the Q&amp;amp;A I think that the legacy car
companies are really gun shy about
regulators and they feel I think they
feel like very like burned by
regulations and so that they they that
is one of the reasons that they roll out
innovations very slowly and very
deliberately is because they're worried
that they're going to get their their
wrist slapped and Tesla because they're
new at this they don't have that natural
fear so they're they're just doing lots
of like crazy things with the interior
of the car that that a company like like
GM or BMW reporter whoever would not
consider doing and and one of them is
have a full web browser on a 17 inch
display in the car waltz in motion
because what happened on Jim
no yeah you showed us in the video I
believe there's a smartphone app for it
obviously yeah so any kind of cool crazy
stuff that Tesla's do in there that we
haven't seen before yeah well it's um
one thing that was nice we when we
parked it in Morro Bay which is our stop
on the first night there's like a sign
in sheet next to the charger just where
you write your name what kind of car you
have and like any thoughts or notes and
there were some notes that suggested
that maybe there there might be some
vandalism in the in the neighborhood so
we were keen to use the app to verify
that the car was still in the same place
where we left it and and one that is one
of the features in the app you can see
like it there chose a just a google map
with a pin where the car is so you can
see how that would be super helpful if
you part in a giant mall and you could
remember where you parked it's very
precise you know that that would be like
the ultimate troll what in it if you
park your your tests are there and you
plug it in and then 10 minutes late like
you're almost dead your batteries and
what's going ten minutes later some
would-be thief comes up and tries to rob
it and the thing just dies out of in the
middle it hadn't been charging that's
exactly so it's funny you say that Tesla
one of the things that tesla told us
when we picked up the car is that it's
it's like carjack proof because like you
just like say okay you can have the car
and then you let it drive like a quarter
mile then you shut it down like scope I
mean it's you know if you can't it's
very difficult for somebody to
effectively steal a model eyes so that's
kind of sound like having a very odd
sort of mobile pc which is also my
excuse for us i should talking about
this uh it has taken pre inside it has a
battery inside it it's got a cellular
connection it's extremely mobile yes it
is very mobile for for 250 miles at a
time yep right thank thank you Dan for
making sure it's it's about rain
but it is fighting it has like the
violent gang is that it is very much
like if you can cook a PC you took a
computer let's say whatever definition
want to give to the broad category of
personal computing devices and then you
put wheels around that are then put like
Chris's a few crazy design students from
another tooth company like Tesla that's
what you would get some borrowers and
again I guess the roasted to a certain
extent but then that those are some
basic most amazing which is kind of
meditation so suppose needs to be
something I was also invited about with
the app discussion is also the nissan
leaf I believe it's epic application
from the leaf have this nice little
function where you could turn on the
engine early so if it's a season like it
is right now it's freezing cold outside
you could get the car warmed up to like
five or six a.m. before you get a pen
and then by the time you get into the
car it's already free yeah the models
can do that too yep now although
interesting fact about that which I
didn't know is that the like that the
the ventilated heat is one of the least
efficient things you can do in an EV and
it drains the battery very fast so the
the Model S has a mode you can put it in
where it replaces some or all of the
ventilated heat with seat heat and it
does it automatically like it you know
it automatically adjusts the the heaters
inside the seat up and down to like
match the temperature that you that
you've set in the dash and then that
apparently saves a lot of energy that
way as opposed to just blasting the
cabin with hot air hmm that is really
Indian HD I didn't know that yeah and
you know I the sensation isn't quite the
same your face is probably still
freezing but your hands are freezing on
the wheel yeah
yeah but if you can get another 10 miles
of range out of it than what I could say
is my tongue tip is due to doubles up a
book that's what I'm calling it which is
put a hoodie on top of a hoodie cuz I'm
doing don't know you do your double
 yeah I'm your double back in it I
like it hey I just want to do in terms
of cultural impact you know particularly
here you UK i know you guys in the USA
association of you-know-who knees and
Aunty and social behavior and kids kids
acting out and I'll go to these things
what happens when you worry too good
it's like then people will be hey one
he's wearing a goodie but it is another
one is this is the second double blog to
see like a demo agent I mean how do you
react to that those just does the one
hoodie cancel out the other hoodie yeah
also how insane is this guy to worry
like something bit more reasonable and
what you need to do I think to complete
the look you need to have you know you
got to have like one foot in front and
one in back and then that way you can
kind of like pull them up like this and
completely encase your head I listen
 okay all right why besides you're
the poem set we have do on the front
until the back yes yes accepting you can
completely encase your head it's exactly
like that Chris is no exact exactly
you're right it is exactly like a sure I
just like Sherlock Holmes hat it speaks
your intelligence do you have your own
ones do your own 1i showed up on set no
yeah but I own about a dozen hoodies I
believe it yeah Vlad Zuckerberg that's
my middle name is revelation plate so do
we have anything else mobile that we
want to talk about the show today or we
have like I'm going to our according to
our topic list we have like 25
blackberry things to talk about well I
mean this the natick which successfully
though
very well so I think that news is
obviously is that Alicia Keys
BlackBerry's global cream no so hey son
of a moss summon from rights of it no
that's that's that's huge man I mean
that's big news I mean everybody knew
this this was gonna happen right my best
part of the story is not that it
happened but that she blamed it on
people hacking her Twitter I am and to
post to post some Drake lyrics which I
said knock you was hack you could
possibly have it's like it's like the
hackers were like we're going to we're
going to piss off Alicia's husband Swizz
Beatz by posting some drink lyrics to
irk it's it's innocuous unless you're
Drake like if it Drake himself hath
Alicia Keys Twitter account then I mean
that's kind of you know that's kind of a
low blow oh yeah I respect nothing but
respect for Drake I mean Yolo but but
I'm just saying it could have been Drake
I am drowning in this conversation I am
nobody was going on the drink may
actually be the leader of anonymous
could be anonymous Chrissy you never
know hey buddy has a name doesn't that
doesn't that just disqualify you it's
kind of like ever being married and
being candidate for the papacy I by the
time you get a name that's it too late
Romulans that that was that was a very
relevant an alum and as we're coming
everything here it was a see some news
that happened in the past mobile related
chin gently mobile related not mobile
related at all what is I we're going to
judge otos freaking blackberry topics
okay and conserve it and I will get back
but it was actually quite hilarious and
we can give people a little behind
seems look in the European newsroom when
the whole news about the Pope retiree
came up we're like this massive massive
news how do you write about it and every
like sitting around for a good five
minutes thinking is really solid angle
to this because everybody is freaking
out like Twitter is freaking out bc
stride cover it but doesn't have any
information it was just kind of love to
because it's like messy breaking you
used any like well actually this doesn't
so it's a shame he didn't tweet that he
was retiring yeah yeah you could have
had to look lad it wouldn't be like bang
bang bang yes yep would have had a new
story but he did he even announced it
and that's it you know you know you know
hilarious actually is apparently the
journalist to prompt the news broke it
first because she knew that's it from
talk about applying a niche skill in a
high-pressure job whether you know it's
like you break the news of the first
pope retirement in centuries and
centuries by using now Satan language oh
sure it's a metaphor to do a sybian here
that we could bring it do if we if we
talk if we ever talk about symbian on on
a verge mobile show we know that it's
time to wrap it up that veg we are that
should be our our benchmark once we hit
symbian so I'm not note uh that was a
crazy episode 35 this week I just want
to say I like 35 next week's episode 35
is gonna poke it with soaks up because
it actually come inside with HTC's event
yes will actually have something new to
talk about that will be officially off
the record and you know we won't be
playing the the rumor game next week I
have I have the scoop on it it's the
fire too
the flyer too with two pens stoolbend's
oh man that would that would blow my
mind straight out of the front of my
skull I mean how epic of a troll would
that the way she did that yep dual pens
that would be amazing like and they
could they have some some play on s-pen
I don't know what it would be exactly
but they could do something clever or
ask pens they could call it I don't know
well like their branding is one x + 1 s
+ 1 V so so maybe at HTC one pen no to
pen HTC to put yeah that doesn't like
they need one pen to rule them all no I
love that but yeah so uh yeah thank you

been the verge mobile show if you want
