Google TV it's much better its first
hardware is the Nexus player a little
hockey puck of a thing but eventually
Google hopes Android will be built into
lots of TVs and set-top boxes the
software is super simple
at the top of the colorfull homepage you
get a running left-to-right list of
everything you've been watching recently
below it you'll see all the apps you've
downloaded below that all the games
you've downloaded below that settings
you can scroll through everything to
find what you want to watch or you can
just use voice search there's a mic in
the remote and you tap the button and
say sons of anarchy to go straight to
the show
you can also say things like movies
starring Natalie Portman or
oscar-winning movies from 1999 or funny
movies the search is great when it works
but it does some weird things sometimes
you'll get the right results and then
just a bunch of other movies that have
nothing to do with anything that or
it'll pick two of the things you search
for and ignore the other one it can be
strange sometimes you'll eventually be
able to search through Netflix Hulu and
other apps but for now it's just google
play in YouTube there are also these
neat info cards below every movie would
show you who's in it ends in vital
information about the picture there's
not that much to do with the Nexus
player yet it has Netflix which I
actually never managed to get to work
and it has Hulu and crackle and Pandora
and obviously YouTube but there's not
that much new to watch here developers
have lots of control and access and will
probably make more apps quickly but
right now it's really basic you can of
course use it like a chromecast to send
movies and music and even browser tabs
to your TV that's the most powerful
thing here so far you can play simple
games with the included remote or by a
gamepad to play harder ones there are
only a few available so far but they
work pretty well and everything syncs
through Google so if you're playing a
game on your TV you can pick up right
where you left off on your phone the
whole interface uses Google's material
design so it's full of layers and
animations it's not very information
dense so you do a lot of scrolling to
find whatever you're looking for and
it's sometimes not obvious when there's
more information you don't see or if
you're supposed to scroll to get
somewhere the interface is pretty
responsive but it can lag in weird
places where it doesn't seem like it
should still though Android TV is a huge
step in the right direction it's much
better than Google TV it's a nice simple
interface that you just sort of
intuitively figure out it puts YouTube
and badland and The Walking Dead both
show and videogame on your TV all that
needs now is more more apps more things
to watch more games more power to run
things fast just more
