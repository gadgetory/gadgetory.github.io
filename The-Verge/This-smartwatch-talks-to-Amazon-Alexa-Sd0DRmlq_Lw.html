we're getting a first look at the new Co
watch that launched earlier this week on
IndieGoGo now at first glance it might
look like some other smart watches that
you seen before but there are two things
to know about this SmartWatch the first
is that it's running on an Android based
OS called chronologic the second is that
it works with Amazon Alexa let's take a
look ok first things first the co watch
is made by a Chinese company called M Co
and right now it costs one hundred and
fifty dollars on IndieGoGo but will sell
for two hundred and seventy dollars when
it ships in June normally we approach
some crowdfunded hardware with a healthy
dose of skepticism until it actually
ships but the good news here is that
this is almost a fully formed SmartWatch
it's much less raw than I expected it to
be the body of the watch is made of
stainless steel with the exception of
this ceramic ring around it that the
company says is both for aesthetics and
to boost wireless connectivity there's
one physical button on the side that
will either power it off or take you to
settings the display is a touch screen
AMOLED display and it looks pretty nice
and the one thing you'll notice right
off the bat no flat tire this Nilla nice
pan will look familiar since everyone
from Apple to Huawei is offering this
style of band with smartwatches these
days okay so I'm just going to come out
and say it the co watch is big
especially for me this is a 42
millimeter watch face it's 12
millimeters thick and these stainless
steel wings on either side of the face
don't help it either company says it
eventually plans to make smaller watches
ones that might appeal more to women or
anyone with delicate wrists but this
first one has a lot of heft to it so
what's more interesting about the co
watch is its software the co watch is
going to run on an android based OS
called chronologic switch was made by
some former Googlers who said they
wanted to focus on a UI that's really
tailored to a smart watch screen the
idea behind chronologic is that it
doesn't take too many swipes to do much
of anything you're never really going
too deep into the interface rather than
cluster
we asked all into one screen these
complications which chronologic scause
containers are spaced out throughout
multiple screens and generally you tap
the app container once you see what you
need to see and you swipe out but the
main event here is the fact that the
kawatche SmartWatch works with alexa or
at least that's the promise so it's not
a totally hands-free alexa experience
you still have to go to the alexa
container and tap it but then she's
listening and you can start asking it
questions right away who is deaf Bezos
what's the weather in San Francisco keep
staying unrecognized audio so yeah not
quite as smooth as Alexa at home but
again this prod is not shipping just yet
it's still being crowdfunded and both KO
watch and chronologic SAR making tweaks
to the final product so hopefully by the
time it is shipping this summer
Alexa will be ready and raring to go
absolutely there you go
it wasn't your watch I swear it was a
lens cap</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
