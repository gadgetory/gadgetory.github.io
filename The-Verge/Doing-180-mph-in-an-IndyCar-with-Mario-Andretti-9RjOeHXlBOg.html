that riding in an Indy car was going to
be more terrifying than the ride I got
last year in a red bull air race stunt
plane that sounds crazy in the plane I
was going upside down doing ultra-fast
snap rolls and started losing my vision
at one point but the danger just seems
so much more present in an open-wheel
car this time there was no parachute to
safety the 99th indy 500 is almost here
and it's going to be one of the fastest
ever but that speed is coming at a
terrific price as multiple drivers have
gotten into some spectacular crashes and
practice and qualifying before that the
cars were on pace to break a 20 year old
track record the sport is faster this
year because the cars have some pretty
wild-looking new aerodynamics kids one
of the few changes the series is made to
help boost popularity ratings have been
going down the last few years and going
faster is frankly one way to fix that as
a long time racing fan I wanted to know
more about where the sport is at right
now there's really no better way to do
that than to go to Indianapolis Motor
Speedway and get a ride around the track
at 180 miles per hour you wouldn't
believe the forces I felt when the car
dipped down into the turns accommodation
of downforce 9 degrees of banking in the
steady hands of Mario Andretti kept the
car turning perfectly smooth but in my
helmet my brains felt like they were
leaking out of my ear on the first lap I
leaned into the turns but by the second
lap my head was flailing helplessly to
the right my neck muscles were
completely worked and this is all just a
fraction of what Indy car driver's deal
with in the Indy 500 for example they'll
run 200 laps reach speeds somewhere
around 230 miles per hour and they're
gonna do that with 33 drivers on the
course i can remember watching the Indy
500 for as long as I've been alive and I
thought that meant I had some idea of
what these drivers were going through
but after my experience I couldn't have
been more wrong</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
