2014 where apparently virtually dead
operating systems can get a second life
it's no understatement to say that webOS
has had a weird history it started as a
way for palm to save itself struggling
the market got sold to HP and then HP
killed its devices and sold the software
to LG the next step in this crazy ride
LG's webOS Smart TVs on the eve of LG's
CES press conference we had a chance to
sit down with level essence head of
product management and design and type
on check to find out more about this
strange new chapter one of the main
things that were trying to achieve is
simplicity and there's nothing simpler
than understanding a lot you have your
pass things you have your present in the
future and that really is the simplest
thing that you can do this is how level
s works on a TV by completely
reimagining it for the big screen using
LG's motion remote you can point it at
what you want to watch and it's all put
on a single line of content instead of a
grid all of your inputs simply become
cards and are all the same a single line
of apps TV consoles and cable boxes apps
are on the right and get big splashy
intro screens while your most recent
cards are available on the left we
wanted unity everything is the same via
your Xbox your source or some apps
they're all the same if you're watching
Netflix and you all want to switch to
see what's happening on a game then go
back to YouTube it should be obviously
think there's no difference LG is also
painfully aware that too many users
don't set up their Smart TVs so it
created a cartoon beam bird to encourage
people to finish the process the bird
might be overly cute but the overall
interface is not at all it's refined
snappy and there are animations that
help you understand what's going on a
lot of the challenge that comes with a
sort of the flat design that it gets
really boring and we're trying to look
for something that makes our design
always dynamic and you'll see that we
have a lot of tension between different
parts of the design there's strong lines
and then they move sort of like jelly or
in an unexpected way
smart tvs typically have terrible
interfaces grids of icons and mismatched
uija balance so LG decided it wanted
something that felt immediate and simple
instead of flashy and overbearing the
inspiration for for the interface the
functionality comes from our perception
that TVs used to be simpler you want it
feeling simple again and it's not just
the functionality or the information
architecture it's also the visuals and
you can see the strong colors and the
lines really come from old TVs and how
even the no signal used to look Smart
TVs need apps and LG has the key ones
Netflix Hulu Amazon and YouTube there's
also a store coming to add more but LG
isn't hanging its hopes on building and
massive ecosystems yet TV right now is
not about apps it's about content and we
want to make sure we have all the
content that people want to see I don't
think that it's about competing about
that you know the app catalog and also
web voice is about the web
at the end that you want everything to
be accessible to everybody on the web
and you're just gonna be the best TV
over the web becoming just another Smart
TV interface isn't what what was could
have been but it is what it is
fortunately for LG it looks like it's a
relatively good interface and given the
sad state of most of the competition
relatively good actually feels pretty
great can level s be more than that at
this point it probably can't be and
that's just going to have to be enough</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
