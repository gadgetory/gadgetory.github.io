towards the inevitable so while we know
that the guy is going to get the girl or
there's going to be a happy ending
there's certain story beats that you hit
the idea of saying I'm now just going to
watch this young boy turn into Darth
Vader you're leading me into the story
that i already know there's certain
things that i know can't happen like
nothing's going to happen to obi-wan
right because it's a prequel and I felt
it was really important that Prometheus
was not positioned as a prologue to
alien write that in fact if prometheus
were successful and there was a sequel
to it the sequel to prometheus would not
be alien I also felt like alien is as
close to a perfect movie as it gets and
I was very reluctant to engage in a
conversation that would somehow diminish
alien right like that if you saw if for
some reason Prometheus didn't succeed
creatively that when you went and
watched alien again you'd be like this
movie is now you should taste would be
soured in some ways well yeah why Bible
I bet that so all that by way of saying
that if you my hope is that if you see
prometheus and you watch alien again
there will be certain things that were
mysteries before about alien that you
have more clarity on but not but but the
mysteries that made alien great are
still mysteries</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
