certainly want to thank everybody for
joining us for today's event the past
several years had seen great change in
the industry and great innovations
coming from Microsoft we've helped usher
in a new era of cloud computing we've
embraced mobility were redefining
communications and attempting to
transform entertainment in all that we
have done Windows is the heart and soul
of Microsoft from Windows PCs to Windows
servers to Windows phones and Windows
Azure Windows has proven to be the most
flexible general-purpose software ever
created spurring on an ecosystem of
unrivaled success when Microsoft was
founded our vision was bold and broad a
computer on every desk and in every home
and while certainly we are optimists to
the core Windows has exceeded even our
most optimistic predictions it now
powers well over 1 billion pcs from
desktops to laptops to ATMs to NASA
workstations and more in homes in
businesses in schools and in
government's literally around the world
with Windows 8 we've reimagined the
windows product we reimagine windows
from the chipset to the user experience
to power a new generation of PCs that
enable new capabilities and new
scenarios we approached the windows 8
product design in a forward-looking way
we designed Windows 8 for the world we
know in which most PC
our mobile and people want access to
information and the ability to create
content from anywhere anytime people
want to do all of that without
compromising the productivity that pcs
are uniquely known for from personal
productivity applications to technical
applications business software and
literally millions of other applications
that are written for Windows that work
perfectly on Windows 8 we're incredibly
gratified by the enthusiastic response
to Windows 8 from our partners our OEM
partners thousands of developers and
literally millions of people consumers
who've downloaded our previews
excitement is high with the new x86 and
arm SOC support the new Metro user
interface and the new store all getting
very broad interest today we want to add
another piece another bit of excitement
and another piece to that Windows 8
story at our foundation Bill Gates and
Paul Allen made a bet a bet on software
at the same time it was always clear
that our unique view of what software
could do would require us to push
Hardware sometimes in ways that even the
makers of the hardware themselves had
yet to envision that's the nature of the
dynamic between hardware and software
pushing each other and pulling each
other forward in fact our number-one
revenue product actually the year I
joined Microsoft 1980 was a hardware
product something known as the soft card
let's just take a little bit of a look
back at the roll of hardware at my
per soft micro so making harder for over
30 years we have over 3,200 hardware
patents that's one every three days over
our 30 years of history here at Hardware
think about a mouse that was the first
new type of input that you would
interact with with a piece of software
it was so revolutionary for its time
being able to work with the GUI in Word
was why the mouse was embedded piece of
hardware that was so unique and so hard
to find marks of like oh we can't get
this that we're gonna have to do it
ourselves number one selling keyboard
just so much built into it they just are
so instrumental to how you work with the
computer Xbox made a huge dive into the
gaming market the same thing we did 30
years ago about making software come to
life we're doing that today with the new
products hit our stride for sure when it
comes to innovation it is still about
wow developing products that are going
to touch the customer in a meaningful
way
I think the shapes are really cool
that's that's the first ratting into
them it's a constant evolution that's
what makes this place special that is
what drives us every day that's why we
come in to work and we work so hard
every day I'm personally very proud of
Connect we are responsible for an
awesome experience but when we cool the
gaming device could do that we control
it on we design it to all be verified
all the manufacturing all ourselves I
think it's about the desire to change
the world but we can do something that
not many others can do and what I see
coming out of the hardware group today
just blows my mind as excited as I am
about seeing people use our devices
right now I'm even more excited about
the stuff we're developing for the
future
we believe that any intersection between
human and machine can be made better
when all aspects of the experience
hardware and software are considered and
working together just let's take the
mouse as an example to be successful
Windows one oh really needed a mouse so
we built one early reviews of mice were
not very positive as people struggle to
understand the real value in fact
actually it was so new the Canadian
customs quarantined the Microsoft Mouse
at the border for four weeks thinking
that it was alive our most successful
hardware product has been the Xbox and
with Kinect
we have created a whole new user
experience and now developers are
pushing Kinect doing more exciting and
even cooler things for both the game
console and for Windows PCs this
combination of hardware software and
peripherals in the Xbox case work
together to deliver an absolutely
amazing experience we see that con that
sort of combination working also today
in our PC ecosystem we believe in the
strength of that ecosystem of software
and hardware companies that work
together to deliver selection and choice
that makes your Windows experience
uniquely your own those partnerships are
essential to the re-imagination of
Windows we've worked with the component
companies Intel AMD Nvidia Qualcomm and
Texas Instruments of course the ultimate
landing point of this PC experience is
through our partnerships with OEMs HP
Dell
Asus Acer Samsung Sony Lenovo Toshiba
and many many more they will deliver
more pcs to market in the year 2013 than
in any previous year
IDC estimates that number at over 375
million Windows PCs that will ensure
that software developers and content
creators have a larger number of new
systems to target with their Windows 8
applications than any other non phone
platform however with Windows 8 we did
not want to leave any seam uncovered
much like Windows 1.0 needed the mouse
to complete the experience we wanted to
give Windows 8 its own companion
hardware innovation
what is this innovation it's something
new it's something different it's a
whole new family of computing devices
from Microsoft
this is the new Microsoft Surface it
embodies the notion of hardware and
software really pushing each other
people do want to create and consume
they want to work and they want to play
they want to be on their couch they want
to be at their desk and they want to be
on the go
surface fulfills that dream it is a tool
to surface your passions to surface your
ideas to surface your creativity and to
surface your enjoyment I really want you
to take the time today to get to know
Microsoft Surface
so let's now learn more from Steven
Sinofsky and the Microsoft Surface team
just as we've reimagined windows we also
have a vision for reimagining the tablet
we see a tablet that is designed the way
that Windows has been designed we see a
tablet that represents a unique vision
for the seamless expression of
entertainment and creativity a tablet
that works and plays the way that you
want to a tablet that's a great PC a PC
that's a great tablet a new type of
computing surface surface is a stage for
Windows surface is designed for the
software experience to take it to have
it take center stage surface is super
thin at 9.3 millimeters it's just thin
enough for this full-size USB port for
peripherals or just charging your phone
while you're at the hotel the edges are
beveled away at 22 degrees so the PC
itself fades into the background it
feels natural in your hands surface is
the first PC with a full magnesium case
through a unique process the liquid
metal is formed into an ultra rigid yet
ultra light frame it is incredibly and
strong yet it's Airy
at under 1.5 pounds just 676 grams and
it's finally balanced you know we didn't
stop there the case is one-of-a-kind
it's a made from a physical vapor
deposition process it results in a
permanent scratch and wear resistance
foot surface this vapor mag case is a
first of a kind
and it accentuates the unique feel of
surface surfaces of course great for
entertainment it has access to all of
the Windows apps for music for video for
Xbox and gaming we can see here I'm
running Internet Explorer I can browse
smoothly you see great pages using the
using clear type and have a great
experience just with all the with with
browsing its 10.6 inch optically bonded
widescreen display
is custom design but for surface and of
course people play games I can go and
play any of the interesting games that
are on in the Windows Store and I can
use surface for using all the sensors
that are within windows as well surface
works for all of those games movies
entertainment look great as well
oops hang on this one there excuse me
just a second surface works great for
entertainment as well in fact I'm going
to show here for the first time a very
exciting new application this is the
Netflix application designed
specifically for Windows 8 now with the
wide screen you get 30% more viewing
area and no banding or letterboxing like
you traditionally should see I'm happy
to show this new Netflix application
give you an early look how it's designed
specifically for Windows 8 with semantic
zoom and Netflix we'll have this ready
at the Windows 8 launch I can go here
and start a movie and see it streams
straight to my surface PC just like you
would expect now to stream so well
surface needs great Wi-Fi surface is the
first tablet to incorporate dual 2x2
MIMO antennas that means it provides the
very best Wi-Fi reception of any tablet
today surface is incredibly great for
windows and for entertainment PC and you
know we're just getting started today
when you have your tablet you want to be
entertained you have to hold it you're
always sitting in an awkward position or
perhaps you have to choose from a
seemingly endless variety of add-on
stands and cases that solve a relatively
simple problem but by adding weight
adding thickness what if I just want to
watch movie or listen to music and do
something else we think that this should
be an integral part of the design we
think that a stand should be integral so
we've built a stand into the device
this stand is made of the same vapor mag
as the rest of the case and it's
completely integrated into the device
the hinge design is like that of the
finest luxury car and when not in use it
just fades away no extra weight no extra
thickness no separate add-on its
integrated just like the software and
the hardware integrated into surface and
then once you have this kickstand you
can sit back and enjoy a truly
hands-free experience you know you could
go and just put the put the surface on a
table lay back and watch a movie and
that's really what entertainment should
be about with the surface but you know
surfaces is designed to be mobile we
design surface to be rugged and move
around but with vapor mag and Corning
Gorilla Glass 2.0 you do not need to
worry at all but we know many people
prefer to have some sort of cover a
cover that helps to just act like an
easy on/off switch at least so surface
has a cover we designed the cover to be
an integral element of the PC we built a
magnetic connector into the device to
hold it very securely so let me attach
the cover click you heard that it's
solid click close the cover it's
integrated into the device it's made
from a fine northwest polar tech feels
great in your hand like a book it just
fits there and when we looked at the
whole surface on the cover we challenged
ourselves to do more this cover is just
three millimeters combined with surface
there over just there just over 12
millimeters that's less than half an
inch and we said why not do something
with this surface why shouldn't we just
take the surface and make it a full
multi-touch keyboard
this touch cover is not just a full
multi-touch keyboard but it's a modern
trackpad with left and right buttons it
even has the keys for the Windows 8
Metro style UI this keyboard combined
with the kickstand form the hallmark of
just hands-on creativity on average
typing is twice as efficient as typing
on glass and it's certainly more
comfortable now of course the innovative
screen on-screen keyboard in Windows is
still there and you can mix and match
the choice is really going to be yours
just put them on the table and you've
got a great stand let me go over here
and show you a different surface this
surface is connected to external HDMI
that's built into the device I'm going
to go here and now I've got sir I've got
the touch cover connected now with front
and rear facing cameras on this device I
can record video so I'm going to start
the camera application so now I can go
here and and I can tilt this around and
angle it so I could see it this camera
is angled at 22 degrees by angling it 22
degrees everybody at the table their
head is perfectly framed into the
picture or when I'm sitting at the seat
I can do a Skype call and I'm perfectly
framed but this device also has windows
on it or office on it so I go into the
desktop and I see here's word running
now what's really neat is I could also
have using the multitasking capabilities
I could dock the the camera app there
and now I can record a video or an
interview and take notes I could record
myself and read from my notes and that
integration is really cool in fact I can
even use the USB port and plug in an
external speaker and microphone even
though it has dual array mics and dual
speakers built in and I can get super
high quality recording and so that's a
quick look at at at surface now there's
so much more to show you today now
imagine if you will that we took all of
those capabilities of surface and we
built them so that you could you could
use all the applications that you're
familiar with you could use Photoshop or
you could use other applications those
applications would be Bill
using the latest of the intel core
processor now that in addition to the
surface that we're releasing today for
Windows RT we also have a surface that's
designed with these latest Intel
processors so in addition to working on
the NVIDIA ARM processor we're also
working with on a surface for Windows 8
Professional I'd like to introduce Mike
and jeweller now who's going to come up
on stage and show us a little bit of the
next generation of the next iteration of
surface
thank you very much Steven I am proud to
introduce you to another member of the
surface family this is surface for
Windows 8 pro the windows ecosystem has
always been about choice and for the
millions of professional desktop users
out there people who use their PC every
day to design and to create things this
is a great choice for you it shares the
same design principles that Steven was
talking about it's a stage for Windows
it shows the same pride and
craftsmanship it's less than two pounds
and less than 14 millimeters it's a full
PC now this also has a clear type
display Stevens PC had a clear type HD
this is a clear type Full HD display and
what that means is three things it's a
combination of a very specific pixel
geometry rendering and an optical
bonding process that together create the
effect that your eye can't distinguish
between the individual pixels and normal
viewing distances in this case 17 inches
less than arm's length this clear type
display also reduces Z height and
conserves battery power it has some of
the other high performance features you
saw too it's got that 2x2 antenna
technology this is a first-in tablets it
has dual high-performance antennas and
receivers so that you get the best Wi-Fi
performance possible no matter how you
hold it it also has a chassis that's
built out of that same durable and
elegant vapor mag that enables features
like the 0.7 millimeter thin kickstand
less than a millimeter
it's got the same compatible accessories
spine that Steven had so if you take a
touch cover like he had it just clicks
in it clicks in the same it has that
same designed and feeling because the
entire surface family of products was
designed together even close like this
this is still less than 17 millimeters
this PC has specs that rival those of
the finest ultrabooks that have ever
been announced and it delivers the power
and the flexibility that you would
expect of a high-end PC this PC is
powered by Intel's third generation Core
i5 processor the Ivy Bridge processor
this is their 22 nanometer process that
results in a CPU that's faster a GPU
that has double the 3d graphics
throughput all while using less power
than today's core i5s
but with that power comes a unique
design challenge how do you design a PC
that you might be holding in any
different way or have a cover in the
front in the back to integrate active
cooling there's no obvious place to put
a vent so here's our solution this is
called perimeter venting you see this
groove that goes all the way around the
outside of the case there's a good shot
of it up on the screen this allows air
to be uniformly distributed across the
entire PC when necessary in a way that
you never block it with your hands in
fact you never even feel it which makes
the PC really comfortable to hold which
is really helpful when doing things like
flipping back your keyboard and taking
notes with digital ink surface for
Windows 8 Pro supports digital inking
windows apps of all kinds can support
inking so here what I've done is I can
go back to the desktop and show you what
I launched I launched the Windows reader
and this is a PDF file of one of
Stephens blog posts so you can see I can
pan and zoom what I can really do here
is I can come and I could do ink I'm
going to come and say this is great now
what you'll notice when I ink and I zoom
in as i zoom in that ink stays smooth
that's because it's being sampled at
600dpi that's sub-pixel accuracy for
aang what that does is it keeps your
handwriting very smooth and hopefully
yours is a little better than mine one
of the neat things about this too is as
I'm inking from here I can see the tip
of the pen almost feels like it's
writing exactly on the screen
since the screen is optically bonded
we've eliminated the layers in between
the thin cover gloss and the screen so
it feels like you're inking right on the
page the distance between the stylus and
where I see the ink is only 0.7
millimeters that's the thinnest and
closest distance of any tablet PC any
inking tablet ever now one of the other
things that's going on here is as I'm
moving my hand you see the page is not
moving underneath my hand
that's because Windows has palm block
technology this surface has two
digitizers it has one for touch and a
separate one for digital ink and what
happens is is when I bring the pen close
to the screen Windows sees the proximity
of the pen and stops taking touch input
so my hand does it mess up what I'm
writing and when I'm done with the pen
you can see the little magnetic charging
connector there it just clicks in so
that's one of the cool things on surface
for Windows 8 pro and inking I got one
thanks the apps that I'm showing you
later look really great in the native
resolution of the screen the 1080
resolution but if you want to unlock the
highest possible resolutions that ID
bridge supports even higher resolutions
that are possible on via HDMI out we
have DisplayPort so now with DisplayPort
I can take this PC I can dock it and I
basically have a full professional
workstation with the power of a desktop
PC I have one here that's plugged in and
synced up to the show monitor and this
kind of a PC is powerful enough to run
big applications applications like
Photoshop Autodesk SolidWorks enterprise
applications that require a TPM chip in
this case I'm going to copy some
high-res photos onto the PC and edit
them in Adobe's Lightroom so I'm copying
on to the desktop and what you'll see
here this is a
five second copy that's a whole gigabyte
that's a whole gigabyte of pictures that
just copied in five seconds service has
support for really fast USB 3.0 and the
new USB SuperSpeed drives a gigabyte
file copy in five seconds is five times
faster than USB 2 Oh which which makes
sense with this PC because you'll be
using it to do big jobs whether you're
editing big photos like this or you're
dealing with big video files or you're
doing you know in Stevens case a big job
might be typing a super long blog post
that you may have read service is up for
the task now let's say you are in fact
doing one of those big typing jobs
you've seen already Steven talked a
little bit about touch cover and the
improvements it makes for typing let's
say you're a really fast touch typist or
maybe you just prefer the feel of
tactile keys well we've got another
surface choice for you this is surface
type cover it shares the same full pitch
layout as touch cover but what we've
done is we've taken a key switch that
has a one and a half millimeter travel
and we've built it into the thinnest
possible package so you can touch type
on I can touch type on this as fast as I
can touch type on any keyboard fully
compatible with Windows you see the
shortcut keys here it has a full modern
trackpad with clicking buttons and this
completes the surface family of products
I'd like to pull all the surface family
together all at one point
panos would you join us with the colors
of touch cover surface for Windows RT
surface for Windows 8 pro and a handful
of the touch cover colors that we're
going to have at launch that's the
complete surface family
thanks Steven now that's how we feel too
and Panos especially Panos Panay is the
leader of the team that created surface
and has some great stories and some more
detail about the product and how it came
to be it's all yours
thank you super cool super cool thank
you thank you for having me I am
unbelievably humbled right now and and
flattered to be up here and but
truthfully I'm rep I'm recognizing an
entire team that's back in Redmond right
now waiting to see your blog posts to
see what you have to say we have a team
full of designers development engineers
manufacturing engineers hardware testers
but all working on these products right
now as we speak before I get into what
I'm going to talk about today I'm just
going to show you a little bit more
about the design show you a little bit
more about the culture of how these
products were built because I think it
might be interesting for you to hear
that
I really want to share with you more of
our team so just watch this video really
quick and I'll be right back it's an
incredible moment when an idea that we
had after so many months working really
hard turns into a product we brought
some of the best people at Microsoft
together to make this awesome device
one of the things that really drives us
isn't that or what a great idea
it's what a great idea and we can build
a collaboration between the disciplines
was this outstanding we had a full-blown
team of researchers engineers user
researchers industrial designers
interaction designers that all work
together we couldn't ask for a better
team what we have right now super
important to not only care about the big
idea but also to care about the smallest
details it takes iteration to build the
best device possible each time we made
one of those revisions we got
progressively better and better took
months and months and months of
prototyping we found it pretty exciting
complex the technology was amazing you
start to realize that what we're making
here is really special
the first reactions will be wow you put
the entire system together for the first
time I think that was a loud moment when
you pick this unit up you viscerally
understand that is high quality a PC
that is everything you would want in a
tablet device for consuming content the
next moment you can be crafting an email
or writing a term paper when you're able
to connect you know some sort of user
experience to bits all the way down to
atoms that's where you start really
seeing a new experiences evolve I think
you find that some that's a pretty
powerful product you're very proud of it
you're going to get to meet a lot of the
people you just saw in the middie Oh in
just a few minutes they're actually
backstage right now preparing to show
you more details of the product and give
you a few minutes to put your hands on
it talk a little bit about the design
let me start by doing that to just give
you a quick preview of oh you might see
backstage in just a few minutes
you heard Stephan and Mike both say it
this was built as a stage for Windows 8
that was part of our core vision for the
product it was very important for us
that we had the hardware fade to the
background for this product it was
important so the Windows software could
rise to the surface it gives you the
best experience possible when the
hardware fades away and what comes to
the surface is that entertainment piece
you want when you're using the device
note the chamber and ankles on chamber
chamber angles on the side of this
product these are chamfer 222 degrees
that's two things one it's a physical
manifestation of the actual stage itself
you can see as it falls away just as we
intended for the hardware to do but - it
actually sits perfectly comfortable in
your hands I only qualify something I
say perfectly a lot I say perfect a lot
as part of our team culture what was
really important for us as we had so
many parts of the design that had to be
in detail and be simple and be right
that we always strive for perfection on
every sub component of this product it
includes this chamfer dangle what it
does is sits in your hand very
comfortably in a way that when you hold
it it feels like it feels Airy most
importantly you can use it all day in
comfort it's really important when you
talk about the hardware fitting to the
background that the hardware is not your
way to accomplish what you wanted to do
it's meant to move you forward what you
think this product does now when we talk
about Hardware fitting to the back
another thing that's super important is
the seamless lines throughout the
product when you look at this product
you'll see lines going throughout it
every line calculated every line built
formed perfectly on the device but
there's one challenge our vision for the
product beyond being a stage 4
Windows was also that we had to bring
creativity and productivity to felt such
as yourselves the opportunity to
transform this device if you will to
transition it to the state of getting
things done putting this kickstand in
the product flies right in the face of
seamless lines and getting it perfect
but we really spent a lot of time here
we knew that if we did not get the
kickstand perfect this device would not
work we could not take any chances take
a look at the three hinges that you see
within this device this is a really
simple example of the details of the
product these are three custom-made
hinges mind you there are over 200
custom parts built from the inside out
of this product to make it come to life
but these hinges they respect justice
Steven told you they respect to feel and
sound like a high-end car door when you
close the device the kickstand just goes
away it's not your way when you need the
device it's there just in time you want
to get something done just open it and
it feels great the spec we created was
around sound we iterated over and over
again in our anechoic chamber this is a
critical point we really wanted to get
the sound right so you get that visceral
feeling that emotional attachment to
your product when you open this
kickstand and close it it makes it yours
it goes away when you don't need it and
it's there when you do now we talked
about vapor mag a few times and let me
bring vapor back to life just a little
bit here so you can understand a little
bit more of what we did vapor mag
essentially becomes what lets us get our
product design and create life out of it
you can see the breakout behind me let
me just explain a few things that we
have going on I'm holding up my room key
it feels weird to hold up my room key
but if you look at this quickly what
you'll see is point seven seven
millimeters of thickness this is an
important point if you can't see it
that's all right
same as a credit card pull it out your
credit cards likely somewhere between
0.75 or 0.85 millimeters thick it's just
to illustrate a point
Vapor mag is a process where we start
with an ingot of magnesium and we melt
it down to a molten State we then
injection molded magnesium
through some tools and we're able to
actually mold the intricate details that
are needed for surface we mold down to
0.65 millimeters of thickness in any
given part 0.75 we mold to 0.65 this is
important to understand because for us
to get to the design we needed for this
product to get the kickstand integrated
seamlessly and hold this line throughout
the product we had to be able to mold to
those tolerances every micron matters
within Microsoft Surface we've actually
stacked up every part from designing
from the inside out so tightly in the
product and so cleanly that even if you
stuck a piece of tape in the middle of
the device it would bulge it would bulge
out that tells you how strong this
product is how much strength comes with
it how light it feels in your hands all
those parts play into each other the
best part about vapor mag is not just
that we can mold 0.65 and get the
intricate details like the point six
five millimeter angles that go around
the product these radii the best part is
the smoothness of the finish that comes
out of the tools after approximately a
hundred and fifty two steps to get the
vapor mag looking just like you see now
you find that the surface finish on this
product and as mike says pride and
craftsmanship is perfect it's seamless
it screams watch quality finish and when
you put it in your hands it feels
elegant when you touch it you're going
to want to hold it I promise you now I'm
proud of vapor mag and I'm proud of the
team for the product that they've done
but nothing nothing stirs me more
nothing gets me more excited than touch
touch cover I really want to walk you
through touch cover for just a few
moments this is an important technology
that came out of our group I'm going to
walk you through it in two ways
the first way is through the experience
and the second way I'm going to talk
about is the technology let's do the
experience first let me explain to you
what we try to do with touch cover from
GetGo you'll notice I'm going to connect
it now to my blue touch cover so I just
click it in as you would expect the
surface turns blue along with my touch
cover and you have a beautiful
integration of hardware and software my
surface knows what is connected to it I
can now bring to life the vision that is
touch cover for this product the vision
that lets you produce content when you
want it how you want it as fast as
you've always done it that's what this
product was designed for let me give you
one more second on this on a little bit
of the experience the thing that was so
critical for us in creating touch cover
was that it had to be three millimeters
thin this essentially is at odds of any
other keyboard you've used and still
have a great typing experience it also
had to be a cover you wanted to connect
something you always had with you
something that gave you confidence just
like the kickstand to bring this product
to life we've designed the flux fountain
two magnets in this product that's a
combination of alignment and clamping
magnets you could actually never miss
connecting this device
you can't miss we force you to not miss
we do that to give you confidence you
close it it feels like a book we
designed this organically like a book we
wanted it to feel just like that what
has more covers on it than books
themselves this fine feels like a book
when you put it in your hand and you
walk away with your product you'll hold
it like a book when you carry it against
your books it'll feel like it's another
book it's just light enough and it feels
just perfect now that said I think
you're going to fall in love with touch
cover I know I have I mean I am
seriously in love with that outside of
my wife touch covers number two it's
very important to me now I never want to
take touch cover off and I'd argue that
you don't need to and you never have to
you saw Mike move his touch cover to the
back now when he did that I'm sure every
single one you thought like wait a
minute how do you move it to the back
well touch cover is pretty smart it has
an accelerometer built into it the
moment you fold it
we've know you fold it back we know
where you're not using it and it's
turned off for you so you never have to
take it off and underneath your
fingertips
it feels great so now you've got a
comfortable device with touch cover
that's yours it's personalized to you
you saw the beautiful colors that we
have coming to market and essentially
what's brought to you is an experience
like none other with touch cover and
surface together now I showed you the
experience but I wanted to show you the
technology because it really is
important that you understand it and
quite frankly we have a bit of a mad
scientist who many of you know named
Stevie batiste
Stevie actually invented touch cover the
fact that we have 30 years of input
experience using mice and 15 years
creating keyboards we really understand
how to create a great typing experience
we also knew that if we brought you
touch cover and touch cover wasn't any
good boy
what a breaking moment but we've
actually evolved this technology to a
point through Stevie and his work to
come to a place where we've brought you
an experience that's amazing at typing
there's actually seven layers squeezed
in pressed right into touch cover to
keep it three millimeters thin now
that's super thin but critical for you
to have a great experience when folding
it back let me explain to you how the
technology works just ever so slightly
and quickly so what you're going to see
is I'm going to put my hands down on
this machine here what you're seeing is
this is surface for Windows RT and my
hands are down on touch cover you'll
notice that my hands are laying flat on
touch cover right now yet nothing's
happening if this was in fact the
capacitive screen or the phone you might
have in your pocket or some other device
you might have the keyboard would take
up half the screen and you put your
fingers down and it would look something
like that
now that's me actually pressing on touch
cover and it knows the grams of force
coming off my fingertips on to touch
cover why is this critical when you type
in touch type speed you have to find
your home position and rest your hands
to do that your keyboard can't fire when
you put your hands down it's comfortable
you can rest your hands and note as I
put pressure on the J key how the
pressure goes up as I push harder and as
I release the pressure comes off it's
actually measuring
every gram of force coming off my
fingertips and as I start to type it
knows how many keys I've hit this
keyboard actually measures ten times
faster and scanning from a keyboard
matrix than any keyboard guarantee that
you use today it is super fast and
brings great great opportunity for you
to be productive and get stuff done
obviously I have a lot of pride in this
product I hope you love it I can't wait
for you to get your hands on it back
there and I really mean that Steven
thanks for having me up here today
that was a moment for our team for sure
I do want to talk a little bit about
some availability and pricing
information and things like that that I
know that I know people want to know
surface for Windows RT I still say
there'll be much more information
available on the web and available
shortly so surface for Windows RT will
be available in both a 32 and a 64
gigabyte model and will be priced like
comparable tablets that are based on arm
surface for Windows 8 Professional will
come in 64 gigabyte and 128 gigabyte
storage models and we'll have a retail
price comparable with competitive
Ultrabook class PCs additional specifics
on pricing and packaging will be
announced as we get closer to retail
availability now of course retail
availability for the surface pcs will be
around the time of will be at the for
the Windows RT PC will be at the time of
the Windows 8 general availability and
from Windows 8 Pro about three months
later surface will be available through
the Microsoft's physical stores here in
the US and will be available through
select online through the Select online
outlets of the Microsoft Store as well
so welcome everybody to surface I just
want to invite Steve Ballmer back up on
stage one more time and thank you thank
you very much
I want to thank Steven and Mike and
Panos and their team this has been an
unbelievable journey we've invested
significantly as you could see in talent
in time in capital to bring the surface
to market
I was asked in the the last few days
here why now why now we took the time to
really get surface and Windows eight
right to do something that was really
different and really special we're very
proud very very proud of the surface
just like we're very proud of Windows 8
because of Windows 8 because of Windows
8 the surface is a PC the surface is a
tablet and the surface is something new
that we think people will absolutely
love we really want those of you here to
have a chance to see and touch the
surface and talk with some of the people
who are involved in designing the
product we have several stations set up
next door where you can see the work
that went into the creation of the
surface and we hope you'll you'll stay
and join us for that today has been fun
for us to put on for you very very
exciting and want to thank you all for
being part of today's event thanks
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
