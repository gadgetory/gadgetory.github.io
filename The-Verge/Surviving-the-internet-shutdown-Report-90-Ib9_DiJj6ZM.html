what was happening through the internet
it's one of the unexpected triumphs of
social media when a people rise up
against their government they do it on
the Internet on Facebook Twitter and
public blogs and sometimes after that
happens the government tries to shut the
internet down what it has been blocked
by the cold we've seen it happen over
and over from Egypt to Venezuela
if activists are relying on Twitter a
country's central telecom can block
Twitter's IP addresses suddenly your
phone can't reach the server and if they
want to stop online activism at large
they can cut off the internet completely
this blue dot is Syria's exclusive
state-run telecom on May 7 2013
it started cutting off the traffic
routes one by one until there was no way
left to get data in or out of the
country central web blocks have also
happened in Turkey Ukraine Egypt Syria
and Iran the question is once the
connection shuts down how do you fight
back in the case of a total web blackout
the kind you've seen in Iran and Syria
simple redirect tricks won't work in
that case you need something stronger
like a mesh network it looks like this
each dawn is a router and each line is a
working connection there's no need for a
central hub or an ISP no-one's ever
deployed a network like that in a real
crisis but there are lots of people
who'd like to today we're gonna see what
it would look like New York art space
called IBM is hosting a mock internet
blackout kind of a fire drill for the
web inside there's no outside
connectivity of any kind the internet is
down and we're gonna see what kind of
network we can put up in its place
the big problem with an isolated mesh
network is you can't download anything
that isn't already there but our group
came prepared we're all connected to the
local Wi-Fi which lets us plug in an IP
address and connect to a local repo of
apps using f-droid incur plap we can
download the apps we need to start
actually talking to each other of course
we're all still in the same room feeding
off the same Wi-Fi network so once
that's done it's time to make the
network bigger everything is running on
this or reprogrammed commotions rather
it doesn't connect to the internet it
just connects to other routers with
enough of them together that's all the
internet you need the new network takes
some getting used to
there are no centralized services so
instead of Facebook or Twitter you'd
publish using a local WordPress app
instead of whatsapp you use a
decentralized chat service like chat
secure WeChat instead of Skype
there's lengthe after a while our
network broke down people walk too far
away and lost connectivity unsure of
where to set up or how to communicate
with the group simple coordination is a
real problem and the process is still
going through some growing pains but the
idea works this kind of small scale
network can be useful even if you aren't
fighting an internet back up mesh is a
big deal in Europe with immense networks
already constructed in Berlin Athens and
Barcelona for the most part there are
way to connect to the internet for a
little less money but they're also
vibrant networks in their own right with
files and programs swapped between
thousands of different nodes it's a
different kind of web than were used to
scrappier and less centralized but
that's the whole point the network in
Chicago might look completely different
from the one in New York and
surveillance agencies have to move
against all of them at once if they want
to listen it it doesn't replace the main
internet it just grows up alongside it
with services that never leave blocked
from a global perspective that's a
powerful thing as this technology
spreads the power of the network gets
stronger maybe it won't be in New York
or Berlin but the day will come when a
government reaches to turn off the
internet and finds out they can</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
