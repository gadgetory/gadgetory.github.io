at a time you're gonna need a good house
and it's not going to be glamorous
living either imagine living in a
one-room tin can with three to four
other people that tin can is keeping you
alive NASA wants to send humans back
into deep space but the last time people
went beyond low-earth orbit they stayed
for less than two weeks per trip this
time around NASA wants to send
astronauts to live in deep space
orbiting the moon and then possibly on
to Mars for months at a time like they
do on the International Space Station
but what does the deep space habitat
look like NASA is partnered with six
different private companies as part of
their next step program to figure that
out each company is researching and
building deep space habitats all with
unique designs to see which modules will
work best and these habitats could be
used as part of a new Space Station that
NASA wants to build near the moon called
Gateway I went to one of these companies
Lockheed Martin to check out a mock-up
of the deep space habitat that they're
working on so here we are in the
prototype habitat that you guys are
building for the next step program so
tell me about it what informs its shape
and size and and all that stuff we put
together this prototype to get a better
feel for what it would be like to live
and work in a space station at the moon
so it's round because the launch
vehicles are round right so we need to
fit inside the payload fairing for
launch
but we've also thought about what it
would be like to live here so you need
all the standard things food water
shelter you would have all your personal
items your clothes your toothbrush all
those normal things NASA hopes this will
serve as a new outpost for astronauts
allowing them to conduct studies in the
deep space environment around the moon
and to travel to and from the lunar
surface the one challenge of sending
things to deep space is
space getting a habitat of this size far
away from Earth in one piece requires a
lot of fuel and the larger the habitat
the more fuel it will require that's why
Lockheed is trying to do more with less
sand in here right now that big of a
space but you envision people living and
doing work here so how would they
utilize all of this limited space if you
will right can you imagine for people in
this space I have a problem with my tiny
apartment and my dog so I don't I don't
know that's exactly what this is it's
one room but it's four bedroom one
bathroom
but yeah we'll have a science
workstation where the crew can do their
science experiments get information from
the vehicle look at health and status we
have a treadmill and exercise equipment
right on the ceiling it's but in space
there is no ceiling right the way you
are is the right way up so we can use
all four walls we need to to get very
effective use of this limited space of
course it's tough to get the full
experience of living in this habitat
here on earth this habitat is just a
mock-up Rocky is currently building its
first working nextstep prototype in
Florida so the company is using virtual
and augmented reality to give engineers
a better understanding of how the
finished product will look and feel all
right I'm ready I'm ready to go to space
all right I hope I didn't break anything
Here I am home sweet home you find your
way there go ahead and go outside oh
let's do that how am I gonna get over
there Wow it's clear that I'm just a
mess and zero gravity so we've been
using a lot of VR and AR technology to
play around with the next step habitat
what is so great about these different
types of technology that helps you with
design and modifications and why not
well there's a few things that's really
great about the first is affordability
it lets you perform a lot of
reconfigurations while keeping things
cheap you saw with the AR you know ones
that you had on you're able to see the
different components that are going to
be in the spacecraft in a habitat so it
allows us to move them around and
reconfigure and see the spacing of
everything things you don't want to put
your treadmill right next to your
workstation and have somebody running
and sweating right above you so and if
you go ahead and build it without
knowing those problems you kind of have
a big cost problem yeah or if you
actually do like build out those big
size you know components it's expensive
and heavy and you have to actually move
them around so they are really helps a
lot with that and VR really helps a lot
with training too because you solve with
the simulation you kind of got a little
bit of a sense of what it's like to be
in the spacecraft and so on the ground
we can train astronauts or the crew just
you know how to move around the new
crane in space isn't as easy as people
might think you know you turn your hand
a certain way and it doesn't your whole
body it moves with you yeah Newton's
third law it's pretty crazy right now
this program is just for engineers not
for astronauts
however astronauts going to the ISS
actually do lots of VR training to
prepare for space
where is it yep if this station does go
to the moon VR trainings will be
important before heading there too what
are the things that you think of when
you go out to design a habitat what are
the essentials that you need
well we think about what is a day in the
life of an astronaut gonna look like
they're gonna wake up they're gonna eat
breakfast they're going to perform
science we want to know what it takes to
keep them alive as well as what work
they're going to do in science they're
going to perform while they're there so
we need to accommodate all those aspects
keeping them healthy and keeping them
productive now you mentioned a one
bathroom where's the bathroom gonna be
it's actually on Orion right through
this hatch is where the crew would come
to the habitat right in Orion and the
bathroom is there at least you have some
privacy
Orion is much more than just a bathroom
it's a crew capsule that Lockheed Martin
is also working on to transport people
from earth to deep space and once Orion
reaches this habitat
it'll have to dock explain this setup
very sure we're sitting in the Orion
crew simulator gotcha so this is the
cockpit this is where the pilot and the
commander would sit as they fly Orion to
dock to the Gateway so we've been
traveling for months and months and
months and now we're finally here and
ready to dock I've been waiting for this
day of my whole astronaut life basically
so if you pull out on that that'll slow
you down okay or you can push in and
fire a thruster to speed us up
docking turned out to be pretty tense
just one small movement can send the
capsule veering off in the wrong
direction okay so I'm veering off to the
right so I think I want to go to the to
the left
so close oh oh here we go
I mean right on the turkey Oh perfect
doggy
beautiful okay just a little bit off but
man nailed it of course it could be a
while before this happens Lockheed and
the other next step finalists will need
to finish building and testing out their
habitats before this deep-space outpost
becomes a reality so it might not be the
most spacious but like all real estate
it's all about location you're
