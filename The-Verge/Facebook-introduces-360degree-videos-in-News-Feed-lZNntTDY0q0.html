this year has been video all the big
tech companies are trying to find ways
to make their videos feel more immersive
interactive and most importantly find
ways to e to watch them longer and the
next big front in video is video shot in
360 degrees camera manufacturers are
starting to make rigs that can capture
the whole world in 360 degrees and
they're finally starting to be more
places online where you can actually
view them as of today one of those
places is Facebook's newsfeed one of the
things we're constantly working on is
how do we improve the formats that are
available in these foods for people to
tell stories to their friends or for
publishers who have really interesting
content to share with the world and over
time we think that the things that
people want to share are getting richer
and more immersive and so we started
thinking about how do we do a really
great mobile experience for 360 degree
videos for people who are using Facebook
who may not yet have a really cool VR
device to check out the content and so
to show you what this looks like if
you're scrolling down through your
newsfeed here you come across this
really cool video that's coming out at
launch from Star Wars and it tells you
that it's a 360 degree video and you can
actually move your phone around as if
you're the director choosing what the
angle should be for now though it seems
like creating a 360 degree video is not
something most people can do adjust what
their phone totally so it you know takes
either specialized hardware or
specialized software so I think the
people you'll see at launch creating
this type of content or you know
enthusiasts or people who really
understand the space but over time I
think it'll get easier and easier for
people to do this so you'll see more and
more cool content who's going to be
showing off 360 degree videos to start
yeah so there's a few so Star Wars is
one of these were really excited about
it launched we also have the Discovery
Channel and Mythbusters is doing a
really cool thing where you're
underwater you can see sort of sharks
coming at you
we've got Vice is doing some reporting
from Afghanistan
which is a really interesting way to
like actually feel like you're there
LeBron James is doing a workout so you
can check out his workout the other
really exciting thing is because of
anyone seeing with coming in over there
over the weeks and months after does
this feel like a step towards Facebook
VR the way I might think about it is a
nice stepping stone for creator so if
I'm creating really really cool
interesting VR content the nice thing
about this is it's a way for lots and
lots of people to check that content out
whether or not they have a VR device
yeah so you might imagine you know a few
years from now lots and lots of people
will have VR devices and be able to
watch content like this on their VR
device but force you know for a creator
like Star Wars this is a great way for
them to make content for the people who
have the devices but also for everyone
else to check out and one of the cool
things is I think over time you can
imagine there being more of this content
and more of it available an oculus and
starting to think through how to make
the experience more seamless between
newsfeed and oculus so the most
interesting thing about having these
videos in the newsfeed maybe what they
tell us about where Facebook is going
they built this product with the help of
the oculus team oculus of course working
on virtual reality and you can look at
360 degree video as a step down that
road toward a world where Facebook is
totally immersive where everywhere you
look you're seeing things shared by your
friends and by publishers that you care
about now we have a long road to get
there for starters you can only see
these videos on an Android device or on
the web
but for a lot of people this is going to
be the first time that they ever see
video shot in 360 degrees and a lot of
them are gonna like it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
