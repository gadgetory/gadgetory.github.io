we're back it's exciting and I am dieter
bohn i'm dan seifert and i'm chris
sigler and this is episode 34 if you're
wondering and I know you were it's the
week of January 28 2013 I know you cared
a lot about that information as well and
we are in the hosts CES pre Mobile World
Congress i would say doldrums but we've
got a ton of stuff that has popped this
week and I'm actually kind of surprised
we've got blackberry hitting tomorrow
we've got no key rumors we got HTC
rumors we have an HTC event we've got
just a ton of stuff to talk about
actually dieter I'm going to challenge
your statement that this is episode 34 i
believe that i mis-read i just read
whoever two handled the show notes I
believe this is episode 35 I believe
don't don't call me about I think ya
know what might be you know you weren't
you were here let this week to you it is
episode 34 well why did somebody not
update this also know our notes is
really important for all our listeners
our notes are counting CES is not a
number this show we did it that's
garbage that's ridiculous we need um we
would have all of our live listeners
complaining to us but we've we're not
running the chat this week it also isn't
running I believe on the verge cast
there's problems with that chat and so
you know you can still email us Virg
Virg mobile show at the verge calm you
could also tweet at us so you can post
comments uh but don't go crazy guys I
mean come on it's you you don't have
that much to say really you know what
they should do you know what our
listeners should do is they should they
should start their own google hangout in
parallel to ours whoa and they they all
hang out and chat and like video talk
video chat with one another while we're
doing the show the shadow hang out yeah
don't be pronouncing pretty awesome idea
um anyway yeah so like it's it's a
surprisingly busy weekend news and we've
got
a lot of stuff to talk about which I've
said like eight times and so I don't see
why we don't just start doing that
unless we want to hear Chris talked
about how he sucks at getting his
computer fixed no III don't suck you
getting my computer it is fixed I'm just
explaining before the show yea i meant
to pick it up it's it's ready for pickup
at the apple store I meant to pick it up
last night and I so I started wandering
through Chicago on my way to the apple
store and I got sidetracked by one of my
favorite coffee shops inteligencia was
it open I go yes it was open for those
of you who live in LA or Chicago you
know that inteligencia is some of the
finest coffee in the world so I stopped
in and then start working on a review
that I can't talk about with you
unfortunately and then next thing you
know a couple hours pass and that's what
is Peter what is going on is that 33
maybe I was happening Charlie get a shot
of the mirror on a pre three on my uh my
camera here comes to God raised it up a
little bit get that free three out of my
face I haven't done to my bosses in it I
was thinking about it but I haven't done
it yet I like I don't even know if the
service is still work it's that I
probably need to do a doctor on it to
get it going properly every year you
should review the pre three just pretend
like it's a new phone just feel like
free 3 review well the webos nation did
like a state of open webOS after a year
last week and it's you know pretty sad
state of affairs there I would imagine
they're running on some Galaxy Nexus
hardware but they don't have 3d
acceleration going they can't get it you
know offers right yet so they're working
on it but like HP's network thing yeah
um anyway we should talk about new stuff
stuff that actually is going to be
relevant and important ever burn yeah so
HTC just today invited us to go to an
event on the nineteenth of februari in
both New York and London I believe
simultaneously is that right yeah yeah
they should be concurrent yep yeah and
so I mean there's two really big
interesting things about that one is
whatever the big huge interesting thing
is that they're going on Allison too for
the first time I can remember it awhile
HTC isn't trying to you know make a big
announcement at overruled Congress me
maybe I'm wrong maybe they've got plenty
that they're saving up for a World
Congress that I'm just not expecting but
they're they're going the Samsung route
they're going the Apple route they're
trying to stand on their own two feet
and announce a big old product without a
trade show surrounding it yeah no it's
good I look III think that HTC has
reached the point where they are more
than entitled to do that I just fear as
an mwc goer and dieter as you're a goer
and Dan year ago or I am starting to
fear for the quality of the
announcements that we're going to get
out of that show and it's a little bit
different from CES where you know that
you're going to be able to still cobble
together a really fascinating narrative
about the goings-on and consumer
electronics I'm WC a cell phone focused
that without these anchor announcements
it makes you wonder what the show is
going to become and and I think that
that what is going to happen in the
short term is it's going to it's going
to be seated to the Chinese companies
and the the Taiwanese companies you're
going to see huawei and ZTE do
interesting things right so it's
interesting that HTC is deciding to what
we're presuming is separating itself
from the main mwc event because last
year they had their big one series
announcement and that was really
everything that a lot of people took out
of mwc last year even though the event
happened early on in the show there
wasn't anything else that really
detracted from that the big news was
HTC's big announced and HTC made the
show its own so it's interesting to see
that this year HTC feels compelled
enough to separate itself a week ahead
of the event and do its own thing even
though it's apparently going to be quite
big as it's in both New York and London
yeah I can't imagine that they'll circle
back and do another big announcement at
mwc but maybe they maybe they want to do
some big 12 punch I just
I don't know I don't see that happening
well I mean neither do I to me to be
perfectly blunt we've only seen leaks of
one important device ma that's HTC m7
we've seen a let's see what's most
recent thing is that it seems to share a
lot of DNA lot block with the droid DNA
which is not a surprise at all I think
we can fully expect a 1080p screen on
this thing and I think we can fully I'm
hoping that you know they're managing to
reduce the size of the bezel even
further so that they can you know make
make it a smaller phone overall and a a
4.7 inch screen at 1080p is really crazy
like that's crazy crazy MA um so yeah
I'm excited I hope that it is available
as more than just you know a droid or
whatever I also hope that it doesn't
just get put on sprint I and you know
we've talked sense to death and so I
really don't want to get into you know
my hopes for since five but you know we
talked about it last week I'm hoping it
looks good so I'm actually really
interested to see what HTC has here I
you know I feel like everything we have
to say about them we've said right like
hopefully they'll manage to get some
traction with this but the thing that's
interesting to me about can HTC get
traction is there's a lot less traction
available to a company like HTC we know
that rim is announcing blackberry 10
tomorrow we know that all four US
carriers are going to support it we also
have something else from Nokia that
we're expecting soon and we've got a
post from Tom which we'll talk about in
a minute about it maybe being a hero
device for verizon and you guys know my
pet theory that the phone that wins
that's not called the iphone is whatever
phone verizon decides to throw its you
know marketing weight behind I mean we
saw AT&amp;amp;T tried it with 920 and if you
know it did fine but it wasn't you know
a barn burner so like even if HTC
managed to score major coos and got a
bunch of support from carriers
especially in the US I mean there's only
so much support to go around right and
so I
HTC really has to just completely knock
us off our feet for this thing to have a
huge impact especially going up against
the galaxy s3 in the iphone 5 well so i
think that with this device so let's
assume that that what they announced on
the 19th is going to be this m7 that's
been leaked and let's assume that they
can get it on to carry ourselves in a
reasonable period of time they might
actually be opening up a nice little
window up between that launched and the
gs4 right which gives them of course i
guess the same thing happened last year
too so i realistically we don't know how
much of a window there they're going to
happen how much of financial impact
that's going to have for them but if
they can if they can get that lead that
might be what they need to to make a
splash with this thing because that is
the elephant in the room in the android
room right is is the the gs4 and that
product is obviously going to have a big
impact and i'm sure it's gonna be
available in all four US Nationals so
even if this this m7 also is the most
they can hope for going up against the
gs4 is a samsung alternative right be
interesting to some people but not
everyone and the thing to point out is
you know if Samsung does what I did with
the gs3 and the gs2 is like HTC's phone
is probably going to look and feel nicer
nice more better happier timer designed
I totally sorry your design yes yeah but
but it but Samsung just I mean we've
seen you know from there was the story a
couple weeks ago or three weeks ago
about how much just how much marketing
money samsung throws behind the galaxy
s3 it's insane and against that you know
juggernaut I mean there's only so much
to HTC could do and the best thing they
can do is have an amazing device and
that's what they need to show us on the
19th so it needs to be an amazing device
and amazing software because you know
with all things considered last year
with the 1x we all pretty much agree
that it was an amazing device hardware
wise but we were let down by the
software so if HTC is able to improve
sense enough with this sense 5 that
we've seen leaked numerous times now to
bring the software
up to the level that the hardware is
likely going to be at based on history
then but that would be its best fighting
chance for sure yeah I remain cautiously
optimistic that since five is going to
be a very compelling skin and I know
that Vlad disagrees with me but he's on
the show this week so he can that's all
right hahaha I I think that sounds about
the leaks we see we've seen precious
little of this UI but from what I've
seen I'm cautiously optimistic that
they're moving in the right direction I
know that I've said that before I said
it was sense for but but this is
definitely a noted improvement and it
looks it looks the most different it
looks like the biggest evolutionary jump
in sense since the introduction of sense
on Android with 1.6 I think yeah okay I
don't know obviously we'll have to see
when it when it's launched but I think
that might be a stretch to say Chris
yeah well put your money where your
mouth is five five dollars says it
sends five is better than sense for
hahaha five American dollars five
American dollars say that since five is
better than sense for yeah I will I
don't know if I'll take that bet oh snap
okay that's your now say I'll say uh no
no because you're saying that since five
is going to be the biggest you know
evolutionary leap since you know the
original sense and I think since 36 the
sense for was a huge difference like a
huge dramatic leap so listen you guys
we're not talking about the most
important software and UI design story
that we have right now with regard to
HTC and we really need to because it's a
huge it's a Titanic shift in my thinking
about how phones work and that's this
new HTC mini bluetooth well maybe maybe
as Chris earlier ridiculous there's this
HTC is planning a one-two punch maybe
this is the two punch o WC if you're not
familiar with what we're talking about
in its day written in China right now
bundling it with the butterfly in China
and it is a little tiny phone
little keypad and a little tiny screen
and send an end things and it's is
basically just a bluetooth headset that
has got some controls for like dialing
and answering calls and whatnot and end
is this play in a display so you know it
pairs up over NFC and it probably you
know gets your contacts and stuff from
the phone so the phone probably like
it'll you know you can send your
contacts over bluetooth so it's
basically like like a bluetooth car
stereo basically um yeah and I mean just
okay I either there must be there is
some cultural context I'm I'm see hmm
look if the phone docked you remember
that that old verizon phone that had a
like an Englishman all set that jet set
yeah yeah yes if this HTC mini docked
inside the butterfly I would be I would
be cool with it which arguably enough
the butterfly is probably big enough to
do this yeah yeah I I would be able to
get down with that yet not nothing
there's nothing else to say about the
mini oh oh oh and also if it played like
the original snake baby that would be
huge but I don't know if they'd be able
to secure the rights from nokia for that
I mean it's man so many things that are
wrong i did another thing to charge is
it how a camera on it to know I know
it's got a big camera can use it as a
remote control to control the The Magus
camera what yes it doubles as a remote
shutter trigger for the butterflies
camera according to oh come on I want
this thing in my life look it can all it
can't cost as an accessory it can't
possibly cost more than like a hundred
bucks right so you you know you buy it
at the same time that you buy your on
contracts droid DNA for instance yeah
I'm down coming in I'm on board this
crazy train that HTC is pulling up to
the station count me in
um I have nothing else to say other than
god speed you crazy train rider um so uh
rim tomorrow or it's happening they're
announcing blackberry 10 they promised
to have a couple more surprises they
have a Super Bowl ad entities they've
already talked about the fact they've
got a bunch of movie studios on board to
sell movies and red buoys we had a leak
that it looks like this is the most
interesting part it looks like Vodafone
in the UK might be selling this thing
like right away the z10 that would be
good that would be very good for them
then the last thing they need to do is
to do a Microsoft Surface style
announcement for they show a phone
without any date or price and say yeah
this will come eventually they need to
strike while the iron is hot yes yeah I
mean they just they need to release it
on all the carriers how they set a
carrier number ma I know remember yeah
rim is said like that over a hundred and
fifty carriers of it in testing um so
they're definitely pushing that it's
going to be available worldwide on as
many carriers as possible I may think
yeah do you think there's any chance
they'll show to ablett tomorrow no I
don't base on tell you why nothing is
leaked all right I would say no whereas
the z10 has leaked to high heaven yeah
the only thing we don't know about a
device that I can remember in the past
like literally like eight years that
hasn't leaked was whatever the last
phone was it got released on t-mobile
because literally nobody cared the curve
whatever whatever it isn't 15 I I try to
remember the name of this phone every
single week and I can never remember it
I never bother to look it up afterwards
it's you have held it out there right
yeah so like the way that I don't know I
mean you know we see apple stuff leaked
you know we see Android stuff leaked we
see everything leaked these days and rim
sort of led the charge how that stuff
back in the day
uh you know they get their stuff out two
testers we get their stuff out to their
corporate partners and it leaks and I
you know did the playbook well they
announced that one Bailey really they
showed the play dress way bug off like
yeah they showed it off like what a
dozen times before it officially
announced so yeah if they mention i see
it's a really bad idea for them to even
mention it out because if they tease it
like a in six months you'll have this
then it all will just be all standing
around talking about one's a tablet com
who's gonna care about the tablet and we
won't be talking about the phones which
presumably are coming much much sooner
right so it's still pretty crazy that
all things point to rim you know
releasing it to all touch screen version
way ahead of a board model oh yeah well
now way ahead right it's still going to
be in the same quarter or half of the
year I suppose yeah I guess it's it's
supposed to be but with but that we've
seen very few leaks of the keyboard
while we've seen it on camera a couple
times but nothing like we've seen of the
z10 itself so um it's just kind of
interesting that you know you know what
I want would you Horschel slider I don't
I don't want to pre three I mean I do
but I want I want I want them to do the
torch right with this new OS I want a
portrait slider I really do i'm willing
to have a fat phone in order to have
physical keyboard I gotta be honest with
you I'm on the exact opposite end and I
know that like this because you're right
i'm on the end of right and you're on
the end of stupid I mean a couple of
years ago I would have totally agreed
with you that you know a portrait
keyboard is like the the best thing ever
for text input but like you know today's
phones are so much more responsive that
autocorrect is so much better I'm so
much faster on a touchscreen keyboard
than I am with a fiscal while you were
just soliloquizing there I just tapped
out the Gettysburg Address on the
physical keyboard on this pre three I
just wanted no you didn't because the
spacebar probably wasn't responding so
it's all one big word insert stock
comment about thinking the venue pro is
greatest portrait slider date hahahaha
I seriously they need to take the the
chassis of that phone and just upgrade
the I mean if they can keep the hd2
alive for a decade thinkin they can
certainly upgrade the venue pro just
drop whatever on I put put put a jelly
bean or put blackberry 10 I don't care
just put something on it so rim is the
only company that cares about physical
keyboards period right which is what's
so crazy about them releasing the
touchscreen model first especially given
that all of their other like all
touchscreen phones have like been
miserable nightmarish pieces so dieter
I'm going to send you a link to Steve
Jobs um a keynote from Macworld 2007
when he and really I've never I've never
never heard never seen it was it good
did he well he made some very
interesting and I think important points
about my physical keyboards are stupid
right but what about the portrait slider
man no none of those points about having
more screen real estate apply when
you've got a magic key board that can
slide up remember need three screen I
guess if you want if I had a 4.7 inch
device like a nexus 4 here and I slide
the keyboard yeah how massive that would
be it would be like the most unwieldy
thing ever I know it's already pretty
unwieldy I mean look there is nothing
cooler than getting done with a call and
hanging it up just slamming the phone
closed well the weird like answering the
phone just popping it open like will you
pop open a portrait slider like I'm
gonna get stuff done now I almost swore
there um and and like you know sly doin
look tacky little code in no I just want
to be like wow I guess that's all cool
until the thing starts Oreo rotating on
you nobody they did okay with the torch
hardware right thinking oh right i mean
it wasn't the sexiest thing ever but
they did ok i guess hardware was all
right i mean the screen was terribly
terrible and the software was obviously
a nightmare um what the the weird thing
to me is that every carrier seems intent
on offering one like crappy low to
mid-range landscape slider but no one
cares about doing that
doing that yes the crappy landscape
slider I guarantee you that if your
tmobile and you go to Samsung and say
crap us out a landscape android phone
samsung is going to say excuse me I need
to use the bathroom and they're gonna
come back five minutes later with Lance
with that ring with the smileys exactly
that because that is the kind of service
Samsung about us and it's the tragic
thing about this isn't at 4 inches or
higher that like Lansky keyboards are
just stupid there's no way to adjust
them yeah i mean the four-inch landscape
keyboard phone man i mean you gotta you
gotta take a lot of fiber to pull it off
exactly I've been squeezing out yeah we
can smiley I just eat you're talking
about the emoticon yes yeah yeah that
was amazing that was an Android right
that was just running whatever that was
an rtos may I think it probably has chat
on it though yeah yeah probably yeah I'm
just I'm really proud that we brought
down to tears that makes me what else
the nexus 4 is actually on sale for
really real Dan mentioned before the
show tell us the joke you said because
it was a fun so uh I'm just
double-checking my sources here and my
sources being the Play Store but as of
the time that we went on air you could
still buy the nexus 4 in the place or
which means that it has been over four
hours in a row that you've been able to
place an order for the nexus 4 which
might be a like new record by about
three and a half hours but it's like a
continuous availability of the nexus 4
in the end it is still yes but it's like
they must have been stockpiling
inventory for the past like 12 weeks I
mean it's been so long since you could
buy a nexus 4 online that like they must
have just waited until they had an
entire warehouse piled to the ceiling
with these things and then they flip the
switch yeah that's my only guess and and
you can buy the bumper now and you know
obviously 8 and 4 16 gigabyte very
you still can't get the touchstone no no
and there's no record what ya think you
can 3d print your own touch to our
charging orb doc it's not you know the
full magnetic charge but yeah instead of
calling it the touchstone they should
have called it the feel rock they didn't
call it a touchstone know I know I know
but I'm saying that that they could have
called it the feel rock and then like it
would have been like a you know synonym
thing nevermind i just like to think of
LG and like the Y screen which is its
variation of samsung smart stay we also
League of a white Nexus 4 which looks
fine I think all of us want it yeah we
tried that so managing can you imagine
if that had LTE like I would die I was
odd I just died I would perish I'm back
on the nexus for this week and after
having use the iphone 5 for a couple of
weeks and the battery life isn't quite
as ridiculously bad as i remember but
it's still like that great and I said I
I gave up and went down that dark hole
of rooting it and putting a customer on
it just because he'd you really yeah did
I mean I uh yeah let's see where I'm at
today I'm at sixty-nine percent it's
been off of the charger for 10 hours oh
it sounds like yeah max is for max yeah
i'm at sixty-nine percent I've been off
since 6am so that's six seven eight
hours yeah so you're you you didn't have
the same issues like mine would be dead
by 3pm if I yeah and done that so i just
want to point out that i was up at 6am
yet again today i believe i called you
know you call me at seven i was already
awake okay yeah I call the you at six
though right yes includes excited yeah
and like how they just don't talk about
the nexus awkward no like android OS
twenty-four percent what does that mean
what is doing it I'd say the same thing
maps 11 / so well maps I know because
latitude is the worst and you can't my
candid are not know but if you turn it
off then Google now is not as good as it
ought to be wait Google Latitude still
exists yeah I know right
well it's like the you know keep locate
keep track of your location / time
feature and whatever anyway um man we're
just jamming through topics we haven't
even been on the air for so about the
white Nexus 4 I really want it I have no
hopes that we'll ever be available for
sale just because we saw the white
Galaxy Nexus as well and like Google
never sold that directly I don't know
where you could even get what you could
buy that I mean like you could yeah i
mean you that the white Galaxy Nexus was
one of those phones were like if you
knew somebody knew somebody the new a
guy who stood in some dark alley you can
go like talk to him and like he would
open his trench coat and he would be one
he would be nude but then to even you
would have some white Galaxy Nexus is
under his trench coat and like you could
buy one for twelve hundred dollars that
kind of phone and I have a feeling this
is gonna be the same thing rich means
that up I need to have one like I just
need to have it well it's like what I
have the experience it's like the white
sega game gear when I was it when I was
12 years old like it was the same
situation like you had import one from
Japan it was insane also with the Galaxy
Nexus you couldn't get the the stupid
extended battery for the gsm version
unless like you went to korea and like
you know had a dinner with an LG or
meanness an executive it was it was the
exact same situation right yeah um the
thing that I want the the unicorn uh
nexus for that I want even not counting
LTE is replace the glass back with the
ridiculously thin plastic back from you
know the Galaxy Nexus or some other
phone and just use that extra space for
battery give me an extra couple hundred
milliamps that would be awesome i'd be
down with that that good I mean to be
fair the battery in it is already pretty
big right it's 2,100 or something just
make the software more efficient there's
no reason that a 20 100 million of our
battery not running on LTE can't last
like the whole day and beyond well
here's here's what sucks like I picked
up my my parents iphone 4
recently I was like holy crap this is a
really thick phone and that that pisses
me off because like simply three or four
months ago or five months ago I would
have never dreamed that thought but like
now I've become accustomed to these
stupid seven millimeter thick phones and
now I can't use a nine millimeter thick
foam like creepy just just go back to
the tank usually the guy that wanted
yeast be the guy that was all about the
resound you thought that that was okay
oh my god result is awesome that my
sound oh great for 720p phone in the
u.s. result awesome be other they should
have they should have never gone from
nine to seven ish who their donors own
and they put better reach through the
screen look man I'm gonna be in my other
life loans we're gonna be a little
bitter stick hundred yeah you're gonna
be I'm California when you're riding
afraid to come to the city you're gonna
like snow plower South just but you know
be safe no I'm going to come to
California and Friday I'm gonna I'm
gonna personally see to it that that I
slap you with a glove like a gentleman's
fight anyway I have gloves for you Chris
but they should have well now i'm going
to use studded so so just so to keep our
readers in loop you guys are going to
find out eventually on the website but
the verge calm but i'm super jealous of
why chris is going to California and you
guys are going to find it to visit me in
your future courtrand yeah I actually
have a cameo in Terminator 5 are you
sure it's not fast 6 I was gonna say
well imagine hang on hang on imagine a
terminator fast mashup oh my face is
gonna melt off even stop now you didn't
astok the vast 6 trailer premieres this
sunday and I'm like I can barely contain
myself by throwing a super bowl and it
was just confirmed last week that Arnold
is going to be in Terminator 5 which is
also pretty excited so Chris the full
disclosure chris is going to California
to see a screening of fast 6 that would
be that would make my life uh but but no
anyway back to my original point I don't
know how we ended up on this tangent I
don't know what you're saying say you
should have net
gone below nine millimeters and they
should have just making the inside of
the phone thinner and used that
remaining space for battery and everyone
would have been happy fine it's hard to
sell a new phone they're like I could
totally see where they're coming from
though like it's a lot easier to sell a
new phone as its new and thinner and
lighter elder than the 920 sort of try
the tank I think and then definitely
kind of a kind of payable over here idea
but the 920 doesn't even have great
better I mean it's it's not bad but
battery life but it's not great it's not
particularly amazing so it did we kind
of tear it apart for being heavy and
thick yeah should i do the full like
weightlifter squat like um anyway so the
hospital yeah the noke in leisure the
users flagship windows phone on Verizon
what do we know about the laser so it
sounds like the laser is going to be
basically a cdma / LTE 700 block c / aw
or presumably AWS version of the of the
catwalk let's daily just like talking
about ieee spectrum all this occasion
just things about that we know about the
laser just like suck them all as all
y'all okay we have people we definitely
have people on this listening to the
show right now who appreciates spectrum
the way I appreciate why did this turn
into the troll Chris show I don't
understand if she doesn't deserve it it
does make it easy though so so that the
laser will probably be a carrier variant
of the catwalk which is expected to be
the successor to the 920 which I believe
we're expecting to see announced at mwc
so so the catwalk could actually end up
being the most interesting thing to
happen in Barcelona and this is it
sounds like nokia is going to go back to
aluminum construction which is something
they haven't really done since the na
yeah and I guess that's exciting news i
mean i thought that nokia has has done a
really amazing job with their poly
carbonate shells but i can see why they
would want like they probably feel left
out by the
aluminum train well I mean you could
definitely make a phone thinner with
aluminum then you can't rent with poly
cotton Polly's got to have some
thickness for rajula rigidness yeah I
mean I'm with you guys I love the the
the polycarbonate shell but does anyone
think it's kind of crazy that Nokia just
announced the 920 in October and here we
are in February and expecting to see it
success accessory coats like that is for
months yeah I mean yeah I do think it's
a little bit crazy but I mean let's not
forget that there's apple and there's
everybody else and everybody else is on
the faster cycle and they know when they
release new phone they bump sales and I
think that we can expect it from rim to
be perfectly honest they're using you
know off-the-shelf parts I think you
know I mean it's not fair to say uh you
know HTC is or Nokia's or even rim is
but I mean so yeah that's the chips are
the chips and they don't need to spend
you're developing this stuff they just
you know they can put it together put a
body on it design it well and and put it
out there so i think it's a it's just
par for the course now that we should
expect that everybody would Apple is
going to be on a faster cycle Samsung is
the only company to really buck that
trend and it's doing quite well for them
but I think everybody else they can't be
need a marketing it clear that I gotta
compete Samsung's doing quite well with
that because a it's doing that on the
high end but it's also just like
spraying the market with everything at
every price point right every size and
everything like that so do you think
that it's like the 920 had actually
taken off and done better that they
would spend more time on the catwalk its
replacement like is it they basically
put these things out there see if they
catch fire if they don't like well let's
not try and let this one burn for much
lawyer less replace it yeah I have to
believe that's the philosophy I mean if
the 920 was a runaway hit and they were
selling by the tens millions i doubt
that they would be I mean look at the
gs3 that it's been on a slow burn for
the past year or well it will have been
on a slow burn for a year by the time
the gs4 comes around and I I don't know
why by Nokia wouldn't like to be on the
I'm sure that that's every OEMs dream is
to be on that cycle right
and and I guess you know depending on
how things go for nokia it doesn't have
a nokia dream was to have high-end
phones on every single carrier in the US
at least and right now it's just a TT so
and speaking of 18 team we've got the
EOS which is apparently going to be a
quote-unquote true PureView handset for
ATT is that right that's that's what our
guy tom warren is saying and he knows
his things I this actually makes me
excited because I would love to I'm sure
dr. manaan is really excited about that
code name dear I I really love the 808 s
camera when I reviewed it I mean it was
like absolutely mind-blowing what you
could do with the the video and the
pictures and stuff like that so having
that in a much more capable smartphone
would be quite a treat I guess a game
that everyone's been waiting for when we
learned that PureView was coming to the
Lumia life yeah well so one problem here
and we knew this was going to happen
nokia has already diluted the PureView
brand right because they they called the
camera on the 900 a pier view I think no
the 920 late at night 2921 yeah right
okay so they've all you know I don't
know how they go back to like when this
comes out did they say no really for
real this time it's a pier view or like
are they gonna come out with like
another name for it or you know how are
they going to reestablish the uniqueness
of that device true plus P really like
it yes here plus you pureview plus
that's that's exactly what they need to
do um I want to go back to to one thing
you're saying a minute ago about like um
like you know the chips are out there
for for the via for the blackberries you
guys remember a couple years ago when i
know mike lazaridis was at d 9 or 78 or
denied and he's like oh it you know what
we can't do a blackberry 10 phone until
they have dual core chips well here they
hear you know we are like 18 months or
24 months later they missed an entire
cycle on that when two quad-core now I
mean come on well he also they also
tried to say that blackberry 10 was
delayed because LTE wasn't available
with the chips that they wanted and
things like that yeah they they were
they were they were issuing a lot of
blame to their component suppliers which
frankly did not deserve the blame right
uh I had nothing else to say about nokia
i mean i hope we see this stuff at
Mobile World Congress otherwise like I
don't know how we're gonna see what
World Congress we're going to see a ZTE
releasing a six point two inch phone oh
my god and and if we're lucky won't see
the note 3 there that's gonna be Eva
yeah that's gonna be fuh I mean that the
only chance of any I mean there's the
note 8.0 or whatever that we seen leaked
a couple times it's a tablet wish that
was a phone I really wish them is gonna
be a phone I just hope that we see a
beam to hear ya so Samsung can a
follow-up last year's awesome mwc
announcements yeah blockbuster but
obviously Samsung does its own thing and
we don't really expect to see anything
huge there yeah uh pebble uh we reviewed
it Neil I reviewed it he likes it it
does i think i think we all want one
yeah I mean yes and no I well I just
don't think look I think the pebble is
like a really exciting product and I'm
really happy to see that that somebody
has finally pushed the notion of a
smartphone into like the mainstream head
space or at least my logging nerd head
space right that's my watch yes um so
but like the thing with the pebble is
like I'm happy with what it is now but
uh you know in six months I anticipate
being unhappy with you know it hasn't
kept up with development and I really
think that if Apple or Google decide
they want to get into the space because
they control the platform's directly
they can do much more interesting things
and so control the platforms and they
also have gobs and gobs of leverage with
with you know manufacturers and
suppliers at their disposal right so I
do one of those companies could you know
on a whim turn around the most amazing
SmartWatch anyone has ever seen yeah so
like evel's great and you know the thing
that I said in our best of CES thing was
that you know sometimes you need to
remove the bells so you can make a
better whistle and they did that like
they they made it work for the things
that it does is best that they could and
they didn't over shoot what they were
trying to do and that'll come later
hopefully and we've seen a lot of other
smartwatches be way too ambitious so
this is this is crazy but I'm going to
draw this parallel anyways but that
pebble is to the SmartWatch what the
original iphone was to the smartphone in
that to the original iphone when it was
first released was really kind of a
dumbed-down thing just like you were
saying that pebble is there's there was
a lot of features missing but the
features that had worked very well and
it was very accessible to a larger
number of people than what had come
previous we've seen a lot of
smartwatches on the market chris has
reviewed I think every single one of
them are at least used every single one
of them and all of them try to do a lot
of things and they all kind of fail
because either they're too cumbersome to
use or their hardware doesn't live up to
their expectations and things like that
whereas the pebble is more or less if
you know you're into so if your type of
person that would actually think about
wearing a SmartWatch you can probably
use the pebble without any issues as far
as getting it set up and working and
things like that even though it doesn't
have all of the features that you might
want eventually if your SmartWatch runs
Android you blew it then that is so true
and I feel like I feel like the the end
game for all these guys and I said this
in my metawatch review last year i think
that the end game the only way to really
make this a successful industry is to
target the very same clientele that
wristwatches have been targeting for a
century which is you know people who are
looking for a fashion accessory and it's
just that this happens to be a very
smart fashion accessory in order to do
that you need to take the core you take
the guts of some
like a pebble and make it available in
you know literally 75 or 100 different
styles you need be what be able to walk
into the fossil store in your local mall
and they have an entire case of
smartwatches that all look completely
different because people don't want a
single wristwatch they want one that
looks good to them and works for their
style right and we're a long way from
that so the the only way to make this a
viable ecosystem is if the gatekeepers
want there to be a viable ecosystem you
know the pebble does okay with what's
supported by bluetooth and what's
supported by iOS and by Android but
where's the motivation other than us
clamoring for there to be an ecosystem
for either these companies to improve
that especially if they're working on
their own watches right like why would
Apple work to develop a vibrant multi
manufacturer or SmartWatch ecosystem
when they could just own the entire
thing yeah this is true and and you know
I think that Apple me I don't know what
Apple is doing there I kind of want to
believe that they intentionally moved
the ipod nano away from that form factor
to make room for a future product I've
heard rumblings in fact theater I think
we were exchanging emails about this
I've heard rumblings that that
third-party developers are seeing some
like weirdness that there seemed like
the you know the framework that the
scaffolding for a really full featured
and rich Bluetooth Low Energy uh you
know ecosystem inside iOS 6 but it's not
fully implemented and they think that
parts are kind of being kept under wraps
or they're only partially exposed for
for exposure in say iOS 7 along with
maybe the launch of something like an
iWatch so that you know that that's
certainly a possibility and an apple is
probably the only cut well Google to
they could both create I think a very
commercially successful product like
that that goes on the wrist but
long-term I truly believe that if you're
going to make a smart
watch industry the only way to do it is
to is to make it make it a wristwatch
and and that's something that no one has
done yet except for Casio and citizen
who are of course traditional wristwatch
players and citizen has the proximity
which is a gorgeous watch and from a
distance you can't tell you know close
you can't tell it it's a Bluetooth watch
and it's fatal flaw is that it can't
give you alerts for messages which is
insane and Cassio makes a Bluetooth 4.0
gchat but it also can't alert messages
so I don't those are both Japanese
companies I don't know if there's like
some like I don't know if maybe like met
message alerts are not a big deal there
maybe and and so that's why they didn't
think to include them but it's
completely insane to me moving on
awkward transition I want to talk about
this the fact that if a carrier doesn't
want you to its now technically illegal
to unlock your phone if it's subsidized
by carrier thanks to lapsing of a thing
that library Congress did for from the
DMCA like everything about this just
like makes me sad yeah I you know I
don't want to advocate crime but you all
should unlock your phone so okay well
this is a Vogon civil disobedience it's
nice right across civil divorce rates I
don't know why the DMCA is like part of
this I mean it's a justification that
like technically the carrier owns a
phone because it's subsidized and so
therefore they can say what it is it
belongs what's what's so crazy about
this story is that like it wasn't voted
on it wasn't you know vetted by anybody
it was you know a librarian of Congress
that read the DMCA in a certain way
interpreted it to mean this and then
like enacted this and odd is that's how
it got freed in the first place it was a
librarian of Congress so I mean don't
hate on librarians I'm just saying not
librarians as a whole but this
particular judgment was maybe a lapse or
maybe he was heavily influenced by
lobbying which is really what I kind of
happened um and unfortunately all of us
that are interested in the locking our
phones are kind of getting the raw deal
on it because of this interpretation I'm
not unlocking my phone right now yeah I
guess the idea is you can you can still
you could theoretically by unlock phones
easily and so they don't need to protect
consumers anymore I mean kind of can you
I'm easily wear this really burns you
those I was actually talking about this
with some friends of mine who are not
like super into into phones and things
like that and they're like well what do
I care if I if I you know by phone from
ATT I'm going to have to have service
from ATT anyways and I'd have to pay a
termination fee to switch to t-mobile
and blah blah blah and I was like well
that's all fine and dandy when you're at
home but as soon as you travel into
another country and you want to put a
local sim card in you can't and then
you're stuck paying your exorbitant
roaming fees that are set by carriers
that you might have never heard of um
and that's where it really kind of gets
you if you don't have the ability to
unlock your phone no it's like so I mean
you know i unlock phones all the time
when it was illegal I'm gonna continue
to do it now that it's illegal again see
you in a reason bro yeah we just had
this next week you know six six month
period where like we had sanity and now
it's gone and that makes me sad you know
of all these uh these cell phone these
notorious cell phone on lockers on death
row you're gonna be a one-hour prasar
prisons filled with cell phone buckers
yeah and cell phone unlocking is a
gateway drug it is something else
jailbreaking be yeah well no
jailbreaking still okay jailbreaking is
cool yeah but I want the double entendre
uh-oh we haven't talked oh my god we
have there's a brand new version of iOS
and like that's well well theoretically
a point one update I wouldn't call that
a brand new version let's just say I'm
not seeing jony ive's influence yet in
rest in fact you are that maybe works
it's going the opposite direction
because the one design thing that I've
noticed is if you are using the music
player on the lock screen the controls
are different and they're aluminum eyes
now so yes oh no oh there's there's one
other design thing too if you go into
passbook now there's there's a new card
that's like hey this is passbook it's
awesome hey good cuz I I suspect that no
one was using passbook so they felt
compelled to put a card in there so that
people know what the heck past passbook
is real isn't that something yeah it
shows a card i use a passbook but it has
it has a button in there that that takes
you out to the app store with a view of
like all the passbook enabled apps right
and to be there I mean one thing in this
starbucks and no I've actually used it
quite a bit like I use it for starbucks
i use it for United all use it for luft
hansa um and walgreen cuz you fly
Lufthansa all the time yeah good point
when I'm flying between Chicago New York
it's always a love times of flight ya
know but but I am actually flying left
ons at mwc excellence i'm looking
forward to sampling their passbook
invasion you know i don't know who i'm
flying off the look you're flying over
at harrahs applying our pants yeah okay
oh yeah i do that i sent you that email
oh right i know more about your
itinerary than than you do exploited
yeah Oh plane is dieter flying on what
kind of kind of plane crisp probably an
a330 would be my guess but I don't know
that for a fact I'm out of 767 that's
what I know all i know is this going to
be uncomfortable and already cramped and
unhappy yeah and it perhaps it'll be
something to write about
indeed uh-uh so Chris wrote up this
really great breakdown of verizon sold a
bunch of spectrum to ATT for a really
exorbitant amount of money or and it's
pending approval Chris broke down
exactly what that means this week and it
means a 18t might not be using its AWS
spectrum right great yeah yeah I was
really I mean so I'm in I'm in an 18
tlte market where they have a like very
very little bandwidth and there are I
think five or six major Americans
nationwide where that's the case where
they kind of got shafted in the 700
megahertz auction so they they had both
708 of us standing by but they'd only
rolled out 700 and the the assumption
for a long time now has been that they
would eventually light up AWS and indeed
all of AT&amp;amp;T LTE phones support both 708
of us well what has happened there have
been two major incidents in the past
year that have led everybody including
myself to start to believe that AWS does
not factor into 18 tease plans one the
first thing that happened was the
breakup not break up at the failure of
the AT&amp;amp;T t-mobile merger and one of the
terms of that failure was that 18t would
give t-mobile a bunch of AWS spectrum
which coincidentally has is one of the
things that has really helped t-mobile
firm up it's aight LTE plans between
that and the metropcs purchase and then
the other thing that happened was this
deal where verizon is giving not giving
selling a bunch of 700 megahertz
spectrum 280 and AT&amp;amp;T is giving a bunch
of AWS spectrum mostly in western
markets to verizon so you know a couple
years ago verizon was a hundred percent
all in on 718 t was splitting its
its prospects between seven hundred and
eight of us and then now Verizon bought
a bunch of AWS from spectrum code that
that cable company consortium that we
wrote about last year gave a little bit
of that to tmobile to get the FCC off
its back and now they're getting more
from AT&amp;amp;T so they've kind of flip
flopped verizon is is going to go with
two different bands 18t at least in the
short term is all in on 700 it looks
like and then longer-term they'll be
looking at the incentive auctions and
and WCS which we wrote about ever report
up on that it's linked in in the the
report I wrote last week uh but yeah
it's it's a very dramatic time to be
following the spectrum story in the US
but what do you imagine that I'm sorry
imagine if we saw companies playing
these kinds of shenanigans and doing
this kind of horse trading with like
national park land right that's what
this is right like we were like oh yeah
you guys go ahead and borrow the parks
for a while that's cool you got to pay
us some money for it but you know make
sure you do some public good with that
we guess you know because it seems nice
and then they just are like make sure
you pay us some money for it yeah they
go well you want a little bit of redwood
well I can give you some Yellowstone I
don't know it's like come on so yeah I
just regulate this stuff I have no idea
is just in turn down up and regulate
inside money yes exactly orangi AT&amp;amp;T up
I would love to understand I would have
loved to been a fly on the wall in some
of these intro meetings in AT&amp;amp;T where
they decided to not deal with AWS cuz I
don't know what I don't know if they
just wanted to concentrate on on 700
because of its superior building
penetration and you know it's probably
you complaining about chicago's ago
basically most you know what it is you
know what it is you know it is there in
a board meeting and to talk about AWS
and some was like AWS that smells like
smells like t-mobile we hate them now
and they just said no they just killed
that's it hey that's entirely possible
yeah this brings up the question for me
at least so
a verizon owned this spectrum and is in
the 700 megahertz and now it's being
sold to ATT does that mean that I'll be
able to use an AT&amp;amp;T phone on Verizon at
some point in the future you would like
to think so but the answer is most
definitely cuz it's illegal to unlock
your phone well it's it's unlegal it's
illegal to unlock your phone a and B
these are different blocks so 700 is
divided into five blocks a spectrum that
span a fairly significant amount of
bandwidth there's a b c d and e verizon
occupies the nationwide c block but they
also for god only knows what reason had
a bunch of dormant B Block sitting
around this morning according the B
Block yeah so they could use it for the
stupid National Park horse trading for
the stupid Nashville parcours trading
that's right and AT&amp;amp;T uh they used the B
Block so it was a very convenient trade
but I do think it is you know these
carriers are treating this spectrum
they're basically holding it hostage as
an investment in many cases and not
actually deploying it and using it the
way it was meant to be used and that is
one of my greatest frustrations as a
writer in this industry is the fact that
but not you know these guys aren't using
every last drop of spectrum that they
can well at the same time they're
they're screening from the highest hill
tops about the quote unquote spectrum
much I don't know why I'm all sudden hot
under the collar about the spectrum
thing now because there's certainly been
worse shenanigans but it's like it's
like you know okay I'm nokia sold their
headquarters and now they're renting it
back and who's a bunch of companies do
that and it's always a really bad sign
right right well we're selling our
spectrum and then renting it back i mean
we could at least like still manage the
building right nokia is still hiring the
janitors and they run the building
mm-hmm it's our spectrum man just like
the Everglades everything so maybe it's
in so swampy morass with filled with
crocodiles
alligators and lies and lies and pythons
apparently an icon problem in the
Everglades phones I can't work on more
than one carrier yeah us spectrum is the
Everglades that's I think we can just
leave it at that hot sticky okay ah that
friends is a virgin mobile show we want
to thank you so much for watching if you
want to watch us again next week you
probably can if you want to leave a
comment on the post you can and i
believe the new plan is for it to be
like one true post room also just leave
it on the posterior watching out or with
your listening to it go find eagle send
us an email its mobile show at the verge
calm i am back on dan is DC seifert with
an e I Chris's e power Vlad is vlad
savov we're all at merge and we'll see
you guys next week probably we'll see
Sita thanks guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
