versions these days is that you only get
a few cosmetic changes up at the top and
most of the interesting stuff is
happening under the hood and here's
what's changed with the new Android oh
so the first change you might notice is
the new notification Docs this is Google
adopting something that Apple already
does with a iPhone a lot when you have a
notification or any alert that an app
wants to send you you have a dot one of
the neat things is that the color
automatically matches the icon itself
so here with the Switzer thing and you
can just wipe it away so you don't have
to go to notification store anymore you
can swipe it away from there jump it in
to the email app here this is neat
Google shoulders a demo where when you
have something like an address
machine-learning integrated into
Google's apps is going to pick that up
and immediately help you select the full
address rather than just a piece of text
it's not happening in this demo or in
this device itself but when Google
shoulder on stage is really neat so you
just double tap and it automatically
knows the entire dress and selects it
for you you can just copy and paste it
as well so it's probably one of the most
requested features that Google just
added and row and it's picture and
picture so when you're watching a
YouTube video if you just go to home the
video carries on playing and you can
continue using the phone as normal and
you can just reposition it wherever you
like and just carry on watching as
you're going now the issue with this is
that it's unsupported on YouTube bread
so if you don't have a YouTube red
subscription doesn't work for you so you
only have a youtube bread and Google geo
which is their video chat client other
third-party supports is expected to come
in the future
Google doesn't have anything to say at
publish another neat thing that Google
has done is autofill so if you have your
login details on twitter.com with a
Chrome browser it remembers them for
apps that you have on Android so as in
this case it picked up the information
from pro and involves you inter Switzer
into the Twitter app via your login and
your password from from the web browser
besides that the notifications tray has
only really changed cosmetically the
little edit icon and the Settings icon
we move down to the bottom rather than
up at the top but still it's mostly the
same thing the settings menu is actually
the thing that has changed quite a bit a
few things being reorganized but also
when you go into a particular submenu
most things have been relegated to this
Advanced section so you only really get
the primary settings and then you jump
to the Advanced section to get the full
set Gugu is also kicking in some
suggestions for when you're setting up
the phone I'm guessing the number of
suggestions would reduce once you start
doing things but broadly speaking is
still Android the way so it's been so
things you probably won't see when you
first boot up Android out but you would
definitely appreciate something that
Google names vitals and these are
stability security battery life and just
general speed of the interface the first
thing is actually you will notice this
it's a boot up time with Android oh the
Google pixel boots up twice as fast and
is super impressive you immediately get
a sense of the improvement of speed
there in terms of stability I can't say
anything about it now we see better
software so that will be later this year
when Android all comes out just as
everything else here in Google i/o is
later this year and it's a security goo
Goo's introducing a thing called Google
Play protect which isn't really a new
thing who has been scanning for
malicious apps on Android
for a long time but Google Play protect
is essentially branding it and just
making it more visible to people and
just essentially reminding them to make
use of that feature and just to know
that it's there as to better life
Google's doing a couple of things to
control background resource issues by
apps so first of all is location when an
app is in the background and also
location Android oh one activated GPS
and the actual device sensors it would
just give it the last-known location
that the phone had and when the app is
in the foreground that's when you will
use the location hardware on the phone
so that will save in better life you
lose spooning these things wise limits
it's doing the same with other resources
that an app might use in the background
just making sure that the better life is
as long as possible
overall is the same old Android but a
whole bunch of under the hood
optimizations which is or we can really
ask for so traditional thing yeah the
traditional thing with Android these
days is only
the common thing would every Android
version each year is there is only a few
cosmetic time why can AskMe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
