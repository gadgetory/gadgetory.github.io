Reykjavik and into the Icelandic
countryside one of my favorite places in
the world we are headed for a waterfall
should get there just around sunset and
we'll be testing some slow-motion and
some other stuff and it's going to be a
really awesome place to do
I am the messenger all right so we have
this side-by-side rig with the 5s and
the 6 shooting of the 6 plus and this is
gonna be awesome for testing stabilizer
panel mode all kind of stuff cuz we can
do real-time side-by-side comparison
amazing thing about Iceland is it can be
storming and raining like crazy and then
you can just drive a mile
clouds are opening up and it creates
this beautiful scene looks like it's
about right so fun to be playing with
this device that makes it easy to after
great images
we are rolling up on a beautiful area
called Thor's smirk which is a
playground of Thor in Icelandic I was
looking at the way that the light is
hitting the piece and thought it might
be an awesome area to test a time lapse
so we're doing that and it's pretty easy
you just switch it into time-lapse mode
and hit go and takes care of everything
else and I think it's going to turn into
a really awesome piece we just pulled up
at the Iceland coastguard flight
operations center and we are about to
board a training mission where they will
be hoisting I think people outside the
chopper I may even get hoisted I don't
know what's gonna happen
they'd be proficient we have to tain
this certain amount so many times every
month so that's what this this is going
to be right before I waste you know some
traps okay and the only thing that can
go wrong is that if you holding auto
race or bring your hands up so you can't
hold on to that school okay hold the
camera
good morning we are here at the yoghurt
Chatillon glacial Lagoon and the
glaciers are floating in this Lagoon and
it's really beautiful they also move
they flood around so we decided a time
lapse
just drove up a random Hill by random I
mean we were driving and we saw a street
and we said hey let's try that and go
for about 30 minutes in the doctor's
office mountain and also a enormous
structure we're gonna be able to get
back up incredible
glacier got some killer images of it the
tones there's a few shots that are
literally zero color it looks like I've
already converted to black and white but
shot full-color and anyway we got out on
the ice a little bit and it was really
really special
we're on the southwesternmost supervised
land and is a really special placing
eyes one of my favorite places I've ever
seen the lights but it's also beautiful
for sunsets and just coastal 30 frames a
second
we just finished a focused pixels and
auto focus continuous auto focus cats to
the iPhone 6 plus vs. the iPhone 5s it
was a pretty impressive test actually
what we did is we we have the cameras
mounted side by side - 5s and iPhone 6
you can see the cameras are as close as
possible to each other and we held a
rock in front of the cameras started
enrolling at the same time and here
they're tack sharp on the rock at the
time it was thrown actually by the time
it landed the iPhone six-plus was able
to refocus on the water and was tack
sharp on the splash in the iPhone 5s
actually never did refocus so it's a
pretty impressive improvement versus
what we've had in the past we are here
it's the end of the week and everything
comes down to this and we've been
dumping footage and editing pictures and
assembling everything all night actually
I haven't slept yet
and we'll be posting my review here in
just a couple of hours I hope you've
enjoyed it so far and check out the
in-depth review on my blog
