and the Walkman to the dawn of the
digital and high-definition arias to 3d
and now ultra high-definition TV in high
resolution audio and of course any type
of platform Sony is always a leader out
in the front Sony's network vision is to
deliver rich entertainment experiences
that empower you to discover connect and
engage with your favorite content on
virtually any device when and how you
want as we built the new network we
asked ourselves what if we could unlock
Playstations library of games so that
they're instantly available on
PlayStation devices as well as non
PlayStation devices we've been steadfast
in our commitment to make this a reality
and have made incredible advancements
towards integrating GEICO's advanced
cloud-based technology into our network
I'm pleased to announce the new
streaming game service PlayStation now
this service will in the long term
provide existing PlayStation gamers with
instant access to the games they love
from previous generations from the
original PlayStation ps2 and ps3 equally
important the service will also
introduce the world of PlayStation 2
even non console owners wire smart
phones televisions and other devices
today I'm thrilled to announce that Sony
will introduce a new cloud-based TV
service in the US this year the service
will give you the most popular live TV
programs combined with a large library
of video on-demand content so people
will have all of their favorite movies
TV shows and sports programs available
through a single destination we plan to
start testing this service in the US
later this year now at the beginning of
this presentation I share with you about
my childhood and how I became enchanted
by what might be possible and that
curiosity has continued to grow within
me and today I've even more excited and
inspired by what might be next
so when looking forward as Andy
described our desire is to break out of
the confinements of physical places or
even primary devices as the only points
of access Sony will be releasing
products to a very near future that will
create an entirely new concept of
consumer electronics these concepts will
reshape our personal media landscape and
transform our living spaces into
evolving environments we're envisioning
and creating a world where people can
enjoy where you can enjoy new ways of
experiencing entertainment freely and
without the restrictions of frames boxes
and displays and with its stylish design
this ultra short throw projector enables
a cinematic like experience to be
wherever you want it to be it's easy to
install and is capable of projecting a
147 inch 4k image and I'm happy to
announce that the first version of this
product will be available to consumers
right here in the united states this
summer and i believe it's time to move
beyond the just good enough era no more
commodity products no more parity parts
no more just good enough products we
must and we can do better
