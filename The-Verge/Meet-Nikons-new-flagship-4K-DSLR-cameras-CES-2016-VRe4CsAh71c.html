where Nichkhun just announced two DSLRs
this is a high-end one the d5 which is a
long-awaited update to the d 4 and D 4s
which our high-end pro cameras used for
kind of sports and so on the upgrade
here is there's a 20 megapixel sensor
inside there is a new autofocus system
with a hundred and fifty three points
you can shoot at super high frame rate
so you can shoot at 12 frames a second
with autofocus in between each frame and
14 frames a second in a mirror lock-up
mode which doesn't give you continuous
autofocus there's also a touchscreen
which is a bit unusual for a camera like
this and it's also capable of 4k video
recording so this is the D 500 from the
club like the the private has a 20
megapixel sensor but unlike it it's D
exercise so that's aps-c it's a smaller
sensor which means the the body's a bit
more compact and so are the lenses as
well and this is actually the the new
flagship the X camera from recon it's
something that he considers have been
waiting for for quite a while it's more
of a follow-up to the d300s then they're
kind of the 7000 series that becomes
focused on a play more interesting than
the traditional guts on this camera are
the connectivity options it has Wi-Fi
and Bluetooth
which is pretty unusual for a DSLR and
the Bluetooth is used for nickels nice
snap bridge protocol and it's Bluetooth
Low Energy and the idea is that it's
always on
so you're just shooting and the images
get transferred straight to your phone
what the camera represents is a letter
from a con to kind of make a DSLR that
still stands out in the modern age it
works well with the smart devices that
we all carry with us so you know we'll
have to wait to see how the software
works but it's an encouraging sign for
now so we're still very much in the
early days of CES stay tuned to the
verge calm and please subscribe to us on
