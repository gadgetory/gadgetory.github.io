senior writer with a verge and I'm here
with Tony gallupi the co-founder and
executive chairman of bitpay
hi Natasha hi nice to meet you so this
is bitcoins biggest presents at CES ever
right
Bitcoin also happens to be in the news a
lot right now it started a few days ago
with a drop in stock price and then
recently the second largest exchange was
hacked and 5.1 million dollars is is in
the either somewhere so it's kind of a
strange time to have like this more
professionalized presence and then yet
like the headlines are different so how
do you feel about that going into it
well you know Bitcoin is a new industry
and there's certainly lots of challenges
and you know we've had to really
reinvent a lot of our inner workings and
accountings to be able to function and
survive in this new digital currency age
because you know when you work with
digital currencies when they move they
move and you can't get them back and you
can't really trace them so you really
have to be very careful about everything
you do from a security perspective
everything that you build every server
that your that your your code is written
on or deployed on you need to understand
you know who has access to that and and
who potentially could could get into
your system so we've been coming to CES
for four years this is our fourth year
here and the first couple years there
were two or three Bitcoin companies and
then this year we have ten so there's a
tremendous growth from last year to this
year in terms of the the types of
Bitcoin companies that are growing up to
the point where they have a marketing
budget and they've gotten some venture
funding and and they can get out so
there's a great variety here we've got
two exchanges two wallets a couple of
merchants you know an ATM of course
bitpay the leader in merchant service so
and so the other big difference is the
amount of investment that these kinds of
companies are getting bitpay in
particular has funding from a number of
high profile individuals Ashton Kutcher
Matt Moll
founders funds which is Peter Thiel's
venture capital fund can you talk a
little bit about how the infusion of
venture capital has affected me in the
street yeah so when you compare let's
say 2013 to 2014 in 2013 there was I
think about eighty or ninety million
dollars in venture capital invested in
Bitcoin companies in 2014 it was almost
four hundred million dollars
so about a four times growth in one year
and kind of mimics the early days of the
internet around 1994 1995 when companies
like Amazon and eBay and Dell we're
really getting started and we're
starting to build their teams and build
their products so we're kind of at that
stage in in bitcoins lifecycle now but
you know venture capital does a couple
things right it allows us to hire really
good engineers we have to develop
software because we're a software
company and just talent is extremely
limited every software company from top
to bottom is short on developers so you
need to be able to recruit and and and
find and retain the best talent you can
we also have sales marketing compliance
you know finance all the things that you
need to run a business especially a
business and handles money so all that
takes time and resources so it surely if
this is a showcase it couldn't have felt
I mean from the people I've talked to it
seems like this is just a hiccup like
you said it's a new market there's a
long term trajectory but surely it can't
feel good to have a showcase right
before a bunch of little to 5.1 million
dollar hiccups right before you go in
yeah yeah I mean look bitcoin is a young
industry there's going to be these
hiccups and and the best thing we can do
as a company is to try to build our
service to you know absorb as many of
these speed bumps as you can and
certainly we want to insulate our
customers insulate our merchants from
any you know drama of the day that that
happens in Bitcoin right so we've we try
to do that as best we can
you know we you know try to make sure
that that our systems are as good as
they possibly can be you know in the
events that happen this week our service
was just fine there were no
interruptions to our service you know
some of our merchants were getting
questions from reporters and we said
yeah you know we we insulate you guys
from that there's
nothing to worry about so you know as
we've seen these incidents take place
the entire industry learns from every
mistake right so whatever the root cause
of this incident was this week we're all
going to understand the root cause and
we're all going to improve our platforms
to make sure that doesn't happen again
so over time you're going to start to
eliminate a lot of the probable causes
and possible causes of errors that can
be made if you look back three years ago
seems like every week something was
going wrong we're not making any of
those same mistakes again well but you
know they're they're different so I
think well you know we don't know the
details of what happened this week but
apparently it was only you know 1% of
the funds that they have now it was
customers money right so we know if they
have reached out to a few people and it
seems that their intention is to go
ahead and make those customers hold
their up their adventure back to company
right they have enough it reserves to
absorb this right yes it's not like
Mount GOx where 90% of their so so
people have learned well we're only
going to put 1% at risk and and they may
have even had insurance on this like we
don't know so there's lots of
opportunities or lots of details still
to come out but if you compare just the
event of this one compared to mount
docks it's you know several automatic
Mateusz less in in severity and
right and I think that would probably be
the difference between a good actor and
a backpack so say you had bit like would
you if somebody had a you know their
position in Bitcoin right now would you
say hold sell buy what's your
recommendation
you know bitcoins been up and down if
you look at it two years ago when we
were at CES it was 13 dollars last year
we were here was around $700 right it's
- it was on my way in yeah okay
so so it's it's been volatile it's it's
kind of what you expect from an
early-stage tech stock or a newly
discovered commodity if you look at the
early history of oil when we first
discovered petroleum right it was really
volatile you know if you were to be able
to to track the minute-by-minute
valuation of Twitter when it was a
start-up right it would just be bouncing
all over the place
their stock is not doing so much yeah
but they're they're a more mature
company now so I think that you know
when you look at the potential for
Bitcoin I think there's a tremendous
opportunity to really start to gain
market share and open new types of
payments that weren't possible before
doing micro payments and tipping online
you know doing peer-to-peer payments of
small amounts anywhere in the world but
you can't do that with anything today
but there's huge markets that are
available well you seem like the way
you're describing it is as a is tamp
down from you know some of maybe the
early panels I would go to one Bitcoin
where you know Charlie Shrem
for example described it as cash with
wings and you know like change the world
potential which which start-ups have a
predilection to to claim that can change
the world so do you like how has that
adjusted like there's a big difference
between like an alternative and an an
entirely an alternative cryptocurrency
and an entirely new system yeah I mean
it Bitcoin is a big deal it's probably
the biggest innovation we've seen since
the invention of the Internet
it's going to change a lot of things
it's gonna take I think a lot longer
than some people expect some people
think it's gonna change the world
overnight it's gonna take a lot longer
than them how on earth I mean with all
of these Falls filled with basically
companies that have some connection to
the internet would Bitcoin be even more
impactful than than that than the
invention of the Internet well it's
interesting you know we see a lot and
even at this show people are talking
about the Internet of Things where
machines and devices can now you know
start to be connected with Bitcoin now
each device can actually have its own
you know wallet in its own payment to be
able to make decisions and buy things
you know credit cards don't really work
for that there's a t-shirt that one of
the engineers at one of these companies
has and he wears it in the office and it
says in the internet of things nobody
knows that you're a refrigerator so you
know bitcoin has a digital currency it
makes sense for digital devices to be
able to communicate with each other you
know it's it's easy to transact anywhere
in the world you know I can send a
nickel worth of Bitcoin from here to
China instantly that's not possible with
any other technology I'm okay one last
question like who you know how did the
connection between Silicon Valley and
Bitcoin get started is there one was it
the fact that these well-known figures
like Matt long wig from WordPress or
Ashton Kutcher who's also an investor in
your company did they help make the
connections like how did those
yeah so some of the some of the early
companies that got some very early
venture funding in 2012 maybe early 2013
we're on the west coast to a Seattle in
San Francisco you're typically had an
investor that saw the potential for
Bitcoin and saw a startup which may have
been two or three guys with a little
project and said yeah I want to give
them a couple hundred thousand dollars
to see if their project can take off you
know then you know in late 2012 you know
you mentioned Matt Mullenweg well
WordPress was a customer of bitpay yes
they were probably the first like major
household name that everybody would
recognize that said we're going to
accept Bitcoin and we're gonna do it
worldwide and they chose bit so
WordPress was actually a customer of us
and they were using it and a lot of it
was driven by Matt he's like well yeah
he said you know I I have a service that
really anybody in the world with
internet access can come to WordPress
and create a blog but I have a problem
in that I can't take a payment from
two-thirds of the world and I have to
give my service away for free and I have
to really limit it just because PayPal
and credit cards don't work with
two-thirds of the world's population so
he's almost two-thirds of the world have
access to Bitcoin
they're getting there and actually
bitcoin is growing in the developing
world more in wet areas South America
Asia are are growing very large for
Bitcoin so he said look you know even if
maybe only a fraction of 1% of people
have it at least it's better than
nothing and he sees the potential I said
yes I mean if somebody from Africa wants
to upgrade their bought blog and buy
more storage or more bandwidth in a
better design pack I'd like to be able
to take their money and I can do that
with Bitcoin so Matt was a customer of
ours with WordPress and then he invested
and you know we kind of pulled together
an early syndicate of guys like
Shaquille Kahn who you know and that was
our early seed round and that helped us
you know really start to hire some more
engineers and continue to build the
product beyond the you know the
the early service that my co-founder and
I bill okay well thank you for talking
to me I really appreciate it yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
