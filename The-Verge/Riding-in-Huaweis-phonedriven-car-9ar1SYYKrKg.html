barcelona's beautiful Stadium and we are
going to see what Huawei claims is the
world's first self-driving car powered
by a smartphone they're using the make
10 pro and it's given 970 chip which has
AI capabilities inside it and what they
claim is that the processing inside the
phone is going to help the car detect
and avoid obstacles behind the camera
there is a Porsche Panamera with a mate
10 probe mounted on the dashboard going
forwards and backwards and forwards and
backwards over there there were a bunch
of cardboard cutouts
there's a giant soccer ball there's a
guy with a bike there's a dog and the
foot on the first run the Porsche is
driving at five miles an hour and during
that time it's learning to recognize the
objects and we are going to say like
what to do when it sees the object like
we should've swerve right should it make
an emergency stop or so on then on the
second run it's going to drive at 30
miles an hour it's going to recognize
one of the objects and hopefully if the
system works it will act accordingly
we're waiting for the USBC connection to
work story a story of my life so yeah
we're sad in this pusher and it looks
pretty much like a normal car I think
that's sort of the point of this demo
just like the car is not an unusual car
beyond the mountain of tech on top of it
it's just a regular car so the phone
isn't acting completely by itself to be
clear there is a big ski box on top of
the car with a bunch of tech in it
there's a whole camera set up and that's
what's sort of acting as the eyes for
the phone it's linked up to the phone
but via USB C but the processing and the
recognition is what's happening on the
phone and that's the important thing
Horace's so I've everything is set up
the phone has taken control of the
engine now the phone says your car
already are you press drive and enjoy
the ride so let's do that
I feel I feel very ready they're moving
at five miles an hour
there is nobody next to me so I guess
what's happening right now is the tech
above me is viewing all these cardboard
images in front of me and the phone is
learning what they are and a bicycle has
been detected now we're looking at a
soccer ball a ball has been detected now
most importantly is it going to detect
the dog a dog has been detected
moves up so our first run has been
scuppered because the phone lost its
connection to the camera on top of the
car because of perhaps a faulty USBC
cable which we've all been there okay
phase two okay so if you like to press
Continue okay so if you see a bicycle do
you want it to swerve left swear I will
break let's soive left if you see a bull
right okay and if you see the dog that's
break those are the guys that I'm gonna
pick one that ran over to our track so
if we see the ball the cars gonna swerve
right very good okay Simon okay we're in
gear I messed up the hitch
well we're going miss scanning for
obstacles a ball has been detected
preparing somewhere wait right well I
guess it worked so well we isn't getting
into autonomous driving or self-driving
cars in on a real level this is really
about showing off what it's phones can
do Huawei has been talking for a long
time about the AI capabilities of its
processors the Carey 970 is said to have
an NP you a neural processing unit and
this is really just a way to show off
how the phone can use its capabilities
in a real-time way the man is going to
get some table
thank you just wanna capture how
beautiful the camera looks which is very
beautiful</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
