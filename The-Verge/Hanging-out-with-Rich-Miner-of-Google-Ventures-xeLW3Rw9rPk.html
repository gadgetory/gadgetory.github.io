its origins they think of andy rubin who
is largely credited as being the father
of what is now the world's most widely
used mobile operating system but Ruben
didn't do it all on his own he had a lot
of help from many brilliant people
including his co-founder rich minor
minor helped develop and expand Android
into the powerhouse we now today these
days minors a general partner at Google
Ventures the search giant's investment
on his job is to find the latest trends
and up-and-coming companies in the
mobile technology world for google
ventures to invest in if minor likes
what he sees he could be a life changer
with Google's coffers on hand he can be
a Rainmaker of sorts definitely tight
securities they didn't quite do a cotton
swab but we got registered anyway so
we're in I swing a little bit more
though while I do this maybe it'll be
more fun I just don't know why a carrier
is gonna want this
you like this all right we found one
customer for the nokia phone all right
damn big screen reasonably responsive
I'm just tickled to see Nokia with
Android and soon to be Microsoft with
Android how good is that when we're
looking to invest in startups I mean the
key thing is you're investing in teams
and people you know you're also
hopefully they're working on something
that's interesting and that you think
you can help out with or at least in my
case I like to think you know either
myself or Google Ventures can help out
with what they're trying to build but it
always starts with the people and then
the vision and what they're trying to
build and then ultimately what's the
market are you going to you know their
way to monetize it but that's a tertiary
issue Google Ventures became a venture
capital firm that takes Google's massive
storehouse of cash and invest it in
startups across a variety of industries
since 2009 it's invested in over 225
companies including well-known names
such as uber and nest it differentiates
itself from other VC firms by offering a
support network and close access to
Google engineers and services for the
companies invest in it's almost like
boot camp for new startups but with a
Google esque Flair while some companies
like nest go on to be acquired by and
integrated into google that's not the
goal of the ventures team in fact some
of its investments have even been
purchased by Google's competitors such
as stamped and Astrid both of which
ended up in the arms of Yahoo with a
strong background in mobile technology
and a doctor in computer science minor
is involved in a lot of the investments
in mobile companies made by google
ventures that's why you can find them at
massive trade shows like Mobile World
Congress looking for the next big thing
they say Biggers better right curves
screen
but I don't think I want to show up that
one around we've certainly made
decisions to invest in the company when
we've joined those companies here on the
show floor and seeing the kind of
interest that they've had in the
attraction that they've had oh boy I'm
actually you can edit later oh yeah
Mobile World Congress and other shows
offer a density of information and new
products and make it easier to spot
trends than through other means over
70,000 people attended the show this
year and hundreds of companies were
showing off their wares and ideas even
big players such as samsung and nokia
used to show to launch important new
devices in their lineups seeing what's
new and actually getting to get a real
world feel of it is one of minors many
goals there from which he can infer
trends for future technologies well
clearly the quality of the phones I
think coming from a lot of the Asian
manufacturers and Chinese manufacturers
are matching the quality that you see
from some of the more established brands
so now it'll be interesting to see how
they take these quality phones and get
their brands well established I think
HTC is a good example of a company that
you know again seven years ago no one
knew what HTC was for consumer brands
they were rebranding most of their
products to carrier brands and then you
know Peter Chou just decided he wanted
to build a consumer brand around HTC but
minor isn't just there to play with
gadgets he's there to find interesting
startups that Google can invest in that
involves a lot of off-site meetings
dinners coffee meetups and other
informal activities that dominate a
venture capitalist schedule at a big
show like mwc the conversation can
easily be monopolized by the big players
the new samsung smart watches or Nokia's
peculiar play into Android finding the
small guys that might not actually have
a booth or presence on the show floor
requires more work but minor says it can
be done even if you're a startup and
you're not showing on the show floor if
you're in mobile you're typically
healeth to show meeting with people so
it requires a little bit of forensic
work but you can you can find the
startups we actually met the first time
at the Google booth and mobile roll
Congress here oh yeah three years ago
right and
this is an investment i haven't done
probably should have maybe but you know
time will tell finding a diamond in the
rough is miners end goal and giving
google ventures track record he's been
pretty good at doing it thus far if that
next diamond is going to be found in the
backhauls of Mobile World Congress or
the coffee shop in Boston's Austin
Brighton neighborhood minor will be
there to find it when i was on android
coming to the show was you know we have
read a lot work to do as you know a we
were building the OS prior to coming
here and then once we're here it's
really about getting partnerships done
and so we were 7 by 24 lockups and rooms
with every carrier hand side OEM of
getting deals done so that we could get
distribution that was in the early days
prior to 2009 coming as if you see it's
a little bit more you know it's a lot of
work but it's a very different nature
it's more hunting gathering you know
finding really bright people that we can
help out as google ventures which is
what we do if we obviously give them
money but can we try and give them a lot
of other resources and help me build
great big companies this isn't the first
time rich miner has jumped into the VC
world having first founded a firm for
orange spending a day with minor it
seems to be the place where he shines
where as an entrepreneur only has one
big moment a venture capitalist can live
that moment over and over again he's an
arbiter of the future and this time
around he's got Google's checkbook
