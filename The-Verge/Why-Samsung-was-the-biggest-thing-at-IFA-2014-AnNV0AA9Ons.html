products Aoife today including a new
note for a note 4 with a curved display
a watch and a VR headset which is crazy
dance to your frontier he's played with
all this stuff let's just art the most
important one that note 4 let's go on
there so no.4 is an update of Galaxy
Note line it's almost exactly like the
note 3 on the outside except it's got a
faster processor high-res screen and
Samsung finally put some metal on its
phone yeah it's anything that'll bend
instead of faking it right the note 3
had this like really ugly chromed
plastic that's supposed to look like
metal but it's no force got a metal band
around it and it's got a kind of the
same soft touch back
that's that leatherette feeling but they
got rid of that awful fake stitching
yeah feels a lot better in your hand put
together a lot better it's a remarkable
how big of a difference what a little
thing like a metal band does when you're
holding their way it's basically just a
really refined note it's a refined no.3
it's exactly what it is it's Samsung
saying we did a really good thing with
the note 3 a lot of people complained
about these particular things we fix
those particular issues here's a note 4
it's faster better screen write and
they're also getting stuff to make it
more luxurious right there's like
Swarovski crystal backs that partners
mont-blanc to do nicer styluses yeah so
like samplings had these partnerships
for a while with Swarovski but now
they're like just going like full hog on
to them and I don't know if we're ever
gonna see them here in the US but I
could picture them in Samsung flagship
stores worldwide of like getting a
Swarovski crystal back for year so a for
other than being or find f3 anything
major about the Note 4 that's worth
knowing so I think that what the big
takeaway for the no.4 is is Apple's
going to be expected to release a big
phone next week or announce it be five
point five five point five or whatever
it might be
Samsung has long held on to that big
screen market it kind of invented the
phablet this is Samsung putting its best
foot forward to be able to hold on to
what it's got against a big screen
incoming iPhone you know they'll be
successful it's hard to say I think that
this is definitely the best note that
they've released yet they refined a lot
of things that made it better the note 3
wasn't a bad product if you wanted a
phablet device is definitely the best
option and now this is just a better
note 3 yeah I don't see what Apple
brings out every time I see Note 3 I'm
like man I want a gigantic screen so
Samsung they also released the note 4
edge which is the note 3 with like a
little bit of a screen curves
buttons along the side for quick actions
and like notifications when you watch
videos you fight a that one yes so the
no edge is exactly what you said it's a
note for except on the right hand side
of the phone they've taken the screen
and like kind of just melted it along
the side and they've had this like kind
of concept for a long time you saw a
couple years ago at CES they're showing
off the exact same concept but now you
can actually or will be able to go by it
and the curved kind of side it shows
different notifications for you can
check your weather you can have it act
as like a clock on your desk they even
built the silly little game for it that
you play on the edge which is just silly
is that just am something Samsung is
this this product is Samsung being
Samsung this is like this it feels to me
like this is a very much a first
generation product that doesn't have a
clear purpose to exist other than
Samsung saying we can do this and nobody
else can right I remember a long time we
this Samsung had the continuum on
Verizon which had two displays and this
well know it just feels very much is
anyone gonna support this exactly you
know I when I talk to Samsung executives
they say they have a release pricing yet
but they say this is gonna be positioned
higher than the note 4 I don't think
that they expect a whole lot of people
that go for the Note edge it's just kind
of like a thing that they built because
they could do it if you use it with your
right hand alternate Samsung it's the
ultimate sale if you use it with your
right hand you can like swipe along the
little edge it's still a really big
phone obviously so it's not super
comfortable but if use it with your left
hand that curve does like nothing for
you for it right you got a hold it
upside down yeah hold upside down which
is like ridiculous so
so speaking of all there are Samsung
stuff today big news gear s which was
announced a few days ago but today you
got to play with it now yeah so the gear
s is the biggest SmartWatch names ever
looks like for a movie missile yeah your
watch looks small yeah because this
thing has a two-inch curved screen and
it is I've long said that these things
look like computers on your wrist and
they always have but like this is
literally the closest thing we have to a
computer it has a full QWERTY keyboard
it has a full QWERTY keyboard you can
swipe on it you know I know some
developers announced some things that
there are keyboards that they've have on
Android phones they're gonna be porting
to this thing it's got a SIM card in it
so you can leave your phone at home and
still get your text messages and emails
and God forbid make calls from this
curve 2 inch screen
there's no plans to bring it to the US
yet yeah see and we don't really know
what it's gonna cost but like this is
like peak Samsung smartphone yeah this
is this is Samsung going full hog with a
big curved display and it looks cool I
don't think I've ever wear it out of the
house I mean it's kind of the same thing
right next next week Apple's gonna do a
watch or something we expect and this is
kind of there
yeah this is simply trying to preemptive
it and so then lastly speaking of crazy
Samsung they announced a VR shelf the
note 4 in partnership with oculus this
great name
it's what the note for VR display
innovators Edition powered by oculus
it's an amazing amazing collection of
nouns all on that man it's kind of crazy
you put a note 4 in it and you can like
wave your head around yeah is that is
this just a gimmick so I yeah this thing
was like I looked at it and I was like
that's silly it's ridiculous I know
there had been leaked a couple weeks ago
and I thought same thing but when you
put it on and it's the same thing that
you get when you put on the oculus rift
it's just like oh my god experience like
you're sucked into this world and you're
moving your head around all over the
place and yeah you're doing your best
Stevie Wonder impression and like you're
just in this world and like I just put a
smile on my face right yeah and it's
just a fun thing to play with I don't
know how much it's gonna cost
I don't know when you're gonna be able
about it it only works with a note for
ya there isn't a whole lot of software
the samsung says there's gonna be a
software store when it launches Samsung
makes a lot of promises that so Samsung
makes a lot of software promises that's
right that's like ah but you know there
was a couple demos on there you could be
Tony Stark in his lab and like grab
things and stuff like that there was
this flight simulator demo where you
flew the ship around with your head and
tap beside the blast things which is
like yeah super fun it's probably it's
like 15 minutes of entertainment if they
ain't cheap it's a good toy to buy a
financial I think I think what they're
gonna do because it only works with a
note 4 I think what they're this they
did the same strategy last year with the
note 3 in the first Galaxy gear it only
worked with the note 3 and like one
other phone so Samsung bundle them
together and they put a galaxy or a lot
of people's risks that wouldn't have ATT
to be giving these things away for free
like I think the gear VR is gonna be the
same thing only works with the note 4 if
you buy no 4 you can pick this up for 50
bucks or something and it doesn't work
for anybody else but you know it's fun
