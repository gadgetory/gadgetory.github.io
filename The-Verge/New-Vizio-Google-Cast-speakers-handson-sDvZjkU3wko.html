those big new suite of cast products so
earlier we were looking at the new P
series TV which starts the thousand
dollars doesn't sell March 27 Vizio is
also previewing some stuff that's income
a little bit later
these are audio products so the TV is
really cool because it pulled all of the
interface all the UI off the TV on this
tablet remote using Google cast control
everything seemed it with these guys
they were on Google cast to do
chromecast Audio sorry familiar so there
is this new great kind of bookshelf
speaker from the volume knob here
there's a sound bar you can see the
satellite sort of subwoofer hidden over
there actually but then my favorite is
this little 360 speaker which is great
so this is just google play music I hit
cast and now it's just playing over the
Wi-Fi casting to it I can turn the
volume up and down and then I can also
just grab it it's one of us it's pretty
cool and it'll run for eight hours over
Wi-Fi using the battery so that's really
neat vizio is just previewing this audio
stuff right now they're gonna say it's
coming out a little bit later but the
point is that they have built an
integrated ecosystem all around cast
that supports video and audio and it's
just a big extension of the chromecast
ecosystem</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
