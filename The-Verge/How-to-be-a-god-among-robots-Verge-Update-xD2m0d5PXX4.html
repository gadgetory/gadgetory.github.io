of fish and flocks a bird actually
follow predictable mathematic behavior
that's just what the museum in math
wants to showcase and its new exhibits
well when we were first kicking around
ideas at the beginning you know what do
we want to have in our Museum there was
a thought that we should have an exhibit
that would bring out the mathematics of
what's called emergent behavior how
simple little individual rules that each
of many entities could be following can
lead to a global dynamic that is more
than the sum of those parts that seems
lifelike or intelligent even though at
the root it's just a simple mathematical
rule being applied over and over again
how did you actually translate organic
seeming behavior into out others right
well that is that that's the amazing
wonder of the mathematics of emergent
behavior so to give this right now it
looks like all the time of following
this leader there's no leader here every
one of these robots is following exactly
the same rules and i can tell you
basically what they are they are don't
get too close to your neighbor okay
don't get too far away from your
neighbor and assuming those are both
satisfied try it ahead in the average
direction of your three nearest
neighbors now we talked a little bit
like behavior studies but it also we've
seen a little bit of like real world
application obviously collision
detection and cars are big right is this
borrow permeating in the real world or I
like indicative of what we'll see go for
it absolutely we produce this exhibit we
had to you know take the cutting edge of
technology in a lot of different
directions so for example this floor
positioning system is sort of a cousin
of a system that Amazon uses and it's
automated factories so that you know the
shelves full of your order you know your
Christmas shopping you know don't smack
into each other as those robots are
bringing it to me you know to be shipped
when you're looking at like how to
educate kids and what this kind of goes
for it are you planning on doing more of
these kind of I guess computer science
centric exhibits right well I mean the
thing I would like to say you're talking
about getting kids we know why do we
want to expose kids of this you don't
have an early age it's because you know
if you wanted one of it akin to study
music to take you to a symphony but when
where do we do that in mathematics where
do we ever show them the amazing
achievements that this mathematics can
lead them to
this is the symphony of mathematics the
symphony in mathematics is a boxing ring
where you get to be a robot God well
there you go we're hoping to get kids
excited and then we'll show them where
it all leads and get the more excited
involved in mathematics that they're
forced to study every day</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
