Tembo fifth and we'll just wrapped
up Nokia's big windows phone 8 event two
new devices will introduce Lumia 920 and
bulimia 820 and the focus was firmly on
the first 17 is the flagship for both
Microsoft Windows Phone 8 and for nokia
itself this is a device that comes with
quite a few unique features among them
there's a new PureView camera which
includes optical image stabilization
that we never seen a smartphone before
there's a new ultra sensitive touch
screen there's a 4.5 inch LCD display
which looks stunning and the industrial
design is peeling up here it looks
wonderful and amazing the bigger mission
though is Windows Phone 8 itself we
didn't see a whole lot of new features
from the operating system and we didn't
hear about a releasing we are not
denouncing the pricing or the
availability of the product in terms of
the individual countries or the
individual carriers you're not saying
exactly in q4 you're not saying prices
that's gross you are the same any detail
the consumer of ID to be able to
purchase what it is that's okay I
understand you've got to get your ducks
in a row one of the big new features in
no case Delta today is wireless charging
you can get it straight and they're
doing a 920 or you can get it through an
interchange of the back cover on the
Lumia 820 there's also NFC which
connects to a whole new set of
accessories which include headphones and
you wireless speakers speak with nokia
representatives will keep hearing of the
hardware for the new lumia devices is
ready however the software seems to be
the thing holding things
in Lucky's words they're still
integrating the two parts we haven't
heard any announcements today about
carriers release date or pricing but
Nokia says it's going to wait in
partners to make their own announcements
as far as Microsoft is concerned today
we saw Joe Belfiore in Steve Ballmer
both take the stage alongside Stephen
Elop and the rest of the lucky accrue
what they revealed were a selection of
new windows phone 8 features and
enhancements but they still said they
are holding a few things back older
Stephen Elop was willing to give us a
day was quota for 2012 that's one will
be able to find out when for how much
and with which carrier will be able to
buy these phones</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
