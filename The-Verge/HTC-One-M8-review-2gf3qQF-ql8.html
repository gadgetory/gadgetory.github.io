HTC and from the g1 to the one it's
always done good work even when it
hasn't been hugely successful but for
all HTC is done in the Android universe
it's new phone might be its most
important yet this is the new HTC One
technically it's the one parentheses m8
and I keep calling it the one too but
everyone's going to know it as the one
it's sort of appropriate that it has the
same name too because it's not exactly a
huge shift
HTC got a lot of things right last year
and it's left those things mostly alone
while trying to fix what went wrong
before the phone is still incredibly
well made and attractive though it's a
little more subtle this year it's a
little more rounded and made of a
slightly softer metal it doesn't feel or
look quite as impressive but it's much
more comfortable its back now wraps
around the sides giving it a sort of
unibody feel like there's a metal out
there that just naturally curves this
way the phone's a bit taller than last
year's model mostly to accommodate a
slightly larger 5-inch screen but it
doesn't feel any bigger than the old one
that screen is gorgeous by the way a
1080p display with perfect color
representation and fantastic viewing
angles it may not be the most pixel
dense display on the market but it's
every bit as good as I need it to be the
one comes in a beautiful silver and a
hideous gold plus a brushed metal gray
that's nice looking but not quite as
eye-catching as the silver HTC moved the
headphone jack to the bottom added an SD
card slot stretch the IR blaster across
the whole top of the phone and has
on-screen buttons instead of sticking
them below the screen one thing that
hasn't changed the two big boom sound
speakers on the front which still sound
fantastic even better than last year is
actually a little louder and fuller but
this phone is more the same than
different it's a little heavy extremely
well made and still probably the
best-looking Android phone around last
year's one had two big problems chief
among them it's mediocre battery life
this year it's really not a problem I
could get a full 30 hours out of the
phone even with extremely heavy use
there's also a new extreme power saving
mode which basically shuts off
everything but the phone texting and
manual email refresh and can pretty much
by itself get me through an entire night
with only about 10% of the battery
there's a big 2600 milliamp battery
inside but the ones new Snapdragon 801
processor certainly helps too and along
with two gigs of RAM it makes the phone
incredibly fast I don't think I've ever
had such a smooth experience with an
Android phone other than maybe the Nexus
5 but that's not to say I didn't have
issues with the phone
HCC's send software still changes every
single pixel of android and many of them
are for the worse especially some of the
icons and menus but HCC skin has become
far more coherent than last year's with
a flat design that often does look
really nice
everything about this phone feels like
HTC is searching for something it can
make commercials about there's blinkfeed
the built-in newsreader that now lives
one screen to the left of your home
screen it's a really handy way to kill a
minute or two waiting across the street
and I use it a lot but it's really not
meaningfully better than say Flipboard
blinkfeed now integrates with Foursquare
for restaurant recommendations and
Fitbit for Fitness information that you
can sync from either the phone's
internal sensors or any Fitbit device
you own both are cool add-ons but again
neither is better than the apps
themselves the other thing is a bunch of
gestures HTC enable to make it easier to
do things quickly on your phone swipe
right on the screen when it's off and
you'll launch straight into blinkfeed
swipe left and you go home down kicks
you straight to voice dialing and double
tapping just turns the screen on you can
even pick up the phone in landscape mode
and hit the volume button and you're
launched straight into the camera after
a day I stopped using the power button
entirely which is still irritatingly
placed on the hard to reach top of the
phone now here's the second thing HTC
got wrong last time the camera it's much
advertised for megapixel ultra pixel
camera basically saw in the dark had
some cool features and took bad pictures
in this year that's still kind of the
case the software is better than ever
with a super simplified interface that
also gives you lots of control over
white balance filters ISO and more
it's uncluttered and useful which is
hard to do one of the coolest new
features is the ability to focus a photo
after the fact like with a light row
it's using a second camera on the back
of your phone to capture depth as you're
capturing a photo the effect isn't quite
as pronounced as with a light row but
it's really cool to tap a blurry spot in
a photo and watch it spring into focus
HTC also still has Zoey's the sort of
automatic highlight real shots that are
nifty but lost my attention pretty fast
the software is great and there's lots
of features but the camera still isn't
very good it sees in the dark yes taking
photos of things where my iPhone sees
only black but those photos and photos
in just about any other situation are
still too soft and too muddy even the
five megapixel front-facing camera does
better in some spots it's certainly an
improvement over last year's camera but
all the cool features in the world can't
hide that it's photos just don't compare
to the galaxy s4 or the iPhone 5s or
even really the Nexus 5 depending on
your carrier the HTC One
cost $199 or 249 dollars with a two-year
contract if you're phone shopping in the
next few months that camera is my only
reservation in telling you to buy the
new HTC one it's gorgeous
comfortable well-made and competitive in
every spec and feature HTC Sense
software isn't great but it's far less
problematic than it's ever been and the
parts you don't like can be obviated
pretty quickly it's big butt so we're
all flagship phones these days and my
iPhone is starting to look mighty small
really it's all about priorities HTC is
so close and so good at so many things
if it can just make a great camera it
might run away with the crown for best
Android phone but we can't have it all
at least not yet
HCC's onto something this year with the
new one but I'm already waiting
anxiously for next year's model</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
