ever and while it may not look like it
on the surface there are enough changes
here to justify that claim iOS 8
represents a big change for Apple it's
finally becoming a modern mobile
operating system
if you've used iOS 7 iOS 8 is going to
feel instantly recognizable and
comfortable in fact you have to dig
quite deep into iOS 8 before you find
what's actually different compared to
iOS 7 unlike last year's complete visual
overhaul iOS 8 is a refinement with few
actual visual changes there's a new
recent contact picker when you open the
multi-tasking menu Notification Center
has shrunk from a confusing three tabs
to a much more logical to and the
animations are ever so slightly faster
than before you can also respond to
notifications right from Notification
Center and apps can insert widgets of
their own right in there too but I
always say looks and feels just like iOS
7
nobody upgrading from one to the other
is really going to be completely lost
spotlight has been updated to provide
results from Wikipedia news sources Maps
iTunes and more based on your location
and other pieces of context it's a
universal search app spotlight should
have always been
iMessage is now more like snapchat and
other hot messaging apps of the day with
audio messages video clips and location
sharing you can finally manage group
messages you can silence your noisy
friend or leave the annoying group chat
that never seems to end but we did have
some issues getting that to work on our
end Iowa State's new health app acts as
a central hub for all of your personal
health data whether it comes from a
connected scale your Fitbit a heart rate
monitor or the iPhones own built-in step
tracking it's a more comprehensive look
at all of the quantified life statistics
you might track these days then other
platforms have done and it lets
third-party apps share their data with
it but without third-party apps
supplying data health doesn't do much on
its own right now but it's really gonna
be a big deal when Apple releases its
watch next year Apple Safari browser has
been upgraded with a new desktop mode
and the ability to send links to other
apps so you can save a webpage to
Evernote without ever leaving Safari
it's a really fast browser and a great
mobile experience but you still can't
set a different browser as your default
in iOS 8 which is frustrating apple's
upgraded the virtual keyboard with next
word suggestions which appear above the
keyboard as you type they're pretty good
not quite as eerily predictive as
SwiftKey but iOS 8 now lets you install
third-party keyboards so if you really
want Swift Keys crazy smart predictions
or swipes useful tracing features you
can just download them from the App
Store Android has had this capability
for years
but it's definitely a welcome first for
iOS apps can put widgets right in the
Notification Center so you can get a
prediction from Yahoo weather or the
latest headlines from New York Times now
without ever opening an app widgets can
either be super useful like ever notes
which lets you create notes right away
or kind of pointless like Dropbox but
thankfully by default they're disabled
and you can pick and choose which
widgets you want to display third-party
apps can now talk to each other in more
ways than ever letting you do things
like share pictures and send data from
one app to another I can save articles
of pocket or instapaper right from the
New York Times app without having to do
an annoying copy and paste dance but
like messages we found this to be a bit
unreliable at least for now
photos can now be edited with
third-party apps right from the main
camera it takes more tabs to get at the
editing tools of an app like lightly
than it really should but it's still
more convenient than having to switch
around apps again Android users aren't
gonna be impressed with these
capabilities but they're entirely new
for the iOS world iOS 8 represents a
great leap in connectivity between your
iPhone and iPad and your Mac Apple's
calling this continuity once OS 10
Yosemite launches sometime later this
year you'll be able to answer incoming
calls reply to text messages and do more
right from your desktop but right now
you could actually use your iPad to
answer calls made to your iPhone the new
handoff feature lets you start something
on one device and pick up where you left
off on another whether that's browsing a
web page or composing an email or
reading an article in a third-party app
like pocket it makes everything in your
life more cohesive and connected if
you're fully bought into Apple's world
but will have to wait until later in the
year to see the full benefits of it
that's the story with iOS 8 it's not a
massive visual overhaul like iOS 7 but
Apple did enough things under the hood
to make this one of the most significant
OS updates ever iOS a is more open place
nicer with others and just feels like a
much more modern mobile platform than
its predecessors and frankly that's
exactly what Apple needed to do
