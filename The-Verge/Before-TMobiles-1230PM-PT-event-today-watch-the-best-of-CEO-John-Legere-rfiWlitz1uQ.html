experience it's not a goddamn person in
the world besides a wireless industry
person that would understand why the
hell this mess works this way this is
the biggest crock of I've ever
heard in my life it's everybody's
blogging holy crap I can't believe you
just said that oh he said that's
how I lost the family pool I bet he'd
only swear five times look up I feel
like I'm the teacher Hey look at me I
don't want to hear a single one of you
tell me after I announce this next thing
so what are you gonna do if they respond
you can't do the next two this cuz you
host chapter one on algebra get ready
for another profanity-laden tirade on
AT&amp;amp;T I can't resist it's not the G rated
version it's like hey kids is it better
for your network to be crap or is it
better to have a good LTE high-speed
network in New York and then this is the
one that comes up with a great answer
I'm gonna explain how stupid we all are
but not make us feel bad holy crap what
happened to my phone cut the crap on the
prepaid postpaid we can do it just the
guy like you hey Billy what's what's
better bigger or smaller I mean come on
how about not coming a cop is angry here
if the way you want to respond to this
tactic is to say no there's a contract
on the device it's not really good go
for it it's it's hi I'm AT&amp;amp;T
and my customers hate me what's keeping
them up at night is us big Macklemore
fans I've already told you about the
spaceship and the aliens coming in
please stop the you know how I
spend my times tweeting skyping blogging
posting googling facetiming good
Oh frankly you're just pissed because
the little girl sitting next to you has
a better phone than you yeah yeah okay
if you're typing I didn't say we're
going completely into the prepaid
business watch out boost so we're gonna
make you pay your bill later in a very
complicated way with a contract so we
can take the out of your pockets
for two years it's so beautiful for me
because this is just a broken industry
with a bunch of arrogant people that
don't know how to tell it like it is I
call them oh moments oh it's
really an abbreviation not necessarily
because your phone fell in the toilet
it's short for oh I'm tied into an
F in contract and I can't get out for
two years and I'm gonna hold that toilet
ridden phone to my head for the next two
years frankly they don't have the balls
to say it either to the manufacturers or
to the customers you are now you are the
first broadcaster on television to say
balls right there so we're a pair by the
way my my daughter is here today you
young bloggers after the speech today if
you find yourself hitting on an
attractive young girl whose tag says
ledger you're dead I mean we can track
you down with these cell phones don't
let them kid you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
