here in Barcelona Spain checking out
samsung's new year lineup of wearable
devices consists of the gear to the gear
2 neo and the gear fit the gear 2 and
the gear 2 neo are updates of Samsung's
Galaxy gear wrist SmartWatch that was
released late last year they feature a
lighter and thinner design refined user
interface and the ability to change out
the wrist strap the main difference
between the gear 2 and the gear 2 neo is
the gear 2 has a camera while the neo
does not mainly because the gear 2 neo
is a lower-cost alternative the gear fit
is a new fitness tracker device very
similar to maybe a Fitbit or other type
of wrist-worn devices it features a
curved AMOLED touchscreen display which
is one of the first applications in a
wearable device that Samsung has used it
also has a heart rate sensor built
underneath it so you can monitor your
heart rate in real time as well as
getting coaching while you're working
out and other activities it also
supports full SmartWatch functionality
for notifications so you can get your
notifications for new emails and
messages and phone calls right there on
the device the gear fit actually feels
pretty nice it's very lightweight it's
it's comfortable to wear it's got a very
simple clasp here on the bottom and it
is possible to change out the band four
different colors if you if you'd like
the gear 2 is a much slimmer and lighter
design than last year's Galaxy gear it
also features interchangeable wrist
bands got a 22 millimeter mount so you
can swap out the wristband to something
else that you'd like it takes a standard
watch band it's got an integrated heart
rate sensor and an IR blaster up here
next to the camera the camera has been
moved off of the strap onto the body
itself and the watch has a new homes
button in addition to the touch screen
interface there are a couple of things
that you can do without the gear
attached to a phone now you can listen
to music and monitor your heart rate
without having your phone available
without having your phone connected
there's four gigabytes of internal
storage here to do that Samsung's going
to be releasing this in a variety of
colors including silver and gold and
bronze as well as a lineup of different
designer wrist straps
Samsung isn't announcing pricing yet but
we do expect to see it on the market in
April</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
