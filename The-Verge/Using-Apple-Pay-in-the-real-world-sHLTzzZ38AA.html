along with it its new mobile payments
platform Apple pay Apple pay is in the
first mobile payments platform there's
been others from Google Isis and couple
of other companies but it is the first
one that works on the iPhone so we've
got Apple pay loaded up on an iPhone 6
and we're gonna go figure out what we
can do with it the first thing you got
to do with Apple pay is get your card
into your phone and a card is actually
really easy you just go to the settings
menu passbook and Apple pay and credit
or debit card and then you can actually
take a photo of your credit card and it
will grab the numbers off of there you
just add some things to confirm and for
this particular credit card that's all
it took now if I go into my passbook you
can see I've got that credit card right
there Apple is supporting Visa
MasterCard and American Express right
now in addition to a handful of national
banks if you have a smaller local bank
or credit union chances are you're out
of luck today
but Apple says 500 more banks will be on
board by early next year Apple says that
there are two hundred and twenty
thousand stores and retailers supporting
Apple pay right now it can be harder to
find places to use it than you might
think here in New York City we couldn't
buy trinkets at a pop up stand a hotdog
from a cart you take Apple pay here no
no okay
thank you or Patrick gum at a newsstand
do you take Apple pay you can I pay with
my phone or no no okay
thank you but if we went to one of
Apple's launch partners such as Duane
Reade drugstores or Macy's finding
something is as simple as holding the
iPhone 6 in front of the credit card
terminal and using our thumbs
authenticate the purchase it worked as
Apple to advertise and we're even able
to pay for our cab ride down to the
Macy's store with our iPhone credit card
security has been a hot button topic of
late with countless retailers being
hacked for the personal data that they
store with Apple pay the credit card
data and the fingerprint authentication
are stored on a secure chip on the
iPhone itself making it much harder for
a hacker to access personal information
at least in theory your name credit card
number and security code are never shown
to the retailer where you are shopping
we'll have to see if Apple pay does make
a difference in credit card security if
so it could be the most revolutionary
part of the whole platform
so we had a little bit of success and a
few failures trying to use Apple pay
today it's really not that much
different than any mobile payment system
we've seen before but since it's on the
iPhone more people are going to be using
mobile payments than ever before</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
