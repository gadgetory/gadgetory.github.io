ambitious goals it is working on
starting that whole human colony on Mars
after all but now the company has added
another ridiculous goal to its list it's
going to try to send to people around
the moon at the end of 2018 these
astronauts won't be employed by NASA
though their paying customers who
approached SpaceX to do the trip we
don't know who they are just yet but
they've put down a sizeable deposit for
the mission SpaceX CEO Elon Musk says
the trip should take about a week to
pull off the two customers will launch
on top of the Falcon Heavy that's the
souped up version of SpaceX's Falcon 9
rocket that's supposed to fly for the
first time this summer and the
passengers will ride inside the crew
Dragon capsule an upgraded version of
the dragon cargo capsule SpaceX has
already been developing the crew dragon
to carry astronauts to and from the
station for NASA as part of the
Commercial Crew program apparently the
vehicle can do just fine carrying people
near the moon too the plan is for the
crew dragon to loop around the moon go a
bit out into deep space and then come
back to earth all in all a trip that
spans between 300,000 and 400,000 miles
the vehicle will mostly be automated but
if there's an emergency
the passengers may have to step in to
get back the crew dragon will re-enter
Earth's atmosphere and land the
passengers hopefully gently it's a
unique mission for SpaceX because it'll
officially put it in the space tourism
business so far the company has launched
satellites for commercial companies and
cargo for NASA and SpaceX will be
launching people soon too but those
riders will be NASA astronauts if it
pulls this off it'll be the first time
private citizens have traveled this far
out into space while this is new
territory for SpaceX the moon mission
sounds an awful lot like another
upcoming space mission one that NASA
wants to do right now NASA is building a
brand new rocket called the Space Launch
System or SLS and a crew capsule called
Orion together the pair is meant to
carry astronauts into deep space and
onto Mars someday
the SLS hasn't flown yet but the plan is
for the rocket to fly for the first time
without
Kru in late 2018 but recently NASA said
I was going to look into maybe putting
people on the first flight of the SLS
possibly for a mission in late 2019 that
trip will take a two-person crew riding
inside the Orion crew capsule on an
eight or nine day mission around the
moon and back hmm
that sounds familiar so with this moon
mission announcement SpaceX seems to
have created a bit of a space race
between the public and private sector
the company is sending the message that
it can do what NASA plans to do only
faster it seems like a political move
for SpaceX to since the new
administration may be more interested in
using the private space industry
SpaceX's Falcon Heavy looks to be
significantly cheaper than the SLS so
officials may be interested in using the
more cost-efficient option to explore
space instead of what NASA is building
but there are a few big caveats to
consider first of all NASA's vehicles
have a lot of support in Congress so
they probably won't be replaced by
SpaceX anytime soon plus SpaceX is
terrible about meeting deadlines the
Falcon Heavy was originally supposed to
debut in 2013 or 2014 but his flight has
been repeatedly pushed back to this year
there are also some questions of safety
within the past two years two of
SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket have exploded
elin argues that the Falcon 9 success
rate is still quite high but that there
will definitely be risk involved with
the moon mission he says the customers
are entering this with their eyes open
good because it's going to be one hell
of a view
if the trip is successful Elon sees
these private moon vacations as being a
big source of revenue for SpaceX he
thinks there's a market for at least one
or two trips a year and the missions
could account for 10 to 20 percent of
SpaceX is revenue as for how much each
mission will cost he estimates a little
more than the cost of taking people to
the International Space Station right
now NASA pays between 70 and 80 million
ziz in just one astronaut to the station
on a Russian Soyuz rocket so if we're
operating in that ballpark I guess I'm
going to start saving now
so Ilan clarified that these people
aren't from Hollywood
but Ilan announced this moon vacation
while I was on vacation so I think it's
only fair that I become one of the
people to go for free</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
