here at motorola and verizon's new york
event to announce the motorola droid
turbo the droid turbo is the latest in
the line of droid smartphones from
motorola and verizon it's kind of like a
Moto X on steroids this particular one
will be replacing the droid ultra in the
droid lineup as a 5.2 inch quad HD
display so it's a higher resolution
screen than the Moto X it's also powered
by a new Snapdragon 805 processor which
is faster than the Moto X it's got a 21
megapixel camera on the back which is
higher resolution than the Moto X and
it's got a 3900 milliamp hour battery
which is much larger than the one
available in the Moto X and verizon and
motorola say that this should last about
48 hours between charges very similar to
last year's droid maxx it's also
supports a turbo charging feature which
will come with a charger in the box that
will give you eight hours of battery
life on 15 minutes of charging otherwise
it's very similar to the Moto X as far
as software and features go it's running
Android 4.4 it's going to be upgraded to
5.0 lollipop at some point in the future
it's got a lot of the similar Motorola
features like the quick launch camera
the voice controls and the active
display features for notifications but
it's different is it's got capacitive
keys underneath the display here as
opposed to the on-screen buttons this
guy is going to be available starting
this Thursday October thirtieth you'll
be able to get a 32 gigabyte version
with for 199 on contract or a 64
gigabyte version for 249 the 32 gigabyte
version is going to come in three
different colors a metallic black
metallic red and this new ballistic
nylon which is actually a nylon finish
it's really weird really different not
sure how it's going to to last over time
the 64 gigabyte version is only going to
be available in this black ballistic
nylon but you'll be able to get the 32
gigabyte model in the other three colors
so there you go that's a quick look at
the motorola droid turbo for Verizon
Wireless
