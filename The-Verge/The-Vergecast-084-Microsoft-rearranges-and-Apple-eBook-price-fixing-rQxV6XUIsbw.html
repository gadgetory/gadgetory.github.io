newsy day oh just a lot going on
actually the whole week has been nuts
what do we have what's on our what's our
start with today let's do it let's start
with the things that happen today today
today this morning no t-mobile's like
those yesterday oh yeah that's right the
Nokia event was today I why I finally
watched our super kind of John Legere is
a chair amazing and it's a yeah sorry I
was yes yeah yeah but if I'm a legend
yeah and I keep asking t-mobile to let
me at him yeah so I can talk you think
he'd want to talk right yeah just team
Oh we'll get it together mobile uh let's
be on let's be sensible let's be let's
get real with each other okay let us
talk to your CEO I mean let me have the
wouldn't kill you look what's he gonna
do he's gonna swear a little bit it's
the worst that could happen he strips
nude and slaps knee lie in the face of
this penis actually there's the other
words all the sugar doll very quickly
anyhow that does seem like the world a
nap but also the best that could happen
metaphorically it's always been trying
to trying to do to eighteen t this hold
on so okay we'll have this pregnant
pause whatever yes this morning was the
was enormous students he's amazing he's
amazing I would that what was imagine
nope no pants right there just like okay
now this way customer no pants it's
crazy are you yeah well I've been
thinking about switching to t-mobile
well based on their new plans well my
iphone I've had my AT&amp;amp;T account for
years is still the iphone you've got a
new t-mobile okay but there's a new
tmobile sim in my next or intra-agency
when I was called it a nexus well it's
basically an access yeah any all right
anyhow go ahead uh but the big news this
morning is Microsoft without question
the biggest news in the industry this
week huge diz huge news Microsoft is
completely reorganized itself which was
I think Kara Swisher reported it a few
weeks ago that this was like in the
works executives have been leaving
Microsoft likes like Don Mattrick just
left Xbox go on zynga before it happened
and now they're announced and the
changes are pretty major so the Steve
Ballmer center on a memo which is I'm
just going to say it yeah one of the
worst examples of corporate bullshit
I've ever read my life
Wow I mean it's really like he should
read it it's like several thousand words
its twenty six hundred words it was so
long that we wanted to put it all in the
post and I suppose yeah and it was so
long that we couldn't figure out a way
to do it so we threw it in the forums
yeah I mean I just I'll find some
excerpts as we go through the news here
because it's so long enough to let go
find them but that the top line is
basically Julie larson-green who just
took over from Steven Sinofsky as head
of windows is no longer the head of
windows let me stop you is there a
reason we can't hear each other in our
ear piensas why am I wearing the
earpiece so they can talk to us alright
but shouldn't we be able to hear each
other don't normally hear each other
they've replaced the headphones they're
looking into it can they can they hear
us to people can the folks the folks out
and they're in America real people and
in the rest of the world yeah greater
Europe as I like to think of it just
kidding it's very insulting yeah it's
actually more like greater it's like
Europe is actually really okay just
forget it yeah what's the worse you
could add what's the word DD its lack of
the base of the penis go go on hmm so
back back to Microsoft please get back
to the org chart news yeah that's a
present you today what it's gonna be
great go for it who loves orange charts
uh so look she took over from Steven
Sinofsky yeah now she's no longer the
head of Windows she's ahead of devices
in entertainment yeah and we and we
talked about this oh I heard a little my
voice we talked about this earlier and
ioana and your take on this is Eddie
well I than Sir John Terry Myerson he
was ahead of Windows Phone yeah he's not
the head of all of Windows yeah
operating systems yeah across hunts
Windows Windows Phone xbox that's
correct go ahead well we we talked about
this earlier and you mentioned that you
thought that the the the move for George
uli is is Larson was just two last names
larson-green washing yeah I don't have
to say larson-green I don't know which
first realize it anyhow LG JLG that the
move for her is actually a kind of weird
emotion and I have to say you know there
was an article in wired sort of like
she's the heir apparent but I'm not sure
that that's the case when she was ahead
of Windows that was obvious yeah and
and and what's interesting is when you
think about in Microsoft are where
division uh really just xboxes and the
thing that's making money I mean they're
not making money off of right yeah mice
and keyboards and but the other big halo
product is the surface but they're not
really i don't think they're making
money on that i don't think it's
considered a success by anybody's
measurement and you've got xbox which is
like for a long time is actually kind of
a loss leader uh and is now I guess
turning some profit I would have met at
this point has but it's not make money
because the hardware's making money
because they can sell things strike is
legal there yeah and that's Myerson
again like he's running that right well
that's I mean it's like so surface is
great but surface has a leader panos
panay like he's in charge of the surface
mmm Xbox has a leader right there's
somebody in charge of the xbox hardware
in ecosystem yeah like saying you're
that's great maybe they'll expand in a
more device so that in the future of
every company is to make integrated
devices right so that's a great project
for like it's not she's not in charge
well big success right the feed room
every company i mean we i don't know
because of microsoft struck a deal with
every cable box maker to what microsoft
software on their then it would just be
kind of a microsoft play for the living
room or whatever i think i'm just wildly
speculative not saying there's like the
old microsoft well but in you microsoft
oh yeah but we assume that you make a
run your so we assume that you make a
box and you put in the living room and
then like that's the thing or you make
the box and people use put in their
pocket i think that like that is a
software licensing microjet is the last
decade the last decade is shown that but
on the surface but look what's what are
we expecting for Microsoft three months
uh obviously they're gonna put out the
xbox hardware they built in design
that's right ah they're gonna do a new
surface yeah or of it that's right a
smaller surface and there are lots
there's lots of discussion of the
surface phone so that's like she has a
lot on her plate to make a res are a big
projects manage right but none of them
are Windows Windows Phone and Xbox
software yeah and that's like that's
Microsoft that's whatever like those
devices are great and I think the future
of Microsoft well but I think when you
look at it maybe it is with this new
streamlined hierarchy you know her role
becomes much more important because it
is there are really fewer there are
fewer spokes in the wheel you know that
there's only a few main spokes she's got
one of them Myerson has one of them in
Ballmer's kind of sense at the top right
like they're basically on either side of
the equation
of the of their of their offerings into
your appointment like we are saying like
Myers has more control is like arguing i
ever send microsoft's business uh Julie
larson-green for the next six months has
a harder job because these are brand new
products that he has to sell right not
windows isn't changing that much I just
I think I didn't say I don't think it's
a demotion I think it's a weird like she
used to be like Steven Sinofsky left it
was a big deal the person who replaced
him is now not doing that job right and
somebody else it isn't that is that's
the oddest part to me is that the job
she was just handed was now taken away
from her and maybe she didn't want it
maybe she's like I'd rather be doing
something else that the internal
politics of that I don't know right we
don't know the answer but but it anyhow
he's a big move for my statement but
it'll is also uh and so the overarching
goal is like what you're saying that
there's two sides of microsomal their
software in devices yeah they they're
their line in bombers email is we're one
Microsoft which is like Sony's been
running around saying they're one sony
or two years as sounds like it's not
going so the application of all come
today that's it today they're now
organized along functional groups which
is the way apples been organized forever
and like so Microsoft used to have like
office and windows like different and
now there's one company with like my
apps cloud engineering wonder how much
this is really marketing right employee
level and how much is just I think this
is a big deal how much is just um anorg
Attard rearrangement right well I mean I
think it's felt that the e like exec you
look this is why executives are leaving
Microsoft right right i don't think i
think engineers or just being told i
mean a lot of people have made a
rearranging deck chairs on the titanic
analogy today I mean do you feel like
this is a does this feel like a for show
or futile or desperation or does this
feel necessary I think it's a little of
both I think it's a little bit for show
it's a little bit out of desperation to
get some further control over what's
going on the company I mean I my Empress
here's my impression based on things
I've heard from people uh familiar with
the matter yeah and based on my
observation my gut feeling is windows in
its current for
worm was is not considered a success at
the company and that the discrepancy
between this confusion about Artie and
the x86 versions of Windows and the way
that it's been market in the way they've
been sold in the way they've been
discussed publicly has been a has-been
not has not been well received in yet
within Microsoft I think windows RT like
at this moment is an enormous failure I
mean windows RT's from what I can tell
and correct me if I'm wrong but it
appears to be a completely failed
product yeah yes like I can't see I'm
not sure I mean I know where she ran
today that we're cutting the price of
windows and I know there are people who
have the surface and I think the surface
the RT version the service has a lot of
good qualities yeah but in the grand
scheme of what Windows is trying to look
you've got windows phone on one side
which seems to be getting a little bit
of a foothold we talked about this
earlier too it's getting market share
just you know it's keats number three ya
gain market share because of course
because black bears lost market share
but also because they're they're getting
better at making stuff and people are
starting to go like hey this is a viable
alternative but so you've got windows
and then you get you got Windows Phone
and Windows those are the real products
yeah and Windows RT is like this sort of
you know it's just like a man without a
country yeah it's basically like who's
the user for that it's a really
specialized user I don't think
developers are flocking to it I don't
think anybody's making hardware for it I
think so if one piece our adrenaline it
was a big but that was the big thrust of
the the start of Windows was the surface
and Windows RT you think about the way
they rolled it out it was first
announced windows on arm at CES yeah it
was literally just windows on a new
processor and they're like this is a big
deal no they made a big deal out they
basically made it sound like in not too
long of a time yeah we're going to be
all arm we're gonna be windows just
gonna be an arm operating system we ran
a lot of stories at the end of like
wintel yeah and what happened was the
arm part was a total failure nobody's
really adopting it nobody seems to like
it hardware makers don't want to make
stuff for it Microsoft uh-uh hardcore
Microsoft users are pissed about it yeah
and he's going to 80x80 the x86 version
and there may
in the x86 version more like traditional
windows yeah you know there I really I
want to go back down this rabbit hole de
beber spelunking down recently but I
really don't understand why the by that
why that surface RT wasn't just like the
Metro tablet oh god you know you know
it's funny it's i really don't i don't
know key event today um you know in sort
of at the end event like everybody kind
of like stands around only chats for a
minute before already disperses and we
like that conversation came up like
you've got windows phone no he put out
the 1020 today which is like a fairly
interesting device because it's insane
camera and it's like they should have
just called all of this metro like down
the line right here's our mobile
operating system its metro or whatever
the name would beam it doesn't have you
metro right could then and they just
completely convinced it i mean they just
if they r you know look Microsoft seems
to be really psyched on Apple strategies
given their me given the reorg today if
they really wanted to do what Apple does
they would have just said this is going
to be our mobile platform this for
tablets and phones and it is going to
have like a bunch of compatibility with
our desktop but our desktop is going to
be something totally different which
would have given them the flexibility to
focus on like an actual like with
Windows Phone you do get the impression
they've been able to focus on making a
better mobile platform they're like hey
there's stuff that was broken in version
one we're going to fix it in the next
version and they did fix it and it's
like now you've got this weird problem
where you have to be fixing something
that's very similar at the same time
that isn't really getting any attention
like you've got to worry about Artie and
x86 for the same platform that isn't the
same platform and you've got to worry
about Windows Phone it's like why not
just have that mobile platform you scale
up yeah we really know about iOS does
right and it works great and two cents
with Android is right there just taking
a phone interface and skinnier is ideal
some chrome literally scales up yeah
well but I'm saying yeah but I'm saying
that the basic idea is that the
underline the core is and that you I and
everything else is all just mobile only
know i think a lot last selling point
was always be like well arm has better
processor but then with Haswell like
that's become like the last thing that
just doesn't matter anymore right with
new chips I mean I mean my macbook air
is any indication though it is a larger
device in but still the battery life is
getting they're not the same as our but
it's getting there right
uh it's yet perplexing man I really wish
I really wish we could have seen what it
would be like had there been this divide
of the mobile of Microsoft mobile what
their line was always no compliment well
yeah but the comp the compromises they
have no they don't have success with
that device right yes the others i don't
want compromise success right resonate
they thought they could differentiate by
sigma compromising right here's a thing
that turns into another thing like that
denied it hasn't worked let me just give
you one Ballmer line here please do we
will plan across the company comma so we
can better deliver compelling integrated
devices and services for the high-value
experiences and core technologies yes
around which we organize high-value
experiences it's just like you could
have I love high-value experience an ad
like this this is a really important
memo that he sent to a lot of people
thought out to the press the millions of
his customers are reading they published
and it reads like he published it yeah
but he sent big liking right right it's
out in the world right and it's like you
should have made this half as long yeah
but easily have maybe even a quarters
it's like one word for everything I like
Ballmer but do you think there's any
chance so you know it's literally it's
like I think they have like 10,000
employees yeah it's like it's important
that yeah a lot Microsoft has a lot more
than 10,000 employees it's like 50 is it
so maybe six ninety thousand plus nine
thousand yeah I don't know where you
Apple has a cap no Apple has over 30
apples who is 10 we have 10 I yes we
have technology we have 10,000 why were
that number it was just in my mind I
mean maybe in 1985 they had okay were
you watching pirates of silicon valley
by any chance no idea where that no I
don't know where came out yeah yeah but
they only have about like eight times
more than that yeah good right look okay
um so what else what else today us than
the Nokia everything else is I think
very in lumia 1020 went by the way like
10 20 it's like it's like it's got a
720p display right yeah yes so it's like
it's weird because all these funds i'll
have 1080 screens and now they have this
they're not they're naming convention is
really bad they need to have names for
phones i think numbers are not the way
to go in my opinion so it's like the 10
lumia and nokia which by the way you
lumia 1020 wat I kind of stumbled over
well that glue BIA Lumias app or some
let me say one thing about this event
let me a click that's what I call I will
say Lumia click it's still present like
letters it sounds it's not expressly not
for lumia my technology photon yeah
everyone kept saying the Nokia zoom
which like not a bad name the Nokia zoom
how about the Lumia zoo listen think
okay so let me start the beginning I
guess I'll leave a room illuminated full
credit to nokia today yeah for putting
on uh maybe the best press event I pin
to in the past like one or two really
why other than WDC WDC was it was like a
shantytown disaster completely okey
event today no um I mean I not just
because I oh uh yeah a little bit better
shorter shorter was less insane not just
cuz there was a coward ethernet like
that's like journalist stuff like i'm
talking like the staging and execution
of their event there are some like
awkward parts and like evolve is kind of
a weird presenter sometime yeah but they
opened with like there was a transparent
screen that we thought was the real
screen and we thought like you up would
be standing like a foot away from us but
that was a projection screen and then he
was behind it and there was an another
screen behind him so there was like
three layers of stuff happening Wow and
it was so cool looking that dan
initially thought that it wasn't real
but he was looking at a 3d display to
correct live blog then was like they've
turned on a 3d display in 3d Elop is
walking around no daddy's right it's
real it's actual it's a lot actual I
that was awesome so they go through
things like there are some weird stuff
when we can talk about the port Dan
they're all wearing yellow diffuse I
trying to catch things it's like Kusabi
I yeah it's like copies like maybe this
is really raining on news yeah the
sparkles they look like sparkle my god
no no that means that's from taylor
swift one in three days you're honest i
don't quote to taylor swift no it's when
I went to the Sony and so anything to
see it sparkles in on us but they're
shooting or 3d cameras we're wearing 3d
glasses too
real work I was working on Taylor Swift
its own you bet you're a hard word
anyhow I should i do all this yeah yeah
yeah and now we're seeing three I'm like
no he's right there he's literally right
the greatest trick eos is crazy yes the
world of people yeah this is uh it is a
lot of showmanship yeah anyway so that
was great and then at the very end of it
the second set of screens open yeah to
reveal the gigantic like hands-on garden
behind were raised and i was like
literally like a journalist right hmm
and like that never happened on that
kind of room so like very well doesn't
it is is it the luby's moment they spent
a lot of money yes they're like this is
it for us but the two things i'm going
to draw in the bag going from it 1b
focus entirely on the camera it was in
it what do you mean to his phone for did
20 minutes yeah like they just didn't
say windows phone or App or software I
think I saw Sascha Segan tweet like does
it connect to the inner does it run
sizes rustic am cares uh which is
amazing like this is a hardware launch
they were they were down to talking
about how when you shake the phone you
can hear the ball bearings and the image
stabilizer move around is that good I
you know I wanting to click when I back
around chat when I drop yeah I don't
like I broke ahead ask it sounds broken
I spent so much money it's broken it's
300 all it was a hard launch yeah oh
yeah they launched the phone one of it
like it was no I saw this oh look they
have a grip I didn't well you compare if
you compared to samsung how samsung
launched this or is this just the
samsung phone camera isn't that just
very much now it's easy it doesn't
actually have that grip that's just an
add-on yeah you better so you put in a
thing it gives you 50 / summer about
everything so if you look if you think
about how samsung long and cs4 why would
i want a phone that's like the size of a
camera cuz it's like like that's why
don't i have a phone so i don't have to
have a camera right it's a 41 megapixel
camera anyway they can't like maybe
can't really do anything to Windows
Phone like Samsung can say like look
we've put all his crops and literally s4
is like look we made this Hardware don't
think we're not too much right so
gigantic screen surrounded by plastic I
you can yeah but you can like look at
all the dumb shit we did with the
software right Nokia's like we can't do
anything the software right we went
all-in I got this
great so these actually 41 megapixels
it's not it's a 41-megapixel am I gonna
do the 40s or 10 megabytes a beat 10
megabytes piece Jesus but they're locked
into the pro camera app so all the other
apps on the phone the camera roll gets
access to 5 megapixel rice like I'll
ensure interpolated like hot like
shareable images that's what icon look
I'm gonna say this is gonna be my
instagrams look amazing so yeah nothing
so slightly every time I instagrams ever
to have Instagram every time no it has
no answer but every time I Instagram a
picture somebody without fails like what
phone is that yep and it's like dude
it's somebody actually pointed us out of
my last one there like s41 iphone it
doesn't matter it's an Instagram like it
is this big and it's got a fencer audit
and it doesn't matter how good the
camera is like that's right really I
constrict yeah exactly Don but like so
it's 41 megapixels yeah they spent a lot
of time talking about zooming you know
which is like a lie because the camera
doesn't actually digitalism but it's
digital Z because it has 41 megapixels
at evening less horrible digital zoom
yeah right yeah but like everything
still looks like super fringy and zoom
zoomy it's not I can't tell you the last
time I used a zoom phone actually I have
used a zoom function the digital zoom
function well you're desperate it's like
here's what they've done they've made
the best digital zoom ever yeah cool
like yeah it's cool it's neat but like I
don't know I don't know you don't want
it I don't think that did I don't think
that most people are like man I really
wish I could take a picture of a factory
and then zoom into seems like i was
saying there's like fry a de i thought
the other day i just told you this in
our front page call uh I thought for a
moment i was like what if I just went
all in on Microsoft like just switch to
a pc yeah you know got like a surface or
whatever and and or whatever laptop I
thought was good and you know got a
windows phone and just moved over
migrated all of my calendars and all my
con and everything out off of Google I
was like you know maybe that would be
cool that could be cool and then I
remembered maps yep and then I just
completely I remember the fact that the
windows phone mail client destroys gmail
email just the whole thing I just like I
started then I started realizing of all
the Reaper cottage the real world
repercussions
and and I decided I can do it but I have
to say it is it is weird to think that
like I'm now trapped essentially by
trapped trapped by Google yeah you know
who yes had that's why this is why it's
so frustrating we shot about this but
they're making all these changes to
their apps and stuff I know I'm
segwaying out of Microsoft that right
but but it is annoying that that when
you're a user of I mean particularly
with Google Apple does the same thing I
mean iOS 7 is great example you're gonna
get at the iOS 7 update you're gonna be
like what's going on yeah like why is it
like this this is not what I bought
write something totally different like
gmail is like they've changed gmail on
the on the phone now and it's like not
as good as the last version and it's
annoying to use in some ways and there's
nothing I can do about it oddly enough i
find the gmail you doing about it better
than the android version right now like
it says we're cut I'm sorry I'm really I
guess you like waiting for things to
load yeah guitar I mean the hands look
nicer user interface it does but it
still is it's not really terrible but
yeah anyhow are what 20 so intense want
to yell it's finished it's not nearly as
thick as you might expect the camera
sticks out a little bit yeah the few
their photos it takes are like they have
the new optical image stabilization that
they introduced me it looks ridiculously
huge it's not humane as big as that no
it's kind of nice looking I don't know
it kind of looks pretty good um there's
you know if they had this running
Android that would be there are two
moments like like really amazing that's
what everyone's been saying nokia yeah
won't you make an android phone I mean
it was really savvy or this blank Pacey
I don't have an exclusivity deal with
with my name is today seemayer basically
question 100 times today um and we were
told that like no he has its earnings
coming out next thursday so they can't
like they were their base like our
people can talk about anything except
yeah i would buy a nokia android phone
you know so so yah was on stage they're
like what he how's it going to Microsoft
and he was like well we knew this would
be a challenge and we think the Android
landscape is really harsh and he said
something really interesting he said we
used to think about Android as a
competitor but now we only think about a
certain hardware manufacturers
competitor mm-hmm he was he obviously
referring to Samson well you can put any
way you or I was like dude if you were
running their same platform like you
would really be competing with that no
that's the thing your gear
you're bound to sell more nokia phones
running the platform that people want
than otherwise right right you know it's
like you get both things working against
you you're fighting an uphill battle
because you have no brand presence and I
hand what they're saying is they want
they want Windows Phone to be a big
success and they want to be the samsung
of Windows Phone that's all 8 well they
probably they probably will do the first
place of third actually Samsung will
probably the Samsung of Windows well no
Samsung's windows phone so I mean I mean
they are the samsung up windows I mean
okie is like congratulations you're the
samsung window shop eat the problem is
your market share is like single digits
right they've got it they've got to
overtake iOS somehow right or the entire
power overtake tuna if you want to elite
who's ever taken iOS like Windows
Windows Phone like in terms of Mark not
saying I'm not saying it could never
like a monthly could happen but like how
about at least let it go how many
handsets how many handsets updation a
lot but I'm saying like have setting a
goal that's less than we want to go from
three to two but we want to go from
really bad 32 Media lasse that's all
you're doing I mean that's basically
what they're doing right I mean I guess
you know they went in for 2 3 next thing
is high 31 from there were only at four
cuz they literally didn't exist before
that right like they did ok I understand
are you arguing for or against the Nokia
android device uh I mean I would if they
ran if they made this camera with it
within Android like on android phone
yeah be incredible what we get what do
you need for windows phone to make this
work or Nokia augmenting windows-powered
dollars go back at this this is it's
like all of us all the ecosystem these
with all the apps that are they don't
have need to be there all the ecosystem
needs be working who was that it's my
way oh she's okay she's cool with you
want me to do anyone was on mute signal
your dad got a lot of phones here makes
its brand new i just got it ya know she
talked about this well let's finish the
1020 that's it I isn't there anything
else talk about such 300 300 only NHL
team three dollars by the way Lions
they're really pushing their luck with
that right and it's only an ATT will
forget about freedom and they don't have
enough costumers there's this moment
where I actually kind of like wanted to
hiss during the press conference yeah
but I was sitting too close to like
loudly his obvious when Ralph D Olivia
came out
we loved working with Nokia on this
project I want to be like what did you
do did you go there did your camera
engineers shop yeah yeah it seems like
the hell DJ a Stephen it's looking good
but we just want to check out this
camera make sure it's on here do you
wanna make sure it's up to AT&amp;amp;T have you
seen our pan text we want to make sure
this is up to eighteen t camera standard
I just everybody's I wanted a
specifically the Q&amp;amp;A there was a was I
think the forest woman had asked about
why are you a good 18t cuz they see doc
so that was the best question like again
best president ever like swell stage
well managed and then the QA Forrester
Research right she was like horse turd
yes was that what it was as for like for
someone anyway oh she goes someone why
the hell are you working with ATT
they've been a terrible partner for you
I tried to buy an Lumia phone and they
didn't know anything about it and I
service sucks yeah and Elop who is one
of the best media exactly like media
training is very very much thought about
it for a second and said the answer
there is an answer that's more about
nokia than eighteen t and he went on to
talk about how like there was a big
opportunity for Windows Phone they had
educated consumer right I was like no
dude the calls drop I did okay question
is like I'm a nine partner in acct where
their network no but I will say I will
say in eel ops defense I've been to a
lot of these press events or trade shows
or whatever where or conferences where
somebody gets up and they've got you've
got like Tim book yeah you know it's
like your question to Tim Cook you could
ask him anything you want you're like
how come my ATT services I've actually
heard people do this at conferences how
come my AT&amp;amp;T service is so bad it's like
you blew it dude I don't care I don't
care how bad your I I don't care if
you're 18 key service like uh sexually
assault you in the night okay there's
you have no easy to ask that question at
that time by the way ATT surface can do
that can and will I'm ashamed to say oh
god clearly
bailey rae be purchased this I didn't
see you like like any of your
opportunity i segreti hit you with the
peanuts it's like don't you know it's
not even his I don't care what your ATT
Jerry slaps you in the face with its
penis terrible George is dying we finish
at sleepys thank you uh anyhow what else
does move what's what about the what
about the audience right the audio it's
great it takes excellent videos yeah
yeah it does all the crazy camera stuff
for the video to you can zoom on the
video yeah it's baby look it's a really
nice camera right it happens to run
Windows Phone mm-hmm it has the weird
grip thing that you can put on to it
that turns it into basically micro four
thirds camera how much does that cost is
it like tech $79 hmm terrible I mean
like look it's fine yeah you've already
spent 300 all that fun like you're it's
more than a Power Shot get a point shoot
for cheaper so that's the thing i
mentioned this in the lifelog it's like
all of the apart from the insane size of
the sensor like not the physical size
for the 41-megapixel almost all of this
technology is like point and shoot level
req technology right it's like they have
optical image stabilization which ad $79
point-and-shoot as they have manual
controls which is that they built a
really nice point shoot camera and they
put Windows Phone on it right and
because they can't put a real lens
assembly in it they like they did this
thing where they built a crazy
41-megapixel sensor which is cool
there's a new there's something I have
to say I there's something unappealing
to me about this combination and i'm not
sure why but i think what's really
striking is what Apple was able to do
with the iphone 5 with its camera which
to me is just far and away which is the
best phone camera i don't know why it
just is really really good look
legitimately dis cameras better no no
i'm sure it is just i'm sure it is going
order i no no this is what i was getting
at i'm sure it is but in order to do
that they had to graft another device
onto the back of a phone and I feel like
the phone should be a thing unto itself
in the sense that if you can't like I
don't want to phone that's half camera
because you don't couldn't figure out
how to make a better small sensor that
could do something
they could make and create incredible
photos but to be awesome and I think
that but they did do something new right
i mean like this what samsung did they
did a second generation of this
technology which it's also samson just
did this they made a camera thanks also
look if you look at the galaxy camera
which when you put this thing into its
battery grip you should you can compare
them one for one right like they look
the single this is obviously better but
if you write kind of as a camera is
wildly different right the galaxy camera
is like a regular camera it has like a
movable lens you can it has optical zoom
right it's a point-and-shoot camera that
runs android right this is like a
android cell phone or up kinda wish list
it's a windows phone like a cell phone
but it has this insane camera that can
approximate what a point you can do it
like that because it doesn't have a lens
assembly like that it wasn't me it's
different 11 it doesn't let you do but
it is as soon as a it has a it is not
just like a cell phone camera is that
protrusion really annoying though live
in my cruiser exact it's like it seem
that bad it's a little it's like a disc
sitting on its not bring one back for us
yeah I try and try to run the yellow
ones really beautiful yeah I'm pretty
into the yellow one one of the colors on
the word yellow like a fight and just
wipe lock and yellow yellow black white
I thought that the black look kind of
things your graph ID color its like it
has like a gray it's like a dark grey oh
yeah it's good I mean look it's real
cool the ant if you love Windows Phone
you tried but that's the problem like
that's the answer if you love Windows
Phone you should buy this phone yeah
right I don't you don't and if you're
committed to any other operating system
like it's still not but not there still
is on an appalling you don't think it's
compelling enough like that versus the
iphone 5 you're not gonna go like if you
have an iphone 5 and you love it you're
not going to be like Windows Phone is so
is so on are rife on five experience
right right that this additional
hardware is worth the switching costs
right and that's look I basically asked
even you off that question like 10 times
in a row for 10 minutes and he had a
variety of different stock answers but
that is his company's Vegas channel yeah
to be honest I did yeah if there was an
ipod touch of rain of this like it's not
cellular up i would pay couple hunter
like it's a nicer point shoot its slim
like i can tether and get the stuff up
there you want like I actually think a
smart camera is nice
I would defend that but I don't put on a
contract like have to pay that monthly
300 ollar station tea service what is it
off contract 700 yeah sure let's do it
yes I mean I mean that's the price of
the galaxy s4 on go and there's no
Instagram so like right hmm which we ran
and I've no vine is there right there
will be lying yes soon no no no uh
something else that's missing so we just
ran this like wildly reviled piece about
Instagram and like the future of like
photo editing is pacifically with iPhoto
yeah in like I'm watching how i see the
people in my life use photos now yeah
and we ran a piece from James biram
about it which is the reason Instagram
is powerful is because lets you take the
photo share it and look at other
people's photos like all in one
interface hmm and that's like that's
what the people yeah I just don't get
the impression that people are editing I
movies anymore like I feel like it's
like if you have kids and you are taking
videos of them or whatever you're not
putting together elaborate edited things
you're doing like quick hits of what's
going on ian is pop in real time you
know the line is wild that you're doing
or you're doing like I shot two minutes
of my kid doing something and then I
uploaded it to youtube and put it on
Facebook or I uploaded it straight to
Facebook right you know um and and I
just don't even know how all the other
thing makes sense like you're gonna sit
people down to watch the movie like the
grandparent the grandparents that those
tools have a place right yeah what I'm
saying is they built a really awesome
camera yeah without the key tool right
there still lacking the key to it that
is making smartphones more pasta Graham
will happen eventually within I'm sure
within six months what's so Instagram is
very go there like we don't we really
don't know when it's coming up well
there are other ways to share photos I
mean that's it's not the only way to
share there's a weird and Twitter you
can share just on Twitter you can share
on Facebook you can share on you could
do you know on YouTube right well now
you can do all these men join group
dotty at one point you know they're like
and we have a great new app called oggle
and you can share directly to oggle yes
dude what like what needs occupy they're
like you can divide clone integration is
built in and everyone's like Michael
what is it really what are you talking
with iCloud I don't
ha die die die colonies all go away
volvo for android I'll go the new
hipster Graham hipstamatic hipstamatic
automatically i'll share to both ogle
and Instagram that was a big amount sold
their daughter shared instagram you can
use hipstamatic to share toggle and
Instagram on windows phone yes so so
hipstamatic shares to Instagram yeah oh
well there you go I don't but I don't
think you can do that I don't even see
instagrams an abstract but doesn't like
you should be able to they have a web
interface genki but i guess there's
something you can do yeah whatever made
you can shred oggle all right moving on
yeah maybe move on talk about your phone
yes oh so speaking of Clive's and
speaking of colors so I've been going
back and forth i have the review units
of the UM and I this is my galaxy s4
yeah I've been torn I've been using a
one and then and then the stock versions
came out and I've been for the past two
weeks have been torn going literally
going back and forth right every day
like swapping my sim and trying to
decide so I now I think I've reached a
point where i'm saying i think i think
what is my clone hey you're looking I
think that I think that I'm going to get
the s4 for like real your brother phone
I hear the things that happen I was like
okay a few days ago a few days ago i had
i was using as far and i was like screw
this i'm getting the one and I went I
went back to the one I was like I just
want to check it out before I place my
order I was using it and it really
started to bother me like that the
screen seems smaller and that it didn't
have a home button and that had that
menu bar yeah and there were just things
that started bugging me about it that I
had not noticed before using the s4 the
only at this point I think the screens
are sort of negligible wrong absolutely
wrong the screen on the other number is
a piece of drugs the more I don't think
it's a pieces I got us wasn't it i think
the one having one of it allege the one
does have a little a degree wedge that
screen is bad every state every time you
scroll text on that screen like it's
like I have a notice I have a notion of
bad you have extreme sensitivity to this
kind of screen sensitive screen
I think I think that the one has an edge
it is it does have it is less saturated
and and we're samsung we make the
displays and we pick the shittiest ones
that we make any how to put in our
biggest margin so so they're always
little but i think that here's what it
comes down to this is what's what's
troubling me this moment is i think that
the one has better low-light photography
capabilities but i think that its
general photography when put side by
side with this late on us on a bright
day or in well-lit scenes i actually
think this is a superior camera so i'm
torn this has a night mode but the night
mode is like kind of not that good but
it is passable questions so far so the
cat so is increasing I take a lot of
night photos yeah yeah yeah well late I
find out the evidence of your life yeah
a social platform yeah but i also think
de fotos took one the other day yeah
yeah it's good job thanks guy I'm lucky
notice on Instagram look hell I mean I'm
just saying I don't I take pictures for
myself not find my phone is a social
video platform that lets you co-create
sink and edit multiple views of a shared
moment finally Louis a frog I take most
people's I take I don't share an
Instagram or anywhere else you
understand what I'm saying like they're
they're just photos of things that I'm
taking right so I just want them to look
okay so so anyhow but I think I've
decided to buy the s4 and and the main I
think the main motivator is is this
that's that's it is his I buttons I
think this is the main motivator no cuz
the phones are basically both really
good the screens bad the phones are
basically both excellent phones in my
opinion right okay honestly like it side
by side they're both really good phones
but I first if I really like this little
like foldy back thing that they make for
it you can replace the backs on it and i
have found several insane like
chinese-made backs for the s4 here's one
of them I told you not to show the
listing because I don't want anybody
else to find any heard you at that point
Evan don't show the listing this is one
back that I georgeous Jordan don't show
the listing it's too late yeah you've
exposed me um show the other one which i
think is really dope do we have it we
don't have it no I don't have it okay
fine well I sent another one anyhow so I
I please sign it when I've been looking
for all these insane backs i ordered a
green one which i cracked
yeah flexing it which isn't a I posted a
picture of it on Instagram yeah I did
post that on Instagram uh and then the i
order these in a fake leather back one
and some other stuff for the view one so
here's the thing i think the view one
this is one of the most annoying things
about this case is that cover the cover
covers the camera when you have it fold
it back I'm like we're gonna get a
picture of that wait a second it's like
who does I that but I know that Samsung
makes one with up with that they may
have one that has like a little window
is that the longer covers the little
window show that only comes in black no
I think it comes to colors know that I
had an orange one you know an intern
went and got me an orange one and then I
was like that's the wrong one and he
returned it yeah they make oh there it
is that's the other case that I got
which I think it looks amazing it's not
a case I'm sorry these are the backs so
it's like a 100-percent part of the
phone when you put it on which because i
hate cases but so but is it is a texture
it's not it's not slimy then like its
slimy that was this one is less slimy
itzel it's no no this one's way less
slimy also color where does s for us now
yeah which is like it's really tense so
anyhow the long and short of it is the
cameras have there's pros and cons hold
on let me finish there's pros and cons
on bogies there's pros and cons on both
cameras okay what does actually know
about instance I know what the third
party instagram app it's still not the
instagram app like oh my god this
windows photo let me do not let them get
to you this witness what are you today
some weird or SATA version of every app
you could possibly want yeah is like
that's yeah it's like it's like instant
chat like it's like no I know I know it
is called what it's called instance it's
not what people yeah it's called ransom
it's Allison one people one Instagram
anyhow but getting back to my phone play
what it boils down to is this both of
these phones are great phones in my
opinion but they both run these exact
same version of stock Android which is
great they have there are pros and cons
right like the pros on that is like the
hardware is way nicer than the s4 last
by leaps I actually made a list of pros
and cons I know the hardware is way
nicer the sound is better the screen has
an extreme the screen is so much fun the
screen is so much better yeah uh the
camera does are stupid the camera does
great low-light yep the kind I by no
grain is resting and then you get the
cons which is like the buttons are
poorly place the not having a home
button is is I mean not have
third button is really stupid was there
that the actual power button location
like the more I it sets for more I had
at what's happened I think that's I
thought I'd know I know but I'm saying
the more successful so the other things
are like like you can't replace the
battery and these phones are they're not
like yeah the greatest with battery life
it's a kind of cool to be able to swap
at the battery and I like the fact you
can change the backs the cons on this
one are really that the low life
photography is that good in the screen
is nothing you look it's okay I think
it's actually pretty good screen when
you compared to old compared to the old
Sarah all that but just it's very simple
when you have a flagship smartphone in
your hand the lead product from company
and you scroll the text and it's blurry
I don't that's bad I honestly don't yes
I was I honey I'm gonna challenge you a
little bit on that and just say I have
never noticed text being blurry when
scrolling it just also when it's
scrolling what does it matter what it
look like it's bad it just looks bad
I've not had that experience LMAO like i
will say that i will say this both these
phones both stock versus these phones
are very bad at regulating their
brightness very bad yes both require a
third party at this app lock switch i
talked about in the last verge cast to
properly regulate the brightness of
these screens i will say this screen is
really annoying when you don't have the
brightness tweaked because its way down
right and it's like it looks even worse
that one is too bright yeah my twins
yeah you need to get lots but the fact
is so anyhow I think I've made my
decision and and I'm a little bit I'm
for a little bit scared that I'm gonna
regret as soon as I place the order and
again look you like customized back
through and what about stream yeah no I
know when I showed you when I showed him
the orange case he was like oh god if I
made the wrong decision not in literally
like now you feel like you've made the
right I got this and I opened a box
yesterday and I was like oh shit about
this one yeah and then what do you think
like here's what I thank you but devices
these two devices aside yeah my
experience with Android going from a
nexus 4 to this device and just one day
it's been like they run the same
software yeah right but on that the
nexus 4 feels really heavy to me in like
dark wide it's why no but like just
running android on it this Arlie feels
like super techy for some reason okay
like it's like it's a good
re like it just feels heavy and on this
phone it's like it's with the phones
faster yeah and everything feels like
lighter and more area it's a really
weird visit i think it's it's all the
hard work this offer is exactly the same
yeah and that's like that's been a
revelation here's my but you're just one
question do I done to you why not wait
for the Moto X just to see what it is
III don't know everything okay first
everything I've heard about the Moto X
leads me to believe that it is not going
to be it's going to be kind of a
mid-range device mm-hmm well that means
it's gonna have a 720p display yeah yeah
and I'm certainly not going down to a
720p and it has if it has a bad camera
than like a good point butter to your
eyes no it matters this is not I really
think you're really think you're you're
I think partying on a pixel layout that
I've been harshing on for like three
years I do not think this green-eyed
really do not think the screen is that
bad give me give me your phone Lily open
I want to see map side by side am I the
only one who actually has some hope for
the Moto X here uh sounds like it damn
I'll wait whatever no you have yo you
have the new maps Oh Babs new maps no I
have the old man yeah I'll maps I really
want the new match uh I don't think
that'd be a good idea hold on so let's
just see here I don't think it's this
it's it you can say I kinda same zooming
in your screens brighter of course it
looks better he might hungry and wide
your screen so doctor looked at
notifications it's on auto price sending
it to know he's not sending it to hear
what will make your hair will go to
riveting television on the burger this
is the audience a merge app current both
dice narration actually he's now open
the virgin still bread I love the
narration scroll just scroll the time
let me get your screen to an equivalent
brightness he is looking at porn on
eli's phone your screens blue or I can
see that our it's greener that's the
porn yeah different I just goes very
blue it's become pensioned okay hold on
a second um try just trying to get this
is I don't have locks in a headlock
somebody I know okay can we heart i'm
gonna scroll scroll now just watch look
at the text just like shatter and move
it's weird just trust me this is
thrilling in person I'm telling it's not
yeah I mean I guess that's just
something i'm looking at i see i can't
unsee it i'm telling ya I don't know it
just doesn't that just doesn't bother me
at all it's fine look we all have that
is
just not do anything yeah i mean i can't
i can't deal like i have my eyes like ah
gross stop it but it's the motion on
screen is bad and these enemies now
about running through the panel Joshua
this is that yeah for years it's been
like re this is a good processor like to
scroll through the apps will passed
everything is the Brazos okay yes you
gather there's lots of folks I'll take
the other the other the other the other
things and I remembered that I now I you
know and I said I complained about this
I've complained about it for a while I
wanted a phone with it I didn't like it
on the one and now I'm so reminded of
how incredible it is I'm how incredible
it is ok that the colored the RGB LED on
this when you use it with light flow no
it is incredible to I can glance at my
phone and I know like I've got some
tweets I've got an email from this
account from that account I've got a
text message and not have to know all of
that just by glancing at a little light
on the phone it's kind of incredible ok
anyhow so so I think at the end of the
day Z the piers the third week in a row
where we've talked about these two yeah
it's depressing anyhow so I'm buying the
s4 and I'll have to suffer the
consequences what's most annoying is I
have to set up another phone I'm gonna
like this I just had I've set up these
two yeah now I have to wipe them and go
set up another moment I guess that's it
there are you happy everyone and of
course now Jim Dalrymple will write a
scathing a scathing posed on his on his
apple fanboy site about how I'm on the
take from Samsung as i said i'm going to
buy one of their phones so get ready
everybody get ready trolls yeah to
unleash your fury god i have that sense
of money tastes good i I'm gonna spend
samsung money to buy the Sam Sam chatter
it tastes like Magna Carta Holy it
tastes like that's where I'm going I
should know is that we're just going to
jay-z thing it's anyway uh cuz yeah
that's samsung money right there yeah so
uh I you know I was just like you had
the best transition I did I'm trying to
figure out what part of this disaster to
go into let's start from the beginning
just start so Samsung I'm just checking
my so Sam seats were to release his new
record hmm right they're gonna give it
away with an app to all these samsung
phones one of them yes a million of them
guaranteed to go platinum right away for
billboard or no for
by just a really good Lumia name to me
Lumia focus oh that's good yeah eel up
thank you laughing that's uh Marciano
yeah added at marcy plan that's where
the royalties go yeah right such way
that guy go on jay-z app uh the thing
leaks anyway the record leaks anyway the
app is kind of a weird disaster it
doesn't work on the baby ruben crashes a
lot it asks for all kinds of insane
permissions from you right apparently
are apparently our chap does as well
which young and I look into into that I
don't know if that's aI don't know why
that is I think that's probably some
sort of weird it might be like laziness
or not we're certainly not collecting
we're certainly not collecting
information and then the worst part is
to unlock the lyrics you have to tweet
like I just look read these lyrics from
this app right and so people like
there's like lots of you know once one
person getting cozy like said he
literally said this is not cool like
yeah this has been today is a lot of
things yeah he said it wasn't cool and
that but he actually was kind of is
interesting what he said which was I
I've gotta like you know I we tried
something it didn't work perfectly and
the next guy will get it but I mean this
line from jay-z is really insane it was
20 million hits for the app and it broke
no one is expecting it there's no way in
the world for you to calculate 20
million age yeah it's not even a number
you can fathom you do not prepare for a
service quite a million you master 20
million of anything at all are you rep
oh cuz he's going to rap genius calm I
wanna look up his lyric just too oh yeah
it goes it's not right genius song
meanings work to this is what it is
there's a specific lyric why rap genius
are failing me Oh rap genius song what
song looks like rap genius in the hot
startup we all thought it was one of his
lyrics and I will say this this record
is like it's not it's ok boys lyrics is
like 1 million two million three million
20 million I'm so good at math but
America notice though no really yes Oh
can't fathom that I don't know how ok
anyhow like this is much better team oh
yeah and the thing I was doing right
1 million two million three million 20
line oh I'm so good at math my crashing
internet and I even enjoy when I worry
about you want with your picture snapped
wait it's great oh ho ho you're telling
me that that that James I'm an American
so what Zach no spaces ends with him
saying twerk Miley Miley twerk which is
an amazing way to end so he he says 1
million two million three million 20
million oh I'm so good at math might
crash the internet and I ain't even into
that might crash the internet cannot
prepare for a service dude senior Swabia
they might have just been quoted himself
cannot prepare for us yeah when I was
writing the lyrics you say my intended
to get cheated so he did for her yeah
it's like oh by the way we get a 20
million when I crash the internet so
maybe make sure that doesn't happen to
the app because he's not I repeat not
into them not into that not into the non
she's gonna do today did you listen to
the record yeah I haven't listened to it
yet it's okay I actually really don't
like jay-z at all so I've never cared I
think it's safe to say that um jay-z and
Kanye West should always work together
yeah con you should make for the music
and write the lyrics yeah like it's very
own message and i will say that like I
uses has become now that I've learned
more of the lyrics of ease like the
first time the first few listens I
wasn't really listening I said this on
one of the on the Virgin's I said it
it's musically in a lyrical a bankrupt
and and the more you listen to it the
less invent of the music sounds because
once you hear the musically oh I've
heard it now and then you know it's like
you it's not surprising then you start
to really focus on the lyric yeah and it
is like punishingly stupid yes like
alike like I'm I don't know if he's
trolling everybody really i have magical
thing where he was like the whole point
of this record is a Kanye doesn't care
what his lyrics mean yeah I don't know
if I read that but I read some other
stuff that was really great about about
um just like critiques of the lyrical
content now it is like it is like it is
just so weird to me how stupid it sounds
just dumb so I was like a dumb guy got
kinda like I don't think he's a dumb guy
no no he's not so that's why I'm trying
to figure out if it's some sort of
elaborate role so kind of
I just I think yes I just lets already
talked Jesus I think like I'm a
beginning well it's like we ever saw go
ahead so no i just i just read when I
Christ loves me more mo meta blues oh
yeah really good highly recognizable uh
he has an extended passage on Kanye
West's in like new client stomach come
when he came out on the scene it kind of
left and center and thing like that I me
request was talking about he loves so
much was like unlike other rappers Kanye
knows he's materialistic and he just
wants to flaunt and he look at that like
will you listen the earlier lyrics which
were clever like it was embracing it now
he's like the keys ghazal efficiencies
record is literally about him buying
fine art oh I was it possible thing it's
literally him being like he did it's
were found a buyer Rothko yeah there's
like a Basquiat in my in my kitchen my
child like lean on it he rhymes he
rhymes like it's like ridiculous but
maybe I subset it to me that is really
obsession rhymes it thinking he's still
street Kanye is like I'm just buying no
Jay Z's like bored but he's like I'm
gonna rap about how incredibly rich I
yeah how good I am but what else is what
else is going on for him yeah just being
rich I'd rather take honey being like I
you trying to be like shocking about
race relations like no that's good i'm
glad the shocking is about race stuff is
amazing it's the stuff that's around it
it's like one line really great point
about race relations in America and it's
Donette for the next line everyone about
people dying about your hanging rich
women in the Hamptons and it's like we
all both of those people know are you
all both both on oh I'm 100 I'm
100-percent Hamptons Kanye get so close
every time the one that killed me the
most why are we talking about yeezus we
always we always have I use this look no
one could have predicted we are we in 10
years of the verge cast you can't put
hair in five and I what else we have our
Apple we have a lot apples yes what oh
my god dude oh my god I think to make
things without okay Apple ebook yes yes
right yeah I believe somehow book prefix
for poor so poor poor Apple the day the
app store turned 50 right which is a big
deal right yeah what about happy
birthday distri change
Casey wrote it was Casey right yeah he
wrote a great piece about the Apple the
App Store training 5 and r and apple
basically changing the world yeah I will
say this like the iphone changed the
world I don't care who you are I don't
care where you're from uh it changed the
world in a lot of ways and and and I
think that it's almost like you forget
that but most people don't even know it
doesn't mind most people who have an
iphone you forget that this apps were a
thing that had to happen yeah and and
also we almost didn't write Steve Jobs
yeah like really resistant he didn't to
do it and you have to say like you gotta
say that the homebrew community really
drove this yeah i mean the jailbreakers
you know and I they don't get the credit
and I feel like they really deserve it I
think that the jailbreaking community
drove Apple to do this in a lot of ways
I boss I think it's always possible but
I mean I think they also realized that
if they didn't do it somebody else was
going to write you know and that it
would become increasingly easy which it
had it had become increasingly easy to
just jailbreak I mean I remember there
was like Ashton Kutcher was uh yeah was
like tweeting about jailbreaking his I
Allen's yeah although that was that was
what I was like a challenging his near
his nerd cred has it having become an
advisor to vox media now believe he has
heard correct and Eddie how that
sponsorship uh but uh no I don't he
still hasn't built a pc which i'm
waiting for all i'm gonna maybe it's
just some point the future have an
opportunity to talk to him about that
doubling his own pc that's the challenge
ask him Eric Cooper know what was it he
was gonna build a time machine yeah
that's what you go back in time and kill
say later yeah that's what it was that's
what I should I did build a time machine
and then go back in time to kill Hitler
yeah to prove that he's got nerd cred
well he did now he has started his steve
jobs in a movie yes 0 which comes out
next month yeah I know he has a computer
in two and a half men he definitely has
what I've seen images of him Gary Gary
to riding gear anyhow the point is what
are we talking about to an F men no
before that oh the app store Jesus does
he listen the users into it happen the
bombs what does he think a blood on the
leaves the point and racial injustice a
mom dad by the way another another
jay-z work I don't pop Molly I rock Tom
Ford Tom Ford like that lyric I don't
understand it means he doesn't get high
an ecstasy gets high on fashion oh
that's where his money because he can
spend he cannot wear tuxedos but well oh
just collapsed oh man if I yeah the
point was that Ashton Kutcher was
tweeting that he's jailbreaking his
iPhone because this is pre app story you
know yeah and i think was pre app store
and uh any other point is that i think
that those guys really drove a lot of
this what it was it was a revolution was
like any other Apple revolution because
the idea was there right you can do apps
on the palm if you have some windows
mobile you can in you could they crank
it crash you perhaps on the blackberry
dislike FM is great frameworks like look
you're not gonna do everything in system
but you have this app do whatever you
want self-contained like yeah and they
made the store Mikey was the store right
the distribution and the payment the did
you know the the centralized like
experience of the store how you doing of
it I'm just reading some tweets yeah
trees and trees don't uh I don't know
shiny way so me said that to me I does
apple have more than 30,000 employees so
may just that they have 80,000 it's not
right that sounds insane let's see
Google away Ross it could be right there
last fun Ross is very useful on this one
here is 30 a song lyric I like to think
I want to be I want a ton interruption
oh I look up to I want to come correct I
just don't want to be wrong on that yeah
I definitely and 30,000 at one point at
the same day they celebrate of the app
store they got handed a brutal verdict
in our ebook price-fixing case yeah
which to be honest I have no idea what I
again you know Apple likes to fight out
its lawsuits which right they obviously
won the lawsuit against Samsung in a
major way yeah well not really the
price-fixing I actually feel that in
some ways won the lawsuit they won the
lawsuit whatever but they lost a very
some weird part of the mindshare that I
think has led to Samsung's like right
dominance current dominance whatever
they want the lawsuit I'm not there of
course not their revenue dominance but
anyhow go all the publishers have
settled this lawsuit so the United
States Department of Justice says this
is antitrust you all colluded to to
bring down amazon and to raise the
overall prices and there is their
settlement is that like
used in the chin the case I I mean I was
either the fight you can't you can't
allow that right yeah did he admit guilt
when they did settle or no I think part
of the settlement was that they're like
we're not guilty right when he said
alike seems it and what so apple doesn't
settle they fight it out they put their
executives on the stand their executives
get beaten up by the Department of
Justice to turn on literally yeah
intellectualizing intellectually is the
judge in her opinion says you know Eddy
Cue is on the stand he was saying these
things I did not find him credible like
well it's at that level of like they
didn't do so well trial right and the
enormous body of evidence is that the
publishers were so scared of Amazon in
amazon's power over the market that when
Apple showed up they saw the opportunity
to make them all collude to enter the
market with ibooks but the correct so
apples goal they explicitly said we
don't want the iBookstore to compete
with Amazon on price we don't want to be
in that game we want to compete with
Amazon iPad to Kindle so the books are
the same the price of the same and then
we think people will pick the iPad they
don't want to get in the price right
what's that the collusion was just
changing a model wasn't saying really
was it wasn't like religion things to
people focused on in this case or what
kind of like the red herrings like it's
not the agency model right it's not the
final prices it's literally the Apple
saw the opportunity to not compete on
price they saw the publishers wanted
higher prices and they organized a
conspiracy to block amazon from
competing against Amon price and to
raise the overall price of ebooks from
nine ninety nine to twelve and fourteen
basically Beyonce like we're all going
to do together don't worry yes and they
were instrumental and they kept on
sending emails to publishers saying
things like this is your only shot to do
this were the only people with the power
to do this against gray right and the
judge is like this is overwhelming that
they had they had the knowledge they
were going to do something illegal and
they did it and she that she there's a
big section opinion about Steve Jobs
where she's like here are some emails
from steve jobs like other executives or
he lays it out and he's like we're going
to push the price is higher or you can
go in with amazon and see how that goes
and then there's a video of steve jobs
talking to walt mossberg at the ipad
launch where he's like the prices are
going to go up trust me right and like
she but she's like pointing this
here's your nvidia which is like I don't
know like people have been asked john
gruber at wwc asked me like straight up
he's like what's going on at the ebooks
case it seems like you know at Amazon
was the big power and apple just enter
the market and it's like yeah but they
did it it's literally they were so
scared the publishers are so scared they
were convinced to do illegal things to
compete with Amazon right it was right
but that doesn't that doesn't change it
doesn't excuse you it isn't you imeem
but but at the end of the day somebody
tweeted something where it was I saw
somebody retweet something where I was
like it was like the worst conspiracy
ever because they didn't they didn't
even write about it do yeah but they
didn't but there's their success has
been extremely limited yes Apple success
has been limited but the publishers got
exactly what they wanted right they got
the agency model and price of books well
that is that all blown apart now or what
we'll see yeah I got a lot of appealing
left to do I actually on interesting
sidenote not sort of related not not
totally related but I was surprised to
learn that my cousin has two sons and
one of them had a birthday was a
surprise to learn I'm telling starting a
story uh one of them I think just turned
seven it's two boys like it's like 11
and seven or something I found on other
ages exactly anyhow he bought them both
whose one's birthday and he bought them
both kindle fires and i was actually
really surprised that I mean I guess
it's just weird to think about he's just
like it you know he's a lawyer he lives
in pittsburgh i'm using it late there
like a very you know normal fan lovely
family um but uh i guess it's just weird
to think about like what a kid would do
with the kindle fire what I mean I just
I don't know it just seems strange to me
me books no I know read books watch TV
yeah use apps I suppose horn I just
think it's interesting over the kids
like I said this at seven and eleven
maybe or eight and eleven or something
Paul they're just little compute they
bought their kids a computer yeah just
interesting to me I guess that's what
people are doing and a really cheap
computer yeah I know I get that it just
struck me as very interesting what
should I buy through and said I don't
know I just I guess I expected if you're
gonna buy somebody a tablet you get in
you get an ipad
yeah but they're very expensive it i was
thinking like yeah they're really
amazing the minions of i presuming to
buy for two kids yeah 350 80,000 plays
travel eighty thousand fifty thousand
two hundred fifty eighty thousand yeah
okay he doesn't worldwide wait a
thousand in the US okay so that's like
actually grown a lot as last time that's
grown a lot since the last time i looked
at their wikipedia entry which was not
that long ago five thousand created
since 2012 21 thousand US jobs added
since 2008 okay so they've been growing
at a pretty crazy like a really rapid
yeah yeah Wow okay that's I'd stand
totally corrected I high for some reason
I thought the number was 30 I don't know
where that number came from just like
you don't know where your 10,000 every
provider number let's just get I'd you
say that I was no I was less off the
deal i was i was myself at Apple the
deal i was about uh ten thousand in 2002
at eleven years ago that's my Microsoft
or Apple Apple house music otter all
right anyhow what else we have on the on
the list is that it that's about else
